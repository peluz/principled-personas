"Ah, a classic house flipping scenario!  To determine Josh's profit, we need to calculate the total value increase and subtract his total investment.

The house's value increased by 150% of its original price, which is $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.

Adding this increase to the original price gives us a post-renovation value of $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Factoring in his $50,000 in repairs, his total investment was $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

Therefore, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Ah, a classic problem involving fractions and working backwards! Let's break it down.

We know Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.  Before selling to the orange house, she must have had double that amount plus 2, since she sold half her remaining stock there. That means she had (5 * 2) + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.

Now, before selling to the red house, she had 2 more than that, meaning she had 12 + 2 = 14 vacuum cleaners.

Finally, to find the original amount, we need to remember she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means the 14 she had represents two-thirds of her starting amount.  

To find the whole, we divide: 14 / (2/3) = 21.

Simplifying the equation:

* 2s + 30 = 110
* 2s = 80

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much money John made from selling his Lego sets. He sold 13 sets at $15 each, so he earned 13 * $15 = $195.

Next, we know he spent $160 on video games because he bought 8 games at $20 each (8 * $20 = $160).

Since he had $5 left over, that means he had $160 + $5 = $165 before buying the video games.

This tells us he sold enough Lego sets to make $165. To find out how many sets that was, we divide his total earnings before buying games by the price per set: $165 / $15/set = 11 sets.

Finally, since he started with 13 sets and sold 11, he has 13 - 11 = 2 Lego sets left.

He covers 60 miles in a week, spread across three running days. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half that time, meaning 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours per day.

This gives him a total of 1.5 hours/day * 2 days = 3 hours of running on the shorter days.

Adding that to his first day's run, his total weekly running time is 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

Finally, his speed is calculated by dividing his total distance by his total time: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

From the given information, we can determine:

* r = 2 * s = 2 * 3 mph = 6 mph
* w = r / 4 = 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph

Now, let's consider the time spent on each activity:

* Running time: (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours
* Walking time: (2/3) * 6 hours = 4 hours

Finally, calculate the distances:

* Distance running: r * running time = 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles

"This problem can be elegantly solved using a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of games won as 'w' and the number of games lost as 'l'. We are given two key pieces of information:

1. **Total Games:** The team played a total of 22 games, which can be represented as the equation w + l = 22.

2. **Wins and Losses:** The team won 8 more games than they lost, expressed as w = l + 8.

Now we have a system of two equations:

* w + l = 22
* w = l + 8

We can solve for 'w' (the number of games won) using substitution. Since we already have 'w' isolated in the second equation, we can substitute (l + 8) for 'w' in the first equation:

(l + 8) + l = 22

Combining like terms, we get:

2l + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

2l = 14

Dividing both sides by 2:

l = 7

Now that we know l = 7, we can substitute this value back into either of the original equations to solve for 'w'. Let's use w = l + 8:

w = 7 + 8

Therefore:

w = 15

* **4x4 boards:** $16 * 1.50 = $24 per board

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling all the boards:

* **2x4 board revenue:** 10 boards * $15/board = $150
* **4x4 board revenue:** 5 boards * $24/board = $120
* **Total revenue:** $150 + $120 = $270

Next, we need to find Sasha's total original cost:

* **Total cost:** $100 (2x4s) + $80 (4x4s) = $180

Finally, we can calculate her profit:

* **Profit:** $270 (revenue) - $180 (cost) = $90

"Ah, a classic ratio problem!  

Since the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we know that for every 20 parts (7 + 13) of the mixture, 7 parts are sugar.  If Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, each ""part"" of the ratio represents 120 / 20 = 6 units.

Therefore, Katy used 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to figure out how many vehicles arrived then.  We know 30 vehicles were at the port in total, and 2 containers with 5 vehicles each were there on the first day, meaning 10 vehicles were already present.  

Subtracting those initial vehicles leaves us with 20 vehicles from the second day. Since each container holds 5 vehicles, we divide the 20 vehicles by 5 vehicles per container.

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

"Let's break this down. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and this represented a 30% increase over Lylah's salary.  This means Lylah was making $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 four years ago.

Fast forward four years, and Adrien's salary has grown by 40%. His current salary is $40,000 + (0.40 * $40,000) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased over those four years. Assuming a simultaneous increase, her current salary is $30,769.23 + (0.30 * $30,769.23) = $40,000.

Adding their current salaries together, we find that Adrien and Lylah are now earning a combined total of $56,000 + $40,000 = $96,000.

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

* Let  'w' represent the cost of a watermelon.

* Let 'o' represent the cost of an orange.

We're given the following information:

*  w = 3p  (A watermelon costs three times the price of a pepper)
*  o = w - 5 (An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon)

We also know Dillon buys:

* 4 watermelons

Finally, let's calculate the total cost:

* Total watermelon cost: 4 * $45 = $180
* Total pepper cost: 20 * $15 = $300

2.  *b = 2q* (Twice as many babies as queens)
3.  *w = 2b* (Twice as many workers as babies)

Now, we can use substitution to solve for 'w'. Since we want to find the number of worker bees, let's substitute the expressions for 'b' and 'w' from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

"Let's break this down.  

First, we need to find the total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000.

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, so we calculate 50% of $1000: $1000 * 0.50 = $500.

Adding that extra amount to her minimum payment gives us her total monthly payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500.

Finally, to find her yearly payment, we multiply her monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18000.

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

* Let  'x' represent the number of gallons of lemonade they made.
* Let 'y' represent the total cost of lemons.

We know the following:

* **Cost Equation:** y = 3x (The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon)
* **Revenue Equation:** 20x * $0.50 = 10x (They earn $10 per gallon)
* **Profit Equation:** 10x - y = 25 (Profit is revenue minus cost, and they made $25 profit)

Now we can solve for 'y' (the cost of lemons):

1. **Substitute** the cost equation (y = 3x) into the profit equation: 10x - 3x = 25
2. **Simplify** the equation: 7x = 25
3. **Solve for x:** x = 25 / 7 
4. **Substitute** the value of x back into the cost equation: y = 3 * (25/7)
5. **Calculate y:** y = 75/7 = $10.71 (approximately)

"Let's break down Zaid's expenses.  

First, we need to figure out how much he spends on rent and fuel:

* **Rent:** (1/4) * $6000 = $1500
* **Fuel:** (1/3) * $6000 = $2000

That's a total of $1500 + $2000 = $3500.

He has $6000 - $3500 = $2500 left.

He donates half of that, which is $2500 / 2 = $1250.

Now, let's add up all his expenses: $3500 (rent and fuel) + $1250 (donation) + $200 (daughter) + $700 (wife) = $5650

Finally, subtract his total expenses from his salary: $6000 - $5650 = $350

"Let's break this problem down using variables:

* Let 'B' represent the number of crabs Bo has.
* Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has B - 4 crabs.
* Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has (B - 4) + 10 = B + 6 crabs.

We know Bo has 40 crabs (B = 40).  

Therefore:

* Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
* Rani has 40 + 6 = 46 crabs.

In total, they have 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs.

*  m - 2 = (j - 2)/2 + 5 (Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age)

Now we can solve for our two unknowns. Substitute the first equation into the second equation:

* m - 2 = ((m + 2) - 2)/2 + 5
* m - 2 = (m)/2 + 5
* m - 2 = 0.5m + 5
* 0.5m = 7

"To determine the time it takes to complete the puzzle, we need to find their combined work rate and then use that to calculate the total time.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute, and her mom places half that amount, which is 2 pieces per minute. Together, they place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since the puzzle has 360 pieces, and they place 6 pieces per minute, it will take them 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

Converting minutes to hours, we get 60 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1 hour.

"Let's break this problem down step by step. 

First, calculate the total stars in the rows of 8: 3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars.

Next, find the total stars in the rows of 6: 2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars.

Now, add those together to see how many stars are used in the 8-star and 6-star rows: 24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars.

Subtract that number from the total stars to find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows: 76 total stars - 36 stars = 40 stars.

Finally, divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by the number of stars per row to find the number of rows: 40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows.

"Let's break this problem down using linear equations.

* Let 'x' represent the total number of medals given out for counting.

* Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 fewer than Ali, meaning Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

* Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

* The problem states that their combined medals are 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This can be written as the equation: 39 = x / 10

* To solve for x, multiply both sides of the equation by 10: 39 * 10 = x

"Let's analyze Nick's job offers to determine the best option based on net income.

For Job A, we need to calculate the annual gross income and then subtract the taxes.  A $15 hourly wage for 2000 hours results in a gross income of $30,000. With a 20% tax rate, Nick would pay $6,000 in taxes, leaving him with a net income of $24,000.

Job B presents a slightly more complex scenario. First, we subtract the flat property tax of $6,000 from the $42,000 salary, resulting in a net income of $36,000. Then, a 10% tax is applied to this amount, equaling $3,600.  Subtracting this from the $36,000 leaves Nick with a net income of $32,400.

Comparing the two net incomes, Job B offers a significantly higher net income of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000. This means Nick would earn $8,400 more per year by choosing Job B.

"This problem can be elegantly solved using a system of equations. Let's denote the number of cows as 'c' and the number of chickens as 'h'. We are given two key pieces of information:

* **Equation 1:** The total number of animals is 60:  c + h = 60
* **Equation 2:** The number of chickens is twice the number of cows: h = 2c

Now we can solve for our unknowns.  Since we already have 'h' isolated in Equation 2, we can substitute that expression into Equation 1:

c + 2c = 60

Combining like terms, we get:

3c = 60

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

c = 20

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can plug that value back into Equation 2 to find the number of chickens:

h = 2 * 20 = 40

Finally, to find the total number of legs, remember that cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2:

Total legs = (20 cows * 4 legs/cow) + (40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken) = 80 + 80 = 160

"Let's break this problem down.  

First, we need to find the total distance of the train's route. The distance from the first to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second to the third is 100 miles. The distance from the third city back to the first is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, meaning it's 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

The total distance for one round trip is 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip three times a day, it covers 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles each day.

Finally, the train needs service every 18,000 miles.  To find out how many days it can travel before needing service, we divide the total service interval by the daily distance: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

First, the taffy deal: ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" means the second pound costs $3 / 2 = $1.50.  

So, 2 pounds of taffy cost $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Her magnets cost $0.25 each, and she bought 4, for a total of $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Adding up all her purchases: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1.00 (magnets) = $7.00

Finally, subtracting her spending from her starting amount: $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

Sally has $3.00 left.

"Let's break down this fireworks purchase. The second package cost twice the first, meaning it was $400 * 2 = $800.  

Together, the two packages cost $400 + $800 = $1200.  A 20% discount on that amount is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

After the discount, the packages cost $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, adding the finale firework, the total spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"Let's break this down. We're dealing with two independent events: a candle exploding and a candle smelling like wet dog.  

The probability of a candle exploding is 1% (100% - 99% guaranteed not to explode). The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog *given* that it explodes is 5%.

To find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities together: 0.01 * 0.05 = 0.0005.

Finally, we multiply this probability by the total number of candles to find the expected number of candles that meet both conditions: 0.0005 * 50000 = 25.

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

* Let 'x' represent the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
* Joanne's total apples: 30 + 15 + x 
* Sister's total apples: 60 + 45 
* Combined total: (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500

Now we can solve for x:

1. Combine like terms: 45 + x + 105 = 500
2. Simplify: x + 150 = 500
3. Subtract 150 from both sides: x = 350

"This problem can be elegantly solved by setting up a system of linear equations. Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.

We know:

* Each animal has one head, so c + d = 180 
* Camels have two humps, and dromedaries have one, giving us 2c + d = 304

We can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries) using elimination.  Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

c = 124

Substituting this value back into the first equation:

124 + d = 180

Therefore, d = 56.

"Let's break down Tom's trip to calculate his total distance.

* **First leg:**  He covered 200 kilometers per day for 4 days, totaling 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers.
* **Second leg:** Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance from the first leg, which is 800 km * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.
* **Rest day:** He didn't travel on the seventh day.
* **Final leg:** During the second week, he covered 300 kilometers each day for 7 days, amounting to 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers.

Adding up all the distances: 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 kilometers.

"Let's break this down. First, we need to find out how many cats were left after the boats took some away.  Four boats carrying 5 cats each means 20 cats were removed (4 * 5 = 20). That leaves us with 30 cats (50 - 20 = 30).

Next, we need to figure out how many of those remaining cats ran off. Three-fifths of the 30 cats is 18 (30 * (3/5) = 18).

Finally, to find out how many cats are left on the rock, we subtract the cats that ran off from the number that remained after the boats: 30 - 18 = 12.

"Let's break this down. The caterer planned for half the guests to have two hot dogs, meaning he prepared enough for 36 / 2 = 18 guests to have seconds. That's a total of 18 * 2 + 18 = 54 hot dogs.

Since 40 guests showed up, and each wants two hot dogs, they need a total of 40 * 2 = 80 hot dogs.  

Unfortunately, the caterer only has 54, which means only 54 / 2 = 27 guests can have two hot dogs.

This leaves 40 - 27 = 13 guests who didn't get a second hot dog.

"Let's break this down. First, we need to figure out how far the horse travels.  Since speed is distance over time, we can rearrange that to find distance: distance = speed x time.  

The horse runs at 32 miles per hour for half an hour, so the distance is 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Next, we need to determine how much hay the horse eats. It consumes half a bail per mile, so for 16 miles, it eats 16 miles * 0.5 bails/mile = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is 8 bails * $3/bail = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, giving him a total of 6 bills * $5/bill = $30.

Finally, to find his change, we subtract the cost of the hay from his total money: $30 - $24 = $6.

"This problem can be elegantly solved by setting up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as 'B', David as 'D', and Lily as 'L'.

We are given the following relationships:

* L = D + 7 
* D = B / 2
* L + D + B = 43

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

L = (B/2) + 7

Now, substitute both the modified first equation and the second equation into the third equation:

(B/2) + 7 + (B/2) + B = 43

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2B + 7 = 43

Solving for B:

2B = 36
B = 18

Now, we can find D:

D = B / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

Finally, we can find L:

L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16



Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

"This is a classic resource allocation problem best solved using linear programming principles.  

To maximize popsicle stick production, we need to determine the optimal combination of 2x4 and 2x8 lumber purchases given the budget constraint.

Let:

*  *x* represent the number of 2x4s purchased
*  *y* represent the number of 2x8s purchased

Our objective function (what we want to maximize) is the total number of popsicle sticks:

*Maximize: 200*x + 400*y*

Our constraints are:

* Budget: 4*x + 6*y <= 24 (The total cost of lumber cannot exceed $24)
* Non-negativity: x >= 0, y >= 0 (We can't buy negative lumber)

Given the budget constraint, the most cost-effective option is to purchase only 2x8s. This is because they yield more sticks per dollar (66.67 vs. 50 for 2x4s).

With a budget of $24, Frederick can buy 4 pieces of 2x8 lumber (24 / 6 = 4).

Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

* **After the first stop:** 48 passengers start, 8 get off, and 8 * 5 = 40 get on. That means there are 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 passengers.

* **After the second stop:** 80 passengers are on the bus, 21 get off, and 8 / 3 = 2.67 (round down to 2 since we can't have parts of people) get on. This leaves us with 80 - 21 + 2 = 61 passengers.

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

* Let Jame's current age be represented by the variable 'j'.
* Let his cousin's current age be represented by the variable 'c'.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

*  j + 5 = 27  (Jame will be 27 in 5 years)
*  c + 8 = 2j - 5 (In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age)

Now we can solve for our variables.

From the first equation, we know j = 22.

Substituting j = 22 into the second equation:

c + 8 = 2(22) - 5
c + 8 = 39
c = 31

Therefore, Jame's cousin is currently 31 years old.

The difference in their ages is 31 - 22 = 9 years.

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

* Let 'c' represent the cost of the computer.
* Let 'm' represent the cost of one monitor.

We know the following:

*  c = 1100             (The cost of the computer)
*  p = c - 400          (The cost of the printer)

Now we can substitute the values of 'c' and 'p' into the first equation:

1100 + 2m + (1100 - 400) = 2400

Simplify and solve for 'm':

1100 + 2m + 700 = 2400
1800 + 2m = 2400
2m = 600
m = 300

To find x, divide both sides by 45: x = $25.

Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of friends invited by the initial 100 guests: 100 people * 2 friends/person = 200 friends.

Adding those to the original invitees, we get 100 people + 200 friends = 300 people.

Then, we add the 10 friends Alex called directly: 300 people + 10 friends = 310 people.

Finally, we include the spouses: 310 people + 8 spouses = 318 people.


Alex needs 318 seats.

"Let's break this down. The Dachshund weighs twice the Affenpinscher, meaning it weighs 10 pounds * 2 = 20 pounds. The Papillon weighs one-fourth the Dachshund's weight, so it weighs 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds. Finally, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the Papillon's weight, making it 44 * 5 pounds = 220 pounds.

"This is a classic example of exponential growth.  The beanstalk's height doubles each day, meaning its height can be represented by the equation:

Height = Initial Height * 2^(Number of Days)

We want to find the number of days it takes for the height to exceed 20 feet. Let's plug in the values and solve:

20 < 4 * 2^(Number of Days)

5 < 2^(Number of Days)

To solve for the exponent, we can try different values. We see that 2^2 = 4 and 2^3 = 8, so 2^3 is the smallest power of 2 greater than 5.


Therefore, it will take **3** days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"Ah, a classic ratio problem!  Let's break it down. We know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.  This means the ratio of protein to mushrooms is 3:100.

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms daily.  To find his protein intake, we can set up a proportion:

3 grams protein / 100 grams mushrooms = x grams protein / 200 grams mushrooms

Cross-multiplying gives us:

3 grams protein * 200 grams mushrooms = 100 grams mushrooms * x grams protein

Simplifying:

600 = 100x

Dividing both sides by 100:

x = 6 grams protein per day

Now, for his weekly intake, we simply multiply his daily intake by 7 days:

6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams protein per week.

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

* Let 'x' represent the measure of the smallest angle.
* The second angle is twice the smallest, so it measures 2x.
* The third angle is three times the smallest, making it 3x.

Since the angles in a triangle must add up to 180 degrees, we have the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms:

6x = 180

Dividing both sides by 6:

x = 30

The largest angle is 3x, so it measures 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"Ah, a classic distance-rate-time problem!  

This scenario involves a direct proportion: if the plane maintains a constant speed, the time it takes to travel a certain distance is directly proportional to that distance.

First, we need to determine the plane's speed.  It covers 1200 miles in 3 hours, so its speed is 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

To find out how long it takes to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours

"Ah, a classic problem of proportional reasoning! Let's break it down.

We know a tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles.  To find out how many rotations occur in 400 miles, we can set up a proportion:

(725 rotations / 2 miles) = (x rotations / 400 miles)

Solving for x, we get x = 145,000 rotations per month.

Now, we know each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement.  Dividing the total rotations by the monthly rotations gives us the lifespan in months:

10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months

Finally, converting months to years, we get:

72 months / 12 months/year = 6 years

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know Ariadne's red hat sales were half her green hat sales, meaning her green hat sales were double her red hat sales: $400 * 2 = $800.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of her first month's total: $1200 * (3/4) = $900.

Finally, to find her total sales over two months, we add the sales from each month: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

* Pork takes 20 minutes longer than rice, so pork takes 'r + 20' minutes.
* Beans take half the time of rice and pork combined, so beans take (r + r + 20) / 2 minutes.

We know rice takes 30 minutes, so r = 30.

Now we can calculate the total cooking time:

* Pork: 30 + 20 = 50 minutes
* Beans: (30 + 30 + 20) / 2 = 40 minutes
* Total: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

"When dealing with weighted averages, the key is to consider both the quantity and the cost per unit.  

In this case, we're essentially finding the difference in cost between two weighted averages of almonds and walnuts.

The first mixture has a higher proportion of almonds (1/2 pound) compared to the second mixture (1/5 pound). Since almonds are more expensive than walnuts, this difference in almond content will drive the price difference.

Calculating the cost of each mixture and finding the difference, we arrive at a price difference of **$3**.

"This problem can be solved by setting up a system of linear equations. Let 's' represent the number of sheep and 'g' represent the number of geese.

We know:

* Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70:  4s + 2g = 70
* Each animal has 1 head, and there are 20 heads in total: s + g = 20

We can solve for 's' (the number of sheep) using substitution or elimination.  Let's use substitution:

1. Solve the second equation for 'g': g = 20 - s
2. Substitute this value of 'g' into the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
3. Simplify and solve for 's': 4s + 40 - 2s = 70 => 2s = 30 => s = 15

* S = M + 23
* K = 68

We can substitute the first equation into the fourth equation to find the value of M:

* Equation 2: x = 0.40 (Each lollipop costs $0.40)

Now we can substitute the value of 'x' from Equation 2 into Equation 1:

* 5(0.40) + 4y = 3.20
* 2 + 4y = 3.20
* 4y = 1.20

So, one candy costs $0.30.

To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

* 10 lollipops * $0.40/lollipop = $4.00

* Let 'v' represent the rate of vanilla ice cream production (quarts per hour).

We know the following:

*  c = 50 quarts/hour (from the chocolate production information)
* v = 12.5 quarts/hour (from the vanilla production information)

The total production rate is the sum of the individual rates:

* Total rate = c + v = 50 + 12.5 = 62.5 quarts/hour

To find the total quarts produced in 48 hours, we multiply the total rate by the time:

* Total quarts = Total rate * Time = 62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts

"Let's break down this delicious purchase!

* The croissants cost 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.
* The cinnamon rolls cost 4 * $2.50 = $10.00.
* The mini quiches cost 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.
* The blueberry muffins cost 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

Adding those up, the subtotal is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

A 10% discount on $50.00 is $50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00.

Subtracting the discount, the final bill is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

   - This phase lasts for 3 minutes, so she taps 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 times.

* **Phase 2: Arms Up**
   - Her rate slows to 200 taps/minute per foot, meaning 400 taps/minute total.
   - This phase lasts for 2 minutes, resulting in 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

"Let's break this problem down.  

First, we need to figure out how many slices Bryce and his two friends ate. They each ate 2/3 of a 12-slice pizza, so that's (2/3) * 12 = 8 slices per person. Since there are three of them, they ate a total of 8 * 3 = 24 slices.

The other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which is (3/4) * 12 = 9 slices per person. With two friends, that's 9 * 2 = 18 slices.

In total, they ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

"To determine the total time Jack is gone, we need to consider both travel time and time spent at the museum. 

The trip to the museum takes 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours. The return trip also takes 2 hours.

"To find out how many wheels are left, we need to calculate the total wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles, then subtract that from the number of wheels Henry has.

First, the cars need 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels.

The motorcycles need 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels.

In total, Henry needs 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Since he has 650 wheels, he will have 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels left.

"Let's analyze this situation step-by-step.  

First, we need to determine the number of movies in each category. A third of Mike's 600 movies are in series, which equates to 600 / 3 = 200 movies.

These series movies are a bargain at a third of the price of a regular movie, meaning they cost $10 * (1/3) = $3.33 per movie.  The total cost for the series movies is then 200 movies * $3.33/movie = $666.67.

That leaves 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies that aren't part of a series. Of those, 40% are older movies, which is 400 movies * 0.40 = 160 movies. These older movies cost $5 each, totaling 160 movies * $5/movie = $800.

The remaining movies are newer releases, numbering 400 movies - 160 movies = 240 movies. These cost the full price of $10 each, for a total of 240 movies * $10/movie = $2400.

Finally, to find the total cost of replacing Mike's entire movie collection, we add up the cost of each category: $666.67 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67.

"Let's break this problem down. We can set up a system of equations to represent the information given.

Let:

*  *d* = the distance driven
*  *h* = the distance hiked

We know the following:

*  *d + h* = total distance 
*  *d* = 50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours  (since they drove for 6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours)
*  *h* = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours (since they hiked at half their driving speed minus 5 miles/hour)

Substituting the second and third equations into the first equation, we get:

(50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours) + (20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours) = total distance

Calculating this gives us:

225 miles + 30 miles = total distance

Therefore, the total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles.

"Let's break this problem down using variables to represent the unknowns.

* Let 'x' be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
* Let 'y' be the number of berries Emma collects.
* Let 't' be the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

We can express Ava's performance in terms of Emma's:

* Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.
* Ava collects y + 3 berries.
* Ava finishes the level t - 4 seconds later than Emma.

Now, let's set up the equations for their scores:

* **Emma's score:** 10x + 5y + 30t
* **Ava's score:** 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(t - 4)

To find the difference in their scores, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's score:

10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(t - 4) - (10x + 5y + 30t)

Simplify the expression:

10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30t - 120 - 10x - 5y - 30t

The 'x', 'y', and 't' terms cancel out, leaving:

-25

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

* Let 'o' represent the number of orange fish Bob bought.
* Let 'w' represent the number of white fish Bob bought.

We know the following:

*  Bob bought a total of 17 fish: o + w = 17
* After the purchase, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish: o + 3 = 2(w + 4)

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. o + w = 17
2. o + 3 = 2w + 8

Let's solve for 'w' (the number of white fish Bob bought).  We can use substitution. Solve equation 1 for 'o':

* o = 17 - w

Substitute this value of 'o' into equation 2:

* (17 - w) + 3 = 2w + 8

Simplify and solve for 'w':

* 20 - w = 2w + 8
* 12 = 3w
* w = 4



Therefore, Bob bought **4** white fish at the store.

First, we need to figure out how long each friend can play per quarter. Jack's worse friends play half as long as him, so they get 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. His better friend plays 1.5 times longer, meaning they get 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

Next, we need to calculate the total playtime in minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now we can determine how many quarters each person needs. Jack needs 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters. His worse friends each need 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, for a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters. The better friend needs 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

3. **Simplify the second equation:** 4x + z = 341

4. **Substitute '3x + 12' for 'z' in the simplified second equation:** 4x + (3x + 12) = 341

5. **Combine like terms:** 7x + 12 = 341

6. **Subtract 12 from both sides:** 7x = 329

7. **Divide both sides by 7:** x = 47

8. **Substitute '47' for 'x' in the equation z = 3x + 12:** z = 3(47) + 12

9. **Calculate z:** z = 141 + 12 = 153

"Let's analyze Milly's situation.  

First, we need to calculate the shipping cost based on the book's weight and the distance to the distribution center. The shipping cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds, resulting in a cost of $0.35 * 4 = $1.40.  

Next, we factor in the distance. The shipping cost per mile is $0.08, and the distribution center is 20 miles away, leading to a cost of $0.08 * 20 = $1.60.

Therefore, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Now, let's determine the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. They offer a 75% refund on the book's $32 price, which amounts to $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.

Finally, to calculate Milly's total loss, we subtract the refund and the shipping cost from the original price: $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.00.

    * Let 't' represent the time it takes one kangaroo to cross the highway.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**

    * We know 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel distance 'd'. This means: 3r * 18 = d 
    * We can simplify this to: 54r = d

* **Find the time for one kangaroo:**

    * From the equation above, we can see that t = 54 hours for one kangaroo.

* **Calculate the speed of a kangaroo:**

    * Speed is distance over time, so r = d/t = d/54

* **Calculate the speed of a turtle:**

    * A turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so its speed is (d/54) / 2 = d/108

* **Calculate the time for four turtles:**

    * The combined speed of four turtles is 4 * (d/108) = d/27
    * Time is distance over speed, so the time for four turtles is d / (d/27) = 27 hours.

* Jack has 60 dishes: d = 60
* Peter has twice as many socks as Jack: Peter's socks = 2s
* Peter has half as many dishes as Jack: Peter's dishes = d/2

We can start by substituting the value of 'd' from the second equation into the first equation:

60 = 2s

Solving for 's', we get:

s = 30

Now we know Jack has 30 socks.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, who has 60 dishes, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Finally, to find the total number of socks and dishes, we add them all up:

* In 10 years, she will be 18:  x + 10 = 18
* We need to find when her age will be three times her current age: 3x

Solving for x in the first equation:
x = 18 - 10
x = 8

Now, set up an equation to find when her age will be thrice her current age:
3x = 8 + y  (where 'y' is the number of years)

Substitute the value of x:
3 * 8 = 8 + y
24 = 8 + y
y = 16

"Let's break down the cost of Kelly's groceries:

* **Bacon:** 5 packs of bacon cost $10, so each pack costs $10 / 5 = $2.
* **Chicken:** Each chicken packet costs twice the price of bacon, meaning each packet costs $2 * 2 = $4.  With 6 packets, the total cost is $4 * 6 = $24.
* **Strawberries:** 3 packs of strawberries at $4 each cost $4 * 3 = $12.
* **Apples:** Each pack of apples costs half the price of strawberries, so they cost $4 / 2 = $2 per pack.  With 7 packs, the total cost is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

* Let Akbar's age be represented by 'a'
* Let Alessandro's age be represented by 'al'
* Let Helene's age be represented by 'h'
* Let Wilfred's age be represented by 'w'

We are given the following information:

* a = 3
* al = 4
* h = 2 * (a + al + w + h) / 4  (Helene's age is twice the average age)
* a + al + h + w = 20 (The total age of the children is 20)

Now we can substitute the known values into the equations:

* h = 2 * (3 + 4 + w + h) / 4
* 3 + 4 + h + w = 20

Simplifying the first equation:

* h = (14 + 2w + 2h) / 4
* 4h = 14 + 2w + 2h
* 2h = 14 + 2w
* h = 7 + w

Now substitute this value of 'h' into the second equation:

* 3 + 4 + (7 + w) + w = 20
* 14 + 2w = 20
* 2w = 6
* w = 3



Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"Let's break down Doctor Jones' schedule.  

He spends 20 minutes per inpatient on rounds, and he has 9 inpatients, totaling 180 minutes (20 minutes/patient * 9 patients = 180 minutes). That's equal to 3 hours (180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours).

His appointments take 30 minutes each, and he has 10 appointments, for a total of 300 minutes (30 minutes/appointment * 10 appointments = 300 minutes). That's 5 hours (300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours).

In total, he spends 8 hours on rounds and appointments (3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours).

Since he has 9 hours available, he'll have 1 hour left for updating records (9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour).

"When dealing with constant depreciation, we can think of it as a percentage decrease applied year after year.  

In this case, the car loses 21% of its value each year.  

* **2008:** The car is worth 79% of its original value (100% - 21% = 79%). So, it's worth $20000 * 0.79 = $15800.

* **2009:**  Again, it loses 21%, meaning it's worth 79% of its 2008 value: $15800 * 0.79 = $12478.

* **2010:** One more year of depreciation: $12478 * 0.79 = $9860.62


The price of the car in 2010 is $9860.62.

"Let's break this down.  

English books make up 50% of the library, which is 50 books / 2 = 25 books.

German books represent 10% of the library, meaning there are 50 books * 0.10 = 5 German books.

That means there are 25 books + 5 books = 30 books in English and German combined.

Therefore, there must be 50 books - 30 books = 20 Spanish books.

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

* Let 'A' represent the number of eggs Arnold painted.
* Let 'M' represent the number of eggs Madeline painted.
* Let 'C' represent the number of eggs Camden painted.
* Let 'S' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.

We know the following:

* A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number)
* C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah's total)
* C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)
* A + M + C + S = 56 (Total eggs painted)

Now we can solve. Since A = M, we can substitute 'A' for 'M' in the fourth equation:

* A + A + C + S = 56
* 2A + C + S = 56

We also know C = S + 12. Substitute that into the equation:

* 2A + (S + 12) + S = 56
* 2A + 2S + 12 = 56
* 2A + 2S = 44

Now substitute C = S + 12 into the second equation:

* (S + 12) + S = 30
* 2S + 12 = 30
* 2S = 18
* S = 9

Now that we know Sarah painted 9 eggs, we can find Camden's eggs:

* C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21

Finally, we can find Arnold's eggs (which is the same as Madeline's):

* 2A + 2S = 44
* 2A + 2(9) = 44
* 2A + 18 = 44
* 2A = 26
* A = 13

To find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs:

* C - A = 21 - 13 = 8

The crayons themselves weigh 200 ounces total (200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon).

Adding the weight of the crayons and boxes, we get 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.

Finally, since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.

"Let's break this problem down using the relationship: distance = rate * time.

Let 'x' represent Grandma's speed on the beach (in miles per hour).  

* **Beach:**

   - Time: Distance / Rate = 2/x hours

* **Sidewalk:**
   - Distance: 1 mile

   - Time: Distance / Rate = 1/(2x) hours

We know 40 minutes is spent on the beach, which is equal to 40/60 = 2/3 hours.  Therefore:

2/x = 2/3

Solving for x, we find her beach speed is 3 miles per hour.

Her sidewalk speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

The time spent on the sidewalk is 1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hour, which is equal to 10 minutes.

The total time for the walk is 40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes.

The total ""degree-ounces"" contributed by the 33-degree water is 33 * 4 = 132.

The total ""degree-ounces"" contributed by the unknown water is x * 1 = x.

The total ""degree-ounces"" in the final mixture is 132 + x.

Since the final mixture is 5 ounces, the average temperature is (132 + x) / 5.

We need this average temperature to be at least 40 degrees:

(132 + x) / 5 >= 40

To solve for x, follow these steps:

"This problem involves recognizing a pattern in fruit production based on the tree's age.  Let's analyze:

* A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
* A 6-year-old tree produces three times that amount, indicating a potential multiplier pattern.
* A 7-year-old tree produces seven times the initial amount, further supporting the multiplier pattern.

We can see the multipliers are 3, 7, and then we're given information about the 8 and 10-year-old trees.

* A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, meaning it yields 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits.
* An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fewer fruits than a 10-year-old, so it yields 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Finally, the 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruit.

Summing the fruit production for each year: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = 2350 fruits.

"This problem can be elegantly solved by setting up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow ropes as 'r', 'b', and 'y' respectively.

We are given the following relationships:

*  r = 4b (The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope)
*  b = y - 7 (The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)
*  r + b + y = 37 (The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters)

By substituting the first two equations into the third, we can eliminate 'r' and 'b', leaving us with an equation solely in terms of 'y'. Solving for 'y', we find the length of the yellow rope.  We can then use this value to determine the lengths of the blue and red ropes.

After performing these calculations, we find that the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each bedroom, the living room, and then add those areas to the area of the rest of the house.

Each bedroom has an area of 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet.

Since there are four bedrooms, their total area is 240 square feet/bedroom * 4 bedrooms = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times larger than a single bedroom, so its area is 240 square feet * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding the areas of the bedrooms and living room gives us 960 square feet + 1200 square feet = 2160 square feet.

Finally, adding the area of the rest of the house, we get a total area of 2160 square feet + 1000 square feet = 3160 square feet.

"Ah, a classic geometric sequence!  

The number of clouds Alice sees each day forms a geometric sequence with a first term of 3 and a common ratio of 2.  To find the total number of clouds she sees over the five days, we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S = a₁(1 - rⁿ) / (1 - r)

Where:

* S is the sum of the series
* a₁ is the first term (3)
* r is the common ratio (2)
* n is the number of terms (5)

Plugging in the values:

S = 3 (1 - 2⁵) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 (-31) / (-1)
S = 93

"This problem can be elegantly solved by setting up a system of equations. Let's denote Wendy's current age as 'w' and Colin's current age as 'c'.

From the given information, we can form the following equations:

*  w = 5(c + 7)  
* c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now, we can solve for 'c'.  Let's substitute the first equation into the second equation to eliminate 'w':

c + 25 = (1/3)(5(c + 7))

Simplifying this equation:

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3

Combining like terms:

(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3

75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c

40/3 = (2/3)c

Multiplying both sides by (3/2):

c = 20



Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Let's break this down.  Pauline's initial cost for her museum visits over 5 years is 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

After the 150% increase, each visit costs $2 + ($2 * 1.5) = $5.

Over the next 3 years, her total spending is 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

Adding the two periods together, Pauline spends a total of $30 + $45 = $75 on museum visits.

"To figure out the total time, we need to consider how many groups of students will be needed and how long each group takes. 

Since each grade has 10 students and only 8 can participate at a time, each grade will need to form 2 groups (10 students / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups, which rounds up to 2).

With 4 grades, that means there will be a total of 8 groups (2 groups per grade * 4 grades).

Each group gets 45 minutes in the escape room, so the total time will be 360 minutes (8 groups * 45 minutes per group).

"Let's break this problem down using a linear equation.

* Let 'x' represent the length of the shorter piece.
* The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it's represented by 4x.
* The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces: x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms, we get 5x = 40.  

Dividing both sides by 5, we find that x = 8.

Therefore, the longer piece is 4 * 8 = 32 feet long.

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

* Let  'x' represent Vanessa's time per mile.
* Aaron's time per mile is then 'x/2' since he runs twice as fast.

We know the following:

* Vanessa runs 4 miles, so her total time is 4x.
* Aaron runs 2 miles (half the distance of Vanessa) in 16 minutes, meaning his time per mile is 16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes. This translates to x/2 = 8.

Now we can solve for x:

* x/2 = 8
* x = 16

Therefore, Vanessa takes 16 minutes to run each mile. Since she runs 4 miles, her total time is 4 miles * 16 minutes/mile = 64 minutes.

"This problem can be elegantly solved using a system of linear equations. Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows. We know:

*  c + w = 20 (The total number of animals is 20)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (The total number of legs is 70)

We can solve for 'c' by using substitution. From the first equation, we get w = 20 - c. Substituting this into the second equation:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2c + 80 - 4c = 70
-2c = -10
c = 5

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
