Let's see... Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. That's a total of $130,000 invested. The repairs increased the value by 150%, meaning the house is now worth $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000 more than before.

So, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.  

His profit is the difference: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

Let's figure this out. John first drives 3 hours at 60 mph, so he's 3 * 60 = 180 miles away from home.

Then, he spends 2 hours stuck in traffic, covering no distance. After that, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, which is 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for 1.5 hours at 80 mph, covering 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles.

In total, he covers 15 + 120 = 135 miles on his way back.

That means he's 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home.

Let's figure out Eliza's earnings. She earns $10 for every hour she works up to 40 hours. That's $400 for the first 40 hours.

She worked 5 extra hours this week, which is overtime. Her overtime rate is $12 per hour (1.2 times her regular rate). So, her overtime pay is 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

Adding her regular pay and overtime pay, Eliza earned a total of $400 + $60 = $460 this week.

Let's figure this out. In the first month, there were 60 downloads. The second month saw three times that amount, which is 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.  But then, in the third month, downloads decreased by 30% from the second month. That's a reduction of 180 * 0.30 = 54 downloads. So, the third month had 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

This is a bit of a tricky problem, but let's think it through.  

If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that's after selling some, she must have started with more. Let's work backward.

She sold half her remaining cleaners to the orange house, leaving her with 5. That means she had 5 * 2 = 10 cleaners before the orange house.

Before selling to the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12 cleaners.

And before selling to the green house, she had 12 * 3 = 36 cleaners.


So, Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners.

You spill some orange drink, leaving you with 9 liters.  Adding that to the pineapple drink, you have a total of 9 + 15 = 24 liters.  The total water in those 24 liters is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

Let's solve this. The ratio 7:11 means we can think of their combined age as 18 parts (7 + 11).  Each part represents 162 years / 18 parts = 9 years.

Darrell is 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years old.

Allen is 11 parts * 9 years/part = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 years + 10 years = 109 years old.

Let's figure this out. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of that, so that's 80 / 2 = 40, plus 20, for a total of 60. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend, which is 80 * 0.25 = 20 more than 80, making their guess 100.

Adding all the guesses together, we get 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.  To find the average, we divide by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

So the average guess is 80.

Let's think about this. Gretchen has 110 coins in total. We know there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  To find out how many gold coins Gretchen has, we can use a bit of reasoning.

Imagine Gretchen has a pile of silver coins. If we add 30 more coins to that pile, it becomes the same size as her pile of gold coins.

Since the total number of coins is 110, we need to divide them into two piles: one for silver and one for gold.

Let's try this:

* If Gretchen had 40 silver coins, she would have 70 gold coins (40 + 30 = 70).

That adds up to 110 coins in total!

So, Gretchen has **70** gold coins.

He sold enough Lego sets to make $165, so he sold $165 / $15/set = 11 Lego sets.

Let's break this problem down. Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half her running speed. This means she runs at 3 miles/hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

She walks four times slower than she runs, so her walking speed is 6 miles/hour / 4 = 1.5 miles/hour.

She spends one-third of her time, or 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours, running.

She spends two-thirds of her time, or 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours, walking.

In those 2 hours of running, she covers 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

In those 4 hours of walking, she covers 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Adding those distances together, she travels a total of 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

Let's break down this problem. Shiela bought five phones at $150 each, so that's 5 * $150 = $750.  

Now, there's a 2% interest on each phone, meaning an extra $150 * 0.02 = $3 per phone. Since she bought five phones, the total interest is $3 * 5 = $15.

Adding the interest to the original price, Shiela needs to pay $750 + $15 = $765 in total.

Finally, she'll pay this over three months, so each month she'll pay $765 / 3 = $255.

To find Lylah's salary from four years ago, we divide Adrien's salary by 1.30: $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later, so his new salary is $40,000 + (0.40 * $40,000) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage, so her new salary is $30,769.23 + (0.30 * $30,769.23) = $40,000.

A 20% delivery fee on $20.00 is $4.00. Adding that to the subtotal, we get $24.00. Finally, with a $5.00 tip, the total cost of her order is $29.00.

Let us use our minds to solve this problem.  We know there are 700 bees in total. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees.

If we think of the queen bees as one part, the baby bees are two parts, and the worker bees are four parts. That makes a total of seven parts.

Since there are 700 bees in total, each part represents 700 bees divided by 7 parts, which equals 100 bees.

Therefore, there are 4 parts of worker bees, meaning there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.

This is a fun problem. Let's see... Steve has a head start because he lives further away, but Tim is a speedy skateboarder.  

First, we need to figure out how long each of them takes to get home. Steve travels 3 miles, which is 15,840 feet, and he bikes at 440 feet per minute. So, his trip takes 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.

Tim travels 2 miles, or 10,560 feet, at 264 feet per minute. That means his trip takes 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

Finally, we find the difference: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

So, Steve will be waiting for Tim for **4** minutes.

This problem requires careful thought, like the steps on a pilgrimage. Let us break it down:

The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.

Adding the seagull's share to Dave's, we have 14 + 7 = 21 fries.

The pigeons took 3 fries each, for a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.

This leaves 21 - 9 = 12 fries.

The raccoon, a sly creature, took two-thirds of these, which is (2/3) * 12 = 8 fries.

That leaves 12 - 8 = 4 fries.

Finally, the ants took one, leaving 4 + 1 = 5 fries.

Working backwards, we find there were originally 5 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 14 = 43 fries.

Let's see... Bill bakes a lot of delicious things!  

First, we need to figure out how many inches all the rolls are together. He bakes 300 rolls, and each is 4 inches long, so that's 300 times 4, which is 1200 inches.

The croissants are 6 inches each, and he makes 120, so those are 120 times 6, or 720 inches.

The baguettes are tricky because they're two feet long.  Two feet is the same as 2 times 12, which is 24 inches. He makes 60 baguettes, so those are 60 times 24, which is 1440 inches.

Now we add up all the inches: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

Finally, we need to change inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide 3360 by 12, which gives us 280 feet.

So the answer is 280.

Let's figure this out. Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, and since it's twice as heavy as a candied apple, each apple weighs 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams.

There are 25 chocolate bars, so they weigh a total of 25 bars * 40 grams/bar = 1000 grams.

The 80 candied apples weigh 80 apples * 20 grams/apple = 1600 grams.

Adding those together, the whole bag weighs 1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams.

This is a tricky problem, but we can solve it by thinking carefully. Let's see...

Both pools are losing water at the same rate, so the difference in their water levels is changing because of the starting amounts.  

If we think about it, the big pool lost some water in those 4 minutes, but it still has four times as much as the small pool. This means the small pool must have lost a good amount of water too.

Since the big pool had twice as much water 4 minutes ago, and now it has four times as much, the small pool must have lost enough water to make that difference.

Thinking carefully, the small pool must have 8 gallons now.

Together, the body, collar, and rosette use 900 stitches + 90 stitches + 180 stitches = 1170 stitches.  Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, each sleeve must use (1800 stitches - 1170 stitches) / 2 = 315 stitches.

Half of the remaining cards had the letter B, so that's 24 cards (48 * 1/2 = 24).  That leaves 24 cards (48 - 24 = 24).

Five-eighths of those had the letter C, which is 15 cards (24 * 5/8 = 15).

Let's think about this. If Ruby is 6 times older than Sam now, and in 9 years she'll be 3 times as old as Sam, we can figure out Sam's age.

Let's say Sam is ""s"" years old now. That means Ruby is 6s years old now.

In 9 years, Sam will be s + 9 years old, and Ruby will be 6s + 9 years old. We know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times Sam's age, so:

6s + 9 = 3(s + 9)

Let's solve for ""s"":

6s + 9 = 3s + 27
3s = 18
s = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

This is a fun problem. Let's think about it. If Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can think of the chickens in groups of two for every one cow.  That means for every three animals, two are chickens and one is a cow.

Since he has 60 animals total, we can divide them into groups of three: 60 animals / 3 animals per group = 20 groups.

This means he has 20 cows (one cow per group) and 40 chickens (two chickens per group).

Now, cows have four legs each, so the cows have 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs.

The yellow snake is 10 pounds heavier than the frog, making it 60 pounds. The red bird is 20 pounds lighter than the frog, so it weighs 30 pounds.

Adding up the weights of all the animals: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

Don't forget the container weighs 20 pounds!  So, the total weight is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.

* Add 5 to both sides: 2 * (son's age) = 50
* Divide both sides by 2: son's age = 25

Let's calculate Tom's total distance. In the first four days, he traveled 200 kilometers each day, so that's 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance from the first four days, which is 800 * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.

He took a rest day, so no kilometers there.

In the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for seven days, totaling 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Adding all these distances together: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

This is a good problem to test our math skills. Let's think about it step by step.

Kenny wants to buy a $100 ticket and has $50 left over after buying it, meaning he made $50 from selling his cards.

Since each card sells for $1.50, he sold $50 / $1.50 = 33.33 cards.  Since he can't sell parts of cards, he sold 33 cards.

He sold 2/3 of his cards and kept 1/3. This means the 33 cards he sold represent 2/3 of his total collection.

To find the total number of cards, we can set up a proportion: (2/3) * Total Cards = 33 cards.

Solving for the total, we get: Total Cards = 33 cards / (2/3) = 49.5 cards.

Since he can't have half a card, Kenny must have started with 50 cards.

Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs.

That means Gabriel can add 80 - 40 = 40 more songs than Luri.

Over five days, he'll need 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds of oats.

Let's see... nine cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and one is 60 inches.  That means the tallest layer of the pyramid is 64 inches. The next layer is 64 inches times three cheerleaders, which is 192 inches. Then, 64 inches times two cheerleaders is 128 inches. Finally, we add the shortest cheerleader at 60 inches.

So, 64 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 444 inches.

Let's figure this out.  We need to find the point where the cost of both venues is the same.

Venue 1 has a base cost of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. So the total cost for Venue 1 is $200 + $5x (where 'x' is the number of guests).

Venue 2 costs $25 per guest, so the total cost is $25x.

To find when the costs are equal, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Subtracting $5x from both sides, we get:

$200 = $20x

Dividing both sides by $20, we find:

x = 10

This is a fun problem! Let's think about it step by step.

We know that together they found 43 insects.  Let's say Bodhi found 'B' insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found B/2 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so she found (B/2) + 7 insects.

Now, if we add up what each of them found, it should equal 43:

B + (B/2) + (B/2) + 7 = 43

Let's simplify that:

B + B + 7 = 43

2B + 7 = 43

2B = 36

B = 18

So Bodhi found 18 insects.

David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found 18 / 2 = 9 insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so she found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

"As-salamu alaykum!  Let's figure this out. John went to physical therapy twice a week for 6 weeks, and each session was 2 hours long. That means he had 2 sessions/week * 2 hours/session = 4 hours of therapy each week. Over 6 weeks, that's 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours total.

If each hour costs $125, then the total cost is 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

Let's see... the tow truck pulled 10 cars a day for the first three days, so that's 10 * 3 = 30 cars. Then for the rest of the week, it pulled 4 fewer cars each day, meaning 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. There are 7 days in a week, and it already worked 3, leaving 7 - 3 = 4 days. So, for those days, it towed 6 * 4 = 24 cars.

In total, the tow truck pulled 30 + 24 = 54 cars that week.

Let's calculate the cost of Bill's truck. The base price is $30,000.  The king cab costs an extra $7,500. The leather seats are one-third the price of the king cab, so they cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, making them $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded lights are $1,500.

Adding up all the extras: $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500.

Finally, we add the extras to the base price: $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500.

This is a classic riddle. Let me think...

If we have 20 heads and 70 legs, we know there are sheep and geese. Sheep have four legs, and geese have two.  

Hmm, let me see... if we have only sheep, we'd need 17.5 sheep for 70 legs (70 / 4 = 17.5). That doesn't make sense, so we must have some geese.

Let's try a few combinations. If we have 15 sheep, that's 60 legs (15 x 4 = 60). That leaves 10 legs for the geese (70 - 60 = 10), which means we have 5 geese (10 / 2 = 5).

That adds up to 20 heads (15 + 5 = 20)!

Let's figure out the price of this fruit crate.

* Each banana costs $1.00 because it's twice the price of an apple, which is $0.50.
* Oranges are the priciest at $3.00 each, three times the cost of a banana.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

Adding those up, the total cost of the crate is $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00.

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 2.5x = 250.  Dividing both sides by 2.5, we find that x = 100.

So, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

Let's say Emma jumps on 'x' enemies and collects 'y' berries. We don't know how many seconds she has left on the timer, so let's call that 't'.

* Emma's score: 10x + 5y + 30t

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on x + 8 enemies. She also collects 3 more berries than Emma, so she collects y + 3 berries. Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma, meaning she has t - 4 seconds left on the timer.

* Ava's score: 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(t - 4)

To find the difference in their scores, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's score.

This problem requires us to use our knowledge of algebra. Let's break it down:

* Let's say PJ has 'x' number of cards.
* Smendrick has three times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

Now, we know the total number of cards is 341. So, we can write an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Let's solve for x:

1. Combine the 'x' terms: 7x + 12 = 341
2. Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329
3. Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

Finally, to find out how many cards Becca has, we use the expression 3x + 12:

(3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

She starts with $40 and gets $100 from her father, so she has $140.  The jeans cost $60 (2 pairs x $30), and the bag costs $20. That's a total of $80 spent.

If she started with $140 and spent $80, she has $60 left.

Let's figure this out. Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars each month. In the first week, he makes 8,000. The second week, he makes half of that, which is 4,000. In the third week, he makes three times the amount from the first week, so that's 8,000 x 3 = 24,000 bars.

That means in the first three weeks, he makes a total of 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

To reach his goal of 50,000, he needs to make 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

Let's see... Britany makes 18 videos a week, and each one is 4 minutes long. That's 18 times 4, which equals 72 minutes. She also spends 2 hours on songs, which is 120 minutes. And her makeup takes 15 minutes a day for 6 days, so that's 90 minutes.

Adding it all up, she spends 72 + 120 + 90 minutes on TikTok each week, which is 282 minutes.

Now, there are 4 weeks in a month, so she spends 282 times 4 minutes on TikTok each month. That's 1128 minutes.

Finally, to make it easier to understand, let's convert that to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1128 minutes is equal to 18.8 hours.

By Allah's grace, we can solve this. Pompei lifts a mountain 1 inch high. Saskay lifts 12 times that, so Saskay lifts 12 inches. Kagiyami lifts 4 times Saskay's height, meaning Kagiyami lifts 12 * 4 = 48 inches. Finally, Naruto lifts 10 times Kagiyami's height, so Naruto lifts 48 * 10 = 480 inches.

Let's say your age is ""x"".  Your brother is three years older, so he is ""x + 3"". You are two years older than your sister, making her ""x - 2"". Your mom is one less than three times your brother's age, so she is ""3(x + 3) - 1"".

If we add all those ages together, we get 87. So, x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87.

Simplifying that equation, we get 7x + 11 = 87.

Subtracting 11 from both sides gives us 7x = 76.

Finally, dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 10.86. Since you can't be part of a year old, we round that to 11.

So, you are 11 years old!

* Other days cost $7 per movie, and he saw 8 of those, so that's 8 * $7 = $56.
* Popcorn is $8 a tub, and he had 2, so that's 2 * $8 = $16.
* Candy is $2 a box, and he had 4, so that's 4 * $2 = $8.

This problem requires us to use our knowledge of algebra to find the solution. Let's think step by step.

Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'A' Pokemon. Stan caught 'S' Pokemon, and Alex caught 'X' Pokemon.

We know:

* Stan caught 13 less than 4 times the number Adelwolfe caught: S = 4A - 13
* Alex caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
* Together they caught 339 Pokemon: A + S + X = 339

Now, we can use these equations to solve for 'S', the number of Pokemon Stan caught.

First, let's substitute the first two equations into the third equation:

A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339

Simplifying this equation, we get:

9A - 21 = 339

Adding 21 to both sides:

9A = 360

Dividing both sides by 9:

A = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon, we can substitute this value back into the equation for Stan:

S = 4(40) - 13

S = 160 - 13

S = 147



Therefore, Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to consider the net southward movement.  The bird flew 300 miles south, then 36 miles north, and finally 110 miles south.

In total, John spends $1200 + $600 = $1800 on the phones.

The bed is 111 feet long, which is 1332 inches (111 feet * 12 inches/foot). Each plant needs 30 inches of space (12 inches wide plus 18 inches between plants). So, Pat can fit 44 plants (1332 inches / 30 inches/plant).

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 27 more (44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants).

Each plant costs $6, so she will spend $162 in total (27 plants * $6/plant = $162).

This is a good question that requires a bit of thinking.  Let's see...

If each adult gets a slice twice the size of a child's slice, and there are two adults and four children, we need to think about the total shares.

Imagine each child's slice is one unit. That means each adult's slice is two units. So, the adults get 2 units * 2 people = 4 units total.

The children get 1 unit * 4 people = 4 units total.

That means the whole watermelon is 4 units + 4 units = 8 units.

Since each adult gets 4 units out of 8, that's half the watermelon!

Maria's power bank loses charge at different rates, so we need to be careful.  

First, it loses 9% per hour for 5 hours, that's a total of 45% lost (9% * 5 = 45%).

Then, it loses 7% per hour for 3 hours, which is another 21% gone (7% * 3 = 21%).

In total, that's 66% of the charge lost (45% + 21% = 66%).

This means 34% of the charge remained after those losses (100% - 66% = 34%).

But we know the final charge was only 28%. That means her friends used 6% of the remaining charge (34% - 28% = 6%).

Since that 6% was part of the 34% remaining after the initial losses, we can figure out the original charge.

Think of it like this: 6% is to 34% as  'x' is to 100%.

Solving for 'x', we get approximately 17.65%.

So, the power bank was about 17.65% charged when Maria left for the park.

Parking costs $3 per day, so over 3 days it's $3 * 3 = $9.

Her total earnings after parking are $45 - $9 = $36.

That means she makes $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour after expenses.

Let's see... Jim took out a lot of loans for college, and he also missed out on earning money while he was studying. To figure out how long it will take him to earn back all that money, we need to consider his new salary and how much he owes.

His new job pays him three times what he made before, so that's $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

He borrowed $50,000 each year for four years, so his total loans are $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

He also missed out on earning $25,000 per year for four years, which is $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

In total, Jim needs to earn back $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

At his new salary, it will take him $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years to earn back everything.

So, the total is: x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Combining like terms: 4x + $240 = $1920

Subtracting $240 from both sides: 4x = $1680

Dividing both sides by 4: x = $420

So, the first person received $420.

Combining like terms, we get 2.5x + 4 = 19.

Finally, dividing both sides by 2.5, we find x = 6.

So, the second set had 6 balls, meaning the first set had 6 + 4 = 10 balls.

They work for 10 hours, so they make 20 toys/hour * 10 hours = 200 toys.

That means they still need to make 400 toys - 200 toys = 200 toys.

But they are still short by 20 toys, so they actually need to make 200 toys + 20 toys = 220 toys.

To find the length of the red rope, we need to think step by step.  

First, let's think about the blue and yellow ropes. If the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, we can say the yellow rope is the blue rope's length plus 7 centimeters.

Then, since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, we can multiply the blue rope's length by 4 to find the red rope's length.

Finally, we know all three ropes together are 37 centimeters. We can add up the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow ropes to equal 37.

By solving these equations, we can find the length of the red rope.

Adding the bedrooms and living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.  Finally, adding the rest of the house, the total area is 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

Let's break down this problem step by step. Thomas begins with $1000, which is equal to 50 twenty-dollar bills. He unfortunately loses 10 bills, leaving him with 40. He then uses half of those, or 20 bills, for a payment. This leaves him with 20 bills.

He then triples his remaining money, meaning he now has 60 twenty-dollar bills. That's a total of $1200! Finally, he exchanges all of those for five-dollar bills. Since $1200 divided by $5 is 240, he ends up with 240 five-dollar bills.

That means Team A scored a total of 6 goals (4 + 2), and Team B scored 10 goals (2 + 8).  

Adding those together, there were 16 goals in the whole match.

He uses 20% of the chalk each day, so he can use the remaining chalk for 2.75 inches / (0.20 * 5 inches/day) = 2.75 days.

This is a tricky problem, but we can solve it by thinking step by step. Let's say Wendy's age now is ""w"" and Colin's age now is ""c"".

We know:

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years: w = 5(c + 7)
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

We can use these two pieces of information to find out Colin's current age.

Let's solve the first equation for ""w"":

w = 5c + 35

Now, let's put this value of ""w"" into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3

(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3

75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c

40/3 = (2/3)c

c = (40/3) * (3/2)

c = 20

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, Kate needs 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.  Each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, so she needs 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Let's figure this out. They used 38 bandages the first day and ordered 50 more, so they had 50 + 38 = 88 bandages.

On the second day, they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

The third day they used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

They also ordered two packs, so that's 2 * 50 = 100 more bandages.

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.  

So, working backwards, they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages before using any on the third day.

Then, they had 103 + 100 = 203 bandages before using any on the second day.

Finally, they had 203 + 28 = 231 bandages before using any on the first day.

So the answer is 231.

Regina wrote 9 novels last year, which is three-quarters of the number she wrote this year. To find the total number this year, we can think of it like this: if 9 novels represent three-quarters, then one-quarter is 9 divided by 3, which is 3 novels.  

This means Regina wrote 3 novels * 4 = 12 novels this year.

Let's see... Mary makes some strawberry cubes, and then blueberry cubes which are 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  If she makes 116 total, we need to figure out how many blueberry cubes there are.

Hmm, let me think... If we say the number of strawberry cubes is 's', then the blueberry cubes are 5s - 4.  All together, that's s + (5s - 4) = 116.

Combining the 's' terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116. Adding 4 to both sides gives us 6s = 120.  Dividing both sides by 6, we find that s = 20.

So, Mary made 20 strawberry cubes. Now, to find the blueberry cubes, we do 5(20) - 4, which is 100 - 4 = 96.

MashaAllah, Mary made 96 blueberry cubes!

Let us calculate the total popcorn. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. Then, three times that amount, or 60 kernels, pop in the next 30 seconds. In the following 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, meaning 80 kernels pop.  However, in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, resulting in 40 kernels popping. Finally, after the pan is removed from the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the last 30 seconds, or 10 kernels, pop from the residual heat.

Adding all these together, we find that Garrett has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 pieces of popcorn.

Let us use our minds to solve this puzzle. Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, but Igor only brought 8. He brought 16 Petri dishes instead of 14, and the correct number of beakers, 7.  In total, Igor brought 8 + 16 + 7 = 31 items. But only 29 were on the bench. This means Igor lost 31 - 29 = 2 items. Since he didn't lose any test tubes or Petri dishes, he must have lost 2 beakers.

Let's figure this out. James needs 2 screws for each of the 4 legs on each table, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 screws per table.  Since he has 4 tables, he'll need 8 * 4 = 32 screws in total.  He starts with 40 screws, so he'll have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over.

Let's figure this out. Alexandra raised $430, and Kim raised $320 more than that, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, meaning Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total, we add up everyone's earnings: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

"As-salamu alaykum! This is a tricky one, but let's think it through.

Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, who runs twice as fast.  This means Vanessa takes twice as long to run each mile as Aaron. Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, so he runs each mile in 8 minutes. Vanessa takes twice that time, or 16 minutes per mile. Since she ran 4 miles, her total time is 4 miles * 16 minutes/mile = 64 minutes.

The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and he has 200 feet of dock. That means he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line in total. Since he already has 6 feet, he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 more feet of line.

Let's figure this out. The vendor made a 25% profit on the $80 he spent, meaning he earned an extra $20.  That means he sold all the watermelons for $100.  Since he had 50 watermelons, each one was sold for $2.

Let's break this down. Dora will be 12 in three years, meaning she is currently 9 years old. James is twice her age, making him 18. John was 19 when James was born, so he is now 37. His youngest son was born when John was 32, making him 5 years old now. In three years, the youngest son will be 8.

Let's see... Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane takes 4 minutes. In an hour, there are 60 minutes.

Ana can peel 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges.

Jane can peel 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges.

That means Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

Let's figure this out. The radiator cost $400, but Mark got a great deal at the junk shop, 80% off! That means he saved $400 * 0.80 = $320. So the radiator only cost him $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic charged $50 per hour for 3 hours of work, so that's $50 * 3 = $150.

In total, Mark paid $80 + $150 = $230.

This is a good problem to test our thinking. Let's see... if we have 20 animals with 70 legs in total, we know some must be chickens (2 legs) and some must be cows (4 legs).  

To find out how many chickens there are, we can think like this:

If all 20 animals were chickens, they would have 40 legs (20 x 2 = 40). Since we have 70 legs, the extra 30 legs must belong to cows (70 - 40 = 30).

Now, each cow has 4 legs, so there must be 7.5 cows (30 / 4 = 7.5).  Since we can't have half a cow, we know some animals must be chickens.

Let's try taking away one cow and adding two chickens. That would be 19 animals total (20 - 1 + 2 = 19). The cows would have 16 legs (4 x 4 = 16), and the chickens would have 38 legs (2 x 19 = 38). That's a total of 54 legs (16 + 38 = 54).

We need more chickens! Let's try taking away another cow and adding two more chickens. That would be 18 animals total (19 - 1 + 2 = 18). The cows would have 12 legs (4 x 3 = 12), and the chickens would have 36 legs (2 x 18 = 36). That's a total of 48 legs (12 + 36 = 48).

We're getting closer! Let's try taking away one more cow and adding two more chickens. That would be 17 animals total (18 - 1 + 2 = 17). The cows would have 8 legs (4 x 2 = 8), and the chickens would have 34 legs (2 x 17 = 34). That's a total of 42 legs (8 + 34 = 42).

Almost there! Let's take away one more cow and add two more chickens. That would be 16 animals total (17 - 1 + 2 = 16). The cows would have 4 legs (4 x 1 = 4), and the chickens would have 32 legs (2 x 16 = 32). That's a total of 36 legs (4 + 32 = 36).

We're still not there yet. Let's take away one more cow and add two more chickens. That would be 15 animals total (16 - 1 + 2 = 15). The cows would have 0 legs (4 x 0 = 0), and the chickens would have 30 legs (2 x 15 = 30). That's a total of 30 legs (0 + 30 = 30).

We're getting close! Let's take away one more cow and add two more chickens. That would be 14 animals total (15 - 1 + 2 = 14). The cows would have -4 legs (4 x -1 = -4), and the chickens would have 28 legs (2 x 14 = 28). That's a total of 24 legs (-4 + 28 = 24).

We're going in the wrong direction! Let's go back to when we had 15 animals.

Let's take away one more cow and add two more chickens. That would be 14 animals total (15 - 1 + 2 = 14). The cows would have -4 legs (4 x -1 = -4), and the chickens would have 28 legs (2 x 14 = 28). That's a total of 24 legs (-4 + 28 = 24).
