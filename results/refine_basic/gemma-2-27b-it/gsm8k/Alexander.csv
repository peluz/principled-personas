"Let's break this down. Janet starts with 16 eggs. She uses 3 for breakfast and 4 for muffins, totaling 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. That leaves her with 16 - 7 = 9 eggs to sell. Since she sells each egg for $2, she makes 9 * $2 = $18 at the market.

"Alright, let's break this down. Josh spent a total of $130,000 ($80,000 for the house + $50,000 for repairs).  The repairs increased the value by 150%, meaning the house is now worth $200,000 ($80,000 x 1.50 = $120,000 increase + $80,000 original value).  

His profit is the difference between the final value and his total investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, he runs 3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters each day.  Then, over a whole week, he runs 180 meters/day * 3 days/week = 540 meters.

"
"Well, let me see. If Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times that amount, then Charleston has 80 sheep.  Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 160 sheep.  Adding them all up, Seattle's 20 plus Charleston's 80 plus Toulouse's 160 gives us a grand total of 260 sheep.

"Alright, let's break this down. Carla starts strong, downloading at 2 GB per minute.  She gets 40% of the way through, which is 80 GB, before that pesky Windows update hits. That update eats up 20 minutes, and she has to start all over.  

So, she downloads 80 GB in 40 minutes. Then she's got 120 GB left to download, which takes another 60 minutes.  Adding it all up: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"
"Let's see... John drove 180 miles out initially.  Then he spent two hours stuck, so he's still 180 miles away. After the slow driving, he's 180 - 15 = 165 miles away.  Finally, after the fast driving, he's 165 - 120 = 45 miles away.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Eliza's earnings.

She makes $10 an hour for her first 40 hours, so that's 40 * $10 = $400.

She worked 5 hours of overtime, and her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.  So her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

Adding her regular pay and overtime pay, Eliza earned a total of $400 + $60 = $460 this week.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

The program had 60 downloads the first month.  The second month it tripled that to 180 downloads. Then, in the third month, those downloads went down by 30%, meaning they lost 180 * 0.30 = 54 downloads. That leaves 180 - 54 = 126 downloads for the third month.

Adding it all up: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 total downloads.

"Alright, let's break down Toula's bakery haul. 

* She got 3 dozen donuts at $68 a dozen, so that's 3 * $68 = $204.
* Then she grabbed 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 a dozen, totaling 2 * $80 = $160.
* Finally, she picked up 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 a dozen, coming to 6 * $55 = $330.

Adding it all up: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.



"
"Let's see... the tree costs $90, and he makes $10.50 each year from the lemons minus $3 for upkeep. That means he makes a profit of $7.50 per year.  So it will take him 12 years to make back the cost of the tree.

"Let's break this problem down.  

If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that's after selling some, we need to work backwards. Think of it like this:

* **Before the orange house:** She had 5 + the amount she sold at the orange house. Since she sold half at the orange house, she had double that amount before. So, 5 x 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners.

* **Before the red house:** She had 10 + the 2 she sold at the red house, meaning she had 12 vacuum cleaners.

* **Before the green house:** She sold a third at the green house, meaning the 12 she had represents two-thirds of her starting amount. To find the whole amount, we multiply by 3/2: 12 x (3/2) = 18 vacuum cleaners.



Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. 

"
"Hey there! Let me break this down for you.  

If 20% of the 20 students are into contemporary dance, that's 4 students. That leaves 16 students. Then, 25% of those 16 students like jazz, which is another 4 students.  That means 12 students are left for hip-hop.

So, 12 out of 20 students like hip-hop, which is 60%.

"Well, let's see.  If the jewelry market goes up 2.5%, that's a profit of $125 on a $5,000 investment. The electronics, with a 1.2% increase, would only yield a $96 profit on $8,000.  

Looks like the jewelry is the better bet this month.

"Alright, let's break this down. Jill makes $20 an hour teaching and works 35 hours a week doing that, so she earns $20 * 35 = $700 per week teaching.  She also makes $30 an hour coaching and works 15 hours a week at that, bringing in $30 * 15 = $450 per week coaching.  

That means she makes a total of $700 + $450 = $1150 every week. Over a year, with 50 weeks of work, her total salary is $1150 * 50 = $57500.

"Well, let's see. Claire eats 3 eggs a day, so that's 21 eggs in a week (3 x 7 = 21). Over four weeks, she'd eat 84 eggs (21 x 4 = 84).  Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, she'll eat 7 dozen eggs (84 / 12 = 7).

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Marissa wants to average 4 miles per hour over the whole 12-mile hike.  She's already walked 6 miles in 2 hours. That means she has 6 miles left and only 1 hour to do it.  To cover those last 6 miles in an hour, she needs to hike at 6 miles per hour.

"
"Well, let's see here.  You've got 10 liters of orange drink, and two-thirds of that is water, so that's 6.67 liters of water. Then you have 15 liters of pineapple drink, and three-fifths of that is water, which is 9 liters.  

But you spill a liter of the orange drink, leaving you with 9 liters.  Adding that to the pineapple drink gives you 24 liters total.  

So, the total amount of water in those 24 liters is 15.67 liters. 



"
"Let's see... Samantha is 31, and Raymond is older by 6 years, making him 37.  Raymond had his son when he was 23, so his son is 37 - 23 = 14 years old. That means Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"
"Let's break this down. Marie spent $12 on chicken, $15 on milk (5 packs * $3), and $6 on apples (4 apples * $1.50), for a total of $33.  That leaves $17 for pizza ($50 - $33). Since each pizza box costs $8.50, she must have bought 2 boxes ($17 / $8.50).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Mishka spent. 

She bought 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each, so that's 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.

Then she got 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each, which is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

Finally, she snagged 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each, coming to 3 * $42 = $126.00.

Adding it all up: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Cynthia eats ice cream every day for 60 days, so that's 60 servings. Each carton has 15 servings, meaning she'll need 4 cartons (60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons).  Since each carton costs $4.00, her total cost will be $16.00 (4 cartons * $4.00/carton).

"
"Hey there!  Let's see... Henry biked 20 miles to his first stop, and his second stop was 15 miles from the end of his 60-mile trip. That means his second stop was at mile 45.  So, he biked 45 - 20 = 25 miles between his stops.

"
"Let's break this down. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice that, so they cost $33 * 2 = $66. Together, the heels cost $33 + $66 = $99. Since the boots cost $5 more than the heels, they must cost $99 + $5 = $104.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Darrell and Allen's ages have a ratio of 7:11, meaning for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11.  Their combined age is 162.

To find Allen's age in 10 years, we need to figure out his current age first.

Think of the ratio as 18 parts total (7 + 11 = 18). Each ""part"" represents 162 / 18 = 9 years.

* Darrell is 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years old.
* Allen is 11 parts * 9 years/part = 99 years old.

Finally, Allen's age in 10 years will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, the first friend guesses 80 jelly beans. The second friend says 20 more than half of that, which is 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend, which is 80 * 0.25 = 20 more jelly beans, making their guess 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

To find the average, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Then we divide by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can think of it like this:

* **Silver coins:**  Let's say Gretchen has 'x' silver coins.
* **Gold coins:** She'd have 'x + 30' gold coins.

Since she has 110 coins total, we can write an equation: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2: x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  

To find the gold coins, we add 30: 40 + 30 = 70

Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"
"Let's break this down.  Raymond has 40 jewels. Aaron has 5 more than half of that, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels. Siobhan has 2 fewer than Aaron, meaning she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes. In the next 20 minutes, he scores 25% more than that, which is 1 extra point. So, he scores 5 points in the second half.  That means he scores a total of 9 points.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he'll eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts. Since each set has 4 yogurts and costs $5.00, he'll need 60 / 4 = 15 sets. That means he'll spend 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt. 


$75.00 

"
"Let's see... John sold his Lego sets for $15 each, and he had 13 of them. That means he made 13 * $15 = $195.  He spent $160 on video games, and had $5 left over.  That means he had $160 + $5 = $165 before buying the games.

So, he sold enough Lego sets to make $165, which is $165 / $15 per set = 11 Lego sets.

Since he started with 13 and sold 11, he has 13 - 11 = 2 Lego sets left.

"
"Let's break this down. John runs 3 hours the first day and half that, or 1.5 hours, on the other two days. That's a total of 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours of running per week.

Since he runs 60 miles in those 6 hours, he must be running at a speed of 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour. 

10 

"
"Let's break this problem down.  Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half her running speed, so she runs at 6 miles per hour. Since she runs four times faster than she walks, her walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends two hours running (one-third of six hours) and four hours walking (two-thirds of six hours).  That means she covers 12 miles running (6 miles/hour * 2 hours) and 6 miles walking (1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours).

In total, Dana travels 18 miles.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's is twice as old, then Ben's is 1 * 2 = 2 years old.  Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, Brandon's is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.

"
"Let's see... Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet normally. With the gemstone, she can throw it three times that distance, so that's 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. Since the dragon's fire reaches 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away and still hit it.

"
"Let's see... Grandma made 5 pies with 8 slices each, so that's 5 * 8 = 40 slices in total. If there were 14 slices left, then the guests ate 40 - 14 = 26 slices.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  You've got 200 calories left and each serving of chips is 250 calories. That means you can only have 0.8 servings. Since a bag has 5 servings and weighs 300 grams, one serving is 60 grams.  So, you can eat 0.8 servings * 60 grams/serving = 48 grams of chips.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Charlie can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, and he needs to make 20 candles. That means he'll use 2 pounds of beeswax.  

Each pound of beeswax and wicks costs $10.00, so 2 pounds will cost him $20.00. He sells each candle for $2.00, so 20 candles will bring in $40.00.

His profit is his total earnings minus his costs: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Meredith's a busy bee!

* On Tuesday, she wrote 5 articles + (2/5 * 5 articles) = 7 articles.
* Wednesday was a big day, with 7 articles * 2 = 14 articles.
* In total, she wrote 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.
* Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours writing.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes and used 220, leaving her with 23.  To find out how many were in the package, we need to figure out how many she had in total before using any.  

She had 80 + 220 = 300 Post-it notes total.

Since she had 23 left over, she must have bought a package with 300 - 23 = 277 Post-it notes.

"
"Let's break this down. John bought 5 blue ties since he spent $200 and each blue tie costs $40. He bought twice as many red ties, meaning he has 10 red ties.  Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so each red tie costs $60. That means he spent $600 on red ties (10 ties * $60/tie). In total, he spent $800 on ties ($200 + $600).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to know how many inches are in 4 feet: that's 4 times 12, which equals 48 inches.

Tracy got 8 pieces of wire. 



"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  If 3/4 of the building is occupied, that means 1/4 is unoccupied.  So, we need to find 1/4 of the total units.

There are 15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units total.

One-fourth of the units are unoccupied, so there are (1/4) * 120 units = 30 unoccupied units.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how many eggs Lloyd gets in a week: 252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs.

Then, we see how many dozens that is: 1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen.

Finally, we multiply that by the price per dozen: 147 dozen * $2/dozen = $294.

So Lloyd makes $294 per week from his eggs.

"
"Hmm, let's see. Uriah needs to take out 15 pounds total. His comic books weigh a quarter pound each, and he's getting rid of 30 of them, so that's 7.5 pounds right there. That means he needs to take out another 7.5 pounds of toys. Since each toy weighs half a pound, he needs to remove 15 toys.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

On Thursday, the mechanic made $60/tire * 6 tires = $360 from trucks and $40/tire * 4 tires = $160 from cars, for a total of $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic made $40/tire * 12 tires = $480 from cars.

The difference is $520 - $480 = $40.

"
"Gosh, that's a lot of kittens! Let's see... Mom said Patchy had three times the number of kittens the Doubtfire sisters brought home, which is 7 times 3, or 21 kittens. Trixie had 12 kittens.

"Let's figure this out!

First, we need to calculate the delivery fee: $40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00.

Now, add that to the original cost and the delivery fee: $40.00 + $10.00 + $3.00 = $53.00.

Finally, add the tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

So the final price of Stephen's groceries was $57.00. 



"
"Well, let's see... 6 clusters with 20 raspberries each is 6 times 20, which is 120 raspberries.  Then we add the 67 raspberries scattered around, so that's 120 plus 67.  That makes a total of 187 raspberries!

"
"Well, let's see.  There are 25 oranges in total. One is bad, 20% are unripe (which is 5 oranges), and 2 are sour. That means there are 8 oranges that aren't good.  So, 25 minus 8 equals 17 good oranges.

"Let's break down the cost:

* The brooch's materials cost $500.
* The jeweler charged $800 to make it.
* Insurance was 10% of the total cost so far, which is $500 + $800 = $1300.
*  10% of $1300 is $130.

Adding it all up: $500 + $800 + $130 = $1430

"
"Let's break this down. Marcy gets a base pension of $50,000 per year after 40 years. Since she's getting a 5% bonus per year on that amount after 20 years, and she's quitting after 30, she'll get that bonus for 10 years.  That bonus is $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500 per year.

So, her total annual pension will be $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500. 


$52,500
"
"Hey there! Let's break this down. Aleena pays $140 a month for the first six months, so that's $140 * 6 = $840.

For the next six months, she gets a 10% discount, which is $140 * 0.10 = $14 off her monthly bill. That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month.

So for the last six months, she pays $126 * 6 = $756.

Adding up both halves of the year, her total cost is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. Jim watches TV for 2 hours and reads for half that time, which is 1 hour. So, he spends a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours each day on these activities.

Since he does this 3 times a week, that's 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours per week.

Over 4 weeks, he spends 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

"Alright, let's break this down. Judy teaches a lot of dance! 

She teaches 5 classes a day during the week, so that's 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.

Add in her 8 Saturday classes, and she teaches a total of 25 + 8 = 33 classes in a week.

With 15 students in each class, that's 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Shiela's buying five phones at $150 each, so that's 5 * $150 = $750.  

Now, there's a 2% interest charge per phone, meaning an extra $150 * 0.02 = $3 per phone.

Since she's buying five phones, the total interest is $3 * 5 = $15.

Adding the interest to the original cost, Shiela needs to pay $750 + $15 = $765 in total.

Spread out over three months, her monthly payment will be $765 / 3 = $255.


Let me know if you have any other problems to solve!

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Artie makes.

First, we need to round his prices to the nearest dollar:

* Marigolds: $2.74 rounds up to $3
* Petunias: $1.87 rounds down to $2
* Begonias: $2.12 rounds up to $2

Now, let's calculate his earnings for each type of flower:

* Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
* Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
* Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Finally, add up his earnings from all the flowers: $36 + $18 + $34 = $88

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If the top level is 16 square feet and each level is half the size of the one below it, we can work our way down.

The third level would be 16 * 2 = 32 square feet.
The second level would be 32 * 2 = 64 square feet.
The bottom level would be 64 * 2 = 128 square feet.

Adding all the levels together: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

Finally, to find the average, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.

"Let's break this down. The puppy needs 1 cup of food a day for the first 180 days, that's 180 cups total.  Then it needs 2 cups a day for the rest of the year, which is another 370 cups (2 cups/day * 185 days).  

That means Cecilia needs 550 cups of food in total (180 + 370). Since each bag has 110 cups, she'll need 5 bags (550 / 110).

"
"Well, let's see. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half of that, which is 200 pounds. David does a quarter of what Sarah does, so he does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.  That means Raymond does 200 - 100 = 100 pounds more laundry than David.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Charlie starts with 10 stickers, then gets 21 more, and then 23 more for his birthday. That's a total of 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers!  He gives 9 to his sister, leaving him with 54 - 9 = 45 stickers. Finally, he uses 28 for a card, so he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.

"
"Let me see... Grace weighs 125 pounds, and Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. So, 4 times Grace's weight is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds.  Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so he weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Together, they weigh 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

"
"Hey there! Let's see... 3 rose bushes with 25 roses each means there are 3 * 25 = 75 roses in total.  Since each rose has 8 thorns, that's 75 * 8 = 600 thorns!

"Hey there! This is a classic word problem. Let's break it down.

If they won 8 more games than they lost, think of it like this:  imagine the wins and losses are split into two groups, with the wins group being 8 bigger.  

Since they played 22 games total, those two groups (wins and losses) have to add up to 22.

To figure out how many are in each group, we need to split 22 in half, then add 8 to the bigger half.

Half of 22 is 11.

11 + 8 = 19

So they won 15 games!

"
"Let's see... he's been on vacation four times a year since he was 23, and he's now 34. That means he's been on vacation for 11 years (34-23 = 11).  So he has 44 shirts total (11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44).

"
"Let's see... the alarm rang 4 times the first time. The second time it rang three times longer, so that's 4 * 3 = 12 times.  The third time it rang half as long as the second time, which is 12 / 2 = 6 times.  In total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Sylvie gets a 10% raise every year after five years.  

* After one year, her salary will be $600 + ($600 * 0.10) = $660.
* After two years, it'll be $660 + ($660 * 0.10) = $726.
* After three years, it'll be $726 + ($726 * 0.10) = $798.60.


So her annual salary after three more years will be $798.60.

"Let's think about this. If Marilyn sold 10 times more than Harald, that means Harald's sales represent one part of the total, and Marilyn's sales represent ten parts.  That makes a total of eleven parts.

Since they sold 88,000 copies combined, each ""part"" represents 88,000 / 11 = 8,000 copies.

Harald sold one part, so he sold 8,000 copies.

"
"Let's break this down. Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald, meaning Gerald originally took 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.

A 10% improvement on Gerald's time is 40 seconds * 0.10 = 4 seconds.

That means Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  If there are 60 dogs and twice as many cats, that's 60 * 2 = 120 cats.  So there are 60 + 120 = 180 dogs and cats altogether.

The problem says there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, meaning there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Finally, to find the total number of pets, we add up all three: 168 rabbits + 180 dogs and cats = 348 pets.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, that means there are 80 boys (2/5 * 200 = 80).  That leaves 120 girls (200 - 80 = 120).

If 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, then 80 girls are Scouts (2/3 * 120 = 80). That means 40 girls aren't in the Girl Scouts (120 - 80 = 40).

"Let's break this down. The second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, who rang it 20 times. That means the second friend rang it 20 * (1/4) = 5 more times, for a total of 25 rings.

The third friend rang it 10 more times than the fourth friend, who rang it 60 times. So the third friend rang it 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Adding up all the rings: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 rings.

"Alright, let's break this down.  Each box has walls that are 1 inch thick, so we need to figure out the space inside.  

Think of it like this: the outer measurements are 5 by 6 by 4, but we lose an inch from each side because of the walls. So, the inside of each box is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

To find the volume, we multiply those inner dimensions: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has three boxes, the total inner volume is 24 cubic inches per box times 3 boxes, which equals 72 cubic inches.

"Alright, let's break this down. Julia's boat is taking on water at a rate of 2 liters every 10 feet.  She rows at a speed of 20 feet in 16 seconds, meaning she covers 1.25 feet per second. To reach the shore, it takes her 64 seconds, so she rows a total of 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.

Since she travels 80 feet, and the boat takes on 2 liters every 10 feet, it takes on a total of 80 feet / 10 feet/intake * 2 liters/intake = 16 liters of water.

"Let's see... Sasha's got some leftover lumber she can sell.  

Those 2x4s cost her $10 each, and she's got ten of them. That's $100 right there. The 4x4s were $16 each, and she has five, so that's another $80.  

Prices went up 50%, so she can sell the 2x4s for $15 each now, making $150. The 4x4s are now worth $24 each, bringing in $120.

That's a total of $270 in sales.  Since she spent $180 to buy the lumber, her profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

"Alright, let's break this down. Katy uses sugar and water in a 7:13 ratio, meaning for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.  If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined, we need to figure out how much of that 120 is sugar.

Think of it like this: the ratio 7:13 represents 20 total parts (7 + 13 = 20).  Each of those parts is worth 120 / 20 = 6.

Since the sugar part of the ratio is 7, Katy used 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"Let's break this down.

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, meaning if Lylah earned 'x' dollars, Adrien earned 1.3x. We know Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, so 1.3x = $40,000.  Solving for x, we find Lylah earned $30,769.23 four years ago.

Fast forward four years, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, bringing his total to $40,000 + (0.40 * $40,000) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased, so she earned $30,769.23 + (0.30 * $30,769.23) = $40,000 four years later.

Adding their salaries together, Adrien and Lylah earned a combined $56,000 + $40,000 = $96,000 four years later.

"Let's break this down. Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. Then she slept 2 hours less each of the next two days, so that's 8 - 2 = 6 hours each night. That's a total of 6 + 6 = 12 hours for those two days.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, meaning she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each night.  Since there are 4 more days left in the week, that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Adding up all the hours, Sadie slept a total of 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Rosie runs fast at first, then slows down.  

She covers 10 miles every hour for 3 hours, so that's 10 * 3 = 30 miles.

She has 7 hours total, and already used 3, leaving 7 - 3 = 4 hours.

Now she's running slower, 5 miles each hour, so in those 4 hours she runs 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

Add up the two parts: 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles.

So Rosie can run a total of 50 miles.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, so that's 3 * $15 = $45.

An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so it's $45 - $5 = $40.

Dillon's buying 4 watermelons at $45 each, so that's 4 * $45 = $180.

He's also getting 20 peppers at $15 each, which is 20 * $15 = $300.

And finally, 10 oranges at $40 each will cost him 10 * $40 = $400.

Adding it all up: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

So the total Dillon spends is $880.

Imagine the queen bees as a single unit. Then there are two units of baby bees, and four units of worker bees. That's a total of seven units.

Since there are 700 bees in total, each unit must represent 700 / 7 = 100 bees.

"Well, let's see. John has a lot of pineapples!  He's got 10 hectares, and each one of those holds 100 pineapples. That's 1000 pineapples every time he harvests. And since he harvests every 3 months, he gets to do that 4 times a year. So, in total, he can harvest 4000 pineapples in a year.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

The bigger set has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. The smallest set has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

In total, Johnny picks up 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 Lego pieces.

"Let's break this down.  

First, 15 bees returned after the first six hours (half of the 30 that left). Then, 60 more bees flew out (twice the original 30). That means a total of 90 bees left the hive during the day. Since all the bees that left eventually returned, 90 bees came back in the last six hours.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

First, we need to know how long it takes each of them to get home. Steve has to go 3 miles, which is 15,840 feet (3 times 5,280). He bikes at 440 feet per minute, so it takes him 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.

Tim only has to go 2 miles, or 10,560 feet. He skateboards at 264 feet per minute, so it takes him 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

That means Steve gets home 4 minutes before Tim. 



"
"Let's break it down:

* Shawnda inflated 10 tires from bicycles (5 bikes * 2 tires each).
* She inflated 9 tires from tricycles (3 trikes * 3 tires each).
* And 1 tire from the unicycle.

That's a total of 20 tires!

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, she made 20 * $0.25 = $5.00. 


$5.00
"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Carl has 60 cookies in total (10 packs * 6 cookies/pack). That means they cost $6.00 (60 cookies * $0.10/cookie). If he pays with a ten dollar bill, his change is $4.00 ($10.00 - $6.00).

"
"Let's break this down like a true detective!

The seagull ate half of Dave's 14 fries, so that's 14 / 2 = 7 fries.

That means there were 14 + 7 = 21 fries left.

Those pesky pigeons ate 3 fries each, for a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.

So, there were 21 - 9 = 12 fries left before the raccoon showed up.

The raccoon was greedy and took two-thirds of those, which is (2/3) * 12 = 8 fries.

That leaves 12 - 8 = 4 fries.

Finally, the ants took one, leaving 4 + 1 = 5 fries.

Working backwards, we can see there were originally 5 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 14 = 43 fries in the pack! 



"
"Let's break this down. Kimo has 9 hours of class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays combined. He has 8 hours of class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. That's a total of 17 hours per week. Over a 16-week semester, he'll spend 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours in class.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Bill makes a lot of yummy treats!  First, we need to find the total length of each type of baked good. The rolls are 4 inches each, so 300 rolls are 300 * 4 = 1200 inches long. The croissants are 6 inches each, so 120 of them make 120 * 6 = 720 inches. The baguettes are tricky because they're two feet long. That's 2 * 12 = 24 inches per baguette. So 60 baguettes are 60 * 24 = 1440 inches long.

Now, let's add up all the lengths: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

Finally, we need to convert that to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 3360 inches is equal to 3360 / 12 = 280 feet.

So the answer is 280. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. The monkeys eat 200 bananas a month, the gorillas eat 400, and the baboons eat 100. That's a total of 700 bananas each month.  Since he needs enough for two months, he'll need 700 x 2 = 1400 bananas.

"Alright, let's figure this out. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field, so he covers 1500 yards. Kelly runs back and forth once for 100 yards, then does 34 trips to the 40-yard line and back, which is 34 times 80 yards, or 2720 yards.  That means she runs a total of 2820 yards. Kelly wins by 1320 yards!

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Raphael spent. 

He bought 4 pens at $1.50 each, so that's 4 * $1.50 = $6.00.

He also got 2 notebooks at $4.00 each, which is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

And finally, the bond paper cost $20.00.

Adding it all up: $6.00 + $8.00 + $20.00 = $34.00

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

On Tuesday, the tank had 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet of water.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Anakin caught a bunch of sea creatures: 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. That's 19 in total. Locsin caught 5 starfish (5 less than Anakin), 3 seahorses (3 less than Anakin), and 5 clownfish (2 more than Anakin). That makes 13 for Locsin.  

Together, they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish!

"
"Alright, let's break this down. The price goes up by 20% every two months, so over 36 months, that's 18 price increases.  Each increase is $4 ($20 x 0.20 = $4).  So, after 18 increases, the price will have gone up by $72 ($4 x 18 = $72).

Adding that to the original price, a bag of marbles would cost $92 after 36 months.

"Hey there! Let's see how much money Elvira has left for clothes. 

Her computer setup costs €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Sandra needs 45 eggs in total (15 flans * 3 eggs per flan). Since she gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, she'll need to babysit 5 times (45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting session = 5 sessions).

"
"Let's break this problem down.  If Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can say Seth's age is represented by 2*b (where 'b' is Brooke's age).

In two years, Seth will be 2*b + 2 years old, and Brooke will be b + 2 years old.  We know that the sum of their ages in two years will be 28, so:

(2*b + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Combining like terms, we get:

3b + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

3b = 24

Dividing both sides by 3:

b = 8

So Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If Ethel has $8, and Jimmy has $2 more than twice that amount, we need to do a little math. Twice Ethel's money is $8 * 2 = $16.  Then, add the extra $2 Jimmy has: $16 + $2 = $18.

So Jimmy has $18.

"
"Hey there! Let's break down the cost of these uniforms.

The jacket costs three times the price of the hat, which is $25. So the jacket is $25 * 3 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket prices. That means they cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Adding up the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants, we get $25 + $75 + $50 = $150 for each uniform.

"Well, let's see... 80 spiders with 8 legs each means there are 80 * 8 = 640 spider legs.  Then there are 90 insects with 6 legs each, so that's 90 * 6 = 540 insect legs. And finally, those 3 mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each add another 3 * 10 = 30 legs.  Adding all those up, we get 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

"Let's break this down. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age, so Sally Four is also 8. Granny Red is twice Sally Four's age, meaning she's 8 * 2 = 16 years old. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so she's 16 + 3 = 19.  

Adding up their ages, we get 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51.

"
"Let's break this down. If Jan is 30, two years ago she was 28.  Half of Jan's age two years ago was 14. Mark was 5 years older than that, making him 19 two years ago. That means Mark is currently 21. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, she is 23.

"Alright, let's break this down. The faster team runs each lap in 55 seconds, so their total time is 55 seconds/lap * 4 laps = 220 seconds.

The other team's first runner takes 60 seconds.  Each of the next runners is 3 seconds faster, so they run in 57, 54, and 51 seconds respectively. That means their total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The faster team wins by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

There are three numbers on a standard die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6), so the chance of rolling one of those is 3 out of 6, or 50%.

To get two even numbers in a row, you need to roll an even number, then another even number. Each of those has a 50% chance, so the chance of both happening is 50% times 50%, which is 25%.

That means rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely.

"Let's break this down.  We know 160 pieces of straw were used in total. The hamsters used 50 pieces (10 hamsters * 5 pieces each) and the rabbits used 20 pieces. That leaves 90 pieces for the rats (160 - 50 - 20 = 90).

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, there must be 15 rats (90 / 6 = 15).  

Because the rats are in 3 cages, there are 5 rats per cage (15 / 3 = 5).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, they spent $20.25 on tickets and $4.50 less on food, so food cost $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Then, those two rides cost $33 each, for a total of $33 x 2 = $66.

Adding it all up, their total spending was $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Finally, splitting that evenly means each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34. 



"
"Hey there!  Let's see... John collects peaches for 3 hours, and he gets 2 peaches every minute.  That's 3 hours times 60 minutes per hour, which is 180 minutes total.  So he collects 180 minutes times 2 peaches per minute, which equals 360 peaches!

"Let's break this down. Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 more each year, so after 10 years he's planted 100 more trees (10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees).  But he also chops down 2 trees each year, so over 10 years he's chopped down 20 trees (2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees).

That means his net increase in trees is 80 (100 trees - 20 trees). Adding that to his starting amount, he has 130 trees after 10 years (50 trees + 80 trees = 130 trees).

Finally, 30% of those trees die, which is 39 trees (130 trees * 0.30 = 39 trees).  

That leaves him with 91 trees (130 trees - 39 trees = 91 trees).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Elaine started with 20 cards. In the first month, she tripled that, so she got 20 * 3 = 60 more cards. That brings her total to 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In the second month, she got 20 fewer than the first month, meaning she got 60 - 20 = 40 cards. Now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

The third month is a bit trickier. She got twice the amount from the first two months combined, which is 60 + 40 = 100 cards.  Twice that is 100 * 2 = 200 cards.

Finally, add up all the cards: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

"Let's break this down. Mark edits 1000 sentences a week, splitting them evenly between two publishers. That means he edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so he earns 500 sentences * $0.05/sentence = $25.00 from them.

Publisher B pays double Publisher A's rate, which is $0.10 per sentence.  So, he earns 500 sentences * $0.10/sentence = $50.00 from Publisher B.

In total, Mark makes $25.00 + $50.00 = $75.00 per week.

Converting that to cents, he makes 7500 cents.

"Let's break this down.  

We know Jerry gets 42 eggs a day total.  The white chickens lay more eggs, so let's figure out how many of each he has.

If we say he has 'r' red chickens, he must have 'r + 2' white chickens.

Each red chicken lays 3 eggs, so they lay a total of 3r eggs.

Each white chicken lays 5 eggs, so they lay a total of 5(r + 2) eggs.

That means 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Let's solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4



Jerry has 4 red chickens.

* Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the water of the small pool.
* Now, the big pool has four times the water of the small pool.

This means the big pool lost water faster than the small pool in those four minutes.  

Let's say the small pool has 'x' gallons of water now. That means the big pool has 4x gallons now.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons, and the small pool had x + 16 gallons (since it lost 16 gallons in those four minutes).

We know that 2x + 16 (the big pool's water four minutes ago) is equal to 4x (the big pool's water now).

Solving for x, we get:

2x + 16 = 4x
16 = 2x
x = 8


The small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Janeth owes $2000 plus 10% interest, which is $200. That means she owes a total of $2200.

If she pays $165 each month for 12 months, she'll pay a total of $165 * 12 = $1980.

Subtracting that from the total she owes, we get $2200 - $1980 = $220.

So, Janeth will have a remaining balance of $220.

"
"Well, let's break this down. Harriet is 21 now, and Adrian is three times her age, making him 63. Zack is twice Harriet's age, so he's 42.

In three years, Harriet will be 24, Adrian will be 66, and Zack will be 45.  Adding those up gives us a total age of 135.  Dividing by 3, we find their average age in three years will be 45.

"
"Let's break this down.  Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, so he scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Together, Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.  That means Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, James has 32 water type cards left (40 - 8). Then, he'll have 34 grass type cards (20 + 14). That means he has a total of 96 cards (30 + 34 + 32).

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type, we divide the number of water cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100%: (32 / 96) * 100% = 33.33%.

Rounding to the nearest integer, the chance is 33%.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Chad owes.

His burrito starts at $6.50. Then he adds $2.00 for meat, $1.00 for cheese, $1.00 for avocado, and $0.50 for two sauces (at $0.25 each). That brings his total to $11.00.

Adding the $3.00 meal upgrade for chips and a drink makes it $14.00.

But wait! He has a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract that.

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Mark buys 12 cars at $20,000 each, so that's 12 * $20,000 = $240,000. Then he has to pay 10% tax on that, which is $240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000.  Adding that to the car cost, it's $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000.  But wait, there's more! He also pays $1000 to register each car, so that's another 12 * $1000 = $12,000.  

In total, Mark pays $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000 for everything.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

So, her makeup costs $250 an hour, and it takes 6 hours a day, four days a week. That's $250 * 6 = $1500 per day, and $1500 * 4 = $6000 per week.

The movie lasts for 5 weeks, so that's $6000 * 5 = $30,000. But wait, there's a 10% discount! That means she saves $30000 * 0.10 = $3000.

In the end, Jean pays $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

"Let's break this down. Last night, Rick was a busy hunter! He took down 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today, he was even more successful. He killed three times as many wolves as cougars, which means he bagged 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.  He also killed three fewer cougars than yesterday, so that's 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

In total, Rick killed 10 + 36 = 46 wolves and 15 + 12 = 27 cougars. That's a grand total of 46 + 27 = 73 animals.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

So, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, that's 200 cows total. Then Mr. Sylas adds 40 more cows. Now there are 240 cows. He puts those new cows in all 20 stalls evenly, so each stall gets 12 cows (240 cows / 20 stalls = 12 cows/stall).

If we want to know how many cows are in 8 stalls, we just multiply: 8 stalls * 12 cows/stall = 96 cows.

"Alright, let's break this down. Andrea has 52 apples, and that's 8 more than Jamal. So Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which is 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

In total, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

Adding those together, they have a grand total of 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, we need to figure out how much the brokerage fee is. That's 5% of $350,000, which is $17,500.

Then, the transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which comes out to $42,000.

Now, let's add everything up: $350,000 (selling price) + $17,500 (brokerage) + $42,000 (transfer) = $409,500.

Finally, we see how much that is over Mrs. Cruz's budget: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

So the house is $9,500 more than her budget. 



"
"Hey there! Let's break down Mr. Tan's house sale.

Finally, to find his net proceeds, we subtract his expenses from the selling price: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.


$118,000 

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  It takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees, and then another 40% of that time to get to 400 degrees.  So that's 20 minutes times 0.40, which is 8 more minutes.  

That means it takes 28 minutes total to heat the oil.  Then, cooking takes 5 minutes less than that, so 23 minutes.

Adding the heating time and cooking time, we get 28 minutes + 23 minutes = 51 minutes.

"Let's break this down. The collar takes 1/10th the stitches of the body, which is 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches. The rosette takes twice the collar's stitches, so that's 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches.  

Together, the body, collar, and rosette use 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches. Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, each sleeve must use (1800 - 1170) / 2 = 315 stitches.

"Let's break this down.  Carly starts with 80 cards.  Two-fifths of them have an A, so that's 32 cards (80 * 2/5 = 32). That leaves 48 cards (80 - 32 = 48).

Half of the remaining cards have a B, which is 24 cards (48 * 1/2 = 24). That leaves 24 cards (48 - 24 = 24).

Five-eighths of those have a C, which is 15 cards (24 * 5/8 = 15).

That means 9 cards have a D (24 - 15 = 9).

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Matthew needs 3 minutes per small hole and he's digging 30 of those, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 minutes. For the large holes, it's 10 minutes each and he's doing 15, so that's 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.  

In total, that's 90 + 150 = 240 minutes of digging.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is equal to 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

"Hey there!  

If their ages add up to 20 now, in 10 years they'll both be 10 years older. That means their combined age will be 20 + 20 = 40.

"
"Hey there! This is a classic age word problem. Let's break it down.

Let's say Sam is ""s"" years old now. That means Ruby is 6 times Sam's age, or 6s years old.

In 9 years, Sam will be s + 9 years old, and Ruby will be 6s + 9 years old.  We know that in 9 years, Ruby will be three times Sam's age, so:

6s + 9 = 3(s + 9)

Let's solve for ""s"":

6s + 9 = 3s + 27
3s = 18
s = 6

So Sam is currently 6 years old.

So, Maddy's got 12 team members, and each brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.  Add in the 3 coaches, and we have a total of 12 + 24 + 3 = 39 people to feed.

Since each pizza feeds 3 people, Maddy needs 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

If each pizza costs $15, the total cost will be 13 * $15 = $195.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Kelly has 5 quarters, which is 5 * 25 cents = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is 2 * 10 cents = 20 cents.  That means she has a total of 125 + 20 = 145 cents. After buying the pop for 55 cents, she'll have 145 - 55 = 90 cents left.

"
"Let's see... 76 stars total, and we know some are in rows of 8 and 6.  Three rows of 8 is 24 stars, and two rows of 6 is 12 more. That's 36 stars used up.  That leaves 40 stars for the rows of 5.  So, there must be 8 rows of 5 stars.

"
"Well, let's see. Each truck can carry 2000 pounds, and each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.  That means one truck can carry 2000 / 75 = 26.67 flagstones. Since we can't have a fraction of a truck, each truck can carry 26 flagstones.  They need to move 80 flagstones, so they'll need 80 / 26 = 3.08 trucks.  You can't have part of a truck, so they'll need 4 trucks.

"
"Well, let's see. The car in the fast lane is zipping along at 60 miles per hour, while the car in the slow lane is cruising at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.  If the fast car covers 480 miles, the slower car would take twice as long to cover the same distance.  

So, the slow car would take 16 hours. 



"
"Let's see... Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less, so Izzy has 17. Together they have 39 medals.  Since they have 10 times fewer medals than the total given out, there must have been 39 x 10 = 390 medals given out in total.

"
"Hey there! Let me see... 4 adults get 6 chocolate bars each, so that's 4 * 6 = 24 bars. That leaves 40 - 24 = 16 bars for the 8 children.  If they share equally, each child gets 16 / 8 = 2 bars.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Susan works for three hours, but takes a 30-minute break, leaving her with 2.5 hours of actual work time.  That's 150 minutes. Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, she makes $75 in total.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Mike has 21 points, Jim has 3 less than Mike, so he has 18 points. Tony has twice as many points as Mike, meaning he has 42 points.  

In the fourth round, both Mike and Tony get an extra point because they have over 20 points.  

So, let's add up their total points: 21 + 18 + 42 + 1 + 1 = 83 points.

"Alright, let's break this down. On the first day, Darren does 100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170 exercises.

On the second day, he does 120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = 200 exercises.

In total, over the two days, he does 170 + 200 = 370 exercises.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal and they eat twice a day, that's 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg of rice per person per day.

With 5 people, that's a total of 5 people * 0.4 kg/person = 2 kg of rice eaten each day.

A 42 kg bag will last 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days.

That's 21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks.

"
"Let's break this down. Three other people bid, and each bid raises the price by $50. That's a total increase of $150.  Since Carmen wins after those bids, she pays the starting price plus the increase: $200 + $150 = $350.

"
"Let's figure this out. John drives 60 miles each day (30 miles to work and 30 miles back). That's 300 miles a week (60 miles/day * 5 days/week) and a whopping 15,000 miles a year (300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year).

At $2 per mile, that's $30,000 just for mileage.  Don't forget the $150 monthly bonus for his driver, which adds up to $1,800 a year ($150/month * 12 months/year).

Adding those together, John pays $31,800 a year for his driving service.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Peter wants to exercise twice as long on Tuesday as he did on Sunday and Monday combined.  Sunday was 23 minutes and Monday was 16 minutes, so that's 23 + 16 = 39 minutes total. To double that for Tuesday, he needs to exercise for 39 * 2 = 78 minutes.

"Well, think about it. You're folding a single sheet of paper in half. That creates four sides, right?  You can print on both sides of the paper, so that gives you eight potential pages.  Since a 32-page tabloid is just a bunch of these folded sections put together, you only need one piece of paper to start with. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Annika started with $50, spent $25 on food, and then another $10 on rides. That means she spent a total of $35.  If she started with $50 and spent $35, she has $15 left.

"
"Let's break this down. Elise sold 45 books this year and has 50 left, meaning she sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in the first two years. Since she sold twice as many in the first year compared to this year, she sold 200 - 45 = 155 books in the first year.  That means she sold 155 - 45 = 110 books in the second year.  

At $20 per book, her earnings in the second year were 110 * $20 = $2200.


$2200 

"
"Let's break down Watson's earnings. He makes $10 an hour for a 10-hour shift, so that's $100 per day. Over five days, he earns $500.

"
"Let's break this down. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, meaning he loses 2 pounds per week (8 / 4 = 2). Sandy wants to lose the same amount as Joey, but it takes her 4 weeks to lose what Joey loses in one.  

So, it will take Sandy **4** weeks. 

"
"Hey there! Let's see... you save $2 on each tub of ice cream, so that's $4 for two tubs.  And you save $0.50 on each packet of milk, so that's $2 for four packets.  In total, you'd save $6.

"
"Let's figure this out. Theo's suits cost him 6 * $100 = $600. His suitcases cost 3 * $50 = $150.  His flight ticket is a bit trickier: 5 times the cost of a suit is 5 * $100 = $500, and $700 more than that is $500 + $700 = $1200.

So far, he's spent $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

He started with $6000 and wants to save $2000, leaving him with $6000 - $2000 = $4050 for expenses and gifts.

That means he has $4050 - $1950 = $2050 left for gifts.

"
"Well, let's break this down.  If we call the number of players on defense ""d"", we know there are twice as many on offense, so that's 2*d*.  Special teams has half the number of players as defense, which is *d*/2.

If we add all those up, it should equal the total number of players:  2*d* + *d* + *d*/2 = 105

Combining like terms, we get 3.5*d* = 105.

Dividing both sides by 3.5, we find that *d* = 30. 

So there are **30** players on defense. 



"
"Let's see... Martha invited 2 families of 6, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 people. She also invited 3 families of 4, which is 3 * 4 = 12 more people. That's a total of 12 + 12 = 24 guests.

But 8 people got sick and couldn't come, and 8 / 4 = 2 people had other plans.  So, in total, 8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't make it.

That means 24 - 10 = 14 people showed up for the party.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, Solomon got 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to his existing 50, giving him 20 + 50 = 70 marbles.

Then, his dad gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 more marbles.

That means Solomon has a total of 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2 kgs, the total weight is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  A pool that's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep... that's a good-sized pool!  

To find the cost, we need to know how much water it holds. That's the volume.  

Volume is length times width times depth, so 6 times 4 times 5 is 120 cubic feet.

Since it costs $0.10 per cubic foot to fill, we multiply 120 by 0.10, which gives us $12.00. 


$12.00 

"
"Well, let's see... if there are 3 times as many girls as boys, that's 30 boys * 3 = 90 girls. And there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so that's 30 boys * (1/10) = 3 nongendered children.  Adding them all up, we get 30 boys + 90 girls + 3 nongendered children = 123 children in the classroom.

"
"Hey there!  

Let's break this down. If the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3, and they need 45 wires, that means each ""part"" of the ratio is worth 45 wires / 3 parts = 15. Since each pole represents one ""part"" of the ratio, they'll need 15 electric poles.

"
"Well, let's see.  There were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people. A quarter of them left, which is 10 people. That means 30 people stayed. If 22 of them are men, the rest must be women.  So, 30 - 22 = 8 women are left.

"Let's figure this out! Jam has 26 pencils total, and 2 are loose, so that means she has 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in boxes.

Together, Jam and Meg have 24 + 46 = 70 pencils. If each box holds 8 pencils, they'd need 70 / 8 = 8.75 boxes. Since you can't have part of a box, they'll need 9 boxes to hold all their pencils.

"
"Let's break this down. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes. That's a weakening of 5 cubes * 12 ml/cube = 60 ml from the ice.  Adding the 15 ml of cream brings the total weakening to 60 ml + 15 ml = 75 ml.


75 

"
"Well, let me see. If they got 7 new records and each trade gets you one new record, that means there were 7 trades.  Since each trade needs 2 old records, they must have brought in 7 trades * 2 old records/trade = 14 old records.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

We know there are 100 programmers in total, and 2/5 of them are junior programmers. That means there are 40 junior programmers (100 * 2/5 = 40).

Since each junior programmer makes $2000 a month, the company pays them a total of $80,000 (40 * $2000 = $80,000).

Senior programmers make $400 more than junior programmers, so they earn $2400 each ($2000 + $400 = $2400). With 60 senior programmers (100 - 40 = 60), the company pays them a total of $144,000 (60 * $2400 = $144,000).

Adding the salaries of both groups, the company pays a total of $224,000 per month to all its programmers ($80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000).

"Let's break this down.  We know 20 people were on the bus before the third stop.  Seven got off at the second stop, so there were 20 + 7 = 27 people before then. Eight got on at the second stop, meaning there were 27 - 8 = 19 people after the first stop. Finally, 5 people got on at the first stop, leaving 19 - 5 = 14 people who started at the terminal.

"Let's figure this out.  

For Job A, Nick makes $15 an hour times 2000 hours, which is $30,000.  But then 20% in taxes comes out, leaving him with $24,000.

Job B pays a flat $42,000, but he has to pay $6,000 in property tax first. That leaves him with $36,000. Then 10% tax on that is $3,600, so his take-home pay is $32,400.

Job B pays him $8,400 more than Job A.

"Alright, let's break this down. Maria starts with 8 shares at $8 each, so that's 8 * $8 = $64.

The stock jumps up 50%, which is like adding half its value: $8 * 0.50 = $4. So now each share is worth $8 + $4 = $12.

But then it drops 25% the next year. That's a decrease of $12 * 0.25 = $3.  So each share ends up at $12 - $3 = $9.

Finally, her total value is 8 shares * $9/share = $72.

"Hey there! This is a fun one. Let's see... 60 animals, twice as many chickens as cows...  

Alright, so if we think about it, the chickens and cows have to add up to 60.  Since there are twice as many chickens, we can figure out the number of cows first. If we split the animals into three equal groups, each group would have 20 animals (60 / 3 = 20). Two of those groups would be chickens, and one would be cows.

So, 20 cows * 4 legs each = 80 legs.

And 40 chickens * 2 legs each = 80 legs.

That means all together, they have 80 + 80 = 160 legs!

"Alright, let's break this down.  

The pink frog is our starting point at 50 pounds. The beetle and toad are the same, so they're also 50 pounds each. The snake is 10 pounds heavier than the frog, making it 60 pounds. The bird is 20 pounds lighter than the frog, putting it at 30 pounds.

Now, add up all the animals: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

Don't forget the container itself weighs 20 pounds, so the grand total is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.

We know those activities make up 30% of his vacation time.  If 15 hours is 30%, then his whole vacation was 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours long.

Finally, he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so he spent 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours sightseeing.

Her second job pays $5 an hour for 15 hours, so she earns $5 * 15 = $75.

In total, she earns $200 + $75 = $275 from both jobs.

Adding that to her savings, she has $275 + $80 = $355.

This means he had $2.00 * 2 = $4.00 left after buying the candy. Since candy costs $1.50 per pound, he bought $4.00 / $1.50 = 2.67 pounds of candy.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If Carver is 45 and that's 5 years less than twice his son's age, we can set up a little equation.  Twice his son's age would be 45 + 5 = 50.  So, his son is 50 / 2 = 25 years old.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  The train travels 75 miles, then 100 miles, and then 125 miles (since it's 50 less than the first two combined). That's a total of 300 miles for one round trip.  If it does that three times a day, that's 900 miles a day. To go 18,000 miles, it would take 20 days.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  John drives 200 miles to his friend's, but a detour adds 10 more miles, making it a 210-mile trip. At 70 mph, that takes him 3 hours (210 / 70 = 3).

On the way back, it's 240 miles at 80 mph, which is also 3 hours (240 / 80 = 3).

So, the whole trip took 6 hours (3 + 3 = 6).

"Let's see... there are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 of them are girls. That means there are 96 - 43 = 53 boys.  But 4 boys were absent, so there were 53 - 4 = 49 boys at school on Friday. 

49 

"
"Hey there!  Let's see... if there are twice as many boys as girls, that means there are 6 girls * 2 = 12 boys.

"Let's break this down.  

Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for fighting over sale items, so we need to figure out how many shoplifters there were first.  

The problem says four times the number kicked out for masks minus 5 equals the number of shoplifters. That means there were 3 * 4 - 5 = 7 shoplifters.

Then, 7 shoplifters * 3 = 21 people were kicked out for fighting.

In total, 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people were kicked out for those reasons.

Since 50 people were kicked out in total, that means 50 - 31 = 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

So, we've got 44 seniors getting picture frames at $20 each. That's 44 * $20 = $880.

Each frame also needs etching, which adds 20% to the cost, so that's $20 * 0.20 = $4 extra per frame.  That means etching will cost 44 * $4 = $176.

Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so that's 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, a quarter of the seniors are officers, so that's 44 / 4 = 11 officers. They each need cords that cost $12, so that's 11 * $12 = $132.

Adding it all up: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"Let's break it down:

* They sold 14 pairs on Friday.
* On Saturday, they sold double Friday's amount, so that's 14 * 2 = 28 pairs.
* Sunday, they sold half of Saturday's amount, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.
* But, 6 pairs were returned on Sunday, leaving them with 14 - 6 = 8 pairs sold.

Adding up all the days, they sold a total of 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs of shoes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Karan borrowed $3650 for five months at 10% interest, and she pays the same amount each month, here's how to find her monthly payment:

First, we need to figure out the total interest. That's calculated by multiplying the principal ($3650) by the interest rate (10%) and the time (5 months), then dividing by 100. That comes out to $1825.

Next, we add the interest to the original amount borrowed to find the total she needs to repay: $3650 + $1825 = $5475.

Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment: $5475 / 5 = $1095.


So, Karan has to pay $1095 each month. 

"
"Let's figure this out! Cho hiked a total of 14 kilometers per hour * 8 hours = 112 kilometers. Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour * 5 hours = 45 kilometers.  That means Cho hiked 112 kilometers - 45 kilometers = 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

"
"Hey there! This is a classic ratio problem.  

Let's break it down. If the ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6, that means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  

We know they have a total of 165 popsicles. To figure out how many more Sam has, we need to see how many popsicles each ""part"" of the ratio represents.

If we add the ratio parts (5 + 6 = 11), and divide the total popsicles by that sum (165 popsicles / 11 = 15 popsicles per part), we know each part is worth 15 popsicles.

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.

Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

That means Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  A quadruple batch means he needs four times the normal amount of ingredients. That's 3 cups of flour * 4 = 12 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk * 4 = 4 cups of milk.

Since flour comes in 2-cup bags, he'll need 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags of flour. Milk comes in 2-cup bottles, so he'll need 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

He needs 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

Allan starts with 40 cannolis and twice that amount in corn, which is 40 * 2 = 80 corns.

He then buys 60 more cannolis, bringing his total to 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

But he buys 40 fewer corns than his new cannoli total, meaning he gets 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Adding his new corn to his original amount, he has 80 + 60 = 140 corns.

Finally, to find the total, we add his corn and cannolis: 140 + 100 = 240.

Then he walked 1,000 more with his friend, for a total of 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.  Since he only needs 2,000 more to reach his goal, he must have taken 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

"Alright, let's break this down. 

In May, they paid 40 employees $15 an hour for a 40-hour week, so that's $15 * 40 = $600 per employee each week. Over a month, that's $600/week * 4 weeks = $2400 per employee.  So in May, they paid out $2400/employee * 40 employees = $96,000.

In June, a quarter of the employees left, meaning they had 40 * (3/4) = 30 employees left. They're still paying the same rate, so that's $2400/employee * 30 employees = $72,000 in June.

Adding those together, the company paid a total of $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000 over the two months.

* Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of his first four days' distance, which is 800 * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.
* He took a break for one day, so no kilometers there.
* In the second week, he covered 300 kilometers each day for seven days, totaling 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Cole got a deal on both pairs of jeans, so we need to figure out the original price of the jogger jeans to see how much more they cost than the tattered jeans.

The jogger jeans were $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the jogger jeans originally cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since they were on sale for $22, and he saved $6, that means the jogger jeans originally cost $22 + $6 = $28.

That means the jogger jeans originally cost the same as the tattered jeans!

"Let's break this down. Kenny wants to buy a $100 ticket and has $50 left over for spending money, meaning he made $50 from selling his cards.  Since he sells each card for $1.50, he sold 50 / 1.50 = 33.33 cards. Since he can't sell parts of cards, he sold 33 cards.

He sold 2/3 of his cards and kept 1/3, so those 33 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection. To find the total, we divide the number of cards sold by 2/3: 33 / (2/3) = 49.5.  He can't have half a card, so he must have started with 50 cards.

Now, let's add up the cost of everything: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Don't forget the 20% discount! That's $165.00 * 0.20 = $33.00 off.

Finally, subtract the discount from the original price: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

So Charlotte's final cost is $132.00.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If 15 gallons of gas are split evenly into 5 containers, each container would have 3 gallons (15 / 5 = 3). Josey needs a quarter of a container, which is 0.75 gallons (3 x 0.25 = 0.75). Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, Josey needs 6 pints of gas (0.75 x 8 = 6).

"
"Let's break this down. George had $5 and has 1% left, meaning he spent $5 - (0.01 * $5) = $4.95.  He spent $1.20 on chips (3 bags * $0.40 per bag), leaving $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 for candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.75, he bought $3.75 / $0.75 = 5 candy bars.

"
"Hey there!  Ray shared his lollipops with his friends, so first, we need to see how many he shared: 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops. Then, we divide those lollipops between his four friends: 20 / 4 = 5 lollipops each.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Rory and her mom eat two pieces, that leaves six pieces of cake. Since the whole cake weighed 20 ounces and was cut into eight equal pieces, each piece weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces.  That means the remaining cake weighs 6 pieces * 2.5 ounces/piece = 15 ounces.


15 

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  Sitti and Juris have a total of 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.  Since they're sharing with 6 friends, that's a total of 8 people.  If they split the oranges evenly, each person gets 56 / 8 = 7 oranges. 


7 

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Antoine's doubling the onions, so that's 2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.  Those onions will cost him 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00. The beef stock is $4.00.  That means his total cost is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.  Since the soup serves 6 people, each serving costs $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00. 


$2 

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and Wayne's drive is 4 minutes. Bernadette's drive is four times longer than Wayne's, meaning it takes her 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.  

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 16 minutes + 5 minutes = 21 minutes before him.


21 

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

First, we know the room is 3 yards long, which is the same as 9 feet.  

Since the area is 360 square feet, and we know the length, we can find the width: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now, to find the perimeter, we add up all the sides: 9 feet + 40 feet + 9 feet + 40 feet = 98 feet.


98 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads (20 beads) and 2 packs of clear beads (40 beads), for a total of 60 beads. Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads (60 beads) and 4 packs of red beads (80 beads), giving her 140 beads.

That means Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  The oven heats the house up 5 degrees each hour for 3 hours, so that's a total of 15 degrees warmer. That brings the temperature to 55 degrees. Then the window cools things down 2 degrees every 10 minutes, and it's open for 30 minutes, which is like three 10-minute chunks. So, it cools down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.  

That means the final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees. 


49
"
"Let's break this down.  Jon takes 40 minutes to swim, 80 minutes to bike, and 50 minutes to run, for a total of 170 minutes. James swims 10% faster than Jon, so he takes 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes to swim. James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.  

To find James's run time, we subtract his swim and bike times from his total time: 160 - 36 - 85 = 39 minutes. 


39 

"
"Let's break this down. Movie C is 1.25 hours long, which is the same as 75 minutes. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than that, so it's 80 minutes long.  Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, meaning it's 20 minutes long. 


20 

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

First, we gotta figure out how far the horse runs. It's going 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, 32 miles per hour times 0.5 hours equals 16 miles.

Now, the horse eats half a bale of hay for every mile.  That means it'll eat 16 miles times 0.5 bales per mile, which is 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so 8 bales will cost 8 times $3, which is $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, so he has a total of 6 times $5, which is $30.

Finally, to find out his change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the money he has: $30 - $24 = $6.

So the answer is $6. 



"
"Let's see... 4 dozen eggs is 48 eggs, plus the 2 loose ones makes 50 eggs total.  Each glass needs 5 eggs, so she can make 10 glasses of eggnog. If each tray holds 5 glasses, she can put out 2 trays.

"
"Let's break this down. First, we need to figure out how much each balloon cost originally. If 20 balloons cost $900, then each balloon cost $900 / 20 = $45.

After the price increase, each balloon costs $45 + $20 = $65.

Finally, to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons, we multiply the new price by the number of balloons: $65 * 170 = $11050. 


$11050
"
"Hey there!  To find the average speed, we need to think about the total distance traveled and the total time it took.  

The car went 60 mph for 2 hours, so that's 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then it went 30 mph for 1 hour, adding another 30 miles. That's a total of 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The whole trip took 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

So, the average speed is 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

"
"Let's break this down. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires worth $800 each, so those are worth 8 * $800 = $6400. She trades 3 for rubies, leaving her with 5 sapphires worth 5 * $800 = $4000.  The rubies are worth $1200 each, so her 2 rubies are worth 2 * $1200 = $2400.  In total, her jewels are worth $4000 + $2400 = $6400. 


$6400
"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Marin and Nancy eat 4 apples each per day, so together they eat 8 apples a day. Over 30 days, that's 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Each bed needs 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet of soil.

Since he has 10 beds, that's 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet total.

Each bag holds 2 cubic feet, so he'll need 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

At $12 per bag, the total cost will be 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920. 


$1920
"
"Well, let's see here.  If there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards, that means there are 15 * 0.60 = 9 more green cards.  So there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Now, the yellow cards are the same number as the red and green cards combined, which is 15 + 24 = 39 cards.

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add up all the colors: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies out of 8, and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies out of 12. That's a total of 7 spotted puppies out of 20 puppies.

To find the percentage, we do (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%.

So, 35% of all the puppies have spots.

"Let's figure this out.  

The farmer has a lot of feed to move!  First, we need to find the total weight. The sugar cubes weigh 2 pounds, the carrots weigh 48 pounds, the hay weighs 3150 pounds, and the oats weigh 1300 pounds.  Adding those all up, we get 4500 pounds of feed.

His truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, so he'll need to make 2 trips to move all the feed. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Grayson earns 2 cents per can and she drinks 3 cans a week, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 cents from cans. She gets 3 cents per bottle and drinks 5 bottles, meaning she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents from bottles.  In total, she makes 6 + 15 = 21 cents each week. Over a month with 4 weeks, she'd earn 21 * 4 = 84 cents. 

84 

"
"Let's break this down. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, who has 10. That means Toni has 10 + (0.60 * 10) = 16 plants. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so she has 16 - 7 = 9 plants.

"Let's figure this out! Miss Maria has a lot of cards.  

First, she has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 in each, so that's 6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards.

Then she has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 in each, for a total of 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards.

That means she has 150 + 200 = 350 cards altogether.

She keeps 50 for herself, leaving 350 - 50 = 300 cards for her students.

If each student gets 10 cards, she has 300 / 10 = 30 students.

"Alright, let's break this down. Each room has 2 sheets and a comforter, so that's 3 pieces right there. Then there are twice as many pillowcases as sheets, meaning 2 sheets * 2 = 4 pillowcases.  And there are twice as many towels as pillowcases, so that's 4 pillowcases * 2 = 8 towels.

In total, each room has 3 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry.

With 80 rooms, that's 15 pieces/room * 80 rooms = 1200 pieces of laundry.

"Let's figure this out!  

If we call the number of guests ""x"", here's how the costs break down:

* **Venue 1:** They want a flat $200 plus $5 per guest for food, so that's $200 + $5x.
* **Venue 2:** It's $25 per guest, so the total cost is $25x.

To find out when the costs are the same, we need to set those two expressions equal to each other:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Now we can solve for x:

$200 = $20x

x = 10 


So, Mark needs 10 guests for the two venues to cost the same. 

"
"Hey there! This is a fun one. Let's see...

If we call the number of insects Bodhi found ""B"", then David found B/2 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so she found (B/2) + 7 insects.

All together they found 43, so:

B + (B/2) + (B/2) + 7 = 43

Combining like terms:

B + B + 7 = 43

2B + 7 = 43

2B = 36

B = 18

So Bodhi found 18 insects. David found half that, or 9 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so she found 16 insects.

The farm has a total of 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Together, they have 40 animals + 80 animals = 120 animals.

"Let's break this down. Rose bought 12 onions and that's 4 times the amount Sophia bought. So Sophia bought 12 onions / 4 = 3 onions.  Rose also bought 4 potatoes, which is 4 times the amount Sophia bought. That means Sophia bought 4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato.

In total, Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and we know it takes burning 3500 calories to lose one pound. That means he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

Now, he has until July 19th, and today is December 31st.  Counting the days, that gives him about 200 days to reach his goal.

To find out his daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories per day.

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Gerald makes $30 a day and worked for a whole week, so he earned $30 * 7 = $210.  After spending $100, he has $210 - $100 = $110 left. 


$110
"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Hannah runs 8 laps at 0.25 km each, she'll run a total of 2 kilometers (8 * 0.25 = 2). Since she needs 60 ml of water per kilometer, she'll need 120 ml in total (2 * 60 = 120).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Julie starts with $500. She spends 20%, or $100, on clothes. That leaves her with $400. Then she spends 25% of that, which is another $100, on CDs.  So, Julie has $300 left. 


$300
"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If the house cost three times as much as the lot, think of it like this: the lot's price plus three times the lot's price equals the total cost.  That means 4 times the lot's price is $120,000.  So, the lot costs $30,000 ($120,000 / 4).  

Since the house cost three times the lot, the house cost $90,000 (3 * $30,000).


$90,000 

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Tara bought 8 packs of bags, and each pack has 5 bags, so that's 8 * 5 = 40 bags total. She spent $4 per bag, so her total cost was 40 * $4 = $160.

She sold each bag for $8, making her total revenue 40 * $8 = $320.  To find her profit, we subtract her costs from her revenue: $320 - $160 = $160.

So Tara made a profit of $160. 


$160
"
"Alright, let's break this down.  Joe throws a lot of punches! 

He throws 25 punches every minute, and each round is 3 minutes long.  So, in one round, he throws 25 * 3 = 75 punches.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Martha needs a lot of wool!

Each grandchild needs 2 skeins for a hat, 4 for a scarf, 12 for a sweater, 1 for mittens, and 2 for socks. That's 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 skeins per grandchild.

Since she has three grandchildren, she'll need 21 * 3 = 63 skeins of wool.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Chris is a busy guy!

* He did 12 problems on Monday.
* On Tuesday, he did 3 times that amount, so 12 * 3 = 36 problems.
* That's a total of 12 + 36 = 48 problems done.
* He started with 100, so he had 100 - 48 = 52 left.
* On Wednesday, he finished another 52 / 4 = 13 problems.
* That leaves him with 52 - 13 = 39 problems for Thursday. 

Looks like Chris still has a bit of work to do!

"
"Well, let's see. If one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means they paint 1/10 of the house each day.  With five people, they'd paint 5 times faster, so they'd paint 1/2 the house each day.  That means it would take them 2 days to paint the whole house.  Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take them a total of 48 hours.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, meaning she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 22 * 3 = 66 chairs.  Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

In total, they have 20 + 64 = 84 sofas and 22 + 66 = 88 chairs.  That means they have a grand total of 84 + 88 = 172 sofas and chairs.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

We start with 48 people on the bus. At the first stop, 8 get off, and then 40 get on (5 times the number who got off). That means there are 80 people on the bus after the first stop.

At the second stop, 21 people get off, and only 2 get on (3 times fewer than those who got off at the first stop).  

So, after the second stop, there are 61 people left on the bus. 



"
"Let's break this down. Jame is turning 27 in 5 years, so he's currently 22.  In 8 years, he'll be 30. His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age then, meaning the cousin will be 55.  Since that's in 8 years, the cousin is currently 47.  That means the cousin is 25 years older than Jame.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

Since there are two equal groups of boys and girls, there are 20 kids / 2 = 10 girls.

The boys found 60 shells each, so they brought back a total of 10 boys * 60 shells/boy = 600 shells.

The girls found 600 shells + (4 * 600 shells) = 600 shells + 2400 shells = 3000 shells.

That means each girl found 3000 shells / 10 girls = 300 shells per girl.

"Let's break this down.  If Ray swims a mile in cold water in 16 minutes, in warm water it takes him twice that time plus 2 minutes. So, that's (16 * 2) + 2 = 34 minutes per mile in warm water.

Now, for 3 miles in cold water, it would take him 16 * 3 = 48 minutes. In warm water, it would take 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

The difference is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"Alright, let's break down this grilled cheese business.  

They spend $3.00 on bread for 10 sandwiches, so that's $0.30 per sandwich. Then they spend another $30.00 on cheese and stuff for 10 sandwiches, which is $3.00 per sandwich. That means each sandwich costs them $3.30 to make.

They sell each sandwich for $7.00, so they make a profit of $3.70 per sandwich.

Selling 10 sandwiches, their total profit is $3.70 x 10 = $37.00.

Then, the total cost for two boxes is $90.00 * 2 = $180.00.

Since each box has 90 pairs of contacts, he'll have 90 pairs/box * 2 boxes = 180 pairs of contacts.

Finally, the cost per pair is $180.00 / 180 pairs = $1.00/pair.

"Let's break this down. Jill worked a total of 3 hours (2 on Saturday + 1 on Sunday). John worked 4 hours on Saturday (twice Jill's time) and 3 hours on Sunday (three times Jill's time), for a total of 7 hours.

Jill earned $30 (3 hours * $10/hour). John earned $70 (7 hours * $10/hour).  That means John earned $40 more than Jill.

"Alright, let's figure this out. Hannah burns 500 calories per hour doing aerobics, so in two hours, she burns 1000 calories.  Running burns 600 calories an hour, so that's another 600 calories. In total, she burns 1600 calories. Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 800 ml of water.

"Let's break this down.  If we think of the blue jelly beans as our starting point, we know the red jelly beans are 1% less, and the green jelly beans are 1% more.  That means for every 100 blue jelly beans, there are 99 red ones and 101 green ones.

Since there are 4500 jelly beans total, we need to figure out what number, when multiplied by 3 (for the red, blue, and green), equals 4500.  

4500 divided by 3 is 1500. So there are 1500 blue jelly beans.

That means there are 1485 red jelly beans (99% of 1500) and 1515 green jelly beans (101% of 1500).

The difference between the green and red jelly beans is 1515 - 1485 = 30.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Jared starts at 47 WPM, then goes up to 52 WPM. If he increases by another 5, he'll be at 57 WPM. To find the average, we add those three speeds together (47 + 52 + 57 = 156) and then divide by 3 (156 / 3 = 52).

So the average of his typing speeds is 52 WPM.

"Let's break this down. If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds a week, so over 5 weeks, that's a loss of 6.25 pounds. If he eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds a week, meaning a gain of 8.75 pounds over 5 weeks.  The difference between gaining 8.75 pounds and losing 6.25 pounds is 15 pounds.

"Let's break this down. If Jerry is twice as old as he was five years ago, that means his current age is double what it was then.  To figure out how old he'll be in three years, we need to know his current age.

Since he's twice as old as he was five years ago, he's gained five years plus another five years (because he's double that age now). That means he's currently 10 years old.

In three years, he'll be 13.

"Let's break this down.  We know all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  If we call the smallest angle ""x"", the other two angles are 2x and 3x.  

That means x + 2x + 3x = 180. Combining the x's, we get 6x = 180.  Dividing both sides by 6, we find that x = 30.

The largest angle is 3x, so it measures 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"Let's break this down. Patrick sold lemonade for a total of 6 hours. For the first 4 hours, he made 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50 per hour.  That's $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.00.

For the last 2 hours, he made 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00 per hour.  That's $6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.00.

In total, Patrick earned $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  If the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that's 400 / 2 = 200 sets of 725 rotations. So, his tires rotate 200 * 725 = 145,000 times each month.

Now, each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement.  That means they'll last 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months.

Finally, 72 months is equal to 72 / 12 = 6 years. 

So the answer is 6. 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Jackie uses half the shampoo per wash, she'll get twice as many washes out of the bottle. That means she'll get 120 washes * 2 = 240 washes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how much the discount is for each item. The shirt is 30% off, so the discount is $25 * 0.30 = $7.50. The shorts are also 30% off, so their discount is $35 * 0.30 = $10.50.

Now, let's find the sale prices. The shirt costs $25 - $7.50 = $17.50. The shorts cost $35 - $10.50 = $24.50.

Adding those together, the total cost is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00.

Finally, Joe started with $50 and spent $42.00, leaving him with $50 - $42.00 = $8.00.

"Let's figure this out. John's research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, meaning it lasted for 50 months total.  

For those first 5 months, he had $100,000 per month, costing him $500,000.

The remaining 45 months cost 50% more per month, so each month was $150,000. That's a total of $6,750,000 for those months.

Adding the two parts together, his total research cost was $7,250,000.

"Let's break this down. Gary does laundry twice a week, which means he does 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads of laundry per year.

Each load uses 20 gallons, so that's 104 loads * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons of water a year.

Since water costs $0.15 per gallon, his yearly cost is 2080 gallons * $0.15/gallon = $312.

* The coral was $2.00 each, and she bought 3 pieces, so that's $2.00 * 3 = $6.00.
* The fish were $0.50 each, and she bought 20, so that's $0.50 * 20 = $10.00.
* The fish food cost $2.00.

Next, we need to convert megabits per second to megabits per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.  

Therefore, Ashley's speed is 0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/hour = 72 Mb/hour.

There are 7 days in a week, and it already towed for 3, leaving 7 - 3 = 4 days.

"Hey there!  Shiela has 10 pages left to write. 



"
"Hey there!  Let's see... Mike's got a 200-page book to read in 30 days, and he wants to read 10 pages a day.  That means it'll take him 20 days to finish (200 pages / 10 pages/day = 20 days).  So, he'll be done 10 days before the deadline!

"Alright, let's break this down.  The plane itself cost James a hefty $150,000. Then, he's shelling out $5000 each month for the hangar, and double that, or $10,000, on fuel. That means his monthly expenses are $15,000. Over a whole year, that's $180,000.  Add that to the initial cost of the plane, and we're looking at a total of $330,000 for James' first year of plane ownership. 


$330000 

"
"Let's break this down. Finley cooked rice for 30 minutes. Pork took 20 minutes longer than the rice, so that's 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.  Beans took half the time it took to cook both the rice and pork combined, which is (30 + 50) / 2 = 40 minutes.

To find the total cooking time, we add up the time for each item: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"
"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

A pound of almonds costs $10, and a pound of walnuts costs $15.  

First, we figure out the cost of each mixture:

* **Mixture 1:** (1/2 pound almonds * $10/pound) + (1/3 pound walnuts * $15/pound) = $5 + $5 = $10
* **Mixture 2:** (1/5 pound almonds * $10/pound) + (1/3 pound walnuts * $15/pound) = $2 + $5 = $7

Finally, we find the difference: $10 - $7 = $3.

So the answer is $3. 



"
"Well, let's see.  If we think about it, each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2.  That means for every sheep, we have 2 extra legs compared to a goose.  Since we have 70 legs total and 20 heads, we know there are more sheep than geese.  

Let me ponder this a bit... Ah, I've got it! There are **15** sheep on Lee's farm. 



"
"Let's break this down.  The fancy coffee costs 20% more than his usual $5 bag, so that's an extra dollar, making it $6 per pound. He needs a pound a day for a week, which is 7 pounds total. That's 7 * $6 = $42 for the coffee.  Don't forget the donut!  So, in total, it cost him $42 + $2 = $44. 


$44
"
"Let's see... Gus spent $20.00 total. The chips were $4.00, the chicken was $8.00, and the soda was $1.00.  That's $13.00 altogether.  So the apple pie must have cost $7.00. 


$7.00
"
"Hey there!  Let's see... James delivers 600 newspapers total. He takes 198 to District A and 209 to District C. That means he delivers 600 - 198 - 209 = 193 newspapers to District B. 


193
"
"Let's see... 4 classes a week times 2 hours each is 8 hours of cooking class per week. Over 6 weeks, that's 8 times 6, or 48 hours total.  He learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, so he'll learn 48 divided by 1.5, which is 32 recipes. 

32 

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

If 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, that means there are 150 * 0.60 = 90 history teachers.  That leaves 150 - 90 = 60 math teachers.

Since each teacher sleeps 6 hours a day, all the math teachers together sleep for 60 * 6 = 360 hours.


360 

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

Kassidy has 3/4 the amount Aurelia has, so Kassidy has (3/4) * $120 = $90.

Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, meaning Rayna has $90 + $60 = $150.

Adding up all their money, they have a total of $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.

If they split that evenly, each person would get $360 / 3 = $120.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  A regular basketball game has four 12-minute quarters, so that's 4 * 12 = 48 minutes. Since they played an extra 5 minutes because of the tie, the whole game lasted 48 + 5 = 53 minutes. 


53 

"
"Well, let's see. If 20% of the 50 employees are in management, that's 10 people. And if only 30% of *those* folks oversee the whole company, then we're talking about 3 employees.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If they combine all their candy, they'd have 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds.  Since there are three of them, each person would get 12 / 3 = 4 pounds of candy.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Adam spent $3.50 on the type A candies and $7.50 on the type B candies, for a total of $11.00. Since he paid with $15.00, his change would be $4.00. 


$4.00
"
"Let's see... Christina had 12 good days total. She already had 8 good days, then one more good day, and then another. That's 10 good days.  So she has 2 good days left.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, and Janey has 21 books, we can set up an equation.  Let's say Sally has 'x' books. Twice the number of Sally's books is 2x, and 3 more than that is 2x + 3.  We know this equals 21, so 2x + 3 = 21.  

Subtract 3 from both sides to get 2x = 18, then divide both sides by 2 to find x = 9.

Sally has 9 books. 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to know how many inches the bamboo needs to grow. It's currently 20 feet tall, which is 240 inches (20 x 12). We want it to be 600 inches tall, so it needs to grow another 360 inches (600 - 240).

Since it grows 30 inches per day, it will take 12 days to reach 600 inches (360 / 30).

"
"Let's figure this out!

James starts with enough toys for 4 dogs, but now has 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.  That means he needs 8 more toys right away.

Then, the number of dogs doubles to 12 * 2 = 24 dogs! So he needs another 24 - 4 = 20 toys.

Finally, 3 dogs leave, so he only needs 20 - 3 = 17 toys.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Dylan put in 2/5 of the $1200, which is $480. That leaves $720. Frances then put in 2/3 of that, which is another $480.  So, Skyler must have put in the rest: $1200 - $480 - $480 = $240.

"
"Well, if 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, that means each potato makes 6 hash browns.  So with 96 potatoes, you could make a whopping 576 hash browns! 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Jack and 8 other adults are in the elevator, that's a total of 9 adults.  Since each adult weighs about 80 kg, their combined weight is 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg.

The elevator can only handle 700 kg, so they're going over by 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Katarina has 68 cookies, and that's 5 less than Max. So Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, meaning he has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, giving her 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total, we add up everyone's cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies. 


298
"
"Hey there! This is a fun problem. Let's think about it like this:

If the dress is 140cm long now, and 20cm of that is lace, then the dress itself is 140 - 20 = 120cm long after the extension.

Since the extension was 50% of the original length, that means the original length was 120cm / 1.50 = 80cm.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Since Chris mows the whole lawn in 60 minutes on turtle mode and 40 minutes on rabbit mode, half the lawn would take 30 minutes on turtle and 20 minutes on rabbit.

Adding those together, it took him 50 minutes to mow the whole lawn.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  They've already walked for 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes. That means they have 30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes left to get to school on time.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Catherine spends. 

* Apples cost $4.
* Bananas cost $2 per kilo, and she buys 2 kilos, so that's $2 * 2 = $4.
* Oranges cost $3 per kilo, and she buys 2 kilos, so that's $3 * 2 = $6.

Adding it all up: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

Catherine pays $14 in total. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Celinda bakes double Greta's amount, so she bakes 30 * 2 = 60 cookies.  Together they have 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. After snacking, they have 90 - 10 = 80 cookies left for the box.

"
"Let's break this down. We know one twin is older than one of the triplets by 7 years.  If we add up all their ages, it equals 44.  

Think of it like this: the twins are a pair, so they have the same age. The triplets are a trio, so they also have the same age.

To figure out the age of one twin, we need to think about how the ages relate to each other and how they add up to 44. 

Let me ponder this for a moment...

Aha! One of the twins is 13 years old. 



"
"Hey there! Let's see... John has 3 hours before dinner, which is 180 minutes.  He needs 20 minutes for math, 40 for reading, and 20 for history, totaling 80 minutes of homework. That means he has 180 - 80 = 100 minutes left for a nap! 


100 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we know the lollipops cost $0.40 each, and he bought five, so that's 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.

That means the candies cost $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

Since he bought four candies, each one costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, for ten lollipops, it'll be 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.

And for ten candies, it's 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

Finally, the total cost is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.


$7.00 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Neil saves 2/5 * 20 coins = 8 more coins than Rong each month. That means Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Over ten years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.


5760 

"
"Let's break this down. The vaccines cost $20 each, so that's $20 * 2 = $40. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total yet.  Let's call the total cost ""x"". We know 0.60x = the cost of the heartworm check.

Since the total bill is the cost of the vaccines plus the heartworm check, we have the equation: x = $40 + 0.60x.

Solving for x, we get: 0.40x = $40, so x = $100.

That means John's total bill is $100. Since he brought $125, he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25. 


$25 

"
"Alright, let's break down the cost of this fruit crate. 

Each banana costs twice as much as an apple, which is $0.50. So, a banana is $1.00. Oranges are the priciest at three times the cost of a banana, making them $3.00 each.

Now, let's add up the cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

Finally, we add the cost of all the fruits together: $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00


$32.00 

"
"Let's break this down.  Brittany has 14 red squares, 18 blue squares (4 more than red), 24 green squares (6 more than blue), and 12 white squares (12 fewer than green). That's a total of 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares. Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, her comforter is 68 square feet.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Mia has 8 high chairs and 5 times that many regular chairs, so she has 8 * 5 = 40 regular chairs. That's a total of 40 + 8 = 48 chairs.  But she needs enough for 42 adults and 15 babies, which is 42 + 15 = 57 people.  She needs 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs.

"
"Well, let's see. If half the deer are bucks, that's 50 deer / 2 = 25 bucks.  And if 20% of those bucks have 8 points, that's 25 bucks * 0.20 = 5 bucks. 


5 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Betty collected 30% more than Adam's 50 points, so she has 50 + (0.30 * 50) = 65 points.

Tom has 30 fewer points than Betty, putting him at 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected three times Tom's amount, meaning she has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Adding up all their points, the class has 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 - 255 = 145 more points to reach their goal.

"
"Let's see... Great Grandma Jones has 3 kids, and each of them has 3 kids, so that's 9 grandkids.  Then each of those grandkids has 3 babies, so that's 9 times 3, which is 27 great-grandbabies!

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Greta saves half her paycheck for retirement, which is $2400 / 2 = $1200. Then she spends 20% on her car, which is $2400 * 0.20 = $480.  That means she's spent a total of $1200 + $480 = $1680.  

So, she has $2400 - $1680 = $720 left over. 


$720.00

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

The city is setting off a ton of fireworks: 15 boxes times 20 fireworks per box equals 300 fireworks. Hannah can see 40% of those, so that's 300 times 0.40, which equals 120 fireworks.

Hannah's also setting off her own fireworks: 3 boxes times 5 fireworks per box equals 15 fireworks.

In total, Hannah will see 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks!

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  There are 20 people in total going to the movies. Each person gets two drinks and three snacks, so that's 40 drinks and 60 snacks altogether.  Since each drink and snack costs $2, they spent $200 on snacks and drinks. 


$200 

"
"Let's break this down. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's 4000-pound truck, so Gordy can haul 4800 pounds. Together, Gissela and Gordy can haul 8800 pounds.  That means Gary's truck must be able to haul the remaining weight: 11600 - 8800 = 2800 pounds.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down. Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of *that* is for industry. That means the remaining 20% of the city's water usage is for non-industrial stuff.  Since the city uses 40% of the total river water, they use 8% (20% of 40%) for non-industrial purposes.

"Hey there! Two weeks of tutoring would be $168.  I charge $12 a day, and there are 7 days in a week, so that's $84 per week. Double that for two weeks! 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to see how much ice cream they make per hour. For chocolate, it's 100 quarts every 2 hours, so that's 50 quarts per hour. For vanilla, it's 50 quarts every 4 hours, which means they make 12.5 quarts per hour.

Together, they make 50 + 12.5 = 62.5 quarts per hour.

Now, in 48 hours, they'd make 62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts! 


3000 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Marcus' bill. 

First, we need to find the cost of each type of pastry:

* Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00/croissant = $15.00
* Cinnamon Rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50/roll = $10.00
* Mini Quiches: 3 quiches * $4.00/quiche = $12.00
* Blueberry Muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00/muffin = $13.00

Now, let's add those up to find the subtotal: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Don't forget his loyalty card discount! 10% of $50.00 is $5.00.

Finally, subtract the discount from the subtotal: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Marcus' total bill is $45.00.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, James spent $20 to get in and then $1.50 for every pound of blueberries he picked. Since he got 30 pounds, that's 30 * $1.50 = $45 just for the blueberries.  

Adding the entry fee, his total cost was $45 + $20 = $65.

If he bought them at the store, it would have cost him $2.50 a pound, so that's 30 * $2.50 = $75.

He saved $75 - $65 = $10 by picking his own blueberries.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If each computer cost $700 and the price went up by 10%, that means each computer now costs $700 + ($700 * 0.10) = $770.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, there are 5 pizzas total, and each has 12 slices, meaning there are 60 slices altogether. Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, which is 2/3 * 12 slices/pizza * 3 pizzas = 24 slices. The other two friends ate 3/4 * 12 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 18 slices.

Adding those up, they ate a total of 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

That means there are 60 - 42 = 18 slices left.

"Let's break this problem down.  Topher's shoe is 100 inches long (8 feet is 96 inches plus 4 more inches).  We know that's 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  

So, if we subtract 10 inches from Topher's shoe size, we get 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe: 100 - 10 = 90 inches.

Finally, divide that number by 9 to find the length of Bobby's shoe: 90 / 9 = 10 inches.

* There are 64 student cars with 4 windows each, that's 64 * 4 = 256 windows.
* She smashes a quarter of those, so that's 256 / 4 = 64 windows.
* There are 32 teacher cars with 2 windows each, totaling 32 * 2 = 64 windows.
* She smashes three-quarters of those, which is 64 * (3/4) = 48 windows.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, they need enough graham crackers for 9 kids who want 2 smores each, plus 6 adults who want 1 smore each. That's 18 smores for the kids and 6 for the adults, for a total of 24 smores.

Each sleeve makes 8 smores, and there are 3 sleeves in a box. They'll need 3 sleeves to make 24 smores, which means they need 1 box.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. Dora's dad is twice her age plus eight years, so he's (15 * 2) + 8 = 38 years old. Her mom is four years younger than him, making her 38 - 4 = 34 years old.  

To find the total combined age, we add up their ages: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A, who got 20%. That means B got 20 + (50/100)*20 = 30% of the votes.  Together, A and B got 20% + 30% = 50% of the votes.  That leaves 100% - 50% = 50% of the votes for candidate C. Since there were 100 voters, candidate C got 50% of 100, which is 50 votes.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Boris starts with 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck will have 77 + 10 = 87 apples. Boris will have 100 - 10 = 90 apples left.

That means Boris has 90 - 87 = 3 more apples than Beck.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Peter uses 12 ounces for the giant cubes, 14 ounces for the medium cubes, and 4 ounces for the small cubes. That's a total of 30 ounces. Since he started with 32 ounces, he has 2 ounces left.

"
"Let's break this down. Clara has 20 books, and that's twice the number Steven has. So Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, meaning she has 10 + 6 = 16 books.  Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  A gallon jar costs $5, and a half-gallon jar costs $3.  So, 10 gallon jars would cost 10 * $5 = $50. And 16 half-gallon jars would cost 16 * $3 = $48.  Adding those together, Cecelia spent a total of $50 + $48 = $98.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If 10 students like to bake and 5 like basketball, that's 15 students total.  Then, twice the number of basketball players like music, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 music lovers.

That means 15 + 10 = 25 students like baking, basketball, or music. Since there are 50 students in total, the rest must like video games: 50 - 25 = 25.

So the answer is 25. 



"
"Well, let's see. Jeremy scared away a third of the birds, so that's 12 / 3 = 4 birds.  That leaves 12 - 4 = 8 birds. Then 20 more showed up, so there are 8 + 20 = 28 birds in the backyard now.

"Let's break this down. Candy rents out 60 chairs per day during the week, so that's 60 * 5 = 300 chairs per week. On weekends, she rents out 100 chairs per day, meaning she rents 100 * 2 = 200 chairs per weekend.  In total, she rents 300 + 200 = 500 chairs per week.

Over a month with 4 weeks, she'd rent 500 * 4 = 2000 chairs. For two months, that's 2000 * 2 = 4000 chairs.

"Let's see... Jeff started with 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 times 12, or 96 glasses. He also had 4 dozen plates, which is 4 times 12, or 48 plates.  

After the party, 10 glasses broke, leaving him with 96 - 10 = 86 glasses. And 6 plates broke, leaving him with 48 - 6 = 42 plates.

In total, Jeff now has 86 + 42 = 128 glasses and plates.

"
"Alright, let's break this sticker and button problem down. Lorraine's got a lot of trading to do!

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers, which is 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers.  Since each small sticker gets her one small button, that's 27 small buttons. She can then trade those 27 small buttons for 9 large buttons (27 / 3 = 9).

Next, she trades half of her large stickers, which is 0.50 * 40 = 20 large stickers. Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets another 20 large buttons.

She has 20 large stickers left, and each of those can be traded for 3 small buttons, giving her 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Adding it all up, Lorraine ends up with 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons. 



"

*  Nine students need large shirts because that's half the number who need medium shirts.
* Finally, 15 students need extra-large shirts because that's six more than the number who need large shirts.

Adding all those up: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts.

Krissa needs to order 75 shirts.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

We know all three houses need 250 cases total. The first house needs half the amount of the second, and the third needs double the first.  

Think of it like this: if the second house needs 'x' cases, the first needs x/2, and the third needs 2 * (x/2) which is just x.

So, x/2 + x + x = 250

That means 2.5x = 250

Divide both sides by 2.5 and you get x = 100.

The third house needs x cases, so it needs 100 cases.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Tanya made.

On Monday, she earned $15 per hour for 5 hours, which is $15 * 5 = $75. Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5, bringing her Monday total to $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she earned $15 per hour for 2 hours, which is $15 * 2 = $30.  No extra bonus for Wednesday.

"Alright, let's figure this out. Mike's got a big movie collection!

First, those series movies: 600 movies divided by 3 is 200 movies.  Since he gets a deal on those, they'll cost him 200 movies times $10 times (1/3), which is $666.67.

Now, let's look at the rest. That's 600 movies minus 200 movies, leaving us with 400 movies.  Of those, 40% are older, so that's 400 movies times 0.40, which is 160 movies. Those older ones cost $5 each, so that's 160 movies times $5, totaling $800.

That leaves 400 movies minus 160 movies, or 240 movies that are newer. Those are the full $10 each, so that's 240 movies times $10, coming to $2400.

Finally, we add it all up: $666.67 plus $800 plus $2400 equals $3866.67.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Winston spent.

Peaches cost $2.00 a pound, and he got 6 pounds, so that's $2.00 * 6 = $12.00.

Plums are $1.00 a pound, and he got 8 pounds, so that's $1.00 * 8 = $8.00.

Apricots are $3.00 a pound, and he got 6 pounds, so that's $3.00 * 6 = $18.00.

Adding it all up, he spent $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00 on fruit.

"Let's break this problem down. Bob starts with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.  He buys some more, and ends up with twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Think of it like this: if he has 'x' white fish after the purchase, he must have 2x orange fish.

We know he bought 17 fish total, so the number of orange fish he bought plus the number of white fish he bought must equal 17.

Let's use algebra!

* Let 'w' be the number of white fish Bob bought.

* Orange fish after the purchase: 3 + (17 - w) 
* White fish after the purchase: 4 + w

We know the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:

3 + (17 - w) = 2(4 + w)

Now we can solve for 'w':

3 + 17 - w = 8 + 2w
20 - w = 8 + 2w
12 = 3w
w = 4



Bob bought 4 white fish. 

"
"Let's break this down. Andy drives 10 miles each day to work and back home (5 miles there and 5 miles back). That's 50 miles in a week (10 miles/day * 5 days/week).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Kris plays for half an hour a day for two weeks, which is 14 days. That's 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours. Then she plays 2 hours a day for a week, so that's 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours. In total, she plays 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours. To get the achievement, she needs to play 30 hours, so she still needs 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 more hours.

"Let's break it down. The diamond and gold cost $600 + $300 = $900.  A 30% premium on that is $900 * 0.30 = $270.  Adding that to the original cost, James paid $900 + $270 = $1170.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

We need to figure out the total number of students who passed and divide that by the total number of students.

Third grade: 340 passed out of 500.

Fourth grade: 40 passed out of 100.

Fifth grade:  Their pass rate was double the fourth grade, so 40 * 2 = 80% passed. That means 400 * 0.80 = 320 fifth graders passed.

Now, let's add up all the students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700

Finally, divide the total who passed by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%

"
"Let's figure this out! Milo needs 12 chips per square inch, and his mosaic is 3 inches tall, so that's 12 chips/inch * 3 inches = 36 chips needed for every inch of length. He has 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips total.  That means he can make his mosaic 144 chips / 36 chips/inch = 4 inches long.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Those four students drank a total of 6 quarts (4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts). The other 16 students drank a whopping 32 quarts (16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts).

That means they drank a total of 38 quarts (6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts).

Since there are 10 quarts left, there must have been 48 quarts to start (38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts).

And since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, they started with 12 gallons of tea (48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Dale started with 100 candies, then got 100 more, so that's 200 candies total. He already sold 150, so he has 200 - 150 = 50 candies left to sell.

"
"Well, let's see. If the student body doubles every month, we need to figure out how many students there are at the end of May and then subtract the original 10.  

By the end of May, there would be 320 students. That means 310 additional students joined after the year began.

"
"Let's break this down. Felix made $105 and charges $0.25 per branch. That means he climbed $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches. If he worked 5 days, he climbed an average of 420 branches / 5 days = 84 branches per day.

"
"Let's see... Rose picked a lot of flowers!  

First, she had 3 flowers with 5 petals each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 petals.

Then she got 4 flowers with 6 petals each, for a total of 4 * 6 = 24 petals.

Next came 5 flowers with 4 petals each, adding another 5 * 4 = 20 petals.

Finally, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each, which is 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

That's a grand total of 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals!

But oh no, she dropped one of each kind of flower!  That means she lost 5 petals.

So, the flowers in the vase have 101 - 5 = 96 petals.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. They used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows for their s'mores.  Oops, they also dropped 3! That means they have 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left. Since each s'more needs one marshmallow, they can each have 14 / 2 = 7 more s'mores.

"Alright, let's break this down. Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His buddies who aren't as good only get 10 minutes per quarter, and his really good friend gets 30 minutes.  They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

So, Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

His weaker friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, and since there are two of them, that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The good friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

Adding it all up, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

That means they spend 68 * $0.25 = $17.00 at the arcade.

"Let's break this down.  Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar. She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.  

Think of it like this:

* **Zest/Fragrance:**  Let's say she uses 1 ounce of each.
* **Salt/Sugar:** Since she uses twice as much salt as zest, that's 2 ounces of each.
* **Oil:** She uses twice as much oil as salt, so that's 4 ounces.

Adding it all up: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10 ounces.

So, Tanya uses **4 ounces** of oil.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If the charity raised $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, that means the students raised $125,000 ($175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000).  Since there are 20 students, each student raised $6,250 ($125,000 / 20 = $6,250).

$6,250 

"
"Let's break this down. Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day and half that time, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours, on the second day.  That means she walked a total of 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. John does a lot of work! 

If he makes $1.20 per task and does 5 tasks per cycle, that's $1.20 * 5 = $6.00 per cycle.

He does 30 cycles a day, so he earns $6.00 * 30 = $180.00 each day.

Over a 7-day week, he makes $180.00 * 7 = $1260.00.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Kimberly bought a lot of pet food!  

She got 8 packages of cat food with 11 tins each, so that's 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

For the dog food, she bought 6 packages with 6 tins each, meaning she has 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

To find the difference, we subtract: 88 - 36 = 52.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. 



"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

We know there are 341 cards total. Let's say PJ has 'x' number of cards. Smendrick has three times that amount, so he has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

To find out how many cards Becca has, we need to figure out what 'x' is.  We know:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get: 7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7: x = 47

Now we know PJ has 47 cards.  Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards.

Finally, Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Cindy had 5 green eggs, and twice that many blue ones, so she had 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs. She had one less pink egg than blue eggs, meaning she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.  

Adding them all up, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how much the shipping will cost. It's $0.35 per pound, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so that's $0.35 * 4 = $1.40. Then, it's $0.08 per mile, and it's 20 miles away, so that's $0.08 * 20 = $1.60.  Add those together, and shipping is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Now, Amazon will only give Milly back 75% of the book's price, which is $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.

Finally, to find out how much Milly loses, we subtract the refund and the shipping from the original price: $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.00.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Mulan starts with $40 and gets $100 from her dad, so she has $140.  The jeans cost $60 (2 pairs x $30), and the bag is $20, for a total of $80 spent. That means Mulan has $60 left.

"
"Let's figure this out! Boris makes 8000 bars in the first week. In the second week, he makes half of that, which is 4000 bars. In the third week, he makes three times the amount from the first week, so that's 8000 * 3 = 24000 bars.

That means in the first three weeks, he makes a total of 8000 + 4000 + 24000 = 36000 bars.

To reach his goal of 50000 bars for the month, he needs to make 50000 - 36000 = 14000 bars in the fourth week.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Britany makes a lot of TikToks! 

First, her videos take up 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes each week.

Then there's the songwriting, which is 2 hours a week, or 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

And don't forget the makeup! That's 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.

So, in total, she spends 72 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 282 minutes on TikTok each week.

Over a month, that's 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 1128 minutes.

Finally, let's convert that to hours: 1128 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 18.8 hours.

"Let's break this down step by step.

If Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, and Pompei can lift 1 inch, then Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, meaning Kagiyami can lift 12 * 4 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 48 * 10 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If each glue stick starts at 12 millimeters, we need to find out how much is left over from each one and then add those amounts together.

* The first glue stick has 5/6 left, so that's (5/6) * 12 mm = 10 mm unused.
* The second glue stick has 1/3 left, so that's (1/3) * 12 mm = 4 mm unused.
* The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so that's (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm unused.

Adding those up, we get 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

Gabriel needs $10,000 for the car and $800 for the phone, so that's a total of $10,800. He already has $5,000 from his job and $200 from his brother, giving him $5,200.

To find out how much more he needs, we subtract: $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

Looks like Gabriel still needs $5,600.

"Alright, let's break this down. Jack has 60 dishes, and that's twice the number of socks he has, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks. Peter, on the other hand, has twice as many socks as Jack, meaning he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.  Peter also has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Adding up all the socks, Peter and Jack have 60 + 30 = 90 socks.  And for dishes, they have 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.

In total, they have 90 socks + 90 dishes = 180 socks and dishes.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month and spends $2640 a year, we need to find out how much each pair costs.

First, we know he buys 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs of shoes a year.

"Let me see...  I'm three years younger than my brother, so if I'm *x* years old, he's *x + 3*. I'm two years older than my sister, making her *x - 2*. Mom's age is tricky - it's one less than three times my brother's age, so that's *3(x + 3) - 1*.

If we add all our ages together, it equals 87.  So, *x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87*.

Let's simplify that: *x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87*

Combining like terms: *6x + 9 = 87*

Subtract 9 from both sides: *6x = 78*

Divide both sides by 6: *x = 13*

So, I'm 13 years old!

"Let's break this down. Claire earns 1 badge a month. Amber takes twice as long, meaning she earns a badge every 2 months, so in a year she'd have 12 months / 2 months/badge = 6 badges. Wendy earns three times Claire's amount, so she gets 1 badge/month * 3 = 3 badges a month, totaling 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges in a year.  That means Wendy earns 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 more badges than Amber.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

We know the three friends have a total of 85 books. Let's think about how many books each has:

* **Fawn:** We'll call the number of books Fawn has ""F"".
* **Anne:** Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so she has F - 12 books.
* **Sofie:** Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, meaning she has (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 books.

Now, let's add up all the books: F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Combining like terms, we get 3F + 1 = 85

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we have 3F = 84

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find F = 28.

So, Fawn has 28 books.

Greg needs enough jello for 30 kids to have 4 cups each, so that's 30 * 4 = 120 jello cups.

If each box costs $1.25, then 12 boxes will cost 12 * $1.25 = $15.00.

"Let's break this down. If Madeline pays 60% of the $400 grocery bill, that means Keenan pays the remaining 40%.  

Keenan's share is 40/100 * $400 = $160 per month.

Since there are four weeks in a month, Keenan spends $160 / 4 = $40 per week on groceries.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Tobias is really hungry!

* On the first day, he demolished 2/5 of the pizza, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 pieces.
* Then he ate another 10 pieces on day two.
* That leaves 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces for day three.
* On day three, he eats 7/13 of those, which is (7/13) * 26 = 14 pieces.

Adding it all up, Tobias has eaten a whopping 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces of pizza!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If 7 sodas cost $21, then one soda costs $3 ($21 / 7 = $3).  

And if 4 waters cost $8, then one water costs $2 ($8 / 4 = $2).

So, 3 sodas would cost $9 (3 x $3 = $9) and 2 waters would cost $4 (2 x $2 = $4).

In total, that's $13 ($9 + $4 = $13).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  David starts with $12.48 and each bolt costs $0.03.  If he buys 16 bolts, that's 16 * $0.03 = $0.48 spent on bolts.  

Taking that away from his starting amount, David has $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00 left.

"Alright, let's break this down. Amy's got a good handle on her history! 

She nails 80% of the multiple-choice, which means she gets 10 questions * 0.80 = 8 of them right. Those are worth 1 point each, so that's 8 points.

For the true/false, she's at 90%, so she gets 20 questions * 0.90 = 18 correct.  Another point each, so that's 18 points.

The long answer is trickier, but she still gets 60%, meaning 5 questions * 0.60 = 3 correct. Those are worth 5 points a pop, for a total of 15 points.

Adding it all up: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points. 

Not bad, Amy!

"
"Let's break this down. Isaias wants to make a $2000 profit, and he's selling each chicken for $50.  He's selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is 180 chickens. That means he'll earn 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.

To figure out how much he paid for the chickens, we subtract his desired profit from his total earnings: $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much money Kelly has left.

First, each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each chicken pack costs $10 / 5 * 2 = $4.

That means 6 packs of chicken cost $4 * 6 = $24.

Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so they cost $4 / 2 = $2 each.

Seven packs of apples cost $2 * 7 = $14.

Three packs of strawberries cost $4 * 3 = $12.

Adding up all the costs, Kelly's total is $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Since Kelly has a budget of $65, she has $65 - $60 = $5 left.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual ones plus a 15-minute encore, and the whole thing is 65 minutes, we can work backwards.  

First, take away the encore: 65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes.

That 50 minutes is double the length of a regular concert. So, divide that in half: 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If Mrs. Smith has 100 plants and a quarter are indoors, that's 25 indoor plants (100 / 4 = 25). That leaves 75 plants (100 - 25 = 75).

Two-thirds of those are outdoor plants, so that's 50 outdoor plants (75 x (2/3) = 50).

That means the rest, 25 plants, must be flowering plants (75 - 50 = 25).

So, 25 out of 100 plants are flowering plants, which is 25%.

"Well, let's see here.  The whatchamacallit is a speedy one at 121 meters per second, and it spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob. That means the thingamabob is spinning at 121 meters per second divided by 11, which is 11 meters per second. Now, the whirligig is a real speed demon, spinning 5 times faster than the thingamabob. So, the whirligig is going 11 meters per second times 5, which equals 55 meters per second.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Colby's got $150 for movies this month. He already spent some on tickets and snacks, so we gotta see how much he has left.

He saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays at $10 each, so that's 5 * $10 = $50.

He saw 8 movies on other days at $7 each, so that's 8 * $7 = $56.

He bought 2 popcorns at $8 each, so that's 2 * $8 = $16.

And he got 4 boxes of candy at $2 each, so that's 4 * $2 = $8.

Adding all that up, he spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

That leaves him with $150 - $130 = $20.

Tonight's a Friday, and a movie, popcorn, and candy will cost him $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

Looks like he can see just **1** more movie tonight! 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to find out how many calories are in each mini pastry. A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a regular one, so that's 600 calories / 3 = 200 calories. A mini blueberry muffin has 450 calories / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories for each type of pastry. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so that's 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories. He baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, which is 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we add up the calories from both types: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

So, all the pastries Andrew baked have a total of 85,000 calories.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice the amount she did on Monday, which is 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs each day. That's 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs for those two days.

Adding up all the Junebugs she removed, we get 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs.

"Let's break this down.  

We know Peter, Paul, and Jean's ages add up to 100. Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is the same as Paul's age plus John's age.

To find Peter's age, we can think of it like this:

*  Let's say John is ""J"" years old.
*  Paul is 10 years older than John, so Paul is ""J + 10"" years old.
*  Peter's age is Paul's age plus John's age, so Peter is ""J + (J + 10)"" years old, which simplifies to ""2J + 10"".

Now, we know that Peter's age (2J + 10) plus Paul's age (J + 10) plus John's age (J) equals 100.

Let's put it all together:

2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100

Combining like terms: 4J + 20 = 100

Subtracting 20 from both sides: 4J = 80

Dividing both sides by 4: J = 20

So, John is 20 years old.

Now we can find Peter's age:

Peter = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 50



Peter is 50 years old.

"Alright, let's break this down. The Widgeteer 3000 churns out 60 widgets an hour, while the WidgetMaster 9000 manages 45.  Each widget sells for $6, and we're running these bad boys 24/7 for a whole month (30 days).

The Widgeteer 3000 will make 1440 widgets a day (60 x 24) and a whopping 43,200 widgets a month (1440 x 30). That's $259,200 in cold, hard cash (43,200 x $6).

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 1080 widgets a day (45 x 24) and 32,400 a month (1080 x 30). That brings in $194,400 (32,400 x $6).

In total, they spelled 300 + 350 = 650 letters.

"
"Hey there!  Let's see... 8 children in a row, 7 rows for each school, and 5 schools... that's a lot of kids!

If each school has 8 * 7 = 56 children, and there are 5 schools, then there are 56 * 5 = 280 children in total. 


280 

"
"Hey there! Let me see... the teacher has 9 coupons for 100 bottles each, so that's 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.  She gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles, meaning she gives out 29 * 2 = 58 bottles. That leaves 900 - 58 = 842 bottles for her. 

842 

"
"Let's break down the cost:

* **Labor:** 2.25 hours * $35/hour = $78.75
* **Total:** $40 (visit) + $78.75 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $178.75

Patty charged $178.75. 

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, James spent 10 CDs * $15/CD = $150 on the CDs.

Then, he got a sweet 40% discount, so he saved $150 * 0.40 = $60.

That means he paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He sold 5 of them for $40 each, making him $5 * $40 = $200.

So, in the end, he had $200 - $90 = $110. 


$110
"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Jen will earn. 

She'll make $9 from the yams (6 yams * $1.50 each), $20 from the sweet potatoes (10 sweet potatoes * $2 each), and $5 from the carrots (4 carrots * $1.25 each).

Adding those up, Jen will earn a total of $34.00. 


$34.00
"
"Alright, let's break this down. James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 12 miles.  At 2 miles per hour, that takes him 6 hours. He then rests for 3 hours (half the swimming time). For the remaining 8 miles, he swims at half his speed, which is 1 mile per hour, taking him another 8 hours.  

Adding it all up, his total time is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Sam had 70 loaves and the bakery has 40 less than seven times that amount, we need to do a little math.

Seven times the loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Now, 40 less than that is 490 - 40 = 450.

So the bakery has 450 loaves of bread. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Jasmine started with 15 stickers, lost 7, and then got 5 more.  So, 15 minus 7 is 8, and then 8 plus 5 is 13.

"
"Let's break down Cayley's earnings.

For the New York Times, he earns 10% commission on each $5 copy, so that's $0.50 per paper.  On 6 copies, he makes $3.00.

For the Wall Street Journal, his 8% commission on each $15 copy means he earns $1.20 per paper. On 10 copies, that's $12.00.

Adding those together, Cayley earns a total of $15.00 in commission. 


$15.00
"
"Let's break this down. Deanna is 26, and Marcus is 5 years younger than her, making him 21. Marcus is half Leo's age, so Leo must be twice Marcus's age. That means Leo is 42 years old. 

42 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If we call the number of points Azibo scored ""x"", we know Bahati scored x + 20 and Dinar scored x + 10.  

Since their total score is 45, we can write the equation: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms, we get 3x + 30 = 45.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us 3x = 15.

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 5.

So Azibo scored 5 points. 



"
"Well, if the book is 1.5 inches thick and each inch has 100 pages, then there must be 150 pages in total. 



"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.  He worked a long day, from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours.  

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he worked for 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

That means he had 900 / 15 = 60 sets of 15 minutes.

Since he staples 30 reports per set, he stapled a total of 60 * 30 = 1800 reports.


1800 

"
"Let's break this down. Kim usually sleeps for 8 hours, which is 480 minutes. She sleepwalked for 23 minutes and woke up 5 minutes early.  

So, she slept for 480 - 23 - 5 = 452 minutes.


452 

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Jonathan has two dozen cups, which is 24 cups. He has 2/3 that many spoons, so he starts with 16 spoons. After giving 6 to Pedro, he has 10 spoons left.  Adding that to his cups, he has a total of 34 utensils. 


34 

"
"Well, let's see here.  The hospital starts with 1000 beds and 1/5 are full, so that's 200 beds occupied. That leaves 800 beds empty.  

Over two weeks, they get 50 new patients each day, so that's 50 * 14 = 700 new patients.

Adding those to the original 200 occupied beds, we get 900 occupied beds.

Finally, subtracting the occupied beds from the total gives us 1000 - 900 = 100 unoccupied beds. 


100 

"
"Let's break this down. Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 are for work. That leaves 9 emails for family and her boyfriend.  Two-thirds of those 9 emails go to family, which is 6 emails. The rest, 3 emails, must be for her boyfriend. 


3 

"
"Let's break this down. Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is three times her age, making Shawna 3 * 3 = 9 years old. Shawna's father is five times Shawna's age, so he is 5 * 9 = 45 years old. 

45 

"
"Well, if Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we need to figure out what number 48 represents as 120% of the actual attendance.  

Think of it like this: 120% is the same as 1.20.  To find the original number (100%), we divide Courtney's count by 1.20: 48 / 1.20 = 40

So, there were probably 40 people at the concert. 


40
"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Jason carried 2 balls, and Jeffrey carried half that amount, then Jeffrey carried 1 ball. Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so he carried 4 balls.  That means they carried a total of 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls.

"
"Ahoy, matey! Let's see... they dug 10 holes the first day, then 13 more the second, and 8 the third. That's 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes. But they filled in 2 of 'em, so that leaves 29 holes. The island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day, so they must've dug 29 / 4 = 7.25 holes on the first day.  That can't be right, can it?  Must be a mistake on the map!  Anyway, they dug 29 - 7 = 22 holes on the fourth day.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 15 more than them, that means Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.  To find the total, we add up what everyone got: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 corn chips. 


225 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If the supplies cost $400 and the tickets cost 50% more, that means the tickets cost an extra $200 (because 50% of $400 is $200).  So, the total cost of travel is $400 + $200 = $600. 


$600
"
"Let me see... Adelwolfe, Stan, and I caught a total of 339 Pokemon.  Stan caught 13 less than four times the number Adelwolfe caught, and I caught 5 more than Stan. Hmm, this is tricky.

Okay, I think I got it! Stan caught 147 Pokemon. 



"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.  Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as minutes in an episode, meaning there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.  Since each episode is 20 minutes, watching them all would take 10 * 20 = 200 minutes.

"Let's break down the bird's journey:

* First, it flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, covering 300 miles (10 * 30 = 300).
* Then, it flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, covering 36 miles (2 * 18 = 36).
* Finally, it flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, covering 110 miles (5 * 22 = 110).

To find the total distance between the bird's homes, we need to consider the net southward movement: 300 miles (south) - 36 miles (north) + 110 miles (south) = 374 miles.

"
"Let's break this down. Greta starts with 12 brownies, gets 6 more from her office, and then her friends give her 48 more. That's a total of 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies!  They eat 18 of them, leaving Greta with 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Andy's got a busy day ahead of him!  

* Synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes each = 45 minutes
* Polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes each = 110 minutes
* Hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes each = 72 minutes

Adding those up, it'll take Andy 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

"
"Let's break this down. John buys two phones at full price, which is 2 * $600 = $1200. The other two phones are half price, so they cost $600 / 2 = $300 each. That means those two phones cost 2 * $300 = $600.  In total, John spends $1200 + $600 = $1800 on phones.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how long the fence is all the way around. Since it's a rectangle, we add up all the sides: 15 feet + 10 feet + 15 feet + 10 feet = 50 feet.

Now, he needs 2 slats for every foot of fence, so we multiply: 50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats.

He'll need 100 wooden slats. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Mrs. Harrington started with 12 boxes and gave away 4, leaving her with 8. She kept 2 of those, so she sold 6 boxes. Since each box has 20 oranges, she sold 6 * 20 = 120 oranges. 

120 

"
"Well, let's see... India has four more states than half the number of states in the USA.  The USA has 50 states, so half of that is 25.  Adding four more gives us 29 states in India.  Together, that's 29 + 50 = 79 states.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to know how much all the books cost together: $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Then, we see how much more money Tyler needs: $39 - $14 = $25.

Finally, we divide the amount he needs by how much he earns per hour: $25 / $5 = 5 hours.

Looks like Tyler needs to work 5 hours. 



"
"Let's break this down. Robert has 30 cherries, and Richard has 10 less than that, meaning Richard has 20 cherries. Together, they have 50 cherries, leaving 10 for Jerry.  Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"
"Let's break down Sunny's sales to figure out his earnings.

On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 6 boxes of apple pie (10 - 4 = 6). That's $60 from gingerbread (10 * $6) and $90 from apple pie (6 * $15).

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread (10 + 5 = 15) and 15 boxes of apple pie. That brings in $90 from gingerbread (15 * $6) and $225 from apple pie (15 * $15).

Adding up his earnings for both days, Sunny made $150 on Saturday ($60 + $90) and $315 on Sunday ($90 + $225).

In total, Sunny earned $465 over the two days. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Pamela needs an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside, and she's out for 4 hours a day. That means she uses 4 ounces a day. Over 8 days, she'll need 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces of sunscreen. Since each bottle has 8 ounces, she'll need 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, that means it costs 60% of the blue car's price.  So the red car costs 0.60 * $100 = $60.

Together, they cost $100 + $60 = $160. 


$160
"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

When Emil is 24, his dad will be double his age, meaning his dad will be 48.  Since Emil is currently 19, his dad is currently 43.

When Emil is 24, his brother will be half his age, meaning his brother will be 12. Since Emil is currently 19, his brother is currently 7.

Adding their ages together, we get 43 + 7 = 50.

"
"Let's see... Joe caught 3 pounds on Thursday, then 3 * 4 = 12 pounds on Friday. On Saturday, he caught 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.  That's a total of 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish. Since each serving is 3 pounds, he has 21 / 3 = 7 servings.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, 20% of the 30 students are football players, which is 30 * 0.20 = 6 students. That leaves 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, 25% of those remaining students are cheerleaders or in band, so that's 24 * 0.25 = 6 students.

In total, 6 football players + 6 cheerleaders/band members = 12 students are leaving early. 


12 

"
"Well, if Charlie's boots are five times bigger than Sophie's size five boots, that means Charlie wears a size 25!  To find the average, we add their sizes together (5 + 25 = 30) and then divide by two (30 / 2 = 15). 

15 

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

First, we need to know how many plants will fit in Pat's flower bed. It's 111 feet long, which is 1332 inches. Each plant needs 12 inches of space plus 18 inches between plants, for a total of 30 inches per plant. So, Pat can fit 1332 inches / 30 inches per plant = 44.4 plants. Since she can't buy parts of plants, she can fit 44 plants.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 44 plants - 17 plants = 27 more plants.

Each plant costs $6, so she'll spend 27 plants * $6/plant = $162 at the store. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, who eats 18 a day. So, his brother eats 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.  In a week, that's 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Katherine needs 3 petunias at $3.00 each, so that's 3 * $3.00 = $9.00 per basket for petunias.

She also wants 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so that's 2 * $2.50 = $5.00 per basket for vines.

In total, each basket will cost $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

Since she has 5 baskets, the total cost will be $14.00/basket * 5 baskets = $70.00.


$70.00 

"
"Let's see... they use 12 pounds for sunflowers and 15 pounds for carnations, which is a total of 27 pounds. That leaves them with 3 pounds of soil for roses. Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  Emily peels 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, that's 90 / 6 = 15 minutes. Now, she cooks 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, meaning 90 shrimp would take her (90 / 30) * 10 = 30 minutes.  

Adding those times together, it'll take her 15 + 30 = 45 minutes to peel and cook all the shrimp.

"
"Let's see... Comet Halley comes around every 75 years. Bill's dad saw it when he was 30, and Bill saw it when he was three times that age.  That means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old. Since the comet comes every 75 years, Bill must have been 75 when he first saw it. 

75 

"
"Let's see... Buford pays his electric and gas bills monthly, so that's 12 checks for each of those. He gives to the church twice a month, so that's 24 checks a year. And since he pays the pest and lawn service every three months, that's 4 checks a year.  Adding those all up, Buford writes 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks per year.

"
"Let's break this down. The second plane takes 44 trips, which is half the number the first plane takes. That means the first plane takes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.  

It flies to Greece for three-quarters of those, so that's 88 * (3/4) = 66 flights. The rest of the flights, 88 - 66 = 22, are split evenly between France and Germany.

So, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France each day.

"
"Let's break this down. Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice that, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for the combined time of the other two, meaning he howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  

In total, they howl for 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, their combined howl time is 120 / 60 = 2 minutes. 

2 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Adam's dad gave him twice the amount his mom did, so that's $6 * 2 = $12. Together, his parents gave him $6 + $12 = $18. Since the trousers cost $30, Adam had to chip in $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

"
"Hey there! This is a fun one.  Let me think...

If each adult gets twice the watermelon of each kid, and there are two adults and four kids, that means the adults get 2 * 2 = 4 ""kid-sized"" portions of watermelon.

Since there are 4 kids and 4 ""adult-sized"" portions, that makes a total of 8 portions.

Each adult gets 4 out of those 8 portions, which is 50%. 



"
"Let's break this down. Doctor Jones spends 20 minutes per inpatient on rounds, and he has 9 inpatients, so that's 20 * 9 = 180 minutes.  That's equal to 3 hours. His appointments take 30 minutes each, and he has 10, so that's 30 * 10 = 300 minutes, or 5 hours. In total, he's spending 3 + 5 = 8 hours on rounds and appointments. Since he works a 9-hour day, he has 9 - 8 = 1 hour left for records.

"
"Hey there! Let's break down the dance studio's earnings.

They charge $25 to rent the space and $1.50 per student. With 10 students, that's $25 + ($1.50 * 10) = $40 per session.

Since they have classes 3 days a week, they earn $40/session * 3 sessions/week = $120 per week.

Over a month with 4 weeks, their earnings would be $120/week * 4 weeks/month = $480.

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much it'll cost the Smiths to fill their pool.

First, we need to find the pool's volume: 14 feet x 25 feet x 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

Then, we multiply that by 5.9 to get the gallons: 1400 cubic feet x 5.9 gallons/cubic foot = 8260 gallons.

Finally, we multiply the gallons by the price per gallon: 8260 gallons x $0.10/gallon = $826.00.

So, it will cost the Smiths $826.00 to fill their pool. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  They have 9 red sticks, and 5 more blue ones than that, so that's 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.  There are 3 fewer yellow sticks than blue sticks, meaning there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.  

Adding them all up, they have 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

Half of the 3000 students are over 16, so that's 1500 students. A quarter of those older students are male, meaning 375 are guys. That leaves 1125 female students over 16.

The other half of the school, 1500 students, are under 16. Half of them are male, so 750 are guys, leaving 750 female students under 16.

Adding those together, there are 1125 + 750 = 1875 female students at Brook Hills High.

"Let's figure this out!

Bethany runs 10 laps. Trey runs 4 more than Bethany, so he runs 14 laps. Shaelyn runs half as many as Trey, which is 7 laps. Quinn runs 2 fewer than Shaelyn, so she runs 5 laps.

That means Bethany runs 5 more laps than Quinn.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Wanda and Ms. B are working hard to fill that tank!

On the first day, Wanda pumps in a quarter of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumps in three-quarters of what Wanda does, so that's 4500 gallons * 0.75 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumps in two-thirds of her day one amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons. Ms. B only pumps in a third of her day one amount, so that's 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

Let's add up all the water they pumped: 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons + 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

Finally, to find out how much is left, we subtract the water they pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons.



So the answer is 6000.

"Let's break this problem down.  

Maria's power bank loses charge at different rates, so we need to figure out the total charge loss before we can determine the starting charge.

First, she loses 9% per hour for 5 hours, totaling 9 * 5 = 45% charge loss.

Then, the rate changes to 7% per hour for 3 hours, meaning another 7 * 3 = 21% loss.

In total, that's 45% + 21% = 66% of the charge gone.

This means 100% - 66% = 34% of the charge remained after these losses.

But we know the final charge was only 28%. This means her friends used 34% - 28% = 6% of the power bank's capacity.

That 6% represents the portion of the 34% that remained after the initial losses. To find the original charge, we can set up a proportion:

6% / 34% = x / 100%

Solving for x, we get x = (6% * 100%) / 34% = 17.65% (approximately).



So, the power bank was approximately 17.65% charged when Maria left for the park.

"Hey there! This is a classic compound interest problem, but with carrots instead of money!  

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Year 1:** The price goes up by 5%, so the carrots cost $120 + (0.05 * $120) = $126.
* **Year 2:** Another 5% increase means they cost $126 + (0.05 * $126) = $132.30
* **Year 3:** One more 5% bump brings the price to $132.30 + (0.05 * $132.30) = $138.92

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the carrots will cost about $139 after three years.

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

Teresa makes a profit of $12 on each large stuffed animal and $4 on each small one. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and made $120 total, we can figure this out.

Think of it like this: for every large stuffed animal, she sold two small ones.  Let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Her earnings from large stuffed animals would be 12x, and from small stuffed animals, it would be 8x (because 2x small stuffed animals * $4 each = 8x).

Adding those together, we get 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining like terms, we have 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find that x = 6.

Since she sold 2x small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

Now, one dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds a day, and there are 30 days in a month, so that's 36 * 30 = 1080 pounds per dwarf. With 40 dwarves, that's a whopping 1080 * 40 = 43200 pounds of ore!

Next, she finds 8 blue balloons and adds 75% of them to her collection, which is 8 * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons.

Finally, she carries 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 balloons into school.

Combining the 'x' terms and the dollar amounts, we get 4x + $240 = $1920.

Subtracting $240 from both sides gives us 4x = $1680.

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that x = $420.

So the first person's share was $420.

If Rory got half as many balls in the third set compared to the second, and the total is 19, we know the second set must be a decent chunk of that total. Let's call the number of balls in the second set ""x"".

* Second set: x balls
* First set: x + 4 balls
* Third set: x / 2 balls

Adding those up, we get: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Let's solve for x:

* 2.5x + 4 = 19
* 2.5x = 15
* x = 6

So, the second set had 6 balls. That means the first set had 6 + 4 = 10 balls.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Betsy took longer than Donovan, and their times add up to 98 minutes, we need to find the difference.  

Think of it like this:

* Donovan's time + Betsy's time = 98 minutes
* Betsy's time = Donovan's time + 18 minutes

Let's say Donovan took 'x' minutes. That means Betsy took 'x + 18' minutes.

So, x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining those 'x's, we get 2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So Donovan took 40 minutes.

Betsy took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Melanie needs 200 toothpicks and has 10 saved each week for 12 weeks, so she has 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks. That means she still needs 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.  Since she saves 10 per week, it'll take her 80 / 10 = 8 more weeks.

"
"Let's break this down. Mr. Rogers got the watch for 75% of $2000, which is $1500.  He then sold it for 120% of that price, meaning he sold it for $1800. That's a $200 discount from the original $2000 price.  

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%

So the answer is 10%. 



"
"Well, let's see. If one spring makes a jellyfish every second, that's 60 jellyfish a minute, and 3600 in an hour!  With five springs, that's 18,000 jellyfish in an hour.  Over four hours, they'd make a whopping 72,000 jellyfish! 

72,000 

"
"Well, let's see. Twice Binkie's score is 90 * 2 = 180.  Frankie scored 15 more than that, so he got 180 + 15 = 195.

"
"Let's break this down. James walks 2 miles to the halfway point, then 2 miles back home. That's 4 miles already. Then he walks another 2 miles to the store, for a total of 6 miles.

Since he walks at 4 miles per hour, it takes him 1.5 hours to reach the store.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas with 4 bananas per bunch, that's a total of 40 bananas. Buying them individually would cost 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00. Since she buys them in bunches for $3.00 each, the total cost is 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.  That means she saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

$2.00 

"
"Well, let's see. If they have 100 feet total and Harry gets 60 more than Sam, we can figure this out.  Think of it like this:  Let's say Sam gets 'x' amount of fence. Harry gets 'x + 60'.  

If we add those together, it has to equal 100 feet. So, x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combining the 'x's, we get 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides, and we have 2x = 40.

Finally, divide both sides by 2, and we find out Sam gets x = 20 feet of fence.

"
"Well, if a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, that means it grows 2 inches every year.  So in 13 years, it would grow 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Marcel's earnings.

First, we know he sold 150 Trekking bikes (half of 300), 45 BMX bikes (15% of 300), and the rest were MTB bikes, which is 105 bikes (300 - 150 - 45).

A BMX bike costs $250 (half the price of an MTB), and a Trekking bike costs $450.

So, his earnings from Trekking bikes are $67,500 (150 bikes * $450/bike), from BMX bikes are $11,250 (45 bikes * $250/bike), and from MTB bikes are $52,500 (105 bikes * $500/bike).

Adding those up, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bikes that month. 



"
"Well, let's see. The farmer makes 5 bales an hour for 6 hours, so that's 5 * 6 = 30 bales. The truck picks up 3 bales an hour for 6 hours, meaning it takes 3 * 6 = 18 bales.  That leaves 30 - 18 = 12 bales in the field.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. John has 8 classes a day, which is 320 minutes of class time. Over a week, that's 1600 minutes. He then spends another 100 minutes each day on the weekend learning, for a total of 200 minutes.  Adding it all up, that's 1800 minutes a week.  

That's 30 hours!

"Hey there! This is a fun one. Let's see... the ball starts at 72 feet (3 floors * 24 feet per floor). After the first bounce, it goes up to 2/3 of that, which is 48 feet. Then, on the second bounce, it goes up to 2/3 of 48 feet, which is 32 feet. 

So the answer is 32. 



"
"Let's break this down. The second child is 74 inches tall (6 feet x 12 inches/foot + 2 inches). The third child is 69 inches tall (74 inches - 5 inches). Finally, the fourth child is 72 inches tall (69 inches + 3 inches).

"
"Well, let's see... they sold 2000 apples in bags of 10, so that's 200 bags.  If each bag costs $5, they made 200 bags * $5/bag = $1000.

"
"Let's think this through. The Allosaurus ate 270 kg, which was half of what the velociraptors left. That means the velociraptors left 270 kg * 2 = 540 kg.  

But that 540 kg was only half of what the T-Rex left behind. So the triceratops must have had 540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg of meat originally. 


1080 

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Two walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so that's 10 * 8 = 80 square feet each.  That's 80 * 2 = 160 square feet total for those walls.

The other two walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so each is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Together they're 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.

The whole room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

At $12 a gallon, the total cost is 12 * $12 = $144.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Ellen's friend has a bit of a sticky situation ahead of them!

Here's the deal: there are 2 shaken sodas left out of a total of 8.  That means there's a 2 out of 8 chance, or a 25% chance, that Ellen's friend will get a soda shower.

"
"Well, let's see here. One train is zipping along at 60 miles per hour, while the other is chugging along at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.  After 3 hours, the faster train will have covered 180 miles (60 x 3), and the slower train will have gone 90 miles (30 x 3).  

Since they're traveling in opposite directions, we add those distances together to find out how far apart they are: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.


270 

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  Billy's got a good heart, helping folks with their taxes.

First, figure out how many days he's actually working. There are 31 days in March plus 19 in April, making 50 days total. He takes 20% of those days off, so that's 50 * 0.20 = 10 days off. That leaves him with 50 - 10 = 40 days of tax-helping.

Now, he helps 2 people per hour and works 3 hours a day, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Finally, multiply the people per day by the number of days he works: 6 * 40 = 240 people.

So the answer is 240. 



"
"Well, let's see.  If each bus held 35 people and there were 12 buses, that's 12 times 35, which equals 420 people.  Then, with 20 cars holding 3 people each, that's 20 times 3, making 60 people.  Adding those together, we get 420 plus 60, which equals 480 people.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. The big slide is 300 feet long and you go 60 feet per minute, so that's 300 / 60 = 5 minutes. The smaller slide is 240 feet long and you zoom down at 80 feet per minute, meaning it takes 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.  

So, the big slide takes 2 minutes longer. 



"
"Well, let's see. Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day, so that's 30 + 30 = 60 minutes of breaks daily. Over five days, that adds up to 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes.  Converting that to hours, we get 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

"
"Let's break this down. Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran, so he ran 3.5 * 8 miles = 28 miles. Together, Amber and Micah ran 8 miles + 28 miles = 36 miles.  That means Ahito ran 52 miles - 36 miles = 16 miles.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Sheila starts with $85.00 on her card, then returns something for $15.00, leaving her at $70.00.

The frying pan is $20.00 but on sale for 20% off, so that's $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00 off.  So the pan costs $16.00.

The towels are $30.00 with 10% off, which is $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00 off. The towels are $27.00.

Adding those together, her new purchases are $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Finally, we add that to her balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00


$113.00 

"
"Let's break this down. If 6 jellyfish change color, and that represents a third of the large jellyfish, then there must be 6 * 3 = 18 large jellyfish.

"Alright, let's break this down. Lauren wants to retire comfortably, and that's great!  

She's aiming for 20 years of retirement living on 40% of her current $100,000 salary. That means she'll need $40,000 per year in retirement. Over 20 years, that's a total of $800,000.

Now, she's a smart saver, putting away 20% of her salary each year, which is $20,000. To reach her $800,000 goal, she'll need to save for 40 years.

"Alright, let's figure this out. Soledad wants to hike a whopping 9,300 miles in June.  If she hikes 125 miles twice a day, that's 250 miles per day. Over 30 days, that's 7,500 miles (250 miles/day * 30 days).  

She's short 1,800 miles (9,300 miles - 7,500 miles). To make up the difference, she needs to hike an extra 60 miles each day (1,800 miles / 30 days).

The store will make $27 from the red balls (3 balls * $9/ball), $55 from the blue balls (11 balls * $5/ball), and $75 from the green balls (25 balls * $3/ball).

Adding those up, the store will have received a total of $157 after selling all the balls.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Amalia mowed the lawn for 4 hours. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so she spent 4 + 2 = 6 hours walking the dog. Dior took a whopping 4 hours longer than Amalia mowing, meaning she spent 4 + 4 = 8 hours doing laundry.  

To find the total time, we add up their individual times: 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.

"
"Well, let's see. John drives 70 miles per hour and it takes him 2 hours to get to his parents, so that's 70 * 2 = 140 miles one way. Since it's a round trip, he drives 140 * 2 = 280 miles each time he visits. He visits twice a month, so that's 280 * 2 = 560 miles.

"
"Let's figure this out! Sofie walks 10 miles a day for 7 days, meaning she'll walk a total of 10 * 7 = 70 miles. Brian walks half the distance Sofie does, so he'll walk 70 / 2 = 35 miles.

"
"Let's break this down.  

The first two workers make 6 toys an hour each, so together they make 12 toys an hour. The other two workers make 4 toys an hour each, for a total of 8 toys an hour. That's 20 toys an hour from those four workers.

Over 10 hours, they make 200 toys (20 toys/hour * 10 hours).

Since they need 400 toys and still need 20 more, they've made 380 toys so far (400 - 20 = 380).

That means the fifth worker made 180 toys (380 - 200 = 180) over the 10-hour shift.

So, the fifth worker makes 18 toys an hour (180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth that weight, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. His second dog is half the weight of Kory's, meaning it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.  

Together, Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.  Adding that to Kory's dog's weight, we get a total of 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

So the fastest car goes 750 mph.

"Hey there! Let's crack this egg-painting mystery.

Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30.  That means Sarah painted 9 eggs (30 - 12 = 18, then 18 / 2 = 9). Camden painted 21 eggs (9 + 12 = 21).

Arnold and Madeline painted the same amount, and together they painted 26 eggs (56 total eggs - 30 = 26). So, Arnold painted 13 eggs (26 / 2 = 13).

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold (21 - 13 = 8).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Nik has a lot of crayons!  Since each box holds 8 crayons and he has 200 crayons, he'll need 25 boxes (200 / 8 = 25). That's also 200 ounces of crayons (200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces).

The boxes themselves weigh 200 ounces too (25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces).

All together, that's 400 ounces (200 ounces crayons + 200 ounces boxes).

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 25 pounds (400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds).

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

First, we gotta figure out how much wood John can actually use. Eighty percent of that 80-foot tree is usable, so that's 80 * 0.80 = 64 feet.

Then, he cuts that into 4-foot logs, so he gets 64 / 4 = 16 logs.

Each log gives him 5 planks, so that's 16 * 5 = 80 planks in total.

Finally, he sells each plank for $1.20, so he makes 80 * $1.20 = $96.

Their mom makes double that, so she earns $15000 * 2 = $30000.  Adding it all up, they have a combined income of $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000.

"Let's break this down. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We know she spends 40 minutes on the beach, so we can figure out her beach speed.

She covers 2 miles in 40 minutes, which means her beach speed is 3 miles per hour.  Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her sidewalk speed is 6 miles per hour.

It takes her 1/6 of an hour to walk the mile on the sidewalk, which is 10 minutes.

Adding up the time on the beach and the sidewalk, her total walking time is 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Let's break this down. Donny needs the water to be at least 40 degrees.  The colder water is bringing the temperature down, so the hotter water needs to make up the difference.  

Think of it like this: the colder water adds ""degree-ounces"" (degrees times ounces) and the hotter water does too.  We need enough ""degree-ounces"" from the hotter water to get the total mix up to at least 40 degrees.

Since we know the colder water is 33 degrees and he's adding 4 ounces, that's 132 ""degree-ounces"". To get the mix to 40 degrees, the hotter water needs to add at least 68 ""degree-ounces"" (since 200 total ""degree-ounces"" / 5 ounces = 40 degrees).

That means the hotter water needs to be at least 68 degrees.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Melanie's dad starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Over three weeks, he gets 20 cows a day from Milkie Cows Limited, which is 20 * 7 * 3 = 420 cows. He also gets 10 chickens a day from Broilers Limited, so that's 10 * 7 * 3 = 210 chickens.

That means he has 50 + 420 = 470 cows and 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

In total, he has 470 + 230 = 700 animals on the farm.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, Russell gets 9 bagels per pack, and he's buying 4 packs, which means he's got 9 * 4 = 36 bagels in total.

Those 4 packs would normally cost him 4 * $10.00 = $40.00, but he gets a 10% discount, which is $40.00 * 0.10 = $4.00 off.

That brings his total down to $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Finally, to find the price per bagel, we divide the total cost by the number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"Well, let's see. Chester eats 3 eggs a day for the first 30 days, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 eggs. Then he ups his intake to 5 eggs a day for another 30 days, meaning he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.  In total, that's 90 + 150 = 240 eggs over 60 days. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, he'll need 240 / 12 = 20 dozen eggs.

"Well, let's see here.  The ratio of men to women is 5:9, meaning for every 5 men, there are 9 women. That's a total of 14 parts.  If there are 84 passengers in total, that means each ""part"" represents 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers.

Initially, there were 9 parts of women, so there were 9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women on the bus.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 women - 20 women = 34 women left on the bus.

"
"Let's break this down. Faraday makes $2 per sunflower and $8 per bouquet. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, that means he makes $8 / 12 = $0.67 per sunflower in a bouquet.

So, he makes a total of $2 + $0.67 = $2.67 per sunflower.

Over three days, he makes $2.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

He earned $26 from individual sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over three days.

That means he sold $82 / $2.67 per sunflower = 30.7 sunflowers. Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, he sold 30 sunflowers.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Jen has 3 fishy friends who each need a dollar's worth of food every day. That means she spends $3 each day on food.  May has 31 days, so over the whole month, she spends 31 days * $3/day = $93 on fish food.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Jim had 27 seashells, and that was 5 more than Carlos, so Carlos found 27 - 5 = 22 seashells. Carlos found twice as many as Carrey, meaning Carrey found 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

In total, they had 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.  When they split them evenly, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to see how much energy 2300 people need in total. That's 2300 people * 100% = 230,000% of daily energy.

Now, Hortex currently makes enough juice to cover 4200 bottles * 20% = 84,000% of daily energy needs.

To find the difference, we subtract: 230,000% - 84,000% = 146,000%.

Finally, since each bottle covers 20% of the daily need, they'd need to produce 146,000% / 20% = 7300 more bottles.

"Let's break down Abraham's land sales:

* He starts with 80 square meters.
* He sells half (80 / 2 = 40 square meters) for $50.
* That leaves him with 40 square meters.
* He sells a quarter of that (40 / 4 = 10 square meters) for $30.
* He has 30 square meters left.
* He sells these last 30 square meters at $3 per square meter, earning 30 * $3 = $90.

Adding up all his sales: $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.

Abraham will earn a total of $170.

"Hey there! Let's crack this egg hunt mystery.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 36 eggs. Lamar found 5, Stacy found twice that amount (5 x 2 = 10), and Charlie found 2 less than Stacy (10 - 2 = 8). Mei found half as many as Charlie (8 / 2 = 4).

Altogether, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

That means there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hiding!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, John's got a lot of garbage to collect!  The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third one is 60% bigger than those two combined, so it's 400 * 0.60 = 240 apartments bigger. That means the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

In total, he's collecting from 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

He goes to each place three times a week, so that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 collections.

Since he makes $0.40 per collection, he earns 4320 * $0.40 = $1728.00 each week.

$1728.00

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, a 5-year-old tree gives us 50 avocados. A 6-year-old tree triples that, making it 150 avocados. A 7-year-old tree gives us 350 avocados, which is seven times the initial amount.

An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fewer avocados than a 10-year-old tree.  A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is a whopping 1000 avocados! That means an 8-year-old tree produces 800 avocados.

The tree takes a break in its ninth year and doesn't produce any fruit.

Adding all the avocados together: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = 2350 avocados.

That's a lot of guacamole!

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope.  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, and all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long.

To find the red rope's length, we need to figure out the length of each rope individually.  

Think of it like this:

* If the blue rope is 'b' centimeters long, the red rope is '4b' centimeters long.
* The yellow rope is 'b + 7' centimeters long.

Now, if we add up the lengths of all three ropes, we get:

b + 4b + (b + 7) = 37

Combining like terms, we have:

6b + 7 = 37

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

6b = 30

Dividing both sides by 6:

b = 5

So, the blue rope is 5 centimeters long.

Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, it's 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

"Let's break this down. Rissa had three times the amount Ronnie had, meaning she started with $5 * 3 = $15.  

After giving some money to their sister, Rissa has 4/5 of her money left. This means she gave away 1/5 of her $15, which is $3.

Ronnie also gave $3 to their sister. Since he started with $5, he has $5 - $3 = $2 left.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  If half the mural is yellow, that's 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint.  That leaves 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints for the red, white, and purple. Since they're used in equal amounts, each of those colors used 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so that's 20 * 12 = 240 square feet per bedroom.  Since there are four bedrooms, that's 240 * 4 = 960 square feet total for the bedrooms.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, meaning it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding the bedrooms and living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

Finally, adding the rest of the house, the total area is 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"Hey there!  Let me see... a bigger box for the same price means more pods per dollar.  

If the big box has 20% more pods, that's an extra 20 pods on top of the usual 100. So, that's 120 pods total.

Since the box still costs $12, you get 120 pods for $12, which means you can run 10 cycles for every dollar!

"Alright, let's break this down. Team A had a great first half with 4 goals! Team B was a bit behind with 2 fewer, so they scored 2 goals.  In the second half, Team B really stepped it up, scoring 4 times their first half amount, which is 8 goals. Team A only managed half of that, scoring 2 goals.

Adding it all up, Team A scored 6 goals total (4 + 2) and Team B scored 10 goals (2 + 8). That means there were a total of 16 goals in the match.

"
"Let's break this problem down.  

We know Wendy's age is related to Colin's age in two different ways.  

First, Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years. That means Wendy is currently much older than Colin.

Second, in 25 years, Colin's age will be one-third of Wendy's current age. This tells us something about the difference in their ages.

To solve this, we can use algebra. Let's say Wendy's current age is ""w"" and Colin's current age is ""c"".

We can set up two equations based on the information given:

* w = 5(c + 7) 
* c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we can solve for ""c"", which represents Colin's current age.

After solving these equations, we find that Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Let's break this down.  They used 38 bandages the first day and ordered 50 more, so they had 50 + 38 = 88 bandages at the start of the second day.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first, meaning they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, or 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.  

To find out how many they started with, let's work backwards:

* Before using any on the third day, they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages.
* Before ordering more on the third day, they had 103 - 100 = 3 bandages.
* Before using any on the second day, they had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages.

Finally, to find out how many they started with on the first day, we subtract the bandages used on the first day: 31 - 38 = -7.

Wait a minute, that doesn't make sense! You can't have negative bandages. This problem doesn't seem to have a realistic solution.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Jen's earnings. 

She works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, so that's 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours a week.

Her hourly rate is $1.50, so she earns 45 * $1.50 = $67.50 per week.

Since April has 4 weeks, her total earnings for the month would be $67.50 * 4 = $270.00.

Don't forget her perfect attendance bonus of $10!

That brings her total to $270.00 + $10.00 = $280.00 for April.

Over two weeks, he emptied the dishwasher 6 times, did laundry once, took out the trash twice, and cleaned his room once.

So, that's $3 + $1.50 + (2 * $0.75) + (6 * $0.50) = $3 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3 = $9.00

Jason earned $9.00.

"Let's break this down. John spends $600 on 10 bottles of scotch, meaning each bottle costs $60. Cognac bottles cost 50% more, so each one is $60 + ($60 * 0.50) = $90.

Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day and twice that many Lodgepole Pine, which is 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. That's a total of 20 + 40 = 60 trees on the first day.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, bringing his total to 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine than the first day, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pine. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. That's a total of 30 + 50 = 80 trees on the second day.

In total, Mr. Julius planted 60 + 80 = 140 trees.

Her sister takes one palette, which is 4 colors. So Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 colors left. Then she uses half the colors from one makeup set, which is 6 colors / 2 = 3 colors.  

That means Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 colors left.

"Let's break this down. Mattison's house is 7 times his height, so it's 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches tall. The first floor is 3 times his height, meaning it's 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches tall.  

If the first floor is 180 inches and Mattison is 60 inches, the combined height of Mattison and the first floor is 180 inches + 60 inches = 240 inches.

To find the height of the second floor, we subtract the height of Mattison and the first floor from the total height of the house: 420 inches - 240 inches = 180 inches.

So the roof is 180 inches from the second floor's floor.

But jelly beans don't fit together perfectly, right? They'll leave some empty space.  He said they get about 80% efficiency, so we multiply the total volume by 0.80: 540 * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we divide the usable space by that: 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans.

Now, he thinks 30% of those are red, so we multiply: 2880 * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

He was off by 36 jelly beans.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

The bus starts with 20 people, then picks up 40 more, that's 60 total. Then another 30 get on (that's three-quarters of the first group). So now there are 90 people.  

At the third stop, the number doubles to 180. That leaves 20 spots left on the bus.

"Let's break this down. Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year at $2 a visit, so that's 3 * $2 = $6 per year. Over 5 years, she spends $6 * 5 = $30.

The price then jumps up by 150%, meaning it increases by $2 * 1.5 = $3.  The new price is $2 + $3 = $5 per visit.

For the next 3 years, she spends $5 * 3 * 3 = $45.

In total, Pauline spends $30 + $45 = $75 on museum visits.

"
"Let's see... they have 10 students in each grade who get to try the escape room, but only 8 can go at a time. That means each grade needs to do a couple of rounds.  Since there are four grades, and each grade needs two groups, that's a total of eight groups. If each group takes 45 minutes, it'll take them 360 minutes for everyone to go.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Ali owes John.  

John made 4 tables at $20 each, so that's 4 * $20 = $80. He also made 2 roof frames at $10 each, which is 2 * $10 = $20.

In total, Ali needs to pay John $80 + $20 = $100.

"
"Hey there! This is a classic division problem.  

Let's think of it like this: the board is split into 5 parts (1 part for the shorter piece and 4 parts for the longer piece).  Each of those parts is 40 feet / 5 parts = 8 feet long.

Since the longer piece is 4 parts, it's 4 * 8 feet = 32 feet long.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Aiden wants 80 meatballs, and he gets 16 meatballs per pound of beef. That means he needs 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of beef.  He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of beef, so he'll need 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If Luke has five windows that are each 35 inches wide, that's a total of 5 * 35 = 175 inches. Since he needs twice that amount of fabric, he should buy 175 * 2 = 350 inches of fabric.

"
"Hey there!  Let's break down this payphone problem.  

The first 16 minutes cost $0.25 per minute, so that's 16 * $0.25 = $4.00.

The rest of the call is 36 - 16 = 20 minutes. Those minutes cost $0.20 each, for a total of 20 * $0.20 = $4.00.

Adding those together, the whole call costs $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00. 


$8.00

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Carly needs enough treats for everyone in her class to have two each, so that's 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats total.  

Let's say Carly makes 'c' cupcakes. She makes 3 times that many brownies minus 2, so that's 3c - 2 brownies.

That means the total number of treats is c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 4c - 2 = 10.

Adding 2 to both sides gives us 4c = 12.

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that c = 3.

So Carly made 3 cupcakes. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Karen's total cost. 

A manicure and pedicure together would normally cost $35 + $40 = $75.  But with the 20% discount for getting both, she saves $75 * 0.20 = $15. That brings the price down to $75 - $15 = $60.

Don't forget the nail art! At $3 per nail and 10 nails total, that's an extra $3 * 10 = $30.

Adding it all up, Karen's total cost is $60 + $30 = $90.


$90 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Susan gets 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

She also has one magazine that sends 6 issues a year.

Her last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine, meaning it sends 6 * 4 = 24 issues.

Adding all those up, she gets 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 magazines a year.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

The toy started at $40. In December, the price jumped up by 80%, which is like adding $40 * 0.80 = $32 to the original price. So in December, it cost $40 + $32 = $72.

Then in January, the price dropped by 50%, meaning it went down by $72 * 0.50 = $36.  That brings the January price to $72 - $36 = $36.

"
"Let's break down Charlie's earnings:

* He earns $80 for each of his standard lessons, and he has 4 of those, so that's 4 * $80 = $320.
* For veterans, he discounts his rate by 25%, meaning he charges $80 - ($80 * 0.25) = $60 per lesson.
* He has 2 veteran lessons, bringing in 2 * $60 = $120.

Adding his earnings from both types of lessons, Charlie makes a total of $320 + $120 = $440 today.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If 9 novels is three-quarters of the total she wrote this year, we can think of it like this: 9 novels represent 3 out of 4 equal parts.  

To find out how many novels make up one whole part, we divide the known number by 3: 9 novels / 3 = 3 novels per part.

Since there are 4 parts in total, we multiply that amount by 4: 3 novels/part * 4 parts = 12 novels.

"
"Well, let's see. Michael's driving 50 kilometers every hour, and he's on the road for a full 3 days. That's 72 hours of driving!  So, he covers 50 km/hr * 72 hours = 3600 kilometers.

Now, the trip from Alaska to Texas is 6000 kilometers.  To find out what percentage of the trip he's completed, we do a little division: (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100% = 60%.

So the answer is 60%. 



"
"Let's see... Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times that amount, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.  That means they used a total of 6 + 30 = 36 grapes for the juice.

Their mom used 48 grapes for the pies because she needed 12 grapes per pie and made 4 pies.

So, at the beginning, there were 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

"Let's break down the cost of Bud's macaroni and cheese:

* He spends $1.00 on pasta each time.
* Cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
* Gruyere cheese costs twice the cheddar, so that's $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

In total, each week's macaroni and cheese costs $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Over a year (52 weeks), Bud spends $10.00/week * 52 weeks/year = $520.00 on his cheesy delight.

"
"Hey there! Let me see... 80 classrooms at 15 minutes each is 1200 minutes of cleaning.  That's a full 20 hours of cleaning!  Since they work 8 hour days, that means cleaning takes up half their workday.

So the answer is 50%. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Each middle shelf holds 10 books, and the bottom shelf holds twice that, so 20 books. The top shelf holds 5 fewer than the bottom, meaning it holds 15 books. That's a total of 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books per bookcase.

Since Elly has 110 books, she'll need 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Rose spent $2.40 per dozen on five dozens of eggs, so that's 5 * $2.40 = $12.00 in total.  She's selling them in groups of three for $1.00 a pop. With 60 eggs (5 dozen * 12 eggs/dozen), she can make 20 sets of three (60 / 3 = 20). That means she'll earn $20.00 (20 sets * $1.00/set).  

Her profit is her earnings minus her costs, so $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

$8.00 

"
"Let's break this down.  Half of Skyler's hats are red, so that's 100 / 2 = 50 red hats. That leaves 100 - 50 = 50 hats that are either blue or white.  

Three-fifths of those remaining hats are blue, meaning there are (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

The rest must be white, so Skyler has 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  If Mary makes 's' strawberry cubes, she makes 5s - 4 blueberry cubes.  That means the total number of cubes is s + (5s - 4) = 116. Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116.  Adding 4 to both sides gives us 6s = 120.  Dividing both sides by 6, we find s = 20.  

So, Mary makes 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 blueberry cubes.

"Let's see... they have 4 flashlights, one for each person.  They also have 2 flashlights per room, so that's 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights.  

For candles, half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 candles. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 candles.

In total, they have 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Adding the candles and flashlights, they have a total of 36 + 4 = 40 light sources.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, Octavia's using 11 small shirts (3 square feet each), 8 medium shirts (4 square feet each), and 6 large shirts (6 square feet each).

* Small shirts total: 11 * 3 = 33 square feet
* Medium shirts total: 8 * 4 = 32 square feet
* Large shirts total: 6 * 6 = 36 square feet

Add those all up: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

Her quilt will be 101 square feet!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is 36 seeds. A large sunflower has 50% more than that, so it has 18 extra seeds (half of 36). That means a large sunflower has 54 seeds (36 + 18). Altogether, that's 90 seeds!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If George has 18 pens and Timothy has three times that amount, Timothy has 18 * 3 = 54 pens. Sarah has half as many as Timothy, so she has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.

"
"Let's break this down. Anne is twice Albert's size, so she's 36"" * 2 = 72"" tall. Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, meaning she's 72"" - 2"" = 70"" tall now.  Since she grew 3"" over the summer, she was 70"" - 3"" = 67"" tall before.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

They make 5000 chocolate bars a day and sell each one for $2. That means they make 5000 * $2 = $10,000 every day.

Over a week, that's $10,000 * 7 = $70,000.

And for two weeks, it's double that: $70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

So the answer is $140,000. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Jake spent.

First, those T-shirts. Since he gets one half off, the second one costs $8 / 2 = $4.  So the shirts cost a total of $8 + $4 = $12.

The shoes are 40% off, which is a discount of $40 * 0.40 = $16. That means the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Adding it all up, Jake spends $12 + $24 = $36 at the store.

"
"Let's see... Ryan earned $6 a week for three weeks, so that's $6 * 3 = $18.  Those ice cream cones cost $1.25 each, and he bought four of them, so that's $1.25 * 4 = $5.  That means he has $18 - $5 = $13 left.  Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Ellen and Lani spent. 

Ellen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a frame, for a total of $105. Lani spent $30 on sunglasses and $200 on two bathrobes ($100 each), making her total $230.

Adding their spending together, they spent $105 + $230 = $335 at the mall.

"Alright, let's break down Tim's honey and jam business. 

He spends $12 on passion fruit, $12 on jackfruit, and $20 on honey for each jar, totaling $44 in costs. Since he sells each jar for $50, he makes a profit of $6 per jar.  Selling 10 jars would net him a profit of $60.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $15.00 on movie tickets (since she bought two at $7.50 each), and $8.50 on a bracelet. That's a total of $27.00. If her parents gave her $40.00, she has $13.00 left.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Josh works 5 days a week and services 3 cars each day, so he works on 15 cars weekly.  He makes $4 per car, meaning he earns $60 each week. Over two weeks, he'd make $120.

"Let's see... Randy starts with 18 cookies. He eats 3, then 2 more, leaving him with 13.  He gives away 2, so he has 11 left. Then he bakes 12 more, for a grand total of 23 cookies!

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Matthew has 12 toys, so half of them is 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

He'd make 6 * $5 = $30 from the first half.

And 6 * $7 = $42 from the second half.

Adding those together, he'd earn a total of $30 + $42 = $72.

"
"Let's see... the dog digs a lot of holes! 84 holes in total while Nate is gone.  Nate fills 9 a day, but the dog digs 6 more each night. That means Nate makes a net gain of 3 holes each day (9 - 6 = 3).  So, it'll take him 28 days to fill all the holes (84 / 3 = 28). That's 4 weeks!

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Butler High School has 3/4 the students of Norman High School, so they have (3/4) * 4000 = 3000 students. That means Norman High School has 4000 - 3000 = 1000 more students.

"Let's see... they made 7995 cookies total, and 2595 were rainbow and 3075 were oatmeal.  That means they made 2325 chocolate chip cookies! 



"
"Let's break this down. Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, but Igor only brought 8. He brought the right number of beakers, 7, and 16 Petri dishes instead of 14.  

Igor brought a total of 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 items. That's 2 more than the 29 he actually put on the bench.  

Since he brought 2 extra items, and those weren't beakers, Igor must have lost 0 beakers.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

James needs 2 screws per leg, and each table has 4 legs, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 screws per table. With 4 tables, he'll need 8 * 4 = 32 screws. Since he has 40 screws, he'll have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over.

"Well, if one basket has 10 eggs and the other has twice that amount, the second basket must have 20 eggs.  That means together they have 30 eggs.

"
"Let's see... Alexandra raised $430, and Kim raised $320 more than that, so she raised $430 + $320 = $750. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.  

To find the total, we add up everyone's earnings: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

"Let's break this down. Aaron is speedy, running twice as fast as Vanessa.  But Vanessa has endurance, covering twice the distance Aaron does. Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron finished his part in 16 minutes.  

Since Aaron is twice as fast, he must have run half the distance, which is 2 miles.  If he ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, that means he runs each mile in 8 minutes. Vanessa, being half as fast, takes 16 minutes per mile.

With Vanessa running 4 miles at 16 minutes per mile, her total time is 64 minutes.

"Well, let's see. He needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock. That means he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line in total.  But he already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 more feet of line.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  Tom's restaurant gets 6 groups of customers each night, and each group spends $15 (2 meals at $5 each plus a $5 bottle of wine). That means they make $90 each night. Since they're open two nights a week, they rake in $180.

"
"Hey there!  Let me see... the vendor made a 25% profit on 50 watermelons he bought for $80.  To find out how much he sold each one for, we need to figure out his total earnings first. A 25% profit on $80 is $20 (25/100 * $80 = $20).  So, he made $100 in total ($80 + $20 = $100).  

If he sold all 50 watermelons for $100, each one would cost $2 ($100 / 50 = $2).

"Let's break this down. Dora is turning 12 in three years, so she's currently 9.  James is twice her age, making him 18.  John was 19 when James was born, so he's now 37. His youngest son was born when John was 32, meaning the son is currently 5. In three years, the youngest son will be 8.

"
"Well, let's see. Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes, and Jane takes 4 minutes.  In an hour, there are 60 minutes.  So, Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges. Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges. That means Ana peels 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, the radiator normally costs $400, but he got a sweet deal at the junk shop for 80% off. That means he saved $400 * 0.80 = $320!

So the radiator only cost him $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic charged $50 an hour for 3 hours of work, so that's $50 * 3 = $150.

Adding it all up, Mark paid $80 + $150 = $230.

"Let's crack this case! We know Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they're all chickens or cows. Chickens have two legs, cows have four, and together they have 70 legs.  

To figure out how many chickens there are, we can think like detectives. If all 20 animals were chickens, they'd have 40 legs (20 x 2 = 40). That's not enough!  Since we have 70 legs, the rest must come from cows.

Let's try a few combinations. If we have 10 cows (10 x 4 = 40 legs) and 10 chickens (10 x 2 = 20 legs), that adds up to 60 legs.  We need 10 more legs, so let's swap a cow for two chickens.

Now we have 9 cows (9 x 4 = 36 legs) and 11 chickens (11 x 2 = 22 legs). That's 58 legs. We're getting closer! Let's swap another cow for two chickens.

Now we have 8 cows (8 x 4 = 32 legs) and 12 chickens (12 x 2 = 24 legs). That's 56 legs. Almost there!

One more swap: 7 cows (7 x 4 = 28 legs) and 13 chickens (13 x 2 = 26 legs). That gives us 54 legs.

Finally, let's swap one last cow for two chickens: 6 cows (6 x 4 = 24 legs) and 14 chickens (14 x 2 = 28 legs). That's 52 legs.

We need to keep going! Let's try 5 cows (5 x 4 = 20 legs) and 15 chickens (15 x 2 = 30 legs). That's 50 legs.

One more swap: 4 cows (4 x 4 = 16 legs) and 16 chickens (16 x 2 = 32 legs). That's 48 legs.

Keep going! 3 cows (3 x 4 = 12 legs) and 17 chickens (17 x 2 = 34 legs). That's 46 legs.

Almost there! 2 cows (2 x 4 = 8 legs) and 18 chickens (18 x 2 = 36 legs). That's 44 legs.

Finally! 1 cow (1 x 4 = 4 legs) and 19 chickens (19 x 2 = 38 legs). That's 42 legs.

We need to go one more step: 0 cows and 20 chickens (20 x 2 = 40 legs). That's not enough legs!

So, the answer is **5**.

"Hey there!  Let's see... 7 pizzas times 8 slices each is 56 slices total.  Since there are 4 people, they each get 56 divided by 4, which is 14 slices.
