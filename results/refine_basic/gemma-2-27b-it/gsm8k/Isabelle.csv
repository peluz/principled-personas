"Okay, let's break this down!

Josh spent a total of $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000 on the house.

The repairs increased the value by 150%, meaning the house is now worth $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000 more than he bought it for.

That brings the total value to $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

His profit is the difference: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

$70,000

"
"Let's figure this out! Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 40 cups. Since each chicken needs 3 cups a day, and she has 20 chickens, she needs a total of 60 cups.  That means she needs to give them 20 more cups in the final meal.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Since every other glass is discounted, Kylar is basically buying pairs of glasses for $5 + $3 = $8. He needs 16 glasses, which is 8 pairs. So, the total cost would be 8 pairs * $8/pair = $64.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times that amount, then Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.  

To find the total, we add up the sheep from all three cities: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.



"
"Oh, that's a bummer about the update! Let's see... she downloaded 40% of the file, which is 80 GB, and that took 40 minutes. Then she had to wait 20 minutes for the update.  After that, she has 120 GB left to download, which will take another 60 minutes.  

So, in total, it took her 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

John drives 180 miles out (3 hours * 60 mph).  Then he spends 2 hours stuck, so he's still 180 miles away. He covers another 15 miles at 30 mph (0.5 hours * 30 mph). That leaves him 165 miles from home (180 - 15).

Finally, he drives at 80 mph for 1.5 hours, covering 120 miles (1.5 hours * 80 mph).

So, he ends up 45 miles from home (165 - 120).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Eliza's earnings.  

She makes $10 an hour for her first 40 hours, so that's 40 * $10 = $400.

She worked 5 hours of overtime, and her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour. So her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

Adding her regular pay and overtime pay, Eliza earned a total of $400 + $60 = $460 this week.


$460 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

The program had 60 downloads the first month.  The second month it had three times that, so 60 * 3 = 180 downloads. But then the third month it went down by 30%, which is 180 * 0.30 = 54 downloads less. So that means the third month had 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Adding all three months together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads total.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Toula spent. 

* Those donuts cost 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204
* The mini cupcakes were 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160
* And the mini cheesecakes were 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330

Adding those all up, Toula spent a total of $204 + $160 + $330 = $694. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

It costs $3 each year to take care of the tree, but Carlos makes $10.50 selling the lemons. That means he makes a profit of $7.50 every year. To make back the $90 it cost to plant the tree, it will take him 12 years.

"Let's break this down!  

If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that's after selling some, we need to work backwards. Think of it like this:

* **Before the orange house:** She had 5 + the amount she sold at the orange house. That amount was half of what she had left *before* the red house.
* **Before the red house:** She had double the amount she had left after selling to the red house, plus 2 (the extra she sold there).
* **Before the green house:** She had triple the amount she had left after selling to the green house.

Let me know if you want to work through the math together! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so 20% of the students are doing contemporary, which is 20 students * 0.20 = 4 students. That leaves 20 students - 4 students = 16 students.

Then, 25% of those remaining students do jazz, so that's 16 students * 0.25 = 4 students.

That means 16 students - 4 students = 12 students are doing hip-hop.

To find the percentage, we do (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%.

"
"Hi there!  Let's see, the merchant wants to make the most money, right?  

Okay, so the jewelry will make a profit of $5000 * 0.025 = $125.

The electronic gadgets will make a profit of $8000 * 0.012 = $96.

Definitely go with the jewelry! It'll bring in more profit this month.

"Hi there!  

Let's see... each train travels 80 miles west and then 150 miles north. To find the total distance, we just add those together: 80 + 150 = 230 miles.

So the answer is 230. 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Jill's salary. 

She makes $20 an hour teaching and works 35 hours a week doing that, so she earns $20 * 35 = $700 each week from teaching.

As a cheerleading coach, she earns $30 an hour for 15 hours a week, bringing in $30 * 15 = $450 weekly.

That means she makes a total of $700 + $450 = $1150 every week.

Over a year, with 50 weeks of work, her total salary is $1150 * 50 = $57500.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Marissa wants to average 4 miles per hour over the whole 12-mile trail.  She's already walked 6 miles in 2 hours. That means she has 6 miles left to go and only 1 hour to do it in.  To cover those last 6 miles in an hour, she needs to walk at 6 miles per hour.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

So, the orange drink has 6.67 liters of water in it (10 liters * 2/3 = 6.67 liters). The pineapple drink has 9 liters of water (15 liters * 3/5 = 9 liters).  

Oops, you spilled some! That leaves 9 liters of orange drink.  

Adding the water from both drinks, we get 15.67 liters total (6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters).


15.67 

"
"Let's see... Samantha is 31, and Raymond is older by 6 years, making him 37.  Raymond had his son when he was 23, so his son is 37 - 23 = 14 years old. That means Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"Hmm, let's see... the candle burns for four hours, and it gets 2 centimeters shorter each hour.  So, it'll be 2 times 4, which is 8 centimeters shorter! 



"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If $19.50 is 75% of the original price (because of that 25% discount), we can set up a simple equation.  

If 0.75x = $19.50, then to find the original price (x), we divide both sides by 0.75.

That means the original price was $26.00.

"
"Let's figure this out!  

Marie spent $12 on chicken, $15 on milk (5 packs x $3), and $6 on apples (4 apples x $1.50), for a total of $33. That means the pizza cost $17 ($50 - $33). Since each pizza box is $8.50, she must have bought 2 boxes ($17 / $8.50).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Mishka spent. 

She bought 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each, so that's 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.

Then she got 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each, which is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

Finally, she bought 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each, making it 3 * $42 = $126.00.

To find the total, we add up all the costs: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00


$243.00
"
"Let's figure this out! Cynthia needs enough ice cream for 60 days, and each carton has 15 servings. That means she'll need 60 / 15 = 4 cartons of ice cream. Since each carton costs $4.00, her total spending will be 4 * $4.00 = $16.00. 


$16.00
"
"Let's see... Henry's second stop was 15 miles from the end of his 60-mile trip, so he stopped at mile 45.  He made his first stop at mile 20. That means he biked 25 miles between stops!

"
"Let's break this down!  One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice that, so they cost $33 * 2 = $66. Together, the heels cost $33 + $66 = $99. Since the boots cost $5 more than the heels, they must be $99 + $5 = $104.

$104 

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Since Darrell and Allen's ages are in a ratio of 7:11, we know their age difference is represented by 11 - 7 = 4 parts of that ratio.

Their total age is 162, and that represents 7 + 11 = 18 parts of the ratio.

One part of the ratio is equal to 162 / 18 = 9 years.

Allen is 11 parts of the ratio, so he's currently 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* The second friend said 20 more than half of the first friend's guess, so that's 80 / 2 + 20 = 60.
* The third friend said 25% more than the first friend's guess, which is 80 * 0.25 + 80 = 100.

Adding up all the guesses, we get 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.  

Dividing by 3 to find the average, we get 240 / 3 = 80. 

80 

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If John spends half an hour on each of his 10 dogs, that's 5 hours a day taking care of them (0.5 * 10 = 5).  Over a whole week, that adds up to 35 hours (5 * 7 = 35).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can think of it like this:

* **Silver coins:**  Let's say Gretchen has 'x' silver coins.
* **Gold coins:** She'd have 'x + 30' gold coins.

Since she has 110 coins total, we can write an equation: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2: x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  

To find the number of gold coins, we add 30: 40 + 30 = 70


Gretchen has 70 gold coins. 

"
"Let's figure this out!  

If Raymond has 40 jewels, then half of that is 20 jewels. Aaron has 5 more than that, so he has 25 jewels. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, meaning she has 23 jewels.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more than that, which is 1 extra point. So, he scored 5 points in the second half.  That means he scored a total of 9 points.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he'll eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts. Since the yogurts are sold in packs of 4 for $5.00, he'll need 60 / 4 = 15 packs. That means he'll spend 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt. 


$75.00
"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  John sold enough Lego sets to buy video games and have $5 leftover. That means he had $165 before buying the games ($160 spent on games + $5 leftover).  Since each Lego set sold for $15, he sold 11 sets ($165 / $15 per set = 11 sets). If he started with 13 sets and sold 11, he has 2 Lego sets left!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.  The other two days, he runs half that time, which is 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

That means he runs a total of 1.5 hours/day * 2 days = 3 hours on those shorter runs.

In total, he runs for 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours each week.

To find his speed, we divide his total miles by his total time: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

So John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half her running speed, so she runs at 6 miles per hour.  Since she runs four times faster than she walks, she walks at 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends 2 hours running (one-third of 6 hours) and 4 hours walking (two-thirds of 6 hours).

In those 2 hours of running, she covers 12 miles (6 miles/hour * 2 hours).

During her 4 hours of walking, she covers 6 miles (1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours).

Adding those together, Dana travels a total of 18 miles.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's, so it's 1 * 2 = 2 years old. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, making it 2 * 4 = 8 years old.

"
"Let's see... Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet normally, but the gemstone lets her throw it three times farther! That's 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. Since the dragon's fire only reaches 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away and still hit it.

"
"Let's see... Grandma made 5 pies with 8 slices each, so that's 5 * 8 = 40 slices in total. If there were 14 slices left, then the guests ate 40 - 14 = 26 slices.

"
"Hmm, let me see...  Okay, so you have 200 calories left and each serving of chips is 250 calories. That means you can only have a portion of a serving.  Since a bag has 5 servings and is 300 grams, one serving is 60 grams.  You can have 0.8 servings, so that's 0.8 * 60 grams = 48 grams of chips.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out Charlie's profit. 

He needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). That'll cost him $20.00 (2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00).

If he sells all 20 candles at $2.00 each, he'll make $40.00 (20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00).

So, his profit is $20.00 ($40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00).


$20.00 

"
"Let's break this down!

Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 more articles than Monday, for a total of 5 + 2 = 7 articles. On Wednesday, she doubled her Tuesday output, writing 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

In total, she wrote 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Candice started with 80 Post-it notes and used 220, leaving her with 23.  To find out how many were in the package, we need to see how many she had in total before using any.  

She had 80 + 220 = 300 Post-it notes total.

Then, we subtract the ones she had left over: 300 - 23 = 277

So, the package had 277 Post-it notes.

"
"Okay, let's break this down! John bought 5 blue ties since he spent $200 and each blue tie costs $40. He bought twice as many red ties, so that's 10 red ties.  Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, meaning they cost $60 each.  So, the red ties cost him 10 * $60 = $600. In total, he spent $200 + $600 = $800 on ties.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to know how many inches are in 4 feet: that's 4 times 12, which equals 48 inches.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Lloyd sells each dozen for $2 and he gets 252 eggs a day, that's 1764 eggs a week (252 x 7).  Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, he makes 147 dozen a week (1764 / 12).  That means he earns $294 each week (147 x 2).


294 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Tom travels for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, so he goes 30 miles (10 x 3 = 30).  On the way back, he's going slower at 6 miles per hour.  To find out how long that takes, we divide the distance by his speed: 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.


5 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Uriah needs to take out 15 pounds total. His comic books weigh a quarter pound each, and he's getting rid of 30 of them, so that's 7.5 pounds right there (30 x 0.25 = 7.5).  That means he needs to take out another 7.5 pounds of toys (15 - 7.5 = 7.5). Since each toy weighs half a pound, he needs to remove 15 toys (7.5 / 0.5 = 15).


15 

"
"Let's figure out how much more the mechanic made on the day with higher earnings.

On Thursday, they made $60 per truck tire and repaired 6, so that's 6 * $60 = $360. They also made $40 per car tire and repaired 4, so that's 4 * $40 = $160.  In total, they made $360 + $160 = $520 on Thursday.

On Friday, they only repaired car tires, earning 12 * $40 = $480.

The mechanic made $520 - $480 = $40 more on Thursday.


$40 

"
"Oh my gosh, that's so many kittens!  Let's see... Mom said Patchy had three times as many kittens as the seven we brought home, so that's 7 times 3, which is 21 kittens! And Trixie had 12.  So in total, that's 21 plus 12, which is 33 kittens from our cats, plus the 7 we adopted... that makes a grand total of 40 kittens!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we need to calculate the delivery fee: $40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00.

Then, add that to the original price and the delivery fee: $40.00 + $10.00 + $3.00 = $53.00.

Finally, add the tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

So the final price of Stephen's groceries was $57.00.

"Ooh, raspberries! Let's see... six clusters of twenty is 120 raspberries. Plus 67 more scattered around? That makes a total of 187 yummy raspberries! 



"
"Hmm, let's see...  There are 25 oranges in total, and we need to figure out how many are good.  

One is bad, 20% are unripe (which is 5 oranges), and 2 are sour. That means there are 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges that aren't good.

So, 25 - 8 = 17 oranges must be good!

"
"Let's break down the cost:

* The brooch materials cost $500.
* The jeweler charged $800 to make it.
* Insurance was 10% of the total cost so far, which is $500 + $800 = $1300.
*  10% of $1300 is $130.

Adding it all up: $500 + $800 + $130 = $1430


$1430 

"
"Let's break this down! Marcy gets a base pension of $50,000 per year. After 20 years, she starts getting an extra 5% of that amount each year. Since she quits after 30 years, she'll get the bonus for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10).

That bonus is $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500 per year.

So, her total annual pension will be $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500. 


$52,500
"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Aleena pays $140 a month for the first six months, so that's $140 * 6 = $840.

For the next six months, she gets a 10% discount, which is $140 * 0.10 = $14 off her monthly bill.

That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the last six months, totaling $126 * 6 = $756.

Adding the two halves together, Aleena pays a total of $840 + $756 = $1596 for the whole year.

"
"Ooh, a treasure chest full of gems! Let's see... they had 175 diamonds, which is sparkly!  There were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so that's 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.  And there were twice as many emeralds as rubies, so that's 140 * 2 = 280 emeralds.  

Adding them all up, there were 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 gems in total! 



"
"Hmm, let's see... If there are twice as many boys as girls, that means there are 60 girls * 2 = 120 boys.  That's a lot of boys!  

So there are 120 boys + 60 girls = 180 students in total.  

Since there are 5 students for every teacher, there must be 180 students / 5 students per teacher = 36 teachers.

She teaches 5 classes each weekday, so that's 5 classes/day * 5 weekdays = 25 classes.

Then she adds 8 more on Saturday, for a total of 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

With 15 students in each class, she has 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Finally, at $15 per student, she makes 495 students * $15.00/student = $7425.00 in a week.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money Tommy raises. He sells each brownie for $3 and he sold 43 of them, so that's 43 * $3 = $129.  He sells each cheesecake slice for $4 and sold 23, so that's 23 * $4 = $92.  

To find the total, we add the brownie money and the cheesecake money: $129 + $92 = $221.

So Tommy raises $221 for his charity! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

So Shiela's buying five phones at $150 each, which means the phones alone cost $750.  Then there's a 2% interest charge on each phone, so that's $3 extra per phone, or $15 total.  

Adding the interest to the phone cost, she'll pay $765 total.  Since she's paying over three months, her monthly payment will be $255. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Artie makes. 

Since he's rounding to the nearest dollar, marigolds are $3, petunias are $2, and begonias are $2.

* He sells 12 marigolds for a total of 12 * $3 = $36
* He sells 9 petunias for a total of 9 * $2 = $18
* He sells 17 begonias for a total of 17 * $2 = $34

Adding those up, Artie makes $36 + $18 + $34 = $88 today.

"Hi! Let's figure this out.  If the top level is 16 square feet and each level is half the size of the one below it, we can work our way down:

* The third level would be 16 * 2 = 32 square feet.
* The second level would be 32 * 2 = 64 square feet.
* The bottom level would be 64 * 2 = 128 square feet.

To find the average, we add up all the levels (16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240) and divide by the number of levels (240 / 4 = 60).

The average square footage of a level is 60. 



"
"Let's figure this out!  

The puppy eats 1 cup a day for the first 180 days, so that's 180 cups. Then it eats 2 cups a day for the rest of the year, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. That's another 370 cups (2 x 185).

In total, Cecilia needs 550 cups (180 + 370). Since each bag has 110 cups, she'll need 5 bags (550 / 110).

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half as much, he does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.  

Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, meaning David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.

That means Raymond does 200 - 100 = 100 pounds more laundry than David.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Vincent can save. 

Buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 would cost 18 / 3 = 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.00.

Buying them in packages of 2 would cost 18 / 2 = 9 packages * $1.00 per package = $9.00.

That means Vincent saves $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00 by choosing the packages of 2.


$6.00

"
"Let's see... Gene's been on vacation four times a year since he was 23, and he's now 34. That means he's been on vacation for 11 years (34 - 23 = 11).  So he has 44 shirts in total (11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations).

44 

"
"Let's see... the alarm rang 4 times the first time. The second time it rang three times longer, so that's 4 * 3 = 12 times.  The third time it rang half as long as the second time, which is 12 / 2 = 6 times.  In total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Sylvie gets a 10% raise every year after five years.  

* After one year, her salary will be $600 + ($600 * 0.10) = $660.
* After two years, it'll be $660 + ($660 * 0.10) = $726.
* After three years, it'll be $726 + ($726 * 0.10) = $798.60.


So her annual salary after three more years will be $798.60. 

"
"Let's think about this! If Marilyn sold 10 times more than Harald, that means Harald's sales were a tenth of the total.  So, we can find Harald's sales by dividing the total sales by 11: 88,000 copies / 11 = 8,000 copies.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  Since not everyone shows up, Christina only needs enough for 12 people (16 friends x 3/4).  She needs 9 gift bags total (12 people x 0.75 gift bags per person). That means she'll spend $18 on gift bags (9 gift bags x $2 per bag).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much potato salad Ted needs.

Okay, so adults eat 10 pounds each, and there are 20 adults, so that's 10 * 20 = 200 pounds of potato salad right there.

Kids eat half as much, so they'll eat 10 / 2 = 5 pounds each. With 5 kids, that's 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

In total, Ted needs 200 + 25 = 225 pounds of potato salad!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Lee is super fast, running the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Gerald used to be a bit slower, but his new diet is making him quicker. Since Lee was 2 seconds faster, Gerald's old time was 40 seconds.  

A 10% improvement means Gerald shaved off 4 seconds (40 x 0.10 = 4).  

So, with his awesome new diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  If there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, that means there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats.  

That's a lot of cats!  

So there are 120 + 60 = 180 dogs and cats altogether.  

The problem says there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Adding them all up, there are 168 + 180 = 348 pets in the neighborhood.

"
"Hi! Let's figure this out.  

If 2 out of every 5 students are boys, that means there are 80 boys (2/5 * 200 = 80).  That leaves 120 girls (200 - 80 = 120).

If 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, then 80 girls are Girl Scouts (2/3 * 120 = 80).

That means 40 girls aren't in the Girl Scouts (120 - 80 = 40).

"
"Let's see... if the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, one can of tomatoes makes 8 ounces of sauce.  Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so she must have used 32 ounces / 8 ounces/can = 4 cans of tomatoes. Since each can has 3 tomatoes, she used a total of 4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes.

"Hmm, let's see... Poppy put down a quarter of the pieces, so that's 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.  That leaves 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces. Then her mom put down a third of those, which is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.  So altogether they put down 250 + 250 = 500 pieces. That means there are 1000 - 500 = 500 pieces left.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Each box has its outer dimensions reduced by 2 inches total (1 inch on each side) because of the walls. So, the inside of each box is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

"
"Let's see... Frankie watched 2 hours of TV on Monday and Tuesday, 1.5 hours on Thursday, and 2 hours on Friday. That's a total of 5.5 hours.  Since he watched 7 hours in all, he must have watched 1.5 hours on Wednesday.  

Since each 30-minute episode is half an hour, he watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

So, the gas costs $3.00 per gallon, and they get $0.20 back for each gallon. That means for 10 gallons, the cashback is $2.00 (10 x $0.20).  

If the gas would normally cost $30.00 (10 x $3.00), taking off the $2.00 cashback makes the final price $28.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Julia rows 20 feet every 16 seconds.  That means she rows at a speed of 1.25 feet per second (20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second).

It takes her 64 seconds to get to shore, so she rows a total of 80 feet (64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet).

The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. Since she rows 80 feet, it takes on 16 liters of water (80 feet / 10 feet/intake * 2 liters/intake = 16 liters).

"Let's figure out Sasha's profit!

* **2x4s:** She has 10 boards that originally cost $10 each, so that's 10 * $10 = $100. With the price increase, she can sell them for $15 each, making 10 * $15 = $150.

* **4x4s:** She has 5 boards that originally cost $16 each, for a total of 5 * $16 = $80.  She can now sell them for $24 each, bringing in 5 * $24 = $120.

* **Total Earnings:** She'll make $150 from the 2x4s + $120 from the 4x4s = $270.

* **Profit:**  Her total profit is $270 (earnings) - $180 (original cost) = $90.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If Katy uses sugar and water in a 7:13 ratio, that means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.  

If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined, we need to see what part of that 120 represents the sugar.

Think of it like this: 7 parts sugar + 13 parts water = 20 total parts

Each ""part"" is worth 120 / 20 = 6

So, Katy used 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

Adrien earned 30% more than Lylah, so if we think of Lylah's salary as 100%, Adrien's was 130%.  That means four years ago, Adrien was making $40,000, which represents 130% of Lylah's salary. To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we can divide Adrien's salary by 1.30: $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

Now, Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago, so his new salary is $40,000 + (0.40 * $40,000) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased, and since it was originally $30,769.23, her new salary is $30,769.23 + (0.30 * $30,769.23) = $40,000.

Finally, to find their combined salary, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries: $56,000 + $40,000 = $96,000.

* Dillon buys 4 watermelons for a total of 4 * $45 = $180.
* He buys 20 peppers for a total of 20 * $15 = $300.
* He buys 10 oranges for a total of 10 * $40 = $400.

Adding it all up, Dillon spends $180 + $300 + $400 = $880 at the store.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

The hospital sees 500 patients a day at 24 minutes each, so that's 12,000 minutes of doctor time total.  That's equal to 200 hours (12,000 minutes / 60 minutes per hour).

The doctors cost the hospital $150 per hour, so that's $30,000 for the day (200 hours * $150/hour).

They charge patients $200 per hour, bringing in $40,000 (200 hours * $200/hour).

Subtract the cost from the revenue and you get a profit of $10,000!

If there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens, we can think of it like this:

* Imagine the queens are 1 group.
* The babies are 2 groups (twice as many as the queens).
* The workers are 4 groups (twice as many as the babies).

That means there are 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 groups of bees in total.

Since there are 700 bees altogether, each group has 700 / 7 = 100 bees.

The worker bees are 4 groups, so there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.

Since he gets 100 pineapples per hectare and has 10 hectares, that's 1000 pineapples per harvest (100 x 10 = 1000). And because he harvests every 3 months, he'll harvest 4 times a year (12 months / 3 months = 4).

So, in a year, he can harvest a whopping 4000 pineapples (1000 x 4 = 4000)!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The bigger set has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. The smallest set has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

In total, Johnny picks up 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 Lego pieces.

"Let's break this down!

* First, 30 bees left, and then half that number, 15 bees, came back.
* Then, twice the original number, 60 bees, flew out.
* That means a total of 90 bees left the hive during the day.
* Since all the bees that left eventually came back, 90 bees returned in the last 6 hours.

"Let's break this down! Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, and that's three times more than Dorothy. So Dorothy has 12 / 3 = 4 friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, meaning he has 4 * 4 = 16 friends.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we need to know how long it takes each of them to get home. Steve has to go 3 miles, which is 15,840 feet (3 x 5280).  He bikes at 440 feet per minute, so it takes him 15,840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim goes 2 miles, or 10,560 feet (2 x 5280). He skateboards at 264 feet per minute, so it takes him 10,560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

That means Steve gets home 4 minutes before Tim. 



"
"Let's see... 5 bikes with 2 tires each is 10 tires. Then there are 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 9 more tires. And don't forget the unicycle! That's 1 more tire.  So in total, that's 20 tires.

At 25 cents per tire, Shawnda made 20 * $0.25 = $5.00! 


$5.00
"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Carl has 60 cookies in total (10 packs * 6 cookies/pack).  That means the cookies cost $6.00 (60 cookies * $0.10/cookie). If he pays with a $10 bill, his change is $4.00 ($10.00 - $6.00).

"
"Oh my gosh, that's a lot of fries! Let's see... Dave ate 14, the seagull ate half of that, which is 7. So together they ate 21 fries. Then those pesky pigeons came along and ate 9 more! That leaves 12 fries. The raccoon was a real glutton, taking two-thirds of those, which is 8 fries.  That leaves 4 fries.  And then the ants got the last one, leaving 5 behind.  

Working backwards, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries before the ants, 6 + 8 = 14 before the raccoon, 14 + 9 = 23 before the pigeons, and 23 + 21 = 44 fries originally! 



"
"Let's break this down! Kimo has 9 hours of class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays (3 classes x 1 hour/class x 3 days). He has 8 hours of class on Tuesdays and Thursdays (2 classes x 2 hours/class x 2 days). That's a total of 17 hours per week. Over a 16-week semester, he spends 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours in class.

"
"Okay, let's see... Bill makes a lot of yummy treats!  

* He makes 300 rolls at 4 inches each, so that's 300 * 4 = 1200 inches of rolls.
* His 120 croissants are 6 inches long, for a total of 120 * 6 = 720 inches.
* And those 60 baguettes are each 2 feet long, which is 2 * 12 = 24 inches each. That's 60 * 24 = 1440 inches of baguette!

Adding it all up: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches of deliciousness.

But the question asks for feet, so we divide by 12: 3360 / 12 = 280 feet.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field, so he runs 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, which is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. In total, she runs 100 + 2720 = 2820 yards.

Kelly runs 2820 - 1500 = 1320 yards farther than Blake.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Raphael spent. 

He bought 4 pens at $1.50 each, so that's 4 * $1.50 = $6.00.

He also got 2 notebooks at $4.00 each, which is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

And finally, the bond paper cost $20.00.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Finn starts with 11 tadpoles. Then 6 more pop up, so that's 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. But then 2 hide, so we do 17 - 2 = 15.  

Finn can see 15 tadpoles now.

"Hi there! Let's see... Anakin caught a bunch of sea creatures: 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer seahorses, and 2 more clownfish.  

To find the total, we need to figure out how many Locsin caught, then add them all up!

Locsin caught 5 starfish (10 - 5 = 5), 3 seahorses (6 - 3 = 3), and 5 clownfish (3 + 2 = 5).

That means Locsin caught 13 sea creatures in total (5 + 3 + 5 = 13).

Anakin caught 19 sea creatures (10 + 6 + 3 = 19).

Together, they caught 32 sea creatures (19 + 13 = 32)!

"Ooh, this is a tricky one! Let's see... the price goes up by 20% every two months, so over 36 months, that's 18 increases.  Each increase is $4, so after all those increases, the bag of marbles would cost $92. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much all the toys cost.  

We know each red car costs $4, and there are 5 of them, so those cost $20 in total.  Each action figure costs $5, and there are 3, so those cost $15. The doll costs the same as 3 action figures, which is also $15.

Adding it all up: $20 + $15 + $15 = $50

All the toys together cost $50! 



"
"Hmm, let's see. If Jackie loses $35 for every hour of freelance work she misses, and she'd miss 3 hours doing her own taxes, that's $35 * 3 = $105 in lost income.  Since the accountant costs $90, she'd actually have $105 - $90 = $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can think of it like this: if Brooke is 1 year old, Seth is 2 years old.  

We know that in two years, their ages added together will be 28. So, let's try adding 2 to each of their ages (since it's in two years) and see if we can find a combination that works.

If Brooke is 8 now, Seth is 16. In two years, Brooke will be 10 and Seth will be 18.  10 + 18 = 28! That's it!

Seth is 16 years old. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. If Ethel has $8, and Jimmy has $2 more than twice that amount, we need to do a little math. Twice Ethel's money is $8 * 2 = $16.  Then, $2 more than that is $16 + $2 = $18.

So Jimmy has $18.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  Sally Thirtytwo is 8, and Sally Four is the same age, so Sally Four is also 8. Granny Red is twice Sally Four's age, so she's 8 * 2 = 16. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, making her 16 + 3 = 19.  

To find the total age, we add up the ages of all four birds: 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51.

"
"Hi there! Let's help Jessica figure this out. 

First, we add up all her minimum payments: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000.

Since she wants to pay 50% more, we calculate that extra amount: $1000 * 0.50 = $500.

Now, we add the extra amount to her total minimum payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500 per month.

Finally, to find her yearly payment, we multiply her monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18000.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money Zaid has left. 

First, we need to see how much he spends on rent and fuel:

* Rent: (1/4) * $6000 = $1500
* Fuel: (1/3) * $6000 = $2000

That's a total of $1500 + $2000 = $3500.

He has $6000 - $3500 = $2500 left.

He donates half of that, which is $2500 / 2 = $1250.

Now, let's add up all his expenses: $3500 (rent and fuel) + $1250 (donation) + $200 (daughter) + $700 (wife) = $5650

Finally, subtract his total expenses from his salary: $6000 - $5650 = $350


Zaid will have $350 left.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer than Bo, so Monic has 36 crabs. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, meaning Rani has 46 crabs.

"Okay, let's break this down!

If Jan is 30, two years ago she was 28.  Half of that is 14.  Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than that, making him 19. That means Mark is currently 21. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, she's 23.

"Okay, let's break this down!

The faster team runs each 400 meters in 55 seconds, so their total time is 55 seconds/runner * 4 runners = 220 seconds.

The other team's first runner takes 60 seconds.  Each of the next runners is 3 seconds faster, so they run in 57, 54, and 51 seconds. That means their total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The faster team wins by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

There are three numbers on a die bigger than 3 (4, 5, and 6), so there's a 50% chance of rolling one.  

To get two even numbers in a row, you need to roll an even number, then another even number. Each of those has a 50% chance, so the chance of both happening is 25%.

That means rolling a number bigger than 3 is 25% *more* likely.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

They spent $20.25 on tickets and $4.50 less on food, so food cost $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The rides cost $33 each, and they went on two, so that's $33 x 2 = $66.

In total, they spent $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

If they split that evenly, each person pays $102 / 3 = $34.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Tom starts with 50 trees. Each year he adds 10 and takes away 2, so that's a net gain of 8 trees per year. Over 10 years, that's 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.

So he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees. But then 30% die, which is 130 trees * 0.30 = 39 trees.

That means he has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out together.  Elaine starts with 20 cards, then gets three times that amount, so that's 20 * 3 = 60 more cards. In the second month, she gets 20 fewer than the first month, meaning she gets 60 - 20 = 40 cards.  

Now, for the third month, she gets twice the amount from the first two months combined, which is 60 + 40 = 100 cards.  Twice that is 100 * 2 = 200 cards!

Finally, to find her total, we add up all the cards: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards. Wow, that's a lot of Pokemon cards!

Publisher B pays double, so they pay him $0.10 per sentence.  He also edits 500 sentences for them, so he makes 500 * $0.10 = $50 from Publisher B.

In total, Mark makes $25 + $50 = $75 each week.  That's 7500 cents!

"Let's break this down!  

If we let 'r' be the number of red chickens and 'w' be the number of white chickens, we know a couple of things:

* There are two more white chickens than red chickens, so w = r + 2.
* All the chickens together lay 42 eggs a day, and red chickens lay 3 eggs each while white chickens lay 5. That means 3r + 5w = 42.

We can use these facts to figure out how many red chickens Jerry has. Let's substitute 'r + 2' for 'w' in the second equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplifying that gives us:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combining like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Finally, dividing both sides by 8:

r = 4


Jerry has **4** red chickens.

Think about it this way: the big pool is losing water at the same rate as the small pool, but it started with more.  Since it now has *four times* as much water, that means the small pool must have lost a good chunk of its water in those four minutes.

If we think about it in reverse, four minutes ago the big pool had *twice* as much water as the small pool. That means the small pool has lost enough water in those four minutes for the big pool to catch up and have four times as much.

Hmm... I think the small pool must have 8 gallons now.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Lori needs to save $320 for the shoes plus $32 for the belt, so that's a total of $352. If she makes $8 an hour, she'll need to work $352 / $8 = 44 hours.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Janeth owes $2000 plus 10% interest, which is $200. That means she needs to pay back a total of $2200.

If she pays $165 each month for 12 months, she'll have paid $165 * 12 = $1980.

Subtracting that from the total amount owed, she'll still have $2200 - $1980 = $220 left to pay.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Harriet is 21 now, and Adrian is three times her age, so he's 21 * 3 = 63 years old. Zack is twice Harriet's age, making him 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

In three years, Harriet will be 24, Adrian will be 66, and Zack will be 45.  That means their total age will be 24 + 66 + 45 = 135.  

To find the average, we divide the total age by 3: 135 / 3 = 45.

So the average age of the three in three years will be 45. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure out Jojo's score.  

Naomi scored 68 points, and Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, which is 34 + 10 = 44 points. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she got 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Together, Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since the four students scored a total of 251 points, Jojo must have scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Celine started with 120 liters and used 90, leaving her with 30 liters.  Then she collected double that amount in rainwater, which is 60 liters.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Carlos and Benji spend. Carlos pays $30 per hour for his canoe and uses it for 3 hours, so that's $30 * 3 = $90. Benji pays $18 per hour for his raft and uses it for 5 hours, so his cost is $18 * 5 = $90.  

Adding their costs together, they'll pay $90 + $90 = $180 in total.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If it takes 6 days by bus, and half that time by car, then the car trip is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out together.  

Okay, so James starts with 32 water type cards (40 - 8). He also has 34 grass type cards (20 + 14) and still has his 30 fire type cards. That means he has a total of 96 cards (32 + 34 + 30).

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100%. So, (32 / 96) * 100% = 33.33%.

Rounding that to the nearest integer, the chance is about 33%!

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Chad owes.  

Okay, so the burrito itself is $6.50. Then he adds $2.00 for extra meat, $1.00 for cheese, $1.00 for avocado, and $0.50 for the two sauces. That brings his total to $11.00.

Adding the $3.00 meal upgrade for chips and a drink makes it $14.00. But wait, he has a $5.00 gift card!

So, $14.00 minus $5.00 is $9.00.

Chad still owes $9.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Mark buys 12 cars at $20,000 each, so that's 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.  Then he has to pay 10% tax on that, which is $240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000.  So the cars and tax together cost $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000.  

But wait, there's more! He also has to pay $1000 to register each car, and that's 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

Adding it all up, Mark pays $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000 for everything.

"Okay, let's figure this out! Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes a day, and his girlfriend eats half that amount, so she eats 3. Together, that's 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes a day.  

Since there are 7 days in a week, they need 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes per week.

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, so they'll need 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

Then, 420 students went out through exit B (3/5 * 700 = 420).

That means 280 students must have used exit C (700 - 420 = 280).

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but now he only has 3.  Each of those pen pals sends him 2 letters a week, and he writes 2 back. That means he's writing and receiving 3 pen pals * 2 letters/pen pal * 2 = 12 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so that's 12 letters * 5 pages/letter = 60 pages a week.

If he writes a page every 6 minutes, then he spends 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes writing each week.

That's equal to 360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours of writing.

Sue ate a lot of cookies! On Monday, she ate 4 times the 5 cookies her sister had, so that's 20 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate double her sister's 13 cookies, meaning she had 26 cookies.  

Her sister ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies in total. That's 46 - 18 = 28 more cookies than her sister.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate 28 * 200 = 5600 more calories than her sister.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so the redwood is 200 feet tall and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. That means there are 20 sections (200 feet / 10 feet/section = 20 sections).

The whole tree originally weighed 8000 pounds (20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds).

Those pesky termites ate 30% of the wood, which is 2400 pounds (8000 pounds * 0.30 = 2400 pounds).

That means the redwood now weighs 5600 pounds (8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds).

If Andrea has 52 apples and that's 8 more than Jamal, then Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, meaning she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

In total, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

That means they have a combined total of 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The house costs $350,000, but there's also a 5% brokerage fee and a 12% transfer fee. That means the brokerage fee is $17,500 (5/100 * $350,000) and the transfer fee is $42,000 (12/100 * $350,000).

Adding those to the selling price, the total cost is $409,500 ($350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000).

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the house is $9,500 over her budget.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Mr. Tan's net proceeds. 

First, we need to find out how much he paid in fees:

* Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = $12,000
* Brokerage fees: 5% of $400,000 = $20,000
* Total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

Now, let's add the remaining loan amount to his fees:

* Total expenses: $32,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

Finally, subtract his total expenses from the selling price to find his net proceeds:

* Net proceeds: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000


Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house are $118,000. 

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

It takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees, and then it takes 40% longer to reach 400 degrees.  That means it takes an extra 20 * 0.40 = 8 minutes.

So, the total time to heat the oil is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

In total, from starting the oil to finishing cooking, it takes 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

That means the body, collar, and rosette together use 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches. Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, each sleeve must use (1800 - 1170) / 2 = 315 stitches.

First, Carly has 80 cards, and 2/5 of them have the letter A, so that's 32 cards (80 * (2/5) = 32).

That leaves 48 cards (80 - 32 = 48). Then, half of those have the letter B, which is 24 cards (48 * (1/2) = 24).

That means 24 cards are left (48 - 24 = 24).  Of those, 5/8 have the letter C, which is 15 cards (24 * (5/8) = 15).

Finally, that leaves 9 cards with the letter D (24 - 15 = 9).

If Ruby is 6 times older than Sam now, and in 9 years she'll be 3 times as old as Sam, we can set up a little puzzle.

Let's say Sam is ""s"" years old now. That means Ruby is 6s years old now.

In 9 years, Sam will be s + 9, and Ruby will be 6s + 9. We know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times Sam's age, so:

6s + 9 = 3(s + 9)

Let's solve for ""s"":

6s + 9 = 3s + 27
3s = 18
s = 6

So Sam is 6 years old now!

Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40, and Margot wrote 60. That's 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories in the first week.

In the second week, they each doubled their stories. So Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories. That's 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories in the second week.

 Altogether, they wrote 120 + 240 = 360 stories!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  The car in the slow lane is going 30 miles per hour (half the speed of the fast car). To travel 480 miles at that speed, it would take 16 hours. 



"
"Let's see... Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less than that, so Izzy has 17. Together they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.  Since they have 10 times less medals than the total given out, there must have been 39 x 10 = 390 medals given out in total!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so there are 40 chocolate bars in total (8 packets x 5 bars per packet). The adults get 24 bars (4 adults x 6 bars each). That leaves 16 bars for the 8 children.  

Each child gets 2 chocolate bars (16 bars / 8 children).

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Mike has 21 points, and Jim has 3 less than that, so Jim has 18 points. Tony has twice as many points as Mike, meaning he has 42 points.

After the fourth round, Mike and Tony each get an extra point because they have over 20 points.

So, let's add up all their points: 21 + 18 + 42 + 1 + 1 = 83

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

On the second day, Darren does 120 pushups, 40 squats, and 40 dumbbell presses.

That means on day two he does 120 + 40 + 40 = 200 exercises.

In total, over the two days, he does 170 + 200 = 370 exercises.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal and they eat twice a day, that's 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg of rice per person each day.

With 5 people eating, that's a total of 0.4 kg/person * 5 people = 2 kg of rice per day.

A 42 kg bag will last 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days.

That's 21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks!

"Okay, let's figure this out!

John drives 60 miles each day (30 miles to work and 30 miles back home). That's 300 miles a week (60 miles/day * 5 days/week) and a whopping 15,000 miles a year (300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year).

At $2 per mile, his mileage cost is $30,000 per year (15,000 miles * $2/mile).  

Don't forget the $150 bonus he gives his driver each month, which adds up to $1,800 per year ($150/month * 12 months/year).

Adding those together, John pays a total of $31,800 per year for his driving service.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Theo has left for gifts. 

First, let's calculate the cost of his suits: 6 suits * $100/suit = $600.

His suitcases cost 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150.

Now, his flight ticket is a bit trickier: it's $700 more than 5 times the cost of a suit, so that's (5 * $100) + $700 = $1200.

Adding up all his expenses: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

He started with $6000 and spent $1950, leaving him with $6000 - $1950 = $4050.

Since he wants to save $2000, he has $4050 - $2000 = $2050 left for gifts.

"Okay, let's break this down!

Cera is currently 46, so six years ago she was 40. Noah was half her age then, meaning he was 20.  The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, which is 60,000.  Since that was half the current population, Chile's population now is 120,000.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If we call the number of players on defense ""d"", we know there are twice as many on offense, so that's 2*d*.  Special teams has half the number of players as defense, which is *d*/2.

All together, that's d + 2*d* + *d*/2 = 105 players.

Combining the 'd' terms, we get 3.5*d* = 105.

Dividing both sides by 3.5 tells us *d* = 30.

So there are 30 players on defense! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how many people made it to Martha's party.  

She invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 people.

Then she invited 3 families with 4 people each, which is 3 * 4 = 12 more people.

That's a total of 12 + 12 = 24 people invited.

But 8 people got sick and couldn't come, and 8 / 4 = 2 people had other plans.

So, in total, 8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't make it.

That means 24 - 10 = 14 people were at the party.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep, so to find the total space it holds (the volume), we multiply those numbers together: 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet.

Since it costs $0.10 per cubic foot to fill, we multiply the volume by the price: 120 x $0.10 = $12.00.


$12.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! If there are 30 boys, and there are 3 times as many girls, that means there are 30 * 3 = 90 girls.  And if there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, there are 30 * (1/10) = 3 nongendered children.  

Adding them all up, there are 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 children in the classroom.

"
"Let's see... each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, and she needs 5 ice cubes to cool it down enough. That's 5 cubes * 12 ml/cube = 60 ml weaker just from the ice.  Then she adds 15 ml of cream, so in total, her iced coffee is 60 ml + 15 ml = 75 ml weaker.

"Hi there! Let's break down this problem. 

First, we know 40 out of the 100 employees are junior programmers because that's 2/5 of the total.  Since each junior programmer makes $2000 a month, the company pays them a total of $80,000 (40 programmers * $2000/programmer).

Senior programmers make $400 more than junior programmers, so they earn $2400 each. With 60 senior programmers, the company pays them $144,000 (60 programmers * $2400/programmer).

Adding the junior and senior programmer salaries together, the company pays a total of $224,000 per month.

"Let's see... 20 people were on the bus heading to the third stop.  Before the second stop, 7 people got off, so there were 20 + 7 = 27 people. Then, 8 people got on at the second stop, meaning there were 27 - 8 = 19 people after the first stop.  Since 5 people got on at the first stop, there must have been 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus at the terminal.

"Let's figure out which job pays Nick more after taxes!

For Job A, he'd make $15 an hour times 2000 hours, which is $30,000.  But then 20% in taxes comes out, leaving him with $24,000.

Job B pays a flat $42,000, but he has to pay $6,000 in property tax first. That leaves him with $36,000. Then, 10% tax on that is $3,600, so his take-home pay is $32,400.

Job B pays Nick $8,400 more than Job A.

"Okay, let's break this down.  Maria starts with 8 shares at $8 each, so that's 8 * $8 = $64.

The first year, the stock goes up 50%, which is like half the original price: $8 / 2 = $4. So now each share is worth $8 + $4 = $12.

The second year, the stock drops 25%, which is a quarter of the new price: $12 / 4 = $3.  That means each share is now worth $12 - $3 = $9.

Since she has 8 shares, they're worth a total of 8 * $9 = $72.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If two of the groups are the same size, and the third is 10 smaller, we can think of it like this:

*  Imagine the two bigger groups combined have 'x' students total.
* The smallest group has 'x - 10' students.
* All together, that's x + x + (x - 10) = 200 students.

Let's solve for x!

* That means 3x - 10 = 200
* Add 10 to both sides: 3x = 210
* Divide both sides by 3: x = 70

So, each of the bigger groups has 70 students. The smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can think of it like this:

* **Imagine the cows are in groups of 1.**
* **Since there are twice as many chickens, they'd be in groups of 2 for every group of cows.**

That means for every 3 animals (1 cow + 2 chickens), there are 8 legs (4 cow legs + 4 chicken legs).

Since he has 60 animals total, that's 60 / 3 = 20 groups of animals.

So, in total, there are 20 groups * 8 legs/group = 160 legs!



"
"Oh, that's a bummer about Josh dropping his balls! Let's see... he starts with 3, adds one each week for four weeks, so that's 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 balls. Then he drops 3, but 2 come back, so he's left with 6 - 3 + 2 = 5 balls.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

The pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and the blue beetle and green toad weigh the same, so they're also 50 pounds each. The yellow snake is 10 pounds heavier than the frog, making it 60 pounds. The red bird is 20 pounds lighter than the frog, so it weighs 30 pounds.

Adding up all the animals: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

Don't forget the container weighs 20 pounds, so the total weight is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Davos got a great deal! A 40% discount on a $30 shirt means he saved $12 per shirt ($30 x 0.40 = $12). So each shirt cost him $18 ($30 - $12 = $18).  Since he bought two, he paid $36 in total ($18 x 2 = $36).

"Let's see... Peyton has a busy week!  

* Yoga on Monday takes 1 hour.
* Cooking class on Tuesday is three times longer than yoga, so that's 1 * 3 = 3 hours.

* The museum tour on Thursday is half as long as the cooking class, so that's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
* And finally, errands on Friday take 2 hours.

"Let's break this down!

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so that's 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

He watched 3 shows at 2 hours each, totaling 3 * 2 = 6 hours of shows.

That means he spent 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours boating, swimming, and watching shows.

We know this 15 hours is 30% of his total vacation time.  To find the total time, we can divide: 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours.

Finally, he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so he spent 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours sightseeing.

"Let's break this down!

First, figure out how much money Billy had left after buying gumballs: he spent $2.00 on gumballs, so he had $10.00 - $2.00 = $8.00 left.

Since he spent half his change on gumballs, that means he had $8.00 * 2 = $16.00 before buying the gumballs.

That means he spent $16.00 - $10.00 = $6.00 on candy.

Finally, divide the amount spent on candy by the price per pound: $6.00 / $1.50/pound = 4 pounds of candy.

The train travels 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles between the first two cities. Then it goes 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles back to the starting city. That means each full trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this three times a day, it travels 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles every day.

To find out how many days it can go between services, we divide the total service mileage by the daily mileage: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

"Let's figure this out! A collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing (that's right in the middle of a Rottweiler's 8 pounds and a chihuahua's 2 pounds).  

So, for the chihuahuas, Mark needs 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds of stuffing.

For the collies, he needs 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds of stuffing.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

John drives 210 miles to his friend's house (200 miles + a 10-mile detour) at 70 mph, so that takes him 3 hours (210 / 70 = 3).

Then, he drives 240 miles home at 80 mph, which takes him 3 hours as well (240 / 80 = 3).

In total, his trip takes 6 hours (3 + 3 = 6).

"Okay, let's break this down!  

So, 3 people got kicked out for not wearing masks. Then, four times that many, minus 5, were kicked out for shoplifting. That's 3 * 4 - 5 = 7 shoplifters.

Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for fighting over sale items, so that's 7 * 3 = 21 people.

In total, that's 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people kicked out for those reasons.

Since 50 people were kicked out in total, that means 50 - 31 = 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

"Okay, let's figure out the total cost of these senior gifts!

*  First, the picture frames will cost 44 seniors * $20/frame = $880.
*  Etching adds 20% to each frame, so that's $20 * 0.20 = $4 extra per frame.  That means etching will cost 44 seniors * $4/frame = $176.
*  The pins are $5 each, and 2 seniors are getting them, so that's 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10.
*  There are 44 seniors / 4 = 11 officers who need cords. Those cords are $12 each, for a total of 11 officers * $12/cord = $132.

Adding it all up: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Karan borrowed $3650 for five months at 10% interest, and she pays the same amount each month, here's how to find her monthly payment:

First, we need to figure out the total interest. That's calculated by multiplying the principal ($3650) by the interest rate (10%) and the time (5 months), then dividing by 100. That comes out to $1825.

Next, we add the interest to the original amount borrowed to find the total she needs to repay: $3650 + $1825 = $5475.

Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment: $5475 / 5 = $1095.


So, Karan needs to pay $1095 each month.

Anna has 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos and 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

That means together they have 50 + 100 = 150 silver pesos and 80 + 120 = 200 gold pesos.

Adding those together, they have a total of 150 + 200 = 350 pesos!

"Okay, let's figure this out! Millie makes 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups of lemonade.  She sells each cup for $1, so she'll make $36 total. But she spent $18 on supplies, so her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells 4 cups per hour, and has 36 cups, her stand will be open for 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.  That means her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2/hour.

If their popsicle ratio is 5:6, that means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  

If they have 165 popsicles total, we need to figure out how many are in each ""part"" of the ratio.  

165 popsicles divided by 11 (5 + 6) parts equals 15 popsicles per part.

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 75 popsicles (5 x 15). Sam has 6 parts, so he has 90 popsicles (6 x 15).

That means Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty!

"Hi there! Let's see how much Tim saves.  

Hulu and Disney Plus together usually cost $20, but he gets a sweet 20% discount for bundling, so that's $20 * 0.20 = $4 off. That means his bundled price is $20 - $4 = $16.

Adding in his Netflix, his total streaming cost is $16 + $10 = $26.

Since his cable was $60, he saves a whopping $60 - $26 = $34!

"Okay, let's figure this out!  Mark needs four times the usual amount of ingredients. That means he'll need 3 cups/batch * 4 batches = 12 cups of flour. Since flour comes in 2-cup bags, he'll need 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags of flour.

For milk, he'll need 1 cup/batch * 4 batches = 4 cups.  Since milk comes in 2-cup bottles, he'll need 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

Mark needs 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

That's a total of 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.  If he only has 2,000 left to go, he must have taken 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

In June, they had 40 employees * (1/4) = 10 fewer employees, leaving 30. Their total June payroll was $2400/employee * 30 employees = $72,000.

He took a break for one day, so no kilometers there.

In the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for seven days, totaling 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

"Hi there! That's a fun problem! Let's see... Kenny had enough money to buy the ticket and have $50 left over, so he made $50 from selling his cards. If he sold each card for $1.50, that means he sold 50 / 1.5 = 33.33 cards. Since he can't sell parts of cards, he must have sold 33 cards.  He kept 1/3 of his cards, so those 33 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection.  To find the total, we can divide the number of cards he sold by 2/3: 33 / (2/3) = 49.5.

"Oh my, that's quite a tale of dragon slaying! Let's see... Prince Thaddeus slayed 100 dragons, and Prince Arthur got three-quarters of that, which is 75. Prince Walter, bless his heart, doubled Arthur's count to 150.  Poor Prince Bruce, forgetting his sword! He only managed one-fifth of Walter's total, which is 30.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  If they split 15 gallons into 5 containers, each container has 3 gallons (15 / 5 = 3). Josey needs a quarter of that, which is 0.75 gallons (3 x 0.25 = 0.75).  Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, she needs 6 pints (0.75 x 8 = 6).

"Let's see... George had $5 and has 1% left, so he spent $5 - ($5 * 0.01) = $4.95.  He spent $1.20 on chips, leaving $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 for candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.75, he bought $3.75 / $0.75 = 5 candy bars.

"
"Ooh la la, let's figure out the cost per serving of Antoine's delicious soup! 

He doubles the onions, so that's 2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.  At $2.00 a pound, those onions will cost him $8.00.  

The beef stock is $2.00 a box, and he needs two boxes, so that's another $4.00.  

In total, his soup ingredients cost $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, each serving costs $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and Wayne's drive is only 4 minutes. Bernadette's drive is four times longer than Wayne's, meaning it takes her 4 * 4 minutes = 16 minutes.  

To get there 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 16 minutes + 5 minutes = 21 minutes before him.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

First, we know the room is 3 yards long, which is the same as 9 feet (since there are 3 feet in a yard).  We also know the area is 360 square feet. To find the width, we can divide the area by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now, to find the perimeter, we add up all the sides: 9 feet + 40 feet + 9 feet + 40 feet = 98 feet.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads (20 beads) + 2 packs of clear beads (40 beads) for a total of 60 beads.

Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads (60 beads) + 4 packs of red beads (80 beads) for a total of 140 beads.

That means Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

The oven heats the house up by 5 degrees each hour for 3 hours, so that's a total of 15 degrees warmer. That brings the temperature to 55 degrees.

Then the window is open for 30 minutes, which is like half an hour. Since it cools down 2 degrees every 10 minutes, it cools down 6 degrees in total.

So, the final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down!

Jon takes 40 minutes to swim, 80 minutes to bike, and 50 minutes to run, for a total of 170 minutes. James swims 10% faster than Jon, so he takes 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes to swim.  James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.  

To find James's run time, we subtract his swim and bike times from his total time: 160 - 36 - 85 = 39 minutes.


James took 39 minutes to run. 

"
"Hmm, let me see... Movie C was an hour and a quarter long, which is 75 minutes. Movie B was 5 minutes longer than that, so it was 80 minutes.  Movie A was a quarter the length of Movie B, so it was 20 minutes long.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

First, we need to see how far the horse runs. It goes 32 miles per hour for half an hour, so that's 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

For every mile, the horse eats half a bale of hay, so it eats 16 * 0.5 = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so the hay will cost 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is 6 * $5 = $30.

That means he has $30 - $24 = $6 left over.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Joey starts with 214 points and gets 26 more, so he has 214 + 26 = 240 points. Marcy starts with 225 and gets 10 more, bringing her to 225 + 10 = 235 points.  

To see how much Joey is winning by, we subtract Marcy's score from Joey's: 240 - 235 = 5 points.

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

The salesman spent $576 on the sneakers. He made $340 from the flash sale and $775 from the department store, for a total of $1115.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we need to find out how much each balloon cost originally. If 20 balloons cost $900, then each balloon cost $900 / 20 = $45.

Then the price went up by $20, so each balloon now costs $45 + $20 = $65.

Finally, to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons, we multiply the new price by 170: $65 * 170 = $11050.


So the answer is $11050. 

"
"Hey there! To find the average speed, we need to think about the total distance traveled and the total time it took.  

The car went 60 mph for 2 hours, so that's 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then it went 30 mph for 1 hour, adding another 30 miles. That's a total of 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The whole trip took 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

So, the average speed is 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

"Let's see... Jenna starts with 8 sapphires worth $800 each, so those are worth 8 * $800 = $6400.  She trades 3 for rubies, leaving her with 5 sapphires worth 5 * $800 = $4000.  The rubies are worth $1200 each, so her 2 rubies are worth 2 * $1200 = $2400.  Adding it all up, her jewels are worth $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Bob's potting soil will cost. 

Okay, so each bed needs 2 feet x 8 feet x 2 feet = 32 cubic feet of soil. Since he has 10 beds, that's 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet total.

Each bag holds 2 cubic feet, so he'll need 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

At $12 per bag, the total cost will be 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920. 


$1920
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

If there are 60% more green cards than red cards, that means there are 15 * 0.60 = 9 more green cards.

So there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

That means there are 15 + 24 = 39 red and green cards in total.

Since there are just as many yellow cards as red and green cards combined, there are also 39 yellow cards.

Adding them all up, there are 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.

* Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
* Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
* Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
* Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Adding it all up: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds of feed.

Since his truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, he'll need 4500 / 2250 = 2 trips.

"Okay, let's figure out the cost of this romantic getaway!

The hotel is normally $1500 a night, but because it's a busy weekend, it's 20% more expensive. That means the markup is $1500 * 0.20 = $300 per night.  So, the hotel costs $1500 + $300 = $1800 per night.

For a three-night stay, the hotel will cost $1800 * 3 = $5400.

The plane tickets are $5000 each, and since there are two of them, that's $5000 * 2 = $10000.

Adding the hotel and plane ticket costs together, the total trip cost is $5400 + $10000 = $15400.

Heather's getting a great deal on those razors. Since they're buy one get one free, two packs really means she's getting four packs worth of razors. That's 16 razors in total!

With the coupon, she's paying $2.00 for all 16 razors.  That means each razor costs $2.00 / 16 razors = $0.125 each.

To get that in cents, we multiply by 100, so each razor costs 12.5 cents.

"Okay, so there are nine cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall, and one who is 60 inches.  That means the tallest layer of the pyramid will be 64 inches. Then, we have a layer of cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall, then another layer of cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall, and finally the shortest cheerleader on top who is 60 inches.  

Let's add up all the heights: 64 + 64 + 64 + 60 = 252 inches.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If we call the number of guests ""x"", we can set up an equation to see when the costs are the same.

Venue 1 costs $200 plus $5 per guest, so that's $200 + $5x.

Venue 2 costs $25 per guest, so that's $25x.

To find when they're equal, we set those two amounts equal to each other: $200 + $5x = $25x

Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x

Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

So, Mark needs **10** guests for the two venues to cost the same.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If David found half of what Bodhi found, and together they found 43 insects with Lily, we need to think about how to split those up.  

Let's say Bodhi found 'B' insects. David found half that, so he found B/2 insects.  Lily found 7 more than David, so she found B/2 + 7 insects.

If we add up what they all found, it should equal 43:

B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Let's solve for B:

2B + 7 = 43
2B = 36
B = 18

So Bodhi found 18 insects. David found half of that, which is 9 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so she found 16 insects.

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, which means the zoo has 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.

That means the farm has a total of 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.

The zoo has a total of 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Adding those together, the farm and zoo have 40 animals + 80 animals = 120 animals.

"Let's figure this out! Rose bought 12 onions and that's 4 times the amount Sophia bought. So Sophia bought 12 onions / 4 = 3 onions.  Rose also bought 4 potatoes, which is 4 times what Sophia bought, meaning Sophia bought 4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato. In total, Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and he knows it takes burning 3500 calories to lose one pound. That means he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

He has about 200 days until his birthday. To reach his goal, he needs to create a daily calorie deficit of 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories per day.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Hannah runs 8 laps times 0.25 km per lap, so that's 8 * 0.25 = 2 kilometers total.

Since she needs 60 ml of water per kilometer, she'll need 2 * 60 = 120 ml of water.

"
"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. If the house cost three times as much as the lot, we can think of it like this: the lot is one part, and the house is three parts. That makes a total of four parts.  Since the whole thing costs $120,000, one part is worth $120,000 / 4 = $30,000.  The house is three parts, so it cost 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.


$90,000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Tara bought 8 packs of bags, and each pack had 5 bags, so that's 8 * 5 = 40 bags total.  She spent $4 on each pack, so the bags cost her 8 * $4 = $32. She sold each bag for $8, so she made 40 * $8 = $320.  

To find her profit, we subtract her costs from her earnings: $320 - $32 = $288.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Chris did 12 problems on Monday and then 3 times that on Tuesday, so that's 12 * 3 = 36 problems.  

That means he did a total of 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

He started with 100 problems, so he had 100 - 48 = 52 left.

On Wednesday, he finished 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

That leaves him with 52 - 13 = 39 problems for Thursday.

"Okay, let's figure this out! If one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means they paint 1/10 of the house each day.  With five people, they'd paint 5 times faster, so they'd paint 1/2 the house each day.  That means it would take them 2 days to paint the whole house. Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take them 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she must have 22 chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 66 chairs.  Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 64 sofas.

That means they have a total of 84 sofas (20 + 64) and 88 chairs (22 + 66), for a grand total of 172 sofas and chairs.

"Let's break down Josh's workout time:

* He worked out for 4 hours a week for most of the 8 weeks, so that's 6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours.
* He had two weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each, adding another 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours.
* And there was one week with a 6-hour workout.

Adding it all up: 24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

So, we start with 48 people on the bus. At the first stop, 8 get off, and then 40 get on (because 8 times 5 is 40). That means there are 80 people on the bus after the first stop.

Then, at the second stop, 21 people get off, and only 2 get on (because 8 divided by 3 is about 2.67, so we round down).  That leaves us with 61 people on the bus.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If the computer cost $1100 and the printer cost $400 less, that means the printer cost $700. Together, the computer and printer cost $1800.  Since Errol spent $2400 total, that means the two monitors cost $600.  If we split that cost in half, we find that one monitor cost $300.

"Hi!  Let's see... the boys each found 60 seashells, and there were 10 girls. The girls found the same amount as the boys plus four times that amount, so they each found 60 + (4 * 60) = 300 shells.  

Since there are 10 girls, each girl found 300 / 10 = 30 shells.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  Elvis wants to save $1125 this month, and he wants to save double in the second half of April compared to the first. Since April has 30 days, that means he wants to save half of his total in the first 15 days, and the other half in the last 15 days.

So, he needs to save $1125 / 2 = $562.50 in the second half of the month. To do that, he needs to save $562.50 / 15 days = $37.50 each day.

Adding those all up, we get $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

But wait! There's a 10% discount.  That means he saves $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

When the water is warm, Ray takes twice as long as his cold water time plus 2 extra minutes. So, that's 16 minutes * 2 + 2 minutes = 34 minutes per mile in warm water.

For 3 miles, in cold water, it takes him 16 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes him 34 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 102 minutes.

"Let's break this down!

We know Juan needs to get down to 4 cups of coffee a day.  He currently drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the recommended amount.

Since we don't know the recommended amount, we can just call it ""x"". Octavia drinks x/2, and Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) which is 5x.

So Juan needs to reduce his intake by 5x - 4 cups.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so she weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, meaning he weighs 130 * 2 = 260 pounds.

To find the average, we add up their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds. Then, we divide by 3 since there are three friends: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

"Okay, let's break down this grilled cheese business! 

They spend $3.00 on bread that makes 10 sandwiches, so each sandwich costs $0.30 for bread.  They also spend $30.00 on cheese and stuff for 10 sandwiches, which is $3.00 per sandwich.  That means each sandwich costs them $3.30 to make.

They sell each sandwich for $7.00, so they make a profit of $3.70 per sandwich.  

If they sell 10 sandwiches, their total profit is $3.70 x 10 = $37.00.

"Let's figure out how much more John earned than Jill.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday (4 hours) and three times as long on Sunday (3 hours), giving him a total of 7 hours.

Jill earned 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John earned 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

John earned $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill.

"Okay, let's figure this out! Hannah burns 500 calories per hour doing aerobics, so in two hours, she burns 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.  Running burns 600 calories an hour, so that's another 600 calories. In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories. Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 1600 / 2 = 800 ml of water.

"Okay, let's break this down!  

If there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue ones, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue ones, we can think of the blue jelly beans as our starting point.  

Let's say there are 'x' blue jelly beans. That means there are 0.99x red jelly beans and 1.01x green jelly beans.

If we add all those together, we get the total number of jelly beans: x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500

Combining like terms, we have 3x = 4500.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 1500. So there are 1500 blue jelly beans.

That means there are 0.99 * 1500 = 1485 red jelly beans and 1.01 * 1500 = 1515 green jelly beans.

Finally, to find the difference between green and red jelly beans, we subtract: 1515 - 1485 = 30


There are **30** more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Okay, let's break this down!  

If one angle is twice the smallest and another is three times the smallest, we can think of the angles as *x*, 2*x*, and 3*x*.  Since all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can write the equation:

*x* + 2*x* + 3*x* = 180

Combining like terms, we get 6*x* = 180.  Dividing both sides by 6, we find that *x* = 30.

The largest angle is 3*x*, so it measures 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

Together, they make 60 pounds/hour + 45 pounds/hour = 105 pounds per hour.

If the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that means his tires rotate 145,000 times each month (400 miles * 725 rotations/2 miles).

Each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement. So, the tires will last for 72 months (10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month).

The shorts are also 30% off, so the discount is $35 * 0.30 = $10.50. The shorts cost $35 - $10.50 = $24.50.

Now, let's add the sale prices together: $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the first month's total, so she made $1200 * (3/4) = $900.

Over the two months, her total sales were $1200 + $900 = $2100.


2100 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! James gets a free hour, so he's really only paying for 3 hours. The first hour is $15, and each hour after that doubles in price, so the second hour is $30 and the third hour is also $30.  

Adding those up: $15 + $30 + $30 = $75

"Hmm, let's see. Sally's account went up by $220 this week.  Since she should have earned $300, it looks like $80 was withheld from her paycheck.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  Lori needs one egg for every two deviled egg halves. Since each guest wants three halves, and she has 16 guests, that's 16 * 3 = 48 deviled egg halves.  

That means she needs 48 / 2 = 24 whole eggs.  Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, she'll need 24 / 12 = 2 dozen eggs.

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

The plane itself costs $150,000.  Then, he spends $5000 a month on the hanger and double that, or $10,000, on fuel. That means his monthly costs are $15,000 ($5000 + $10,000). Over a year, that's $180,000 ($15,000 x 12).

Adding the initial cost of the plane, the total cost for the first year is $330,000 ($150,000 + $180,000).


$330000 

"
"Let's break this down!

Rice took 30 minutes. Pork took 20 minutes longer than that, so pork took 50 minutes.  Beans took half the time it took to cook both the rice and pork together. That's 30 + 50 = 80 minutes total for rice and pork. Half of that is 40 minutes for the beans.

Finally, add up all the cooking times: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

A pound of almonds costs $10, and a pound of walnuts costs $15.  

The first mixture has half a pound of almonds ($5) and a third of a pound of walnuts ($5), for a total of $10.

The second mixture has a fifth of a pound of almonds ($2) and a third of a pound of walnuts ($5), for a total of $7.

That means the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If we think about it, each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2.  We know there are 70 legs total, and 20 heads.  

Hmmm... if we try different numbers of sheep, we can see that 15 sheep would have 60 legs (15 x 4 = 60). That leaves 10 legs for the geese (70 - 60 = 10), which means there would be 5 geese (10 / 2 = 5).

And guess what? 15 sheep and 5 geese add up to 20 heads!

So the answer is 15. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

So, Roger's usual coffee is $5 a pound, but he has to get a fancier one that's 20% more. That means the expensive coffee is $5 + ($5 * 0.20) = $6 a pound.

He drinks a pound a day, and there are 7 days in a week, so that's 7 pounds of coffee total, costing 7 * $6 = $42.

Don't forget the donut! That's another $2.

Adding it all up, Roger spent $42 + $2 = $44. 



"
"Let's see... Gus spent $20.00 total.  He bought chips for $4.00, chicken for $8.00, and soda for $1.00. That's $13.00 altogether.  So the apple pie must have cost $7.00. 


$7.00
"
"Let's see... James delivers 600 newspapers total. He takes 198 to District A and 209 to District C. That means he delivers 600 - 198 - 209 = 193 newspapers to District B.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  John has a lot of cooking to do!

He's in class for 4 days a week times 2 hours a day, so that's 8 hours a week. Over 6 weeks, that's 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours total.

Since he learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, he'll learn 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes. 

32 

"
"Okay, let's break this down!  

First, we need to figure out how many math teachers there are. If 60% are history teachers, that means 40% are math teachers (100% - 60% = 40%).  So, there are 150 teachers * 0.40 = 60 math teachers.

Since each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours, they sleep a total of 60 teachers * 6 hours/teacher = 360 hours.


360 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Kassidy has 3/4 the amount Aurelia has, so Kassidy has (3/4) * $120 = $90.

Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, meaning Rayna has $90 + $60 = $150.

If they combine their money, they'd have $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.

Splitting that equally means each person gets $360 / 3 = $120.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, and Janey has 21 books, we can set up an equation. Let's say Sally has 'x' books. Twice the number of Sally's books is 2x, and Janey has 3 more than that, so 2x + 3 = 21.  

To find out how many books Sally has, we can solve for x:

1. Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 18
2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 9

Sally has 9 books. 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Mrs. Jameson's bamboo is already 20 feet tall, which is 240 inches.  She wants it to be 600 inches tall. That means it needs to grow another 360 inches (600 - 240 = 360).

Since it grows 30 inches every day, it will take 12 days to reach 600 inches (360 / 30 = 12).

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs, and then 8 more dogs arrive. That means he needs 8 more toys right away.  Then, the number of dogs doubles, so he needs toys for 16 more dogs! That's another 16 toys.  

But wait, 3 dogs leave, so he doesn't need those toys anymore.  

Let me add it all up: 8 + 16 - 3 = 21 toys.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Katarina has 68 cookies, and that's 5 less than Max. So Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, meaning he has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, giving her 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total, we add up everyone's cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.

"Hey there! This sounds like a fun dress design.  Let me see... if the final dress is 140cm long and that includes an extra 20cm of lace, then the dress itself must be 140 - 20 = 120cm long before the lace.

But wait, that 120cm is also 150% of the original length because Shania added 50%.  So, to find the original length, we need to figure out what 100% is.

If 150% is 120cm, then 100% is 120 / 1.50 = 80cm.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Neil saves 2/5 * 20 coins = 8 more coins than Rong each month. That means Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Over ten years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money John has left. 

The vaccines cost $20 each, so that's $20 * 2 = $40. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so before the check, his bill is $40.  The heartworm check costs $40 * 0.60 = $24.  

That means his total bill is $40 + $24 = $64.  If he brought $125, he'll have $125 - $64 = $61 left.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Brittany has 14 red squares, and 4 more blue squares than red, so that's 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

She has 6 more green squares than blue, meaning she has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

Brittany has 12 fewer white squares than green, so she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Adding all the squares together, she has 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, her comforter is 68 square feet.

Adding up all their points, the class has 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 points to go on the trip, so they still need 400 - 255 = 145 more points.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If each of the 6 females ate 3 dumplings, they ate a total of 18 dumplings (6 x 3 = 18). The 8 males each ate 1 more dumpling than the females, meaning they each ate 4 dumplings (3 + 1 = 4).  That means the males ate a total of 32 dumplings (8 x 4 = 32).

To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we add the dumplings eaten by the males and females: 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.

Adding all that up, his subtotal is $15 + $10 + $12 + $13 = $50.

But wait! He has a loyalty card for 10% off.  That means his discount is $50 * 0.10 = $5.

It cost him $20 to get into the blueberry patch and then $1.50 for every pound he picked. Since he got 30 pounds, that's $1.50 * 30 = $45 just for the blueberries.  

Adding the entry fee, his total cost was $45 + $20 = $65.

If he bought 30 pounds at the store, it would have cost him $2.50 * 30 = $75.

That means James saved $75 - $65 = $10 by picking his own blueberries!

"Okay, let's break this down! Helga's a speedy dancer.  

When her arms are down, she taps 300 times per minute with her right foot and 250 times per minute with her left, for a total of 550 taps per minute. Since her arms are down for 3 minutes, that's 550 * 3 = 1650 taps.

When her arms are up, she slows down to 200 taps per minute with each foot, so that's 400 taps per minute total. Over 2 minutes, that's 400 * 2 = 800 taps.

Adding those together, Helga taps a total of 1650 + 800 = 2450 times.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

They ate a lot of pizza!  Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, which is like 8 slices each (2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices). That's 24 slices total for them (8 slices/person * 3 people = 24 slices).

The other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices). That's 18 slices total for them (9 slices/person * 2 people = 18 slices).

So, they ate a total of 42 slices (24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices).

Since they started with 60 slices (12 slices/pizza * 5 pizzas = 60 slices), there were 18 slices left (60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices).

The problem says Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  So, if we subtract 10 inches from Topher's shoe size, we get 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe: 100 inches - 10 inches = 90 inches.

Finally, to find the length of Bobby's shoe, we divide 90 inches by 9: 90 inches / 9 = 10 inches.

"Oh my gosh, that's terrible!  Let's see... 

She smashed windows on a quarter of the students' cars, so that's 64 cars / 4 = 16 cars. Since each of those cars has 4 windows, she broke 16 cars * 4 windows/car = 64 windows.

Then she smashed windows on 3/4 of the teachers' cars, which is 32 cars * (3/4) = 24 cars. Those cars each have 2 windows, so she broke another 24 cars * 2 windows/car = 48 windows.

In total, Hannah smashed 64 windows + 48 windows = 112 windows.  

Yikes!

"Hmm, let's see... Candy has a lot of thread!  

Okay, so she has 15 light blue and 45 dark blue spools, which means she has 60 blue spools in total.  If she has 150 spools all together, that means 40% of her spools are blue.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

So, 2/5 of the people voted by midday, which is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people. That leaves 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people. Then, 2/3 of those remaining folks voted by 4 pm, meaning 2000 more people voted.  That leaves 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people who hadn't voted yet.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Dora's dad is twice her age plus eight years, so he's (15 * 2) + 8 = 38 years old. Her mom is four years younger than her dad, making her 38 - 4 = 34 years old.  

To find their total combined age, we add Dora's age, her dad's age, and her mom's age: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years old.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A, who got 20%. That means B got 20 + (50/100)*20 = 30% of the votes.  Together, A and B got 20% + 30% = 50% of the votes.  That leaves 100% - 50% = 50% of the votes for candidate C. Since there were 100 voters, candidate C got 50% of 100, which is 50 votes.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Beck starts with 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

After Boris shares, Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

"Let's break down Mark's card venture!

He spent $5400 on the packs (3 packs * $1800/pack).  

His awesome finds brought in $5000 ($4000 + $1000), and the other cards added another $1500 (30 cards * $50/card).

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Jake's family can save. 

At the first park, two adults would cost 2 * $26 = $52, and two children would cost 2 * $12 = $24. That's a total of $52 + $24 = $76.

At the second park, two adults would cost 2 * $14 = $28, and two children would cost 2 * $10 = $20.  That's a total of $28 + $20 = $48.

The family would save $76 - $48 = $28 by going to the second park.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

*  If 11 students need extra-small shirts, and twice that number need small, then 11 * 2 = 22 students need small shirts.
* Four less than the number needing small shirts need medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need medium shirts.
* Half as many students need large shirts as medium, meaning 18 / 2 = 9 students need large shirts.
* Finally, 6 more students need extra-large shirts than large shirts, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need extra-large shirts.

Adding all the sizes together: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts.

Krissa needs to order 75 shirts.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Jayden has $70 and Ava gives him $90 / 2 = $45. That means he has a total of $70 + $45 = $115. Since the camera costs $200, he still needs $200 - $115 = $85.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

If the third house needs double the first house, and all three houses need 250 cases total, we can use some algebra. Let's say the second house needs 'x' cases. The first house needs half of that, or x/2 cases. The third house needs double the first, so it needs x cases.

That means x/2 + x + x = 250 cases total.

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 2.5x = 250.

Dividing both sides by 2.5, we find that x = 100.

So the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Henry needs 4 wheels for each of his 57 cars, so that's 57 * 4 = 228 wheels.  He also needs 2 wheels for each of his 73 motorcycles, meaning he'll use 73 * 2 = 146 wheels for those. In total, he'll use 228 + 146 = 374 wheels. If he starts with 650 wheels, he'll have 650 - 374 = 276 wheels left over.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Mike has 600 movies, and a third of them are in series, so that's 600 / 3 = 200 movies. Since he can get those for a third of the price of a normal movie, those will cost 200 * ($10 * (1/3)) = $666.67.

That leaves 600 - 200 = 400 movies that aren't in a series.  Of those, 40% are older movies, which is 400 * 0.40 = 160 movies. Those will cost 160 * $5 = $800.

That means there are 400 - 160 = 240 newer movies left, and those will cost 240 * $10 = $2400.

Adding it all up, the total cost is $666.67 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Winston spent. 

Peaches cost $2.00 a pound and he got 6 pounds, so that's $2.00 * 6 = $12.00.

Plums are $1.00 a pound, and he picked 8 pounds, making it $1.00 * 8 = $8.00.

Apricots are $3.00 a pound, and he got 6 pounds, so that's $3.00 * 6 = $18.00.

Adding it all up: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00


Winston spent $38.00 on fruit. 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! They drove for 4.5 hours (6 hours total - 1.5 hours hiking) at 50 miles per hour, so they covered 225 miles (4.5 hours * 50 miles/hour).  Then they hiked 30 miles (20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours).  Adding those together, their vacation spot is 255 miles away!

"
"Hi there! This sounds like a fun game!  

Let's see... to figure out the difference in their scores, we need to think about all the ways they earn points.

* **Enemies:** Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she gets 80 more points (8 enemies * 10 points/enemy).

* **Berries:** Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, giving her 15 more points (3 berries * 5 points/berry).

* **Timer:** Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, meaning Emma gets 120 more points (4 seconds * 30 points/second).

To find the total difference, we add up Ava's extra points and subtract Emma's extra points: 80 + 15 - 120 = -25

It looks like Emma's score will be 25 points higher than Ava's! 



"
"Hmm, let me see...  If two pizzas cost $30, and they bought four pizzas for $64 total, that means the other two pizzas cost $34 altogether.  Since those two pizzas cost the same amount, each one must have cost $17.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.  He bought 17 more fish, and now he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  

Let's say he bought 'w' white fish. That means he bought (17 - w) orange fish.

After the purchase, he'd have:

* Orange fish: 3 + (17 - w)
* White fish: 4 + w

We know the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so:

3 + (17 - w) = 2(4 + w)

Let's solve for 'w':

3 + 17 - w = 8 + 2w
20 - w = 8 + 2w
12 = 3w
w = 4

So Bob bought 4 white fish at the store. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Andy drives 10 miles a day to work and back home (5 miles each way). That's 50 miles a week (10 miles/day * 5 days). Since his car gets 10 miles per gallon, he'll use 5 gallons of gas each week (50 miles / 10 MPG).  With gas at $3 a gallon, his weekly fuel cost is $15 (5 gallons * $3/gallon).

"Brrr, that sounds chilly!  Let's see... if it's 33 degrees colder at night, that means it'll be 12 degrees (45 - 33 = 12).  To keep the pipes from freezing, Carson needs to raise the temperature by 20 degrees (32 - 12 = 20). Since each log warms things up by 5 degrees, he'll need to burn 4 logs (20 / 5 = 4).

"
"Okay, so there were 90 people and they made groups of 9. That means there were 10 groups total.  Three-fifths of those groups, or 6 groups, brought back 2 seashells each person. Since each group has 9 people, that's 18 seashells per group!  So 6 groups times 18 seashells is... 108 seashells!

"Hey there! Let's figure out Jamie's pay. 

She makes $20 an hour for her regular 8 hours, so that's $20 * 8 = $160.

Since she worked 3 extra hours, her overtime pay is $20 * 1.50 = $30 per hour for those hours. That means she earned $30 * 3 = $90 in overtime.

Adding it all up, she made $160 + $90 = $250 for the day.

"Let's see... 40 classes times 25 students is 1000 students. And 40 classes times 3 teachers is 120 teachers. So the students plant 1000 trees, and the teachers plant 240 trees.  That means they plant a total of 1240 trees!

"Let's see... Bubbles has 3 puppies + 5 koalas + 2 zebras + 4 frogs = 14 stuffed animals.  To have 30% be goats, she needs 14 x 0.30 = 4.2 goats. Since she can't buy parts of a goat, she should buy 5!

"Hi there! Let's see... Kris plays for half an hour every day for two weeks, that's 14 days, so that's 7 hours of playtime right there! Then she plays 2 hours a day for a whole week, so that's another 14 hours.  That means she's played for 21 hours total.  She needs to play for 30 hours to get the achievement, so she still needs to play for 9 more hours!

"Oh, that's so sweet!  Let's see... the diamond and gold cost $900 altogether.  A 30% premium on that is $270.  So, the total he paid was $1170. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

First, we need to find out how many fifth graders passed.  Since the fifth-grade pass rate was twice the fourth-grade rate, that means 40% * 2 = 80% of fifth graders passed. So, 400 fifth graders * 0.80 = 320 fifth graders passed.

Now, let's add up all the students who passed: 340 third graders + 40 fourth graders + 320 fifth graders = 700 students.

Finally, to get the overall pass rate, we divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.70 or 70%.

"
"Let's figure this out!  Milo needs 12 chips per square inch, and his mosaic will be 3 inches tall. That means he needs 12 chips/inch * 3 inches = 36 chips for every inch of length. He has 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips total.  So, he can make his mosaic 144 chips / 36 chips/inch = 4 inches long.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

So, four students drank 1.5 quarts each, which is a total of 6 quarts (4 x 1.5 = 6). Then, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, for a total of 32 quarts (16 x 2 = 32).  That means they drank a total of 38 quarts (6 + 32 = 38).

Since there are 10 quarts left, they must have started with 48 quarts (38 + 10 = 48). And since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, they started with 12 gallons (48 / 4 = 12).

"
"Hmm, let's see. Dale started with 100 candies and got 100 more, so that's 200 candies total. He already sold 150, so he has 200 - 150 = 50 candies left to sell.

"
"Hmm, let's see. If Felix made $105 and each branch costs $0.25 to climb, he must have climbed 105 / 0.25 = 420 branches.  If he worked 5 days, that means he climbed an average of 420 / 5 = 84 branches per day.

"
"Okay, let's see... Rose picked a lot of flowers!  

She started with 3 flowers that had 5 petals each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 petals. Then she got 4 flowers with 6 petals each, for a total of 4 * 6 = 24 petals.  

Next, she added 5 flowers with 4 petals each, which is 5 * 4 = 20 petals. Finally, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each, making 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

That's a grand total of 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals!

But oh no, she dropped one of each kind of flower!  That means she lost 5 petals.

So, the flowers in the vase have a total of 101 - 5 = 96 petals.

"
"Let's see... they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows for their s'mores.  Oops, they also dropped 3! That means they have 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.  Since each s'more needs one marshmallow, they can each have 14 / 2 = 7 more s'mores!

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His friends who aren't as good only get 10 minutes per quarter, and his really good friend gets 30 minutes per quarter.  They play for 4 whole hours, which is 240 minutes.

So, Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

His not-so-good friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, and since there are two of them, that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters total.

His really good friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

Adding it all up, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

That means they spend 68 * $0.25 = $17.00 at the arcade.

"
"Okay, let's break this down!  Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar. She also uses twice as much salt as zest, and twice as much oil as salt.  

Since the jar holds 10 ounces, we need to figure out how much of each ingredient she uses to make it all fit.  

Let's think of it like this: if the zest is 1 ounce, the fragrance is also 1 ounce. The salt and sugar would each be 2 ounces (twice the zest), and the oil would be 4 ounces (twice the salt).

That adds up to 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10 ounces!

So, Tanya uses **4 ounces** of oil.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much John spent.  He bought 3 goats at $500 each, so that's 3 * $500 = $1500. He also got 2 cows for $1500 each, which is 2 * $1500 = $3000.  Adding those together, he spent a total of $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Joe has twice the number of cars Robert has, so Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars. He sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars. Then, he gives his mother twice the number he sold, meaning he gives her 2 * 8 = 16 cars. In total, he gives away 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

That means Joe has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.

"Let's figure this out!

In the first game, Julie scored 4 less than Sasha's 14 points, so she scored 10 points.  In the second game, Sasha scored 6 less than Julie's first game score, meaning she scored 4 points.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Let's say PJ has 'x' number of cards. Smendrick has three times that amount, so he has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

All together, they have 341 cards, so we can write an equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.  Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329.  Dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 47.

Since Becca has 3x + 12 cards, she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 153 cards.

"
"Hi! Let's figure out how many eggs Cindy has.  She had 5 green eggs, and twice that many blue ones, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs. She had one less pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, which is 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Adding them all up, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs!

"
"Let's figure out how much Milly loses on this boring book!

First, the shipping cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so that's $0.35 * 4 = $1.40.

Then, the shipping cost per mile is $0.08, and it's going 20 miles, so that's $0.08 * 20 = $1.60.

Adding those together, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Amazon will only give Milly back 75% of the $32 price, which is $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.

Finally, to find her total loss, we subtract the refund and shipping from the original price: $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.00.

"Let's figure this out!

Boris makes 8000 bars in the first week. In the second week, he makes half of that, which is 4000 bars. In the third week, he makes three times the amount from the first week, so that's 8000 * 3 = 24000 bars.

That's a total of 8000 + 4000 + 24000 = 36000 bars for the first three weeks.

He wants to make 50000 bars total, so in the fourth week he needs to make 50000 - 36000 = 14000 bars.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Britany makes 18 videos a week, and each one is 4 minutes long, so that's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes on videos.

She also spends 2 hours on songs, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

And her makeup takes 15 minutes a day for 6 days, so that's 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

In total, that's 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes per week on TikTok.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 282 * 4 = 1128 minutes on TikTok each month.

That's 1128 / 60 = 18.8 hours!

"Let's break this down!

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than that, so Saskay can lift 1 * 12 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami is even stronger, lifting a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, meaning Kagiyami can lift 12 * 4 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto is the strongest of them all, lifting a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. That means Naruto can lift 48 * 10 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high!

"Okay, let's think about this! If three kangaroos take 18 hours, that means one kangaroo would take three times as long, which is 54 hours.  

Now, turtles are much slower. They only go half as fast as a kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours, a turtle would take twice as long, which is 108 hours.

But we have four turtles! That means their speeds add up.  Since each turtle takes 108 hours, four turtles together would take 108 hours / 4 = 27 hours.

* The first glue stick has 5/6 left, so that's (5/6) * 12 mm = 10 mm unused.
* The second glue stick has 1/3 left, so that's (1/3) * 12 mm = 4 mm unused.
* The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so that's (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm unused.

Adding those together, we get 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Jack has 60 dishes and that's twice the number of socks he has, then he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, meaning he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Peter also has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Altogether, they have 60 + 30 = 90 socks and 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.

That means they have a total of 90 + 90 = 180 socks and dishes.

Three baskets of red food would normally cost 3 * $18 = $54, but since we get $2 off each one, that's $6 off in total. So the red food costs $54 - $6 = $48.

Adding the green and red food together, we get $75 + $48 = $123.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Claire earns 1 badge a month, and Amber takes twice as long, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. That means in a year, Amber earns 12 months / 2 months/badge = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times as many badges as Claire, so she earns 1 badge/month * 3 = 3 badges a month. In a year, that's 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges!

Wendy earns 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

"Okay, let's break this down!

If we let Fawn have 'F' books, Anne has F - 12 books, and Sofie has F + 13 books.  

Since they have a total of 85 books, we can write the equation:

F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Combining like terms, we get:

3F + 1 = 85

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

3F = 84

F = 28

So Fawn has 28 books.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If 7 sodas cost $21, then one soda costs $3 ($21 / 7 = $3).  

And if 4 waters cost $8, then one water costs $2 ($8 / 4 = $2).

So, 3 sodas would cost $9 (3 x $3 = $9) and 2 waters would cost $4 (2 x $2 = $4).

In total, that's $13!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  David starts with $12.48 and each bolt costs $0.03.  If he buys 16 bolts, that's 16 * $0.03 = $0.48 spent on bolts.  

That means he has $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00 left.


$12.00 

"
"Hmm, let's see... If Ella makes $33 for 3 hours of dog walking, that means she earns $11 per hour.  If she walks dogs for 12 hours, she'd make $11 x 12 = $132!

"Let's break down Amy's score:

* **Multiple Choice:** She gets 80% of 10 questions right, so that's 8 questions * 1 point each = 8 points.
* **True/False:** She nails 90% of 20 questions, meaning 18 questions * 1 point each = 18 points.
* **Long Answer:** She answers 60% of 5 questions correctly, so that's 3 questions * 5 points each = 15 points.

Adding it all up: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points!

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Isaias wants to make a $2000 profit, and he's selling each chicken for $50.  He's selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is 180 chickens. That means he'll earn 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.

To find out how much he paid for the chickens, we subtract his profit from his total earnings: $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

"Let's break down Iris's spa day spending!

Her manicure cost $400 / 4 = $100.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money Kelly has left. 

Okay, so the bacon costs $10 total, and each chicken pack costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, which is $2.  That means the chicken costs $2 * 6 = $12. The strawberries cost $4 * 3 = $12, and the apples cost $4 / 2 = $2 each, so those are $2 * 7 = $14.

Adding it all up, Kelly's groceries cost $10 + $12 + $12 + $14 = $48.

If her budget is $65, she has $65 - $48 = $17 left.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual ones plus a 15-minute encore, and the whole thing is 65 minutes, we can work backwards.  

First, take away the encore time: 65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes.

That 50 minutes is double the length of her usual concert. So, divide that in half: 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's see... they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday and Wednesday, so that's 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas. On Friday, they make twice that amount, which is 250 * 2 = 500 chimichangas.  

In total, they make 250 + 250 = 500 chimichangas on those three days.

"
"Ooh, that's a tricky one! Let's see... if 20% of the microphones don't fit, that means 80% do.  So 80% of 50 microphones is... 40 microphones! Since each pair needs two microphones, he could make 20 pairs.

"Hi there! Let's count those birds!

Jerry sees 6 birds in the bushes, and then 2/3 of that number flying, which is 4 birds. He also sees 3 groups of 8 birds eating, so that's 24 birds.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Mrs. Smith has 100 plants and a quarter are indoors, that's 25 indoor plants (100 / 4 = 25). That leaves 75 plants (100 - 25 = 75).

Two-thirds of those are outdoor plants, so that's 50 outdoor plants (75 x (2/3) = 50).

That means the rest, 25 plants, must be flowering plants (75 - 50 = 25).

So, 25% of her plants are flowering plants (25 / 100 = 0.25, which is 25%).

"
"Okay, let's see... a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit goes 121 meters per second.  That means the thingamabob spins at 121 meters per second divided by 11, which is 11 meters per second.  The whirligig is five times faster than the thingamabob, so it spins at 11 meters per second times 5, which equals 55 meters per second.

"
"Let's figure this out! Ellen's yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.  Her salad and yogurt together cost $6 + $3 = $9. That means her carrots cost $11 - $9 = $2. Since she buys two carrots, each one costs $2 / 2 = $1.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages, and Paul is 10 years older than John, we can do some clever adding.  

Let's say John is ""J"" years old. That means Paul is ""J + 10"" years old.  Since Peter is the sum of their ages, Peter is ""J + (J + 10)"" which is ""2J + 10"" years old.

We know all three of their ages add up to 100, so:

J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100

Combining like terms: 4J + 20 = 100

Subtracting 20 from both sides: 4J = 80

Dividing both sides by 4: J = 20

Now that we know John is 20, we can find Peter's age:

Peter = 2J + 10 = (2 * 20) + 10 = 50



Peter is 50 years old.

The Widgeteer 3000 would make 1440 widgets a day (60 x 24) and 43,200 widgets a month (1440 x 30).

The WidgetMaster 9000 would make 1080 widgets a day (45 x 24) and 32,400 widgets a month (1080 x 30).

Since each widget sells for $6, the Widgeteer 3000 would earn $259,200 a month (43,200 x 6) and the WidgetMaster 9000 would earn $194,400 a month (32,400 x 6).

On the Wall Street Journal, he makes 8% commission, which is $15 * 0.08 = $1.20 per paper. For 10 papers, that's $1.20 * 10 = $12.00.

Adding those together, his total commission is $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If we let Azibo's points be ""x"", Bahati scored x + 20, and Dinar scored x + 10.  

Since their total is 45, we have the equation: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms: 3x + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

Dividing both sides by 3: x = 5

So Azibo scored 5 points.

"Okay, let's figure this out! Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he works for 15 hours total. That means he staples for 900 minutes (15 hours * 60 minutes/hour).  Since he staples in 15-minute chunks, he completes 60 sets of stapling (900 minutes / 15 minutes/set).  

That means he staples a whopping 1800 reports in total (60 sets * 30 reports/set)!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Jonathan has two dozen cups, which is 24 cups. He has 2/3 that many spoons, so he has 16 spoons (2/3 * 24 = 16). After giving Pedro 6 spoons, he has 10 spoons left (16 - 6 = 10).  In total, he has 34 utensils (24 cups + 10 spoons = 34).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how many beds are empty right now. If 1/5 of the 1000 beds are full, then 1000 / 5 = 200 beds are occupied. That means 1000 - 200 = 800 beds are empty.

Over two weeks, 50 patients come in each day, so that's 50 * 14 = 700 new patients.

Adding those to the already occupied beds, we get 200 + 700 = 900 occupied beds.

Finally, subtracting the occupied beds from the total gives us 1000 - 900 = 100 unoccupied beds.

"Hmm, let's see. If Courtney overstated the number by 20%, that means the real number is 20% less than what she said.  20% of 48 is 9.6, so we subtract that from Courtney's count: 48 - 9.6 = 38.4. Since we can't have part of a person, we round down.

"Ahoy there, matey! Let's see... they dug 10 holes the first day, then 13 more the second, and 8 more the third. That's 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes! But they filled in 2 of those, so there were 31 - 2 = 29 holes left.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, so there must have been 29 / 4 = 7.25 holes at the end of the first day.  That doesn't make sense, does it?  Maybe the map was a bit off!

Anyway, they had 29 holes at the start of the fourth day, and they found the treasure then, so they must have dug 29 - 7 = 22 holes on the fourth day.

"Hmm, let me see... If Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 15 more than them, that means Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.  To find the total, we add up what everyone got: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 corn chips.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Jen's travel tickets cost 50% more than his $400 worth of supplies. That means his tickets cost an extra $400 * 0.50 = $200.

"Hi there! This sounds like a tricky Pokemon problem! Let's see...

If we think about it step by step, we can figure it out.  Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times the number Adelwolfe caught.  That means we need to figure out how many Adelwolfe caught first. Then we can figure out how many Stan caught!

Hmmm... after doing some calculations, it looks like Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

To find the total distance between the homes, we need to add up the southward distances and subtract the northward distance: 300 - 36 + 110 = 374 miles.

Since Pat already has 17 plants, she needs to buy 27 more (44 - 17).

Each plant costs $6, so she'll spend $162 in total (27 x 6).

In total, each basket will cost $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

Since she has 5 baskets, the total cost will be $14.00/basket * 5 baskets = $70.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Emily peels 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, that's 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

She cooks 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so for 90 shrimp, it would take her (90 / 30) * 10 = 30 minutes.

"Okay, let's break this down!  

The air conditioner cooled the room 6 degrees on low (2 degrees/hour * 3 hours) and then another 12 degrees on high (3 degrees/hour * 4 hours). That's a total of 18 degrees cooler.

But then it warmed up 4 degrees while it was off (2 degrees/hour * 2 hours).

So, the final temperature was 14 degrees cooler than it started (18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees).

"Okay, let me see...  The first plane is busy! It flies to Greece most of the time, which is three-quarters of its flights. That means the other quarter is split between France and Germany. The second plane only goes to Poland, and it flies way less, only half as much as the first plane.  

Since the second plane does 44 trips, the first plane does double that, which is 88 trips.  If 66 of those are to Greece, then the rest, 22 trips, are split between France and Germany.  That means the first plane takes 11 trips to France each day.

If the total age of the four children is 20, and we know Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4, that's 3 + 4 = 7 years accounted for. Helene is twice the average age of the group, and since there are four kids, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5 years old. That means Helene is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

So far, that's 7 + 10 = 17 years.  

To find Wilfred's age, we subtract the ages we know from the total age: 20 - 17 = 3 years old.

Wilfred is 3 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Half of the 3000 students are over 16, so that's 1500 students. A quarter of those older students are boys, meaning 375 are boys over 16. That leaves 1125 girls over 16.

The other half of the students are under 16, so that's another 1500 students. Half of them are boys, which is 750 boys. That means there are 750 girls under 16.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she pumped 4500 gallons * (3/4) = 3375 gallons.

Together on day one, they pumped 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons.

On day two, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her day one amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her day one amount, which is 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

On day two, they pumped a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons.

In total, they pumped 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

That means there are 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons left to fill.

"This is a tricky one! Let's see...  

Okay, so the power bank lost 9% of its charge every hour for 5 hours, that's a total of 45% lost right there. Then it lost another 21% over the next 3 hours. That means it lost a total of 66% of its charge before it got down to 28%.

So, if 28% is what was left after losing 66%, that means 34% was left *before* her friends started using it (100% - 66% = 34%).

And since her friends used 6% of the power bank's charge, the original charge must have been 40% (34% + 6% = 40%).

* **Year 3:** $132.30 + (0.05 * $132.30) = $138.92

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the carrots would cost $139 after three years.

"Let's see... Olivia put 72 pictures into 8 albums, so each album has 72 / 8 = 9 pictures.  She has 3 albums of selfies, so that's 3 * 9 = 27 selfies.  And she has 2 albums of portraits, which is 2 * 9 = 18 portraits.  In total, she has 27 + 18 = 45 portraits and selfies.

"Okay, let's see... so the hotel started with 100 guests.  Some left early, some stayed late, and then more people checked in.  Hmm...

* 100 guests - 24 guests = 76 guests left after the early checkouts.
* Then 15 guests * 2 = 30 guests checked in after the late checkouts.
* So now there are 76 guests + 30 guests = 106 guests.
* And finally, 106 guests + 7 guests = 113 guests after dinner.

So the hotel now has 113 guests!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. John picked 4 bananas on Wednesday and 6 on Thursday, so that's 4 + 6 = 10 bananas. On Friday, he picked three times the amount from Wednesday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 bananas.  Adding that to his total, he has 10 + 12 = 22 bananas.

"Let's break this down!

There are 60 questions total, and 40% are easy, so that's 60 * 0.40 = 24 easy questions.  The rest, 60 - 24 = 36 questions, are split evenly between average and difficult, meaning there are 36 / 2 = 18 of each.

Aries gets 75% of the easy ones right, so that's 24 * 0.75 = 18 easy questions correct. She gets half of the average and difficult ones right, so that's 18 * 0.50 = 9 correct for each type.

In total, she's sure to get 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, and each small one costs $4, the large ones cost $12.

She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Her earnings from the large stuffed animals would be 12x, and from the small ones, it would be 8x (since 2x small stuffed animals * $4 each = $8x).

In total, she made $120, so 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find that x = 6.

Since she sold 2x small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"Hmm, let me see... The twins found 30 eggs each, so that's 30 * 2 = 60 eggs.  If 10 eggs were left over, then their friends found 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

A dwarf with just his hands mines 12 pounds a day. With an iron pickaxe, that jumps to 24 pounds a day (twice as much!). A steel pickaxe is even better – it lets them mine 50% more than the iron pickaxe, so that's 24 pounds * 1.50 = 36 pounds a day.

Now, one dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds a day * 30 days = 1080 pounds in a month.

If we have 40 dwarves all mining with steel pickaxes, they'll mine a whopping 1080 pounds/dwarf * 40 dwarves = 43200 pounds in a month!

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Sally starts with 25 red + 7 green + 12 yellow = 44 balloons.

Then 40% of the red balloons pop, which is 25 * 0.40 = 10 balloons.  That leaves her with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

She loses half her yellow balloons, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons gone. She has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then she finds 8 blue balloons and keeps 75% of them, which is 8 * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons.

Finally, she has 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 balloons when she gets to school.

"Hmm, let's see. There's a 50% chance of a substitute, which means no homework. If his regular teacher comes, there's a 40% chance of an extension for everyone, so no homework there either.  Even if there's no class extension, there's still a 20% chance Marcus can get out of it with the dog-ate-my-homework excuse.  

So, the only time he *has* to do it is if the regular teacher is there, no extension is given, AND he can't pull off the dog excuse. That seems like it would be... 30%?

"Let's break this down! Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so that's 6 * 3 = 18 hours total.

She earns $15 per day, so over three days she makes $15 * 3 = $45.

Parking costs $3 per day, and she parks for 3 days, meaning she spends $3 * 3 = $9 on parking.

Her total earnings after parking are $45 - $9 = $36.

Finally, to find her hourly rate, we divide her net earnings by the total hours worked: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Jim takes out $50,000 in loans each year for four years, so that's a total of $200,000 in loans.  He was making $25,000 a year before college, and his degree triples his income to $75,000 a year.  While he's in school, he misses out on earning $25,000 a year for four years, which is another $100,000.

So, in total, he needs to earn back $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost wages) = $300,000.

At his new salary of $75,000 a year, it will take him $300,000 / $75,000 per year = 4 years to earn back everything.

* On the second race, he won $1 more than double his first race loss, meaning he won $10 + $1 = $11.
* Unfortunately, he lost 1.5 times his second-race winnings on the third race, which is $16.50.

To find his average loss, we add up all his losses: $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.  Then, we divide that by the total number of races: $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.

If we let the first person's share be ""x"", the second person got ""x + $80"", and the third person got ""2 * (x + $80)"" which is ""2x + $160"".

All together, that's x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Combining the 'x' terms and the dollar amounts, we get 4x + $240 = $1920

Subtracting $240 from both sides gives us 4x = $1680

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that x = $420.

So the first person's share was $420.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If Betsy took longer than Donovan, and their times together add up to 98 minutes, we need to find the difference.  

Think of it like this:

* Donovan's time + Betsy's time = 98 minutes
* Betsy's time = Donovan's time + 18 minutes

Let's say Donovan took 'x' minutes. That means Betsy took 'x + 18' minutes.

So, x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining those 'x's, we get 2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So Donovan took 40 minutes.

Betsy took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Kayla's party will cost! 

First, we need to know how many people are coming. She invited 25 classmates + 7 dance friends + 13 family members = 45 people. But, 4 people can't make it, so that leaves 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The theater costs $125 for the first 20 people, and then it's $6 extra for each person after that. Since Kayla has 41 guests, that's 41 - 20 = 21 extra people.

So, the extra guests will cost 21 * $6 = $126.

Finally, we add the initial fee and the extra guest cost: $125 + $126 = $251.

Kayla's party will cost $251.

Finally, he sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each, making 20 * $1.50 = $30.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and hangs around for 20 minutes. The second train shows up 30 minutes after the first one leaves, which means it arrives at the 30-minute mark (10 + 20 = 30). This second train only stays for 5 minutes (20 / 4 = 5).

The third train gets in an hour after the second train leaves, so that's at the 95-minute mark (30 + 5 + 60 = 95). This train takes off right away.

Finally, Paul's train, the fourth one, arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, putting it at the 115-minute mark (95 + 20 = 115).

So, Paul will be waiting for a total of 115 minutes.

If we take away Harry's extra 60 feet, they'd have the same amount. That means they'd have 100 feet - 60 feet = 40 feet to split evenly.

So, Sam would get half of that: 40 feet / 2 = 20 feet.

"Hmm, let's see... if a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, that means it grows 2 inches every year.  So in 13 years, it would grow 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches!

"Hi there! Let's figure out Marcel's earnings. 

First, we know he sold 150 Trekking bikes (half of 300), 45 BMX bikes (15% of 300), and the rest were MTB bikes, which is 105 bikes (300 - 150 - 45).

A BMX bike costs $250 (half the price of an MTB), so he made $11,250 from those. Trekking bikes brought in $67,500 (150 bikes * $450 each), and MTB bikes earned him $52,500 (105 bikes * $500 each).

Adding all those up, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bikes that month. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. The farmer makes 5 bales an hour for 6 hours, so that's 5 * 6 = 30 bales. The truck picks up 3 bales an hour for 6 hours, meaning it takes 3 * 6 = 18 bales.  That leaves 30 - 18 = 12 bales in the field.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

John has 8 classes a day (6 normal + 2 extra) and each class is 40 minutes long, so that's 8 * 40 = 320 minutes of class each day.

Over a week, that's 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes in class.

He spends another 1600 minutes / 16 = 100 minutes on each weekend day for extra learning, totaling 100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes.

Adding it all up, he spends 1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes learning each week.

That's equal to 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

The ball starts on the third floor, which is 3 floors * 24 feet/floor = 72 feet high.

After the first bounce, it goes up to 72 feet * (2/3) = 48 feet.

Then, on the second bounce, it goes up to 48 feet * (2/3) = 32 feet.

"
"Let's figure this out!

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches. The second child is 2 inches taller, so they are 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second, making them 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall. Finally, the fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third, so they are 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

"
"Hmm, let me see...  If the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, and that was only half of what was left after the velociraptors had their fill, then there must have been 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms before the velociraptors got there.  And since that was only half of what the T-Rex left, the triceratops must have started with 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat! 

1080 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

First, we need to find the area of each pair of walls. The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so they each have an area of 80 square feet. Together, that's 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, making them 40 square feet each.  Combined, they're 80 square feet.

Adding those together, the total area of all the walls is 240 square feet.

Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, Tony will need 12 gallons to paint the whole room (240 / 20 = 12).

At $12 per gallon, the total cost will be $144 (12 x $12 = $144).

"Hi there!  Let's see... they're going in opposite directions, so we need to add their distances together. The faster train goes 180 miles (60 mph * 3 hours), and the slower one goes 90 miles (30 mph * 3 hours).  

That means after 3 hours, they'll be 270 miles apart! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people each day.

There are 31 days in March and 19 in April, for a total of 31 + 19 = 50 days.

He takes 20% of those days off, which is 50 * 0.20 = 10 days.

That means he works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

In total, he helps 40 * 6 = 240 people.

"Hmm, let's see... the big slide is 300 feet long and you go 60 feet per minute, so that's 300 divided by 60... which is 5 minutes. The smaller slide is 240 feet long and you zoom down at 80 feet per minute, so that's 240 divided by 80... which is 3 minutes.  

So it takes 2 minutes longer on the big slide! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day, so that's 30 + 30 = 60 minutes of breaks daily. Over five days, that adds up to 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes.  Converting that to hours, we get 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran, so he ran 3.5 * 8 miles = 28 miles. Together, Amber and Micah ran 8 miles + 28 miles = 36 miles.  That means Ahito ran 52 miles - 36 miles = 16 miles.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

First, Sheila's balance goes down to $70.00 after she returns the $15.00 item. Then, the frying pan is on sale for $16.00 ($20.00 - $4.00 discount) and the towels cost $27.00 ($30.00 - $3.00 discount).  Adding those together, her new purchases are $43.00.

So, her final balance is $113.00 ($70.00 + $43.00).

"Hmm, let's see... if 6 jellyfish changed color and that's only a third of the large jellyfish, then there must be 6 * 3 = 18 large jellyfish.  Since those are only a fifth of the total, there must be 18 * 5 = 90 jellyfish in the tank!

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Lauren wants to live on 40% of her $100,000 salary during retirement, which is $40,000 per year.  Since she wants to retire for 20 years, she'll need a total of $40,000 * 20 = $800,000 saved up.

She's saving 20% of her salary each year, which is $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000.

To reach her goal of $800,000, she'll need to save for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

"Okay, let's figure this out! Soledad wants to hike a whopping 9,300 miles in June. If she hikes 125 miles twice a day, that's 250 miles per day.  Over 30 days, that's 7,500 miles (250 miles/day * 30 days).  

She needs to hike 1,800 more miles (9,300 miles - 7,500 miles) to reach her goal. To do that in 30 days, she needs to hike an extra 60 miles each day (1,800 miles / 30 days).

* Amalia mowed the lawn for 4 hours.
* Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia, so that's 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

"Let's figure this out! Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth that weight, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. His second dog is half the weight of Kory's, meaning it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.  

Together, Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.  Adding that to Kory's dog's weight, we get a total of 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

Arnold and Madeline painted the rest, which is 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since they painted the same amount, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Camden painted 30 - 13 = 17 more eggs than Arnold.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Nik has a lot of crayons!  Since each box holds 8 crayons and he has 200 crayons, he'll need 25 boxes (200 / 8 = 25).  

That means he has 25 boxes weighing 8 ounces each, for a total of 200 ounces just from the boxes (25 x 8 = 200).  

The crayons themselves weigh 200 ounces too (200 crayons x 1 ounce each = 200 ounces).

So, all together, the crayons and boxes weigh 400 ounces (200 + 200 = 400).

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 25 pounds (400 / 16 = 25).

"Okay, let's figure this out! Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and it takes her 40 minutes. That means she walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour on the beach.  Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, she goes 6 miles per hour there.  

It takes her 10 minutes to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk.  

So, her whole walk takes 40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes.

Melanie's dad starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Over three weeks, he gets 20 cows a day from Milkie Cows Limited, which is 20 * 7 * 3 = 420 cows! He also gets 10 chickens a day from Broilers Limited, so that's 10 * 7 * 3 = 210 chickens.

That means he has 50 + 420 = 470 cows and 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

In total, he has 470 + 230 = 700 animals on his farm!

"Let's figure this out!

Faraday makes $2 per sunflower and $8 per bouquet. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, that means he makes $8 / 12 = $0.67 per sunflower in a bouquet.

So, he makes a total of $2 + $0.67 = $2.67 per sunflower each day.

Over three days, he'd make $2.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

He earned $26 from individual sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over three days.

That means he sold $82 / $2.67 per sunflower = 30.71 sunflowers. Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, he sold 30 sunflowers.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Adam spends $100 on rocks, and he sells each one for $7.  But he only sells 60% of the rocks he buys. That means he loses money on the rocks he doesn't sell.  

If he buys 20 rocks, he sells 12 (20 x 0.60 = 12). That's $84 earned (12 x $7 = $84).

Since he started with $100 and only made $84, he loses $16.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Okay, so Hortex makes 4200 bottles a day, and each bottle covers 20% of a person's energy needs. That means they're currently covering 4200 * 0.20 = 840% of a person's daily energy needs.

We need to know how much more they need to make to cover 100% of the needs for 2300 people. That's a total of 2300 * 100% = 230,000% of daily energy needs.

To find the difference, we subtract: 230,000% - 840% = 229,160%.

Finally, to see how many more bottles they need, we divide that difference by the amount each bottle covers: 229,160% / 20% = 11,458 bottles.


So the answer is 11,458.

"Hmm, let's see...  

So, 3/4 of the octuplets wear purple, which is 6 babies. And 1/4 wear blue, which is 2 babies.  

Of the purple babies, 1/3 wear bows, so that's another 2 babies.  

That means there are 4 babies total wearing bows (2 blue and 2 purple).

So, if a baby is wearing a bow, there's a 50% chance they're wearing purple!

"Let's break down how much money Abraham makes:

* He starts with 80 square meters of land.
* He sells half (80 / 2 = 40 square meters) for $50.
* That leaves him with 40 square meters.
* He sells a quarter of that (40 / 4 = 10 square meters) for $30.
* Now he has 30 square meters left.
* He sells the rest at $3 per square meter, earning 30 * $3 = $90.

Adding up all his sales: $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Cole hid a whole bunch of eggs, 3 dozen to be exact! That's 3 times 12, or 36 eggs. Lamar found 5, Stacy found twice that amount (so 5 times 2, which is 10 eggs). Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he got 8 eggs. And Mei found half as many as Charlie, which is 4 eggs.  

Altogether, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

That means there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hiding in the yard!

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

John has a lot of garbage to collect!  

* The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.
* The third complex is 60% bigger than those two combined, meaning it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments.
* That makes the third complex 400 + 240 = 640 apartments big.
* In total, he collects from 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.
* Since he goes to each place 3 times a week, that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 collections.
*  At $0.40 per collection, he earns 4320 * $0.40 = $1728.00 each week.

Wow, that's a lot of garbage and a lot of money!

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many fruits that avocado tree can produce. 

Okay, so a 5-year-old tree makes 50 fruits. A 6-year-old makes three times that, which is 150 fruits. A 7-year-old makes 350 fruits, and an 8-year-old makes 200 less than a 10-year-old. A 10-year-old tree makes a whopping 1000 fruits!  The 9-year-old takes a break and doesn't make any.

Adding all those up: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = 2350 fruits!

"Okay, let me see...  

The red rope is four times as long as the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. Together, all three ropes are 37 centimeters long. Hmm... to find the red rope's length, we need to figure out the length of the blue rope first.

Let's think about it this way: if the blue rope were the same length as the yellow rope, the red rope would be four times that length. But the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter, so we need to account for that.

I'm going to try working backward from the total length.

"Let's break this down! Rissa had three times the amount Ronnie had, which is 3 * $5 = $15.  After giving some money to their sister, Rissa has 4/5 of her money left. That means she gave away 1/5 of $15, which is $3. Ronnie also gave $3 to their sister.  So, Ronnie has $5 - $3 = $2 left.

"Hmm, let's see... half the mural is yellow, so that's 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint.  That leaves 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints for the red, white, and purple. Since they're used in equal amounts, each color gets 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

"Hi there! Let's figure out the total area of Tom's house. 

Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so that's 20 * 12 = 240 square feet per bedroom.  Since he has four bedrooms, that's 240 * 4 = 960 square feet for all the bedrooms.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, meaning it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding up the bedrooms and the living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

Finally, don't forget the rest of the house, which is 1000 square feet.  

The total area of Tom's house is 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"Okay, let's break this down!

Team B scored 2 fewer goals than Team A in the first half, so they scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, Team B scored four times the amount from the first half, meaning they scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals.

Team A scored 1/4 the number of goals Team B did in the second half, so they scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Adding up Team A's goals from both halves, they scored a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals.

Team B scored a total of 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

Finally, adding both teams' scores together, there were 6 + 10 = 16 goals in the match.

"Okay, let's break this problem down.  

Let's say Wendy's age now is ""w"" and Colin's age now is ""c"".

We know:

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years: w = 5(c + 7)
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Let's solve for ""c"", which is Colin's current age.

From the first equation, we can say w = 5c + 35.

Now, substitute this value of ""w"" into the second equation: c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for ""c"":

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
40/3 = (2/3)c
c = (40/3) * (3/2)
c = 20


Colin is currently 20 years old.

For pepperoni, they need 24 slices (6 friends * 4 slices each). With 8 slices per pepperoni pizza, she'll need 3 pepperoni pizzas (24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas).

In total, Kate needs to buy 6 pizzas (3 cheese + 3 pepperoni).

"Let's see... they used 38 bandages the first day and ordered 50 more, so they had 50 + 38 = 88 bandages to start the second day.  On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, meaning they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. That leaves them with 88 - 28 = 60 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two packs, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.  They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. That means they used a total of 100 + 60 - 25 = 135 bandages.

Since they had 78 left over, they must have started with 135 + 78 = 213 bandages.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my work...

Ah, I made a mistake! They had 60 bandages at the start of the third day, not 100. So, they used a total of 60 - 25 = 35 bandages on the third day.

Since he buys twice as many cognac bottles, that's 10 * 2 = 20 bottles.  His total cognac cost is 20 * $90 = $1800.  Adding that to his scotch cost, he spends a total of $600 + $1800 = $2400.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oaks, bringing his total to 20 + 10 = 30 White Oaks. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pines than the day before, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pines.  So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pines on day two.

If the first floor is 180 inches and the whole house is 420 inches, then the second floor (including the space from the second floor to the roof) is 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches tall.

Since the first floor is 180 inches tall, the roof must be 240 inches - 180 inches = 60 inches above the second floor.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we need to find out how many jelly beans could fit in the jar.  The jar is a rectangular prism, so we multiply the length, width, and height: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

But jelly beans don't fit together perfectly, so we need to account for that 80% efficiency. That means we can only use 80% of the jar's volume: 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, divide the usable space by the volume of a single jelly bean to find the total number of jelly beans: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

Tim thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red, so he'd estimate: 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

The actual number of red jelly beans is 900, so Tim was off by 900 - 864 = 36 jelly beans.

At the third stop, the number of people doubles, so there are 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus can hold 200 people, so there's room for 200 - 180 = 20 more people.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year for 5 years, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 visits.  Each visit costs $2, so those first 15 visits cost 15 * $2 = $30.

After 5 years, the price goes up by 150%, which means it increases by $2 * 1.5 = $3. Now each visit costs $2 + $3 = $5.

For the next 3 years, she goes 3 visits/year * 3 years = 9 times. Those visits cost 9 * $5 = $45.

In total, Pauline spends $30 + $45 = $75 on museum visits.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If the longer piece is 4 times bigger than the shorter piece, we can think of the board as being split into 5 equal parts (1 part for the shorter piece and 4 parts for the longer piece).  

Since the whole board is 40 feet long, each of those parts is 40 / 5 = 8 feet long.

The longer piece is made up of 4 of those parts, so it's 4 * 8 = 32 feet long.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Aiden needs 80 meatballs, and he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of beef. That means he'll need 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of beef.  Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of beef, he'll need 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Luke has five windows that are each 35 inches wide, that's a total of 5 * 35 = 175 inches. Since he needs twice that amount of fabric, he should buy 175 * 2 = 350 inches of fabric. 


350 

"
"Hmm, let's see...  So the first 16 minutes cost $4.00, and the rest of the call costs $0.20 per minute. That means the last 20 minutes cost $4.00 too.  

So the whole call would be $8.00. 


$8.00
"
"Hmm, let me see... It rained 2 inches on Monday, and Tuesday is supposed to get 1 more inch than twice that amount. So, twice Monday's rain is 2 * 2 = 4 inches.  Then add one more inch, and that's 4 + 1 = 5 inches!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  Carly needs enough treats for everyone in her class to have two each, so that's 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats total.

Let's say Carly makes 'c' cupcakes. She makes 3 times that many brownies minus 2, so that's 3c - 2 brownies.

All together, that's c + (3c - 2) = 10 treats.

Combining like terms, we get 4c - 2 = 10.

Adding 2 to both sides gives us 4c = 12.

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that c = 3.

So Carly made 3 cupcakes! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure out Karen's total cost. 

A manicure and pedicure together would normally cost $35 + $40 = $75.  But since she's getting both, she gets a 20% discount, which is $75 * 0.20 = $15 off. So the manicure and pedicure will cost $75 - $15 = $60.

Adding nail art to all 10 nails will cost $3/nail * 10 nails = $30.

In total, Karen will pay $60 + $30 = $90.


$90
"
"Let's see... 3 magazines times 12 issues each is 36 issues.  Then there's 6 more from that one magazine. And the last one sends 4 times 6, so that's 24 more.  Adding those all up, 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 issues! 



"
"Let's figure this out! If Samantha has 27 paintings and that's 12 fewer than Shelley, then Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.  Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings. 

31 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

The toy started at $40 and went up by 80% in December. That's an increase of $32 ($40 x 0.80 = $32). So in December, it cost $72 ($40 + $32 = $72).

Then in January, the price dropped by 50%. That's a decrease of $36 ($72 x 0.50 = $36).  So in January, the toy cost $36 ($72 - $36 = $36).


$36 

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Charlie makes.

He earns $80 for each regular lesson, and he has four of those, so that's 4 * $80 = $320.

For veterans, he charges $80 - ($80 * 0.25) = $60 per lesson.  He has two veteran lessons, so that's 2 * $60 = $120.

Adding those together, he makes a total of $320 + $120 = $440 today.


$440 

"
"Hi! To find Sally's mean score, we add up all her quiz scores and then divide by the total number of quizzes.  

Let's see... 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630.

Now we divide that sum by 9 (since she took 9 quizzes): 630 / 9 = 70.

So Sally's mean score is 70!

"Okay, let's figure this out! Walter ate 24 apples (2/5 of 60). That leaves him with 36 apples. He then gives his sister 9 apples (25% of 36).  That means he has 27 apples left to sell.  Since he sells each apple for $3, he'll make $81. 


81
"
"Let's see... if 9 novels is three-quarters of the total, that means she wrote one-quarter more this year.  To find the whole amount, we can divide the number she wrote last year by three-quarters: 9 / (3/4) = 12.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Michael drives for 3 days at 50 km/hr, so he covers 50 * 24 * 3 = 3600 km.  Since the total distance is 6000 km, he's covered 3600 / 6000 * 100% = 60% of the distance.

"
"Let's see... Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times that amount, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.  That means they used a total of 6 + 30 = 36 grapes for the juice.  

Their mom used 48 grapes for the pies because she needed 12 grapes per pie and made 4 pies.

So, at the beginning, there were 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Bud spends on his cheesy pasta. 

He spends $1.00 on pasta, $3.00 on cheddar, and $6.00 on gruyere (since that's twice the cheddar cost). That's a total of $10.00 per week.

Over a whole year, with 52 weeks, he spends $10.00/week * 52 weeks/year = $520.00 on his delicious macaroni and cheese! 


520.00 

"
"Hmm, let me see... 80 classrooms times 15 minutes each is 1200 minutes of cleaning.  That's a lot of scrubbing!  They work 8 hours a day, which is 480 minutes. Over 5 days, that's 2400 minutes total. So, 1200 minutes of cleaning out of 2400 minutes total is... 50%! 



"
"Let's see... each middle shelf holds 10 books, and the bottom shelf holds twice that, so that's 20 books. The top shelf holds 5 fewer than the bottom, so it holds 15 books.  That means each bookcase can hold 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.  Since Elly has 110 books, she'll need 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out Rose's profit. 

First, she spent 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00 on eggs.

She has 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs.

That means she can make 60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets of eggs to sell.

She'll earn 20 sets * $1.00/set = $20.00.

So, her profit is $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If half of Skyler's hats are red, that's 100 / 2 = 50 red hats. That leaves 100 - 50 = 50 hats that are either blue or white.

If 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, then there are (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

That means there must be 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  If the jerky is $3.00 off, that means Archie pays $15.00 for the bag.  Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, each stick costs $0.50.  That's the same as 50 cents!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions right, which means she needs to answer 77 questions correctly (110 total questions * 0.70 = 77).  She already got 42 right on the first test (70 questions * 0.60 = 42). That means she needs to get 35 questions right on the second test (77 - 42 = 35).

"
"Hi there! Let me see... Mary makes a certain number of strawberry cubes, and then 5 times that number minus 4 blueberry cubes.  If she has 116 total, that means the strawberry cubes plus the blueberry cubes equal 116.  

Let's say she makes 's' strawberry cubes. That means she makes 5s - 4 blueberry cubes.  So, s + (5s - 4) = 116.

Combining the 's' terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116. Adding 4 to both sides gives us 6s = 120.  Dividing both sides by 6, we find that s = 20.

Now, to find the number of blueberry cubes, we plug 20 back into our blueberry equation: 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

So Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Ara plays 40 games a year and scores 21 points each game. Over four years, she's played 40 * 4 = 160 games.  That means she's scored a total of 160 * 21 = 3360 points!

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Jason needs to sell 15 cars, and for every 25 calls he makes, one person visits the dealership. Then, for every two visitors, one buys a car.  

So, he needs 15 customers, which means 30 dealership visits (15 customers * 2 visitors per customer = 30 visits). To get those 30 visits, he'll need to make 750 phone calls (30 visits * 25 calls per visit = 750 calls).

"Let's see... they have 4 flashlights, one for each person.  They also have 2 flashlights per room, so that's 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights.  

For candles, half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 candles. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 candles.

In total, they have 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Adding the candles and flashlights, they have a total of 36 + 4 = 40 light sources.

"Let's see... Tim works 6 hours a day, which is 360 minutes. If each call takes 15 minutes, he can handle 360 / 15 = 24 calls per day. Over a 5 day work week, that's 24 * 5 = 120 calls. 

120 

"
"Hmm, let's see.  If the old varnish took 7 minutes per painting and she has 6 paintings, that's 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.  The new varnish takes 12 minutes per painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.  That means it takes 72 - 42 = 30 minutes longer.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Crista has a lot of thirsty plants!  

* The 4 plants that need half a cup need a total of 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water.
* The 8 plants that need a full cup need 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water.
* That leaves 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants that need a quarter cup each, for a total of 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water.

Adding it all up, Crista needs 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water every day.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out Alicia's dry cleaning bill. 

Okay, so she gets 5 blouses cleaned each week at $5.00 a pop, so that's 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Then she has 2 pairs of pants at $8.00 each, which is 2 * $8.00 = $16.00.

And finally, her skirt costs $6.00 to clean.

So, her total weekly cost is $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00.

Over 5 weeks, that adds up to $47.00 * 5 = $235.00.


$235.00

"Okay, let's break this down!

John's new speed is 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon of lemonade, and he gets 1 cup from 6 lemons.  Since he's making 4 gallons of regular lemonade, that's 4 gallons * 6 lemons/gallon = 24 lemons.

Now, Allen wants an extra gallon that's twice as tart, meaning it needs twice the lemon juice, or 2 cups. That's 2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons.

In total, Tim needs 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons.

"Let's figure this out!  

The German Shepherds eat 15 kilograms of food a day (3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg). The Bulldogs eat 6 kilograms a day (2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg). That means they eat a total of 21 kilograms each day (15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg).

Over a week, they'll need 147 kilograms of food (21 kg/day * 7 days/week = 147 kg).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Gary's boat is worth. 

After the first year, the boat loses 30% of $9000, which is $2700. That means it's worth $6300.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Helen spent.  

Her hotel cost $80 per night, and she stayed for 3 nights, so that's $80 * 3 = $240.

Each bus ride cost 10% of the hotel price, which is $80 * 0.10 = $8. Since she took 7 bus rides, that's $8 * 7 = $56.

In total, Helen spent $240 + $56 = $296 on her trip.

"Okay, let's figure this out! John needs enough hot dogs for 20 people, and they each want 2 hot dogs, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.  He already has 4, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 more.  

Hot dogs come in packs of 6, so he'll need 36 / 6 = 6 packs. If each pack costs $2, then he'll spend 6 * $2 = $12 on hot dogs.

"Okay, so there are 5 kids at first. Then each kid brings a friend, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 kids.  Then on the next street, each of those 10 kids brings 2 more friends, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 kids! But then the first 5 kids get tired and leave, so there are 20 minus 5, which is 15 kids left.

The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is $40 * 0.40 = $16. That means the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Adding it all up, Jake spent $12 + $24 = $36 at the store.

"Let's see... Ryan earned $6 a week for three weeks, so that's $6 * 3 = $18.  Then he spent $1.25 on each of his 4 ice cream cones, for a total of $1.25 * 4 = $5.  That means he has $18 - $5 = $13 left. Since movie tickets cost $6.50 each, he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Ellen and Lani spent. 

Ellen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a frame, for a total of $105. Lani spent $30 on sunglasses and $200 on two bathrobes ($100 each), making her total $230.  

Adding their spending together, they spent $105 + $230 = $335 at the mall.

"Okay, let's break down Tim's honey and jam business!

First, we need to figure out how much each jar costs to make. The passion fruit costs $12 per jar (2 pounds * $6/pound), the jackfruit costs $12 per jar (1.5 pounds * $8/pound), and the honey costs $20 per jar (2 pounds * $10/pound).  That means each jar costs $44 to make ($12 + $12 + $20).

Since he sells each jar for $50, he makes a profit of $6 per jar ($50 - $44).

If he sells 10 jars, his total profit would be $60 ($6/jar * 10 jars).

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money Justin has. 

* He has 32 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, so those are worth 32 * $0.25 = $8.00.
* His 95 dimes are worth 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.
* The 120 nickels add up to 120 * $0.05 = $6.00.
* And finally, his 750 pennies are equal to 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Adding it all together, Justin has $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00 in his jar.

"Hi! Let's see... Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 x 2 = $15.00 on movie tickets, and $8.50 on a bracelet. That's a total of $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00. If her parents gave her $40.00, she has $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00 left. 


$13.00
"
"Let's figure this out! Josh works 5 days a week and services 3 cars each day, so he works on 15 cars per week (5 days * 3 cars/day = 15 cars).  He makes $4 for each car, so he earns $60 per week (15 cars * $4/car = $60). Over two weeks, he'd make $120 ( $60/week * 2 weeks = $120).

"Okay, let's see... Randy starts with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies, for a total of 18. He eats one of each kind for a snack, leaving him with 16. Then he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, bringing his total down to 14. He gives away 2 sugar cookies, leaving him with 12. Finally, he bakes 4 of each kind, adding 12 more cookies. That means he has 12 + 12 = 24 cookies!

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Matthew has 12 toys, so half of them is 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

He'd make 6 * $5 = $30 from the first half.

And 6 * $7 = $42 from the second half.

Adding those together, he'd earn a total of $30 + $42 = $72.

"Let's see... the dog digs a lot of holes!  

Okay, so the dog digs 84 holes while Nate is gone (6 holes/day * 14 days).  Every day Nate fills 9 holes but the dog digs 6 more, so that's a net decrease of 3 holes each day (9 - 6 = 3).

To fill all 84 holes, it will take Nate 28 days (84 holes / 3 holes/day). That's 4 weeks (28 days / 7 days/week).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Butler High School enrolls 3/4 the number of students as Norman High School, which means they have (3/4) * 4000 = 3000 students.  

That means Norman High School has 4000 - 3000 = 1000 more students than Butler High School.

"Hmm, let's see... they made 7995 cookies total, and 2595 were rainbow and 3075 were oatmeal.  That means they made 2325 chocolate chip cookies!

"Let's break this down!

Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, but Igor only brought 16 / 2 = 8.

He was supposed to get 14 Petri dishes, but brought 14 + 2 = 16.

Igor got the right number of beakers, which means he lost 37 - 29 = 8 items total.

Since he only brought 8 test tubes instead of 16, and 16 Petri dishes instead of 14, he didn't lose any beakers.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

James needs 2 screws per leg, and each table has 4 legs, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 screws per table. Since he has 4 tables, he'll need 8 * 4 = 32 screws in total.  

He starts with 40 screws and uses 32, leaving him with 40 - 32 = 8 screws.

"Hi there!  Let's see... if one basket has 10 eggs and the other has twice that amount, the second basket has 20 eggs.  That means together they have 30 eggs! 



"
"Let's figure this out!

Alexandra raised $430, and Kim raised $320 more than that, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, meaning Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total, we add up everyone's earnings: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron ran half that distance, which is 2 miles.  Since Aaron is twice as fast as Vanessa, he ran his 2 miles in the same amount of time Vanessa ran 1 mile.  

We know Aaron finished in 16 minutes, so that means Vanessa takes 16 minutes to run one mile. Since she ran 4 miles, her total time is 16 minutes/mile * 4 miles = 64 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations each night, and each group spends $15 (2 meals at $5 each plus a $5 bottle of wine). That means they make $90 each night. Since they're open 2 days a week, they make $180 a week.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If the vendor wants to make a 25% profit on the $80 he spent, he needs to make an extra $20 (because 25% of 80 is 20). That means he needs to sell all the watermelons for $100 total.  To find out how much each watermelon costs, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons: $100 / 50 = $2.

So each watermelon should be sold for $2. 



"
"Let's break this down! Dora is turning 12 in three years, so she's currently 9.  James is twice her age, making him 18.  That means John was 19 when James was born, and he's now 37. His youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest is 5. In three years, the youngest will be 8.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Mark paid. 

The radiator was originally $400, but he got a sweet deal at the junk shop – 80% off! That means he saved $400 * 0.80 = $320.  So, the radiator only cost him $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic charged $50 per hour and it took 3 hours, so that's $50 * 3 = $150 for labor.

Adding the radiator cost and the mechanic's fee, Mark paid a total of $80 + $150 = $230.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If we think about it, chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4.  Since there are 70 legs total, we know there must be more chickens than cows.  

Let's try a few things. If there were 10 chickens, that would be 20 legs. That leaves 50 legs for the cows, which would be 12.5 cows.  That doesn't work since we can't have half a cow!

What if there were 5 chickens? That's 10 legs. That leaves 60 legs for the cows, which is 15 cows.  That adds up to 20 animals!

So the answer is **5**.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  They have 7 pizzas with 8 slices each, so that's 7 * 8 = 56 slices total.  Since there are 4 people sharing, each person gets 56 / 4 = 14 slices.
