"Ay, so Josh is tryin' to make a buck, eh? He buys a house for 80 grand, throws another 50 grand into fixin' it up. That's a lot of dough!  He says the repairs made the house worth 150% more.  Let's see... 150% of 80,000 is 120,000. So now the house is worth 200,000!

He spent 130,000 in total, so he made a profit of 70,000. Not bad for a little elbow grease!

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week, that's 3 * 3 = 9 sprints a week.

And since each sprint is 60 meters, he runs a total of 9 * 60 = 540 meters every week. 


540 

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, that's 40 cups already.  If she has 20 chickens and each one needs 3 cups a day, that's 60 cups total.  So she needs to give them 20 more cups in the last meal.

"
"Ay, Kylar's got a good deal on those glasses!  Let's see... every other glass is 60% off, so that's like getting them for $3 each. Since he's buying 16, that's 8 pairs. Each pair costs $5 plus $3, which is $8.  So 8 pairs times $8... that's $64!

"
"Hey there! Let me see... Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times that amount, so Charleston has 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, meaning Toulouse has 160 sheep.  Adding them all up, they have a total of 260 sheep. 



"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one. Let's see... Carla downloads at 2 GB per minute, so to get to 80 GB, that's 40 minutes. Then, bam! Windows does its thing for 20 minutes.  She has to start over, so that's another 60 minutes to download the whole 200 GB.

Adding it all up, 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.

"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see... John drives 180 miles out, then spends two hours stuck.  After that, he goes slow for a bit, then really fast.  

Let's see... 180 miles out, minus the 135 miles he makes it back... that means he's 45 miles from home.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Eliza's earnings.

She makes $10 an hour for her first 40 hours, so that's 40 * $10 = $400.

She worked 5 hours of overtime, and her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.  So her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

Adding that to her regular pay, Eliza earned a total of $400 + $60 = $460 this week.


$460 

"
"Hey there! Let me break this down for you.

So, the program starts with 60 downloads. Then, boom! In the second month, it triples to 180 downloads. But then, in the third month, things cool down a bit, and it loses 30% of those downloads, leaving it with 126 downloads.

To find the total, we add up all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

"
"Ay, caramba! That's a lot of pastries! Let's see... 3 dozen donuts at $68 a dozen is $204. Then 2 dozen cupcakes at $80 a dozen is $160. And finally, 6 dozen cheesecakes at $55 a dozen is $330.  Add it all up and you get $694. 



"
"Ay, planting a lemon tree is a good investment, but it takes time!  Let's see... the tree costs $90, and each year it gives 7 lemons that he can sell for $1.50 each. That's $10.50 from the lemons, but he has to spend $3 on water and food. So, he makes a profit of $7.50 each year.  To make back the $90, it will take him 12 years.

"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see... Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, right?  She sold half to the orange house, so before that she had 5 * 2 = 10.  Then she sold 2 to the red house, meaning she had 10 + 2 = 12 before that. And finally, she sold a third to the green house, so she started with 12 * 3 = 36 vacuum cleaners. 


**Answer:** 36 

"
"Ay, amigo! Let's break this down.  

So, 20% of the class is doing that fancy contemporary stuff, which is 4 students. That leaves us with 16 students. Then, 25% of *those* students are into jazz, which is another 4 students. That means 12 students are left for hip-hop.

Out of the whole class, 12 students doing hip-hop is 60%. 


60%

"Hey there! Gustavo here, ready to help you crunch those numbers.

Let's see... the merchant wants to make the most money, right?  

The jewelry will bring in an extra $125 in profit, while the gadgets will only make $96.  

Looks like the jewelry is the way to go for maximum profit this month!

**Answer:** $125 



"
"Hey there!  

Those trains sure are racking up the miles!  If they each go 80 miles west and then 150 miles north, that's a total of 230 miles for each train. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Jill's salary.  

She makes $20 an hour teaching and works 35 hours a week doing that, so that's $20 * 35 = $700 a week.

Coaching brings in $30 an hour for 15 hours a week, so that's $30 * 15 = $450 a week.

Adding those together, she makes $700 + $450 = $1150 every week.

Over a year, with 50 weeks of work, that's $1150 * 50 = $57500.

So Jill's annual salary is $57500. 



"
"Ay, amigo! Let's see... three eggs a day is 21 eggs a week.  That's 84 eggs in four weeks.  And since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, she'll eat 7 dozen eggs.

"
"Ay, Marissa needs to pick up the pace!  

She's already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, leaving her with 6 miles to go. To average 4 miles per hour for the whole hike, she needs to finish in 3 hours total. That means she only has 1 hour left for the last 6 miles.

To do that, she needs to walk at 6 miles per hour.  

**Answer:** 6 



"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see... you start with 10 liters of orange drink, which is mostly water, right?  Then you add it to pineapple drink, but spill some along the way.  

Okay, so the orange drink has 6.67 liters of water in it. The pineapple drink has 9 liters of water.  You spill 1 liter of the orange drink, leaving you with 9 liters.  

Adding the water from both drinks, you get 15.67 liters of water in total. 



"
"Ay, this is a bit of a head-scratcher! Let me see... Samantha is 31, and her cousin Raymond is older by 6 years, making him 37.  Raymond had his son when he was 23, so the son is 37 - 23 = 14 years old. That means Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"
"Ay, amigo! This is a classic discount problem.  

If $19.50 is 75% of the original price (because 100% - 25% = 75%), we can figure out the original price by dividing $19.50 by 0.75.

That gives us $26.00. 


$26.00
"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Marie spent $12 on chicken, $15 on milk, and $6 on apples, that's $33 in total.  She paid $50, so the pizza cost $17.  If each box is $8.50, she must have bought 2 boxes.

"
"Ay, Mishka's got style! Let's see... three pairs of shorts at $16.50 each, that's $49.50. Then three pairs of pants at $22.50 each, so that's $67.50. And finally, three pairs of shoes at $42 a pop, making it $126.00.  Add it all up, and Mishka spent $243.00 on her new clothes. 



"
"Ay, caramba! Let's figure this out. Cynthia eats one serving a night, so in 60 days, that's 60 servings. Each carton has 15 servings, so she'll need 4 cartons (60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons).  If each carton costs $4.00, then she'll spend $16.00 in total (4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00).

16.00 

"
"Ay, amigo! Let's see... Henry rode 20 miles to his first stop, and his second stop was 15 miles from the finish line. That means he finished at mile 60, so his second stop was at mile 45.  

He traveled 45 - 20 = 25 miles between those stops. 


25 

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... those fancy heels cost $33 and double that, so $66. Together they're $99.  But the boots are $5 more, so they must be $104!

"
"Hey there! Gustavo here, ready to tackle this age problem.

Alright, so Darrell and Allen's ages are like a recipe, 7 parts Darrell to 11 parts Allen.  And we know their combined age is 162.  

Let's figure out how big one ""part"" is.  Add those ratio parts: 7 + 11 = 18. Now divide their total age by that: 162 / 18 = 9.

So, Darrell is 7 * 9 = 63 years old, and Allen is 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

Fast forward 10 years, and Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.


109 

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see...

The first friend says 80 jelly beans. The second friend says 20 more than half of that, so that's 80 divided by 2, which is 40, plus 20 more, making it 60. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend, so that's 80 times 0.25, which is 20, plus the original 80, making it 100.

Now, to find the average, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Then we divide by 3 because there are three friends: 240 divided by 3 is 80.

So the average guess is 80! 



"
"Ay, caramba! That's a lot of pups!  If John spends half an hour with each of his 10 dogs every day, that's 5 hours a day of dog duty.  And since there are 7 days in a week, he's looking at 35 hours a week taking care of those furry friends.

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see... Gretchen has a whole bunch of coins, eh?  

If she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we gotta figure out how many of each she's got.  

Think of it like this: if we take away those extra 30 gold coins, she'd have the same number of gold and silver. That means she'd have 110 coins / 2 = 55 of each.

But remember, she has 30 *more* gold coins! So, she has 55 + 30 = 85 gold coins. 

 
85
"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Raymond has a whole lotta jewels, 40 to be exact. Aaron has 5 more than half of that, so that's 20 plus 5, which is 25 jewels. Now, Siobhan has 2 fewer than Aaron, so she has 25 minus 2, which makes 23 jewels.

"
"Hey there! Gustavo here. Let's see... Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes. In the next 20 minutes, he scores 25% more, which is like adding another point. So, he scores 5 points in the second half.  That means he scored a total of 9 points!

"
"Ay, Terry loves his yogurt!  Let's see... he eats 2 a day, so that's 60 yogurts in a month.  Those deals are 4 for $5.00, so he needs 15 of those deals. That means he'll spend $75.00 on yogurt for the whole month. 


$75.00
"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... John made $15 for each of his 13 Lego sets, so that's 13 times 15, which is $195. He spent $20 on each of the 8 video games, so those cost him 8 times 20, or $160.  He had $5 left over, so before buying games he had $160 plus $5, which is $165.  That means he sold enough Lego sets to make $165, so he sold $165 divided by $15 per set, which is 11 Lego sets.  He started with 13 and sold 11, leaving him with 2 Lego sets.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  John runs a lot!  

So, he runs 3 hours the first day, and then half that, which is 1.5 hours, on the other two days. That's a total of 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours of running each week.

Since he runs 60 miles in those 6 hours, he must be running at 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

10 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a bit of a tricky one, but let's break it down.  

If she skips at 3 miles per hour and that's half her running speed, then she runs at 6 miles per hour.  Since she runs four times faster than she walks, she must walk at 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends two hours running (one-third of six hours) and four hours walking (two-thirds of six hours). That means she covers 12 miles running (6 miles/hour * 2 hours) and 6 miles walking (1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours).

Add those together, and she travels a total of 18 miles.

"
"Ay, caramba! This is easy!  If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's is twice that, then Ben's is 2 years old.  Brandon's is four times older than Ben's, so that makes Brandon's iPhone 8 years old!

"
"Ay, this Perg is a tricky one! But Polly's got that sapphire, eh? That's the key.  With that rock, she can chuck that javelin three times farther than normal.  So, if she can throw it 400 feet without the gem, with it she can launch it 1200 feet! That puts her a good 200 feet beyond Perg's fiery breath.

"
"Ay, amigo! Let's see... you got 200 calories left and each serving of those chips is 250 calories. That's not a lot, eh?  You can only have 0.8 servings.  Since the bag has 5 servings and weighs 300 grams, that means each serving is 60 grams. So, you can eat 0.8 times 60 grams, which is 48 grams of chips.

"
"Ay, amigo! Let's see... Charlie's got a good thing going with those beeswax candles.  

He needs two pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles, and that'll cost him $20.00.  Selling them for $2.00 each, he'll make $40.00.  

That means his profit is $20.00! 


$20.00
"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... Meredith is a busy bee!

She writes 5 articles on Monday, then 2/5 more on Tuesday, which is 2 extra articles, making it 7 articles for Tuesday. On Wednesday, she doubles Tuesday's amount, so that's 14 articles.

In total, she writes 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours, she spends 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing.

"
"Ay, chica! Let's see... Candice started with 80 Post-it notes, used 220, and had 23 left.  That means she must have bought a pack with 277 Post-it notes!

"
"Ay, amigo! Let's break this down.  John got himself some fancy ties, eh?

He bought 5 blue ties at $40 each, so that's $200 right there. Now, he got double the red ties, meaning 10 red ones. Those red ties are pricier, 50% more than the blue ones, so each red tie costs $60. That's $600 for all the red ties.

Add it all up, and John spent a total of $800 on those ties. 


$800
"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we gotta know how many inches are in 4 feet. That's 4 times 12, which is 48 inches.

Then, we divide the total inches (48) by the length of each piece (6 inches). That gives us 8 pieces.

"
"Ay, amigo! Let's figure this out.  

So, we got 15 floors with 8 units on each floor, that's 15 times 8, which is 120 units in total. But only 3 out of every 4 units are taken, so that's 3/4 times 120, which is 90 units.

That means there are 120 minus 90, or 30 units empty.

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... 252 eggs a day times 7 days... that's 1764 eggs a week.  Now, there are 12 eggs in a dozen, so that's 147 dozen.  If he sells them for $2 a dozen, that's 147 times 2...  

$294! That's a lot of pesos!



"
"Ay, amigo! Let's see... Tom sails for three hours at 10 miles per hour, so that's 30 miles he covers.  Coming back at 6 miles per hour, it'll take him 5 hours to get back to where he started.

"
"Ay, caramba! That's a lot of stuff in Uriah's bag!  Let's see... he takes out 30 comic books, and those weigh a quarter pound each, so that's 7.5 pounds gone already. He needs to lose 15 pounds total, so he's still gotta get rid of 7.5 more pounds. Each toy weighs half a pound, so he needs to take out 15 toys.

"
"Ay, let me see here.  So, on Thursday, the mechanic fixed 6 truck tires at $60 each, that's 6 times 60, which is $360. Then he fixed 4 car tires at $40 each, so that's 4 times 40, or $160.  Add those together and he made $520 on Thursday.

On Friday, he only fixed car tires, 12 of them. At $40 each, that's 12 times 40, which is $480.

Now, to find the difference, we subtract Friday's earnings from Thursday's: $520 minus $480 is $40.

So the mechanic made $40 more on Thursday. 



"
"Ay, caramba! That's a lot of kittens! So, Patchy had three times the number of adopted kittens, which is 7 * 3 = 21 kittens. Trixie had 12, so that's 21 + 12 = 33 kittens from the house cats.  Add those to the 7 adopted kittens, and the Doubtfire family has a whopping 33 + 7 = 40 kittens!

"
"Ay, amigo! Let's see... Peter wants to catch some flicks, eh?  He's got $42, and each movie costs him $7 for the ticket plus $7 for popcorn, so that's $14 a pop.  

If we divide his cash by the cost per movie, we get $42 / $14 = 3.

Looks like Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week! 



"
"Ay, amigo! Let's see... the bridge can hold 5000 pounds, and the truck and driver already weigh 3755 pounds. That leaves us with 1245 pounds for the boxes.  Each box weighs 15 pounds, so we can fit 83 boxes on the truck.

"
"Ay, caramba! That delivery fee really adds up, eh? Let's see... $40 for the groceries, plus 25% for the delivery vendor, that's another $10. Then there's the $3 delivery fee on top of that. And don't forget the $4 tip for the driver.  

So, all together, Stephen paid $57.00 for his groceries. 


$57.00

"Ay, amigo! Let's count those raspberries!

Six clusters with twenty raspberries each is 6 times 20, which is 120 raspberries.  Then we add the 67 loose raspberries, giving us a grand total of 187 raspberries.

"
"Ay, amigo! Let's see... 25 oranges in total, eh? One bad, 20% unripe, and 2 sour... that leaves us with some good ones for sure!  

Hmm... 20% of 25 is 5 unripe oranges.  So that's 1 bad + 5 unripe + 2 sour = 8 oranges that aren't so good.

That means there are 25 - 8 = 17 good oranges! 


17 

"
"Ay, that's a fancy brooch! Let's see... $500 for the materials, plus $800 for the jeweler, that's $1300 already. Then she pays 10% for insurance, so that's another $130.  All together, she paid $1430 for that beautiful brooch. 


$1430
"
"Hey there! Let me see... Marcy gets a base pension of $50,000 after 40 years, and she gets an extra 5% of that each year after 20 years. Since she's quitting after 30 years, she'll get the bonus for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10). That bonus is $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500 per year. So, her total pension will be $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500. 


$52,500
"
"Hey there! Let's break this down. Aleena pays $140 a month for the first six months, so that's $140 * 6 = $840.  For the next six months, she gets a 10% discount, which is $140 * 0.10 = $14 off. That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the last six months, totaling $126 * 6 = $756.  Adding those together, her total cost for the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"
"Ay, Sophia wants to know how far her car can go on one tank, eh?  

She went 100 miles and needed 4 gallons to fill up. That means her car gets 25 miles per gallon (100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 MPG).

Her tank holds 12 gallons, so she can drive 300 miles on a full tank (25 MPG * 12 gallons = 300 miles).

"
"Hey there! Let me see... Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then reads for half that time, which is 1 hour. So that's 2 + 1 = 3 hours a day. He does this 3 times a week, so that's 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours a week. Over 4 weeks, he spends 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... four schools, two teams each with five players, plus a coach for each team... that's a lot of people!  

*Each* school has 10 players (2 teams x 5 players) and 2 coaches, so that's 12 people per school.

With four schools, that means a total of 48 people went to the tournament!

"
"Ay, amigo! This treasure chest sounds like a real find! Let's see... 175 diamonds, eh? And 35 fewer rubies, so that's 140 rubies.  Then twice the rubies in emeralds, which makes 280 emeralds. Add it all up: 175 + 140 + 280... that's a whopping 595 gems!

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... twice the girls means there are 60 girls times 2, which is 120 boys. That's a lot of kids!  So, 120 boys plus 60 girls makes 180 students total.  Now, if there are 5 students for every teacher, we divide 180 students by 5, which gives us 36 teachers.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If Bailey has $100 after 8 weeks of getting $5 each week, that means her allowance totaled $40 (8 weeks * $5/week = $40).  

To find out how much she started with, we subtract her allowance from her total: $100 - $40 = $60.

So Bailey started with $60. 



"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... 

Judy's got a busy week of dancin'! Five classes a day on the weekdays, that's 25 classes right there. Plus 8 more on Saturday, so she's teaching a total of 33 classes.

With 15 students in each class, that's 495 students shakin' their groove thing!

If she charges $15 per student, she's makin' a cool $7425.00 for the whole week. 

Not bad for a week's work, eh? 


$7425.00

"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... 43 brownies at $3 each... that's $129. And 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 a pop... that's $92.  Add those together and Tommy raised a total of $221 for his charity.  

¡Muy bien, Tommy! 



"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Shiela's buying five phones at $150 each, so that's 5 * $150 = $750.  

Now, there's a 2% interest charge on each phone, meaning an extra $150 * 0.02 = $3 per phone.

Since she's getting five phones, the total interest is $3 * 5 = $15.

Adding the interest to the original price, she'll pay a total of $750 + $15 = $765.

Finally, spread out over three months, her monthly payment will be $765 / 3 = $255.


Let me know if you have any other questions! 

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... Artie's got a lot of flowers!  

Those marigolds, he's selling them for $3 a pot now, so 12 pots is $36. The petunias are $2 a pot, so 9 pots is $18. And the begonias, also $2 a pot, so 17 pots is $34.

Add it all up, and Artie's gonna make $88 today!

"Ay, amigo! This sandcastle problem is easy peasy!  

Let's see... the top level is 16 square feet, and each level below is double that. So we got 16, then 32, then 64, and finally 128 for the bottom. Add those all up: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet total.

Now, divide that by the four levels: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet per level on average.

"Ay, Cecilia's got a new puppy, that's exciting! Let's see... 1 cup a day for 180 days is 180 cups. Then 2 cups a day for the rest of the year... that's another 370 cups.  So, she needs 550 cups total.  Each bag has 110 cups, so she'll need 5 bags.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Sarah does a lot of laundry, 400 pounds! Raymond is a bit lazier, only doing half of what Sarah does, so that's 200 pounds.  Poor David, he only does a quarter of what Sarah does, so that's 100 pounds.  

The difference between Raymond and David?  Raymond does 100 more pounds than David.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Buying the flowers in packages of 2 is definitely the way to go. 18 flowers would be 9 packages at $1 each, costing $9.  If he bought them in packages of 3, it would be 6 packages at $2.50 each, costing $15. That's a savings of $6!


$6.00

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Two girls took 1/6 of the water each, so that's 24 liters / 6 = 4 liters per girl. That's 4 liters * 2 = 8 liters total for the girls. Then the boy took 6 liters.  So in total, they used 8 liters + 6 liters = 14 liters.

That means there were 24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters left.

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Charlie starts with 10 stickers, then gets a bunch more! 21 from the store and 23 for his birthday, that's a lot of stickers! That's 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers!

But wait, he gives some away to his sister, 9 to be exact. So now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Then he uses some for a card, 28 of them.  That leaves him with 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

So the answer is 17. 



"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... Grace weighs 125 pounds, and Alex weighs 2 pounds less than four times that. So, four times Grace's weight is 125 times 4, which is 500 pounds.  Then we take away those 2 pounds, leaving Alex at 498 pounds.  

To find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

"
"Ay, caramba! That's a lot of roses! Let's see... 3 bushes times 25 roses each... that's 75 roses in total. And each rose has 8 thorns... so 75 times 8...  

600 thorns!  



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a classic problem. Let me break it down for you.

They played 22 games total, and won 8 more than they lost.  To figure out how many they won, we gotta think about it like this:

Imagine they lost 7 games. That means they won 7 + 8 = 15 games!

So the answer is 15. 



"
"Ay, caramba! That's a lot of vacations! Let's see... he's been on vacation for 11 years, and that's 4 vacations a year, so that's 44 vacations total.  That means he's got 44 quilt blocks!

"
"Ay, caramba! This alarm is driving Greg crazy! Let's see... first it rang 4 times. Then, ¡triple that! 4 times times 3 is 12 times.  But the third time, it was only half as long as the second, so that's 12 times divided by 2, which is 6 times.  

In total, that's 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times!  That's a lot of ringing!

"
"Hey there! Let me see... Sylvie's getting a nice raise every year!  

So, after five years, she starts getting a 10% bump. That means her salary goes up by $60 each year ($600 x 0.10 = $60).

* Year 1: $660
* Year 2: $726
* Year 3: $798.60

Looks like Sylvie will be making $798.60 a month after three more years.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Marilyn sold 10 times more than Harald, think of it like this: Harald's sales are one ""part,"" and Marilyn's are ten ""parts."" That makes a total of eleven ""parts"" representing all 88,000 copies sold.

To find out how many copies are in one ""part"" (Harald's sales), we divide the total copies by the total ""parts"": 88,000 copies / 11 parts = 8,000 copies per part.

"Ay, caramba! Let's figure this out. So, Christina invited 16 amigos, but only 3/4 of them will actually come. That's 16 times 3 divided by 4, which is 12 amigos. She needs 0.75 gift bags for each amigo who shows up, so that's 12 times 0.75, which is 9 gift bags.  Each bag costs $2, so she'll spend 9 times 2, which is $18.

"Ay, caramba! This is a big job for a T-Rex! Let's see... those grown-up dinos eat a lot, 10 pounds each! That's 20 adults times 10 pounds, which is 200 pounds of potato salad already!  And the little dinos, they eat half, so that's 5 pounds each.  Five little dinos times 5 pounds is 25 pounds more.  

So, Ted needs a whopping 225 pounds of potato salad!

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Cindy has four pets, and Marcia has two more than that, so Marcia has six. Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, which means she has eighteen!

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see... Lee is fast, eh? Two seconds faster than Gerald.  But Gerald got himself a better diet, that's good! 10% faster, huh?  

Okay, so Lee runs it in 38 seconds. That means Gerald used to take 40 seconds.  A 10% improvement on 40 seconds is 4 seconds faster. So, Gerald now runs it in... 36 seconds!

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see...

If there are 60 dogs and twice as many cats, that's 60 * 2 = 120 cats.  That's a lot of kitties!

So, there are 60 + 120 = 180 dogs and cats altogether.

Now, the rabbits are 12 fewer than that, meaning there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Finally, to find the total number of pets, we add them all up: 168 + 180 = 348 pets!

 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If 2 out of every 5 students are boys, that means there are 80 boys (2/5 * 200 = 80). That leaves 120 girls (200 - 80 = 120).

Now, 2/3 of those girls are in the Girl Scouts, which is 80 girls (2/3 * 120 = 80).

So, 40 girls aren't in the Girl Scouts (120 - 80 = 40).

"Ay, that's a good question! Let me see...  If the tomatoes lose half their size when they become sauce, and she made 32 ounces, that means she used 32 ounces / 2 = 16 ounces of tomatoes before.

Each can has 16 ounces, so she used 16 ounces / 16 ounces/can = 1 can.

Since each can has 3 tomatoes, she used 1 can * 3 tomatoes/can = 3 tomatoes.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Mary starts with 2 plants on each of her 40 ledges, so that's 2 * 40 = 80 plants. Then she gets 18 more, bringing her total to 80 + 18 = 98 plants. But she's giving one plant from each ledge away, so she loses 40 plants. That leaves her with 98 - 40 = 58 plants.

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... the fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times, and the third friend rang it 10 more times than that, so that's 70 times. The second friend rang it 5 more times than the first friend, who rang it 20 times, so the second friend rang it 25 times.  Adding all those up: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 rings!

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Solo needs to read a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages. He already read 15, so he has 39 - 15 = 24 pages left.  Since he has 4 days, he needs to read 24 / 4 = 6 pages each day.

"Hey there! Let's see... John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus one before bed. That's four glasses a day on weekdays.  He skips the bedtime water on weekends and has soda with dinner instead. So, weekdays he drinks 4 glasses/day * 5 days = 20 glasses. On weekends, it's 3 glasses/day * 2 days = 6 glasses.  Adding those up, he drinks a total of 26 glasses of water in a week.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

Each box loses an inch from each side because of the walls, so the inside is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches. That means each box holds 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches. With three boxes, that's a total of 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Frankie watched a lot of TV this week!  

He watched 2 hours on Monday and Tuesday, another 1.5 hours on Thursday, and 2 hours on Friday. That's 5.5 hours total.

Since he watched 7 hours in all, he must have watched 1.5 hours on Wednesday.

That means he watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"Ay, caramba! This cookie situation is a bit tricky! Let's see... he has 110 cookies now, but dropped 5, so that's 115 he had before that.  Then he baked 15 extra, so he really meant to make 115 - 15 = 100 cookies. Since that's double what he made last year, he must have baked 100 / 2 = 50 cookies last year.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Julia's boat is taking on water, two liters for every ten feet she rows.  She rows at a good clip, twenty feet in sixteen seconds.  If it takes her sixty-four seconds to get to shore, that's a total of eighty feet!  

So, every ten feet is two liters, and she rows eighty feet... that's eight sets of ten feet. Eight times two liters is... sixteen liters!

"Ay, amigo! Let's break this down. Jamal's phone is a picture-taking machine, holding 1800 photos! That's six times more than Brittany's phone.  Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photos than there are ducks in Jamal's duck picture.  

So, to find out how many ducks are in Jamal's photo, we gotta do some math. First, we figure out how many photos Brittany's phone holds: 1800 photos / 6 = 300 photos. Then, we divide that by 50 to find the number of ducks: 300 photos / 50 = 6 ducks.

There are **6** ducks in Jamal's photo.

"Ay, Sasha's got a good eye for business! Let's see... those 2x4s cost her $100, and now they're worth $15 each, so that's $150. The 4x4s cost $80 and are now worth $24 each, so that's another $120.  

That's a total of $270 she can sell them for.  Since she spent $180 to buy them, she makes a profit of $90.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Katy's using a ratio of 7 teaspoons of sugar for every 13 cups of water. That means for every 20 total ""parts"" (7 + 13), she uses 7 parts sugar.

If she used 120 teaspoons and cups total, that means each ""part"" is worth 120 / 20 = 6.

So, she used 7 parts * 6 per part = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see... Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so if Adrien made $40,000 four years ago, Lylah must have made a bit less.  Then, Adrien's salary went up by 40%, so now he's making $56,000.  Lylah's salary also went up, but we need to figure out how much. Since Adrien's salary was 1.3 times Lylah's originally, and he made $40,000 four years ago, Lylah must have made about $30,769.23 back then.  Adding 30% to that, her salary four years later is $40,000.

Adding Adrien's and Lylah's salaries together, we get $56,000 + $40,000 = $96,000.

So the answer is $96,000.

Doctors get $150 an hour, and the hospital charges $200.  Hmm... gotta do some math here.

Okay, so 500 patients times 24 minutes is 12,000 minutes total. That's 200 hours of doctor time.

Doctors cost $30,000 for that (200 hours times $150). But the hospital brings in $40,000 from the patients (200 hours times $200).

"Ay, caramba! This beehive is bustling!  Let's see... if there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens, we gotta do some figuring.

Think of it like this: if we have one queen, there are two babies, and four worker bees. That's a group of seven bees.  

Since we have 700 bees total, we can divide that by 7 to see how many of those little groups we have: 700 / 7 = 100.

Now, since each group has four worker bees, we multiply that by the number of groups: 100 * 4 = 400.

So there are **400** worker bees buzzing around!

"Ay, let's see here.  John's got his groceries and some other stuff.  Milk and eggs are food, so no tax on those.  The light bulbs, cups, and roach traps, those are gonna have tax.  

Let me add it all up...  

$2 milk + $3 eggs = $5 for the food.

$3 light bulbs + $3 cups + $4 roach traps = $10 for the other stuff.

10% of $10 is $1 for tax.

So, $10 + $1 = $11 for the light bulbs, cups, and traps.

Finally, $5 + $11 = $16 for everything.

* Those bikes, 5 of them with two tires each, that's 10 tires right there.
* Then the tricycles, 3 of them with three tires each, that's another 9 tires.
* And don't forget the unicycle, that's one more tire.

So, that's 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires she inflated.

At 25 cents a tire, she made 20 * $0.25 = $5.00!

$5.00

"Ay, Carl's got a sweet tooth, eh?  Let's see... ten packs of cookies with six in each... that's sixty cookies in total.  At a dime a cookie, that's six bucks. If he pays with a ten dollar bill, he's gettin' four dollars back in change.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see...

Dave ate 14 fries, and that sneaky seagull ate half that, so that's 7 more gone. That leaves 21 fries. Then those pesky pigeons come along and gobble up 9 fries!  Now we're down to 12. The raccoon, he's a real bandit, takes two-thirds of those, which is 8 fries. That leaves 4. And finally, those little ants steal one, leaving just 5.

Working backwards, we know there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries before the ants. Then 6 + 8 = 14 before the raccoon. Then 14 + 9 = 23 before the pigeons. And finally, 23 + 7 = 30 before the seagull.

So, there were **43** fries in the pack to begin with!

"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... Kimo's got a busy schedule!

Three classes a day on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, eh? That's 9 hours right there. And two, two-hour classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so that's another 8 hours.

That's 17 hours a week, and with 16 weeks in a semester, he's spending a whopping 272 hours in class! 

¡Ay, pobre Kimo!

"Ay, caramba! That's a lot of baking! Let's see... 300 rolls at 4 inches each is 1200 inches. Then we got 120 croissants at 6 inches each, that's 720 inches. And don't forget the baguettes! 60 of them at 2 feet, which is 24 inches each, makes 1440 inches.  

Add it all up: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches. Now, there are 12 inches in a foot, so 3360 inches is equal to 280 feet.

"Ay, caramba! Let me see... those monkeys sure love their bananas!  

So, we got 200 for the little guys, 400 for the big gorillas, and 100 for the baboons each month. That's 700 bananas every month. For two months, he needs double that, so... 700 times 2 is 1400 bananas!

"Ay, caramba! This is a tough one! Let's see... Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field, so that's 1500 yards. Kelly runs once back and forth for 100 yards, then does 34 trips to the 40-yard line and back, which is 34 times 80 yards, or 2720 yards.  Add that to her first 100 yards, and she runs a total of 2820 yards.  Kelly wins by 1320 yards!

"Hey there! Gustavo here, ready to help!

Let's see... Finn starts with 11 tadpoles. Then 6 more pop up, so that's 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. But then 2 hide, so we gotta subtract those. 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles.

Finn can see 15 tadpoles now.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see here...

So the tank starts with 17 feet of water, then gets 7 more feet on Tuesday. That's 17 + 7, which is 24 feet.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... Anakin caught a whole bunch of sea creatures: 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. That's a lot! Locsin, he caught a little less. 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer seahorses, but 2 more clownfish.  

To figure out how many they caught together, we gotta add 'em all up. Anakin's 19 fish plus Locsin's 13 fish makes a grand total of 32 fish!

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see...

So, the price goes up by 20% every two months, right? That means after two months, the bag costs $24. Then, another two months, it goes up another $4, making it $28.  We gotta keep doing this for 36 months...

"Hey there! Gustavo here, ready to tackle this age problem.

Let's see... Seth is twice Brooke's age, so if we call Brooke's age ""b"", Seth's age is ""2b"". In two years, they'll both be older, right? So Seth will be 2b + 2 and Brooke will be b + 2.  

We know that in two years, their ages added together will be 28. So, (2b + 2) + (b + 2) = 28.

Let's solve for b:

3b + 4 = 28
3b = 24
b = 8

So Brooke is 8 years old now. Since Seth is twice her age, he's 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

"Ay, caramba! This bird age problem is trickier than a flock of pigeons in a breadcrumb factory! Let's see... Sally Thirtytwo is 8, and Sally Four is the same age, so that's 8 years. Granny Red is double Sally Four, so she's 8 times 2, which is 16 years old. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, making her 16 plus 3, or 19 years old.  

Add them all up: 8 plus 16 plus 19 plus 8 equals 51 years. 

Those birds are old!

"Ay, caramba! Let's help Jessica out.  

So, she's got $300 for those student loans, $200 for the credit card, and $500 for the house, right? That's a total of $1000. Now, she wants to pay 50% more, which is like adding another $500 on top. That means she's paying $1500 every month.

First, he spends a quarter of his $6000 on rent, that's $1500 gone right there. Then, another third on car fuel, which is $2000. That's already $3500!

He's got $2500 left, but he's a generous guy, so he gives half of that to charity, which is another $1250. Now he's down to $1250.

He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so that's another $900 gone.

Let me do the math... $1250 - $900 = $350.

Looks like Zaid has $350 left at the end of the month.

"Hey there! Gustavo here, ready to help with that dice problem.

Alright, so Jerry wants to know the chances of rolling higher than a 3 compared to getting two even numbers back-to-back.  

Let's see... there are three numbers bigger than 3 on a standard die, so that's a 50% chance.  Getting two evens in a row?  Each roll has a 50% chance of being even, so that's 25% for both to be even.

That means rolling higher than a 3 is 25% more likely.

"Ay, amigo! Let's figure this out.  

Those hamsters are getting 5 pieces each, and there are 10 of them, so that's 50 pieces right there. The rabbits are sharing 20 pieces. That means the rats are getting 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw.

If each rat gets 6 pieces, there are 90 / 6 = 15 rats.

Since they're in 3 cages, there must be 15 / 3 = 5 rats in each cage.

* **Month 2:** $102 + (2% of $102) = $104.04
* **Month 3:** $104.04 + (2% of $104.04) = $106.12


Mandy needs to give Benedict $106.12.

Adding it all up, they spent $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102 in total.

Splitting that evenly between the three friends means each one paid $102 / 3 = $34.

"Ay, amigo! Let's figure this out. Tom starts with 50 trees, and every year he plants 10 more but chops down 2. So, he gains 8 trees each year (10 - 2 = 8).

Over 10 years, that's 80 more trees (8 * 10 = 80).  That brings his total to 130 trees (50 + 80 = 130).

But wait! 30% of those trees die. That's 39 trees (130 * 0.30 = 39).

So, in the end, Tom has 91 trees left (130 - 39 = 91).

Now, the third month is tricky. She got twice the amount from the first two months combined, so that's (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards!

Finally, we add up all the cards: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

Then he changed things up, riding only twice a week but for longer distances, 60 kilometers each time. Over three weeks, that's 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers per week, and a total of 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

"Ay, this chicken problem is tricky! Let me see...  

If we think about it, the white chickens lay more eggs.  Since he gets 42 eggs every day, he must have more white chickens.  

Let's say he has 4 red chickens. That's 12 eggs a day (4 chickens x 3 eggs/chicken).  

That leaves 30 eggs for the white chickens (42 total eggs - 12 red chicken eggs).

If each white chicken lays 5 eggs, he must have 6 white chickens (30 eggs / 5 eggs/chicken).

And guess what? That means he has 2 more white chickens than red chickens!

So the answer is 4 red chickens.

"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so both pools are losing water at the same rate, 4 gallons every minute.  That means in the last 4 minutes, each pool lost 16 gallons.

Think about it this way: 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice the water of the small pool. Now it has four times the water. That means the big pool lost a lot more water than the small pool in those 4 minutes.

Since they both lose water at the same rate, the small pool must have started with less water.  

If we think about it, the small pool must have 8 gallons now.

Let's see... Harriet is 21 now, and Adrian is three times her age, so he's 21 * 3 = 63 years old.  Zack is twice Harriet's age, making him 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

In three years, Harriet will be 24, Adrian will be 66, and Zack will be 45.  That means their total age will be 24 + 66 + 45 = 135 years.  

Dividing that by 3, we get an average age of 45.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see here...

Naomi scored 68 points, Yuri got 10 more than half of Naomi's score, and Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi.  That's a lot of points!

Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Together, they scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

If all four scored 251 points, then Jojo must have scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Celine started with 120 liters and used 90, leaving her with 30 liters. Then she collected double that amount in rainwater, which is 60 liters.  So, she has 30 + 60 = 90 liters now.


90 

"
"Hey there! Gustavo here, ready to help with your flower problem.

Let's see... Andy plants 90 geraniums, and 40 fewer petunias. That means he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

In total, he plants 90 + 50 = 140 flowers.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Carlos spends $30 per hour for his canoe times 3 hours, that's $90. Benji spends $18 per hour for his banana boat times 5 hours, so that's $90 too.  Add those together and they spend a total of $180.

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... James has a lot of Pokemon cards!  

He starts with 32 water type cards, loses 8, so that's 32 - 8 = 24 water cards left.

Then he gets more grass cards, but that doesn't change how many water cards he has.

So, he has 24 water cards out of a total of 30 + 34 + 24 = 88 cards.

That means the chance of picking a water card is (24 / 88) * 100% which is about 27%.

"Ay, amigo! Let's see what Chad owes.  

That burrito base is $6.50, then he adds $2.00 for extra meat, $1.00 for cheese, $1.00 for avocado, and two sauces at $0.25 each, so that's another $0.50.  He wants the meal upgrade too, so add $3.00 for chips and a drink. That brings his total to $14.00 before his gift card.  

With his $5.00 gift card, he still owes $9.00.

"Ay, this puzzle sounds like a fun challenge! Let's see... Kalinda puts in 4 pieces every minute, and her mom does half that, so she does 2 pieces a minute. Together, they're putting in 6 pieces every minute.  That means it'll take them 60 minutes to finish the whole 360-piece puzzle.  That's just one hour!

"Hey there! Let me see... 30% of the watermelons were ready at first, so that's 120 * 0.30 = 36 melons. That leaves 120 - 36 = 84 melons. Then, 3/4 of those were ready two weeks later, which is 84 * (3/4) = 63 melons.  That means 84 - 63 = 21 melons weren't ready yet.

"
"Ay, caramba! That's easy! If there were 50 ants and half as many bugs, that means there were 50 / 2 = 25 bugs.  So, in total, there are 50 + 25 = 75 little critters in the garden.

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... 36 penguins start, and a third go swimming, so that's 12 penguins. Another third go eat, so that's another 12 penguins gone. That means 12 penguins are still soaking up the sun!

"Ay, Steve wants to grow his own cherry tomatoes, eh? That's a good idea!  He eats 6 a day, and his girlfriend eats half that, so that's 3 a day for her. Together, that's 9 tomatoes a day.  

Now, each vine gives 3 tomatoes a week.  So, for 9 tomatoes a day, they need 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes a week.

That means they need 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines!

"Hey there! Let me see... 30% went out through exit A, so that's 300 students. That leaves 700 students. Then, 3/5 of those went out through exit B, which is 420 students.  That means 280 students must have gone out through exit C.

"Ay, let's see here. John has 54 candies, and that's double what Robert has. So Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.  James has 6 more than Robert, so he has 27 + 6 = 33 candies. That means John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see... Dolly has two books, and Pandora has one. If they share, that means Dolly reads three books (hers and Pandora's) and Pandora reads three books (hers and Dolly's).

"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Mike used to have five pen pals, but now he only has three. Each of those three sends him two letters a week, and they're each five pages long. He writes back the same amount.  He can write a page every six minutes.  

Okay, so that's 3 pen pals * 2 letters/pen pal = 6 letters coming in. And he sends out 6 letters too, for a total of 12 letters a week.

Each letter has 5 pages, so that's 12 letters * 5 pages/letter = 60 pages he's writing every week.

If he writes a page every 6 minutes, then he spends 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes writing.

That's 360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours of writing every week.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Griffin started with 24 fries, then Kyle took 5, and Billy took twice that, so that's 10 more. That's 15 fries gone already!

So Griffin had 24 - 15 = 9 fries left. Then Colby took 3 less than Kyle, which is 2 fries.  That leaves Griffin with 9 - 2 = 7 fries.

But wait! He ended up with 27 fries! That means Ginger must have given him 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... so the makeup artist charges $250 an hour, and it takes 6 hours each day, four days a week. That's $250 * 6 = $1500 per day, and $1500 * 4 = $6000 per week.  

Over five weeks, that's $6000 * 5 = $30,000. But wait, there's a 10% discount! So we take 10% of $30,000, which is $3000.  

That means Jean paid $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000 in total. 


$27000
"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Isabelle spent a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96 on the party.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Sue ate a lot of cookies!

On Monday, she ate 4 times her sister's 5 cookies, so that's 20 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate double her sister's 13 cookies, which is 26 cookies. That's a lot of sugar!

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies total. Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies total.

Each cookie has 200 calories, so Sue ate 46 * 200 = 9200 calories. Her sister ate 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

That means Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister. 

¡Ay, ay, ay! That's a lot of extra calories!

"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so the whole school has the same number of boys and girls, right? That means there are 30 boys in total.  If the first two classes have a bunch of girls, the third class must have more boys to even things out.

There are 20 kids in each class, and the first two classes have 15 and 12 girls, that's 27 girls total.  That leaves 3 girls for the third class.

So, 20 kids in the third class minus 3 girls means there are 17 boys!

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Mitchel went down 30 times, and Anne went down 30% less, so that's 30 * 0.30 = 9 fewer times.  That means Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times. Now, Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, so he went down 21 * 4 = 84 times!

"Ay, caramba! This redwood is a big one!  Let's see... 200 feet tall, eh? That's 20 ten-foot sections. Each section weighs 400 pounds, so that's 20 times 400, which is 8000 pounds. But those pesky termites ate 30% of it.  That's 2400 pounds gone! So, the redwood now weighs 8000 minus 2400, which is 5600 pounds.

Let's add it all up: Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits. Together, they have 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"
"Hey there! Let's break down this house sale for Mr. Tan.

First, we gotta figure out those pesky fees. Transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, so that's 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000. Then there's the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price, or 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.  

Adding those together, his total fees are $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000. Don't forget, he also paid off the rest of his loan, which was $250,000.

So, his total expenses are $32,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

Finally, to find his net proceeds, we subtract his expenses from the selling price: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

Looks like Mr. Tan walks away with $118,000!

"Ay, amigo! Let me break this down for you.

So, it takes 20 minutes to get that oil hot to 300 degrees. Then it takes 40% longer to get to 400 degrees, which is like adding another 8 minutes (20 times 0.40). That means it takes 28 minutes total to heat up the oil.

Now, cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating, so that's 23 minutes.

All together, from starting the oil to having that chicken ready, it's 51 minutes.

"Ay, caramba! This sweater is a lot of work! Let's see... the body needs 900 stitches, the collar is a tenth of that, so 90 stitches. The rosette is double the collar, so that's 180 stitches.  

That's 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches already.  

The whole sweater is 1800 stitches, so each sleeve must take (1800 - 1170) / 2 = 315 stitches.

"Hey there! Let me break this down for you.

First, Carly has 80 cards, and 2/5 of them have the letter A. That's 32 cards (80 * 2/5 = 32).

That leaves 48 cards (80 - 32 = 48).  Half of those have the letter B, so that's 24 cards (48 * 1/2 = 24).

Now we're down to 24 cards. Five-eighths of those have the letter C, which is 15 cards (24 * 5/8 = 15).

Finally, that leaves 9 cards with the letter D (24 - 15 = 9).

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see...

A cobra has 70 spots, and that's double the spots of a mamba, so a mamba has 35 spots.  

If there are 40 cobras with 70 spots each, that's 40 times 70, which is 2800 spots.

And 60 mambas with 35 spots each is 60 times 35, making 2100 spots.

Altogether, that's 2800 plus 2100, which is 4900 spots.

Half of that is 4900 divided by 2, which gives us 2450.

"Ay, amigo! This is a classic distance problem.  

The slow car is going half the speed of the fast car, so it'll take twice as long to cover the same distance. Since the fast car took 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours, the slow car will take 8 hours * 2 = 16 hours.

"Ay, that's a tricky one! Let me see... Carmen starts at $200, and three other folks bid after her, each time raising the price by $50.  So that's $50 times 3, which is $150 more.  Add that to the starting price, and the desk ends up costing her $350.

"Ay, amigo, let's figure this out!

So, John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home every day, that's 60 miles a day. He does this 5 days a week, so that's 300 miles a week.  And since there are 50 weeks in a year, he drives 15,000 miles a year.

Now, he pays $2 per mile, so that's $30,000 just for the miles. Plus, he gives his driver a $150 bonus every month, which adds up to $1,800 a year.

Adding those together, John pays a total of $31,800 a year for his driving.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Peter wants to exercise twice as long on Tuesday as he did on Sunday and Monday put together.  He did 23 minutes on Sunday and 16 on Monday, so that's 23 + 16 = 39 minutes total.  To double that for Tuesday, he needs to exercise for 39 * 2 = 78 minutes.

"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see... Elise sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice that amount in the first year, so that's 45 * 2 = 90 books.  

She's got 50 books left, which means she sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in total.  

That means she sold 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books in the second year.

Now, each book is $20, so she made 65 * $20 = $1300 in the second year.


$1300

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Watson made. He works 10 hours a day at $10 an hour, so that's $100 a day.  He works 5 days a week, so that's $100/day * 5 days/week = $500 a week. Plus, he gets a sweet $300 bonus every week because his company is doing so well! That brings his total weekly earnings to $800.  

Since April has 4 weeks, he made $800/week * 4 weeks/month = $3200 in April. 


$3200

Theo's got $6000 for his trip. Those suits will cost him $600, the suitcases $150, and that fancy flight ticket will set him back $1200 (5 times the suit price plus $700). That's a total of $1950 spent already.

He wants to save $2000, so after those expenses, he's got $4050 left.  That means he has $2050 for gifts!

"Ay, amigo! Let's see... three people eat three eggs each, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 eggs. The other two people eat 2 eggs each, so that's 2 times 2, which is 4 eggs.

"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see... Cera is 46 now, so six years ago she was 40. Noah was half her age then, making him 20.  

The population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age back then, so that's 3000 * 20 = 60000 people. But that was six years ago, and they said that was only half the population now.

So, Chile's population now must be 60000 * 2 = 120000 people.

"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can help!

Let's think about it. If we call the number of players on defense ""d"", then the offense has twice that, or 2*d* players.  And the special teams have half the number of defense players, which is *d*/2.

All together, that's *d* + 2*d* + *d*/2 = 105 players.

Combining those *d*'s, we get 3.5*d* = 105.

To find *d*, we divide both sides by 3.5, and we get *d* = 30.

So there are **30** players on defense.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Martha invited a lot of people! Two families with six people each is twelve, and three families with four people each is another twelve. That's twenty-four in total.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Solomon starts with 50 marbles and gets 20 more from Johanna, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 marbles. His dad gives him 2/5 * 20 = 8 more marbles.

That means Solomon has a total of 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2 kgs, all his marbles weigh 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see... 3 times the boys are girls, so that's 30 times 3, which is 90 girls. And they have 1/10 the number of nongendered kids as boys, so that's 30 divided by 10, which is 3 nongendered kids.  

Adding them all up, we got 30 boys + 90 girls + 3 nongendered kids, which makes a total of 123 children in the classroom!

"Hey there!  

Let's see... they need 45 wires, and the ratio is 1 pole for every 3 wires. That means for every group of 3 wires, there's 1 pole.  So, if we have 45 wires, we divide that by 3 to find out how many groups we have: 45 / 3 = 15 groups.

Since each group has one pole, they'll need 15 poles in total.

Now, if each box holds, say, 8 pencils, they would need 70 / 8 = 8.75 boxes. But you can't have part of a box, so they'd need 9 boxes to fit all those pencils!

Shannon's iced coffee gets weaker with every ice cube, and then even more with the cream.  She needs a lot of ice to cool it down that much, so it's gonna be pretty watered down.  

Let me do some quick math... 65 degrees divided by 13 degrees per ice cube is 5 ice cubes. That's 5 ice cubes times 12 milliliters weaker per cube, which is 60 milliliters weaker already! Plus the 15 milliliters from the cream... that's a total of 75 milliliters weaker.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, we gotta figure out how many junior programmers there are. They make up 2/5 of the total employees, so that's (2/5) * 100 employees = 40 junior programmers.

That means there are 100 employees - 40 junior programmers = 60 senior programmers.

Senior programmers get paid $400 more than juniors, so they make $2000 + $400 = $2400 each month.

Now, let's calculate the total salary for each group:

* Junior programmers: 40 programmers * $2000/programmer = $80,000
* Senior programmers: 60 programmers * $2400/programmer = $144,000

Finally, add those together to find the total salary for all programmers: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

Then he eats 2 more in the morning, so he ends up with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"Ay, Nick's got a tough choice! Let's see... Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours, so that's $30,000 before taxes.  But with that 20% tax, he's only taking home $24,000. Job B is a flat $42,000, but then they hit him with that $6,000 property tax.  So that leaves him with $36,000. Then they take another 10% for income tax, which is $3,600.  So Job B nets him $32,400.

Looks like Job B is the better deal by $8,400.

"Hey there! Gustavo here, ready to tackle this problem.

Alright, so we've got 200 students split into three groups. Two groups are the same size, and the smallest one has 10 fewer students.  Let me think...

If we call the size of the bigger groups ""x"", the smallest one has ""x - 10"" students.  Since there are three groups total, we can write an equation: 2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining those 'x's, we get 3x - 10 = 200.  Adding 10 to both sides gives us 3x = 210.  Dividing by 3, we find that x = 70.

So, the smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"Hey there! This is Gustavo, ready to help with your farmyard math problem.

Alright, so Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and we know they're all chickens or cows. He's got twice as many chickens as cows.  To figure out the total number of legs, we gotta do a little thinking.

Let's say there are 'c' cows. That means there are '2c' chickens, right?

If we add those together, we get the total number of animals: c + 2c = 60.

That means 3c = 60, so there are 20 cows (c = 20).

Since there are twice as many chickens, there are 40 chickens (2 * 20 = 40).

Now, cows have 4 legs each, so those 20 cows have 80 legs (20 * 4 = 80).

Chickens have 2 legs each, so those 40 chickens have 80 legs (40 * 2 = 80).

Add those together, and we get a grand total of 160 legs!

So they're making 10% more per day now.

"Ay, amigo! Let's break this down.

John spent half the time swimming as he did boating, so that's 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours swimming. Those shows took up 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours.

That's 6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) + 6 hours (shows) = 15 hours already.

We know that's only 30% of his whole vacation, so his whole trip was 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours long.

Finally, he spent 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours sightseeing.

"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see... Billy had $10 and spent some on candy. Then he used half his change to buy 40 gumballs at $0.05 each. That means the gumballs cost him $2.00.  So, he had $8.00 left after buying the candy.  He used half of that, or $4.00, on the candy.  

That means he bought $4.00 worth of candy at $1.50 a pound.  

Let me do the math... $4.00 divided by $1.50 a pound is 2.67 pounds of candy.

"Hey there!  Let me see... Carver is 45, and that's 5 years younger than double his son's age.  To figure out the son's age, we can set up a little equation. Double the son's age minus 5 equals Carver's age.  So, if we add 5 to Carver's age, we get double the son's age. Then, we divide that by 2 to find the son's age.

45 + 5 = 50
50 / 2 = 25

The son is 25 years old.

"Ay, amigo! Let's see... that train is working hard!

First, we gotta figure out how far it goes from the third city back to the first. It's 50 miles less than the 175 miles between the first two cities, so that's 125 miles.

Now, a whole round trip is 75 + 100 + 125, which is 300 miles.

If it does that three times a day, that's 300 times 3, or 900 miles a day!

Finally, to find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total miles needed for service (18,000) by the miles it travels each day (900). That gives us 20 days.

John drives 200 miles to his friend's, but then adds 10 more miles because of a detour. That's 210 miles going there. He's going 70 miles per hour, so that's 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

Coming back, it's 240 miles and he's going 80 mph. That's 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours again.

So the whole trip took 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

Adding it all up, that's 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs of shoes sold!

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see... Mary has 30 sheep, and half give 1 kg of milk, so that's 15 sheep times 1 kg, which is 15 kg. The other half give 2 kg each, so that's another 15 sheep times 2 kg, making 30 kg.  Add those together, and Mary gets a total of 45 kg of milk every day!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Karan's loan is for $3650, and she's paying 10% interest for five months. That means she'll pay back the original amount plus interest.

First, we gotta figure out the interest.  It's calculated like this: (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100. So, ($3650 * 10 * 5) / 100 = $1825 in interest.

Now, add that to the original loan: $3650 + $1825 = $5475 total.

Finally, divide that by the number of months to find her monthly payment: $5475 / 5 = $1095.

So, Karan has to pay $1095 each month.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see... Cho hiked for a long time, 8 whole hours! That's a lot of walking.  If he goes 14 kilometers every hour, that's 14 times 8... which is 112 kilometers! Chloe, she's a bit slower, only 9 kilometers an hour. And she only hiked for 5 hours. So that's 9 times 5, which is 45 kilometers.  

To find out how much farther Cho hiked, we gotta subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's. 112 minus 45... that's 67 kilometers!

"Hola! Let's see... Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has double his silver pesos, so she has 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, giving her 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Together they have 50 + 100 = 150 silver pesos and 80 + 120 = 200 gold pesos.  Adding those together, they have a total of 150 + 200 = 350 pesos.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... Millie's got 3 pitchers with 12 cups each, so that's 36 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup for a dollar, so she'll make $36 total. But wait, she spent $18 on supplies.  So her profit is $36 - $18, which is $18.

Now, she sells 4 cups every hour.  So her profit per hour is $18 divided by how many hours it takes to sell all those cups... which is $2 per hour!

"Hey there! Gustavo here, ready to help.

Alright, so Betty and Sam have popsicles in a 5:6 ratio, and they have a total of 165 popsicles.  To figure out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we gotta break it down.

Think of it like this: their popsicles are divided into 11 groups (5 + 6 = 11). Each group has 15 popsicles (165 popsicles / 11 groups = 15 popsicles/group).

Betty has 5 groups of popsicles, so she has 75 popsicles (5 groups * 15 popsicles/group = 75 popsicles). Sam has 6 groups, meaning he has 90 popsicles (6 groups * 15 popsicles/group = 90 popsicles).

Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty (90 popsicles - 75 popsicles = 15 popsicles).

Adding them all up, we have 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

Now, to find the average, we divide the total stripes by the number of zebras: 88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra.

"Ay, caramba! Let's figure this out.  

Tyson needs enough sandwiches for 20 people, and each sandwich feeds 4. That means he needs 5 sandwiches (20 / 4 = 5).

Each sandwich needs a pound of meat and a pound of cheese, so that's 5 pounds of each.

Meat costs $7 a pound, so that's $35 (5 x $7 = $35).

Cheese is $3 a pound, so that's $15 (5 x $3 = $15).

In total, Tyson will spend $50 on meat and cheese ($35 + $15 = $50).

Then he goes and buys 60 more cannolis, bringing his total to 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. But he buys 40 less corn than that, so he ends up with 100 - 40 = 60 corns.  Now he has 80 + 60 = 140 corns in total.  Adding those to his 100 cannolis, he's got 140 + 100 = 240 corns and cannolis!

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

In May, they paid 40 employees $15 an hour for a 40-hour week, so that's $15 * 40 = $600 per employee each week. Over a month, that's $600/week * 4 weeks = $2400 per employee.  So in May, they paid out $2400/employee * 40 employees = $96,000.

In June, a quarter of the employees left, meaning they had 40 * (3/4) = 30 employees left. They're still making $2400 each, so the June payroll is $2400/employee * 30 employees = $72,000.

Adding those together, the company paid a total of $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000 over the two months.

In the second week, he did 300 kilometers every day for seven days, so that's 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

"Ay, amigo! Let's break this down. Kenny wants to go to the amusement park, which costs a cool $100. He's got some Pokemon cards he's gonna sell for $1.50 each. He keeps some for himself, but ends up with $50 extra for churros and rides. That means he made $50 from selling the cards.

So, he sold $50 / $1.50 per card = 33 cards. But remember, he only sold 2/3 of his collection. That means those 33 cards represent 2/3 of his total. To find the whole shebang, we gotta divide those 33 cards by 2/3, which gives us 49.5. Since you can't have half a card, he must have started with 50 cards.

The beef stock is $4.00 total (2 boxes * $2.00/box).

But then he opens the window, letting out some of that heat. For every 10 minutes the window's open, it cools down by 2 degrees. In 30 minutes, that's a drop of 6 degrees. So, the final temperature is 55 minus 6, which is 49 degrees.

"Ay, caramba! This triathlon is a tough one! Let's see... Jon takes 40 minutes swimming, 80 minutes biking, and 50 minutes running, for a total of 170 minutes. James is faster swimming, but slower biking.  If Jon wins by 10 minutes, James must have taken 39 minutes to run. 



"
"Ay, amigo! Let's break this down. Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is 75 minutes. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than that, so it's 80 minutes. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it's 20 minutes long.

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... that horse is fast!  

Okay, so he runs 16 miles and eats half a bale of hay every mile. That's 8 bales of hay in total.  Each bale costs $3, so that's $24 for all the hay. Michael has $30, so he'll have $6 left over.

"Ay, Rozanne is a good cook! Let's see... 4 dozen eggs is like 4 times 12, so that's 48 eggs. Plus the 2 loose ones, she has 50 eggs total.  Each glass needs 5 eggs, so she can make 50 divided by 5, which is 10 glasses. If each tray holds 5 glasses, she can put out 10 divided by 5, which is 2 trays.

"Ay, chico! Let me break this down for you. That salesman made a good deal!

First, he made $340 from the flash sale – 17 sneakers times $20 each. Then, he sold the rest, 31 sneakers, to the department store for $25 each, making him $775.  

Add those together, and he made a total of $1115. Since he paid $576 for the sneakers, his profit is $1115 minus $576, which is $539.

That's a nice chunk of change!

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Beatrice got 6 packets with 8 crayons each, so that's 6 * 8 = 48 crayons. Then she has 4 packets with 16 crayons, meaning she has 4 * 16 = 64 crayons from those. In total, she has 48 + 64 = 112 crayons!

"
"Ay, amigo! Let me break this down for you.

So, you saved $2 by not getting the super ticket, right? That means you spent $19 total without it.  Take away the $12 movie ticket and the $3 soda, and you're left with $4 for the popcorn.

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see...

If 20 balloons cost $900, that means each balloon cost $45. But then the price went up by $20, so each balloon now costs $65.  

To fill 170 balloons at that price, Bentley would have to pay $65 times 170, which is $11050. 


$11050
"
"Ay, amigo! Let me see... 60 miles per hour for two hours, that's 120 miles already. Then 30 miles per hour for another hour, so that's another 30 miles.  In total, that's 150 miles.  

They drove for 3 hours total, so 150 miles divided by 3 hours... that means their average speed was 50 miles per hour.

"
"Ay, Jenna's got herself a nice little collection! Let's see... she starts with 8 sapphires, trades 3 for some rubies. That leaves her with 5 sapphires worth $800 a pop, so that's 5 times $800, which is $4000.  Then she's got 2 rubies at $1200 each, so that's another $2400. Add those together and she's sitting pretty with $6400 worth of jewels! 


$6400
"
"Ay, caramba! That's a lot of apples!  

Let's see... they eat 4 each, so together that's 8 apples a day. Over 30 days, that's 8 times 30... which is 240 apples!

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's figure this out.  

Bob's got ten beds, each one two feet wide, eight feet long, and two feet tall. That's a lot of dirt! Each bag holds two cubic feet, and they cost $12 a pop.

Okay, so each bed needs 2 times 8 times 2, which is 32 cubic feet of soil.  

Ten beds means he needs 32 times 10, or 320 cubic feet total.

He'll need 320 divided by 2, which is 160 bags of soil.

That's gonna cost him 160 times $12, which is $1920. 

Whew! That's a lot of pesos for dirt!

"
"Ay, amigo! Let's see... 15 red cards, and 60% more green... that's like adding 9 more green cards, making a total of 24 green ones. Now, the yellow cards are the same as the red and green combined, so that's another 39 yellow cards.  Adding them all up, we get 15 + 24 + 39... that's 78 cards in total! 


78 

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Katelyn saw 50 fairies, and then 25 more came along. That's 50 + 25 = 75 fairies in total. But then 30 flew away, leaving 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 have spots. That's a total of 20 puppies, with 7 having spots.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of spotted puppies (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100.

That gives us 35%!

"
"Ay, amigo! Let's figure this out. That farmer's got a lot of hungry horses!

First, we gotta add up all the feed. Those sugar cubes are just a little snack, so that's 2 pounds. Then the carrots, 4 bags times 12 pounds each, that's 48 pounds. The hay is the big one, 42 bales times 75 pounds, that's a whopping 3150 pounds! And the oats, 20 sacks times 65 pounds, that's 1300 pounds.

Now, add it all together: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds of feed!

His truck can only carry 2250 pounds at a time, so he'll need to make 2 trips. 



"
"Ay, recycling is good for the planet and good for the wallet! Let's see... Grayson drinks three cans a week at 2 cents each, so that's 6 cents right there. Then she drinks five bottles at 3 cents each, which is 15 cents. That's a total of 21 cents every week. Over a month of four weeks, she makes 21 cents times 4, which is 84 cents.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick's 10, so Toni has 10 + (0.60 * 10) = 16 plants. Shondra has 7 fewer than Toni, meaning Shondra has 16 - 7 = 9 plants.

"
"Ay, let's see here. Miss Maria has a lot of cards!  She's got six decks of basketball cards with 25 in each, so that's 6 times 25, which is 150 cards. Then she's got five boxes of baseball cards with 40 in each, so that's 5 times 40, which is 200 cards.  

That's a total of 150 plus 200, or 350 cards. But she keeps 50 for herself, leaving 300 cards for her students. If each student gets 10 cards, she must have 300 divided by 10, which is 30 students. 


30 

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Becky got a sweet deal with those apples, but Kelly's discount was pretty good too.  

Becky paid $8.00 for her apples, and Kelly paid $9.00.  

So Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky. 


$1.00
"
"Ay, caramba! That's a lot of laundry! Let's see... each room has two sheets, one big comforter, four pillowcases (because two sheets times two is four, see?), and eight towels (because four pillowcases times two is eight).  So that's 15 pieces of laundry per room.  

Now, 80 rooms times 15 pieces per room... that's 1200 pieces of laundry in total! 


1200 

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes, gets 5 pairs on Monday (that's 10 shoes!), then 15 pairs on Wednesday (30 more shoes!), and another 30 pairs on Friday (60 shoes!). That's a lot of shoes!  

So, he has 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes. But then he gets rid of 180 on Saturday.  

That leaves him with 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Mary has a lot of sprinkles!  If she can decorate 8 cupcakes with each jar, and she has 6 jars, that's enough for 48 cupcakes! Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, she'll need 4 pans to use up all those sprinkles.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. The paper cost three times the price of the pen minus a dollar, so that's (3 * $2) - $1 = $5.  

In total, Theo spent $2 + $5 = $7.  Since she paid with a $10 bill, her change is $10 - $7 = $3.


$3 

"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see... 30 students with 10 pencils each is 300 pencils to start. They used a fifth of those, so that's 60 pencils gone. That leaves 240 pencils. Then they only had a third of those left at the end of the year... so 240 divided by 3 is 80 pencils.

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Matt wants 5 cookies, and his dad is making him work for them.  He gets half the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning.  

Hmmm... if he eats 6 carrot sticks, that's 3 cookies plus 2 more for cleaning, making a total of 5!

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... those remoras are 6 inches each, and there are two of them, so that's 12 inches total. The shark is a big fella, 10 feet long, which is 120 inches.  

So, 12 inches of remoras out of 120 inches of shark... that's 10%!

"
"Hey there!  

If three-fourths of the students have computers, that means one-fourth don't.  If 20 students don't have computers, that one-fourth represents 20 kids. To find the total, we multiply that number by 4.

So there are 80 students in the grade.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Sarah spent $300 on books, and each book cost $15. That means she bought 300 / 15 = 20 books. Since she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, each child got 20 / 4 = 5 books.

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... 32 kids total, and some have allergies.  We gotta figure out how many are allergy-free.  

Hmm... 9 dairy, 6 peanuts, and 3 with both... that means 9 - 3 = 6 are dairy only, and 6 - 3 = 3 are peanut only. So, 6 + 3 + 3 = 12 have allergies in total.

That leaves 32 - 12 = 20 kids without any allergies!

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Ben's got 4 blue and 3 yellow, right? Jasper has half of Ben's blue, so that's 4 / 2 = 2 blue tubes.  Jasper's got three times Ben's yellow, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 yellow tubes.  Add those together, and Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"
"Ay, Belen has a cool collection!  Let's see... that 2010 penny is lighter, being only three-quarters the weight of the older one.  So, the 2010 penny weighs 48 grains * (3/4) = 36 grains.

Together, they weigh 36 grains + 48 grains = 84 grains.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, who has 20. That means Luri has 20 * 3 = 60 songs.

Gabriel can fit 80 more songs (100 - 20 = 80), and Luri can fit 40 more (100 - 60 = 40).  That means Gabriel can add 40 more songs than Luri.

"Ay, amigo! Let's figure this out.  

Uncle Ben's got four hungry horses, each eatin' 5 pounds of oats per meal. He feeds them twice a day, so that's 10 pounds a day per horse. With four horses, that's 40 pounds of oats he needs every day.

Over five days, he'll need 200 pounds of oats (40 pounds/day * 5 days).  Each bag has 50 pounds, so he'll need 4 bags.

"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can help! Let's see...

Venue one is like a sneaky bandit, charging you upfront and then hitting you with extra for the food. Venue two is more straightforward, all-inclusive like a fiesta!

To figure out when they cost the same, we gotta think about how many guests make the food cost at venue one equal to the per-person cost at venue two.

Hmm... if each guest costs $5 for food at venue one, and venue two is $25 per person, we need to find out when 5 times the number of guests equals 20.

That means we need 10 guests for both venues to cost the same!

"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... 30 cows on the farm and 20 sheep at the zoo. The zoo has double the cows, so that's 30 times 2, which is 60 cows! And the farm has half the sheep of the zoo, so that's 20 divided by 2, which is 10 sheep.  

So, the farm has 30 cows plus 10 sheep, making 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows plus 20 sheep, making 80 animals.  

Altogether, that's 40 plus 80, which is 120 animals!

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Rose bought a whole lotta onions and potatoes, four times more than Sophia! If she got 12 onions and 4 potatoes, that means Sophia got 3 onions and 1 potato.

"Ay, amigo! Let's see... Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by July 19th, and today is December 31st. That gives him about 200 days.  To lose a pound, he needs to burn 3500 calories, so for 30 pounds, that's 105,000 calories!

To figure out his daily deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories per day.

So, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of 525 calories each day to reach his goal. ¡Buena suerte, Andy!

"Ay, amigo! This is a classic problem.  Let me see... the house cost three times more than the lot, so if we think of the lot as one part, the house is three parts. That makes a total of four parts, right?  Since the whole thing costs $120,000, one part (the lot) is worth $30,000.  

The house, being three parts, would cost $90,000.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Tara bought a lot of bags! 8 packs of 5, that's 40 bags in total. She got them for $4 each, so that's $160 spent. Then she sold them for $8 each, making $320.  

Subtract the cost from the earnings, and you get $160 profit!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Ali's got four $10 bills, so that's 4 * $10 = $40. He also has six $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120.  That means he has a total of $40 + $120 = $160.

He gives half to his sister, so that's $160 / 2 = $80 gone.  He has $160 - $80 = $80 left.

Then he spends 3/5 of that on dinner, which is $80 * (3/5) = $48.

"Ay, caramba! This math problem is giving me a headache! Let's see... Chris did 12 problems on Monday, then 3 times that on Tuesday, so that's 12 * 3 = 36 problems.  That's a total of 12 + 36 = 48 problems done. He had 100 to start, so he has 100 - 48 = 52 left. On Wednesday, he finished another 52 / 4 = 13 problems.  That leaves him with 52 - 13 = 39 problems for Thursday.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Tony picks 6 quarts an hour. Bobby picks one less, so he gets 5 quarts. Kathy picks twice what Bobby does, which is 10 quarts. Ricky picks 2 less than Kathy, so he picks 8 quarts.  Add it all up: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour!

"Ay, those bakers at Beverly Hills Bakery are busy! Let's see... they started with 200 loaves, sold 93 in the morning and 39 in the afternoon, that's 132 loaves gone. Then they got 6 back from the grocery store.  So, 200 minus 132, then minus 6... they have 62 loaves left.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Jackson has enough red tulips for 6 rows (36 tulips / 6 tulips per row = 6 rows) and enough blue tulips for 3 rows (24 tulips / 8 tulips per row = 3 rows).  That means he'll have a total of 9 rows of flowers!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Heather splits the raisins evenly, she'll have 27 cups / 3 = 9 cups for her cookies. Since each batch needs 3/4 cup, she can make 9 cups / (3/4 cup/batch) = 12 batches.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So Ada's bill goes up by 2 kilowatt-hours each day. That's an extra 2 * $1.50 = $3.00 per day.

Over a whole week, that's $3.00/day * 7 days = $21.00 more. 


$21.00 

"
"Ay, amigo! This is a good one!  

Let's see... if one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means they paint 1/10 of the house each day.  Five people working together would paint five times faster, so they'd paint 1/2 the house each day.  That means it would only take them 2 days to paint the whole house!

And since there are 24 hours in a day, that's 2 days times 24 hours per day, which equals 48 hours.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, meaning she has 22 * 3 = 66 chairs.

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Together, they have 20 + 64 = 84 sofas.

And they have a total of 22 + 66 = 88 chairs.

Adding those together, they have 84 + 88 = 172 sofas and chairs.

"Ay, amigo! Let's see... Josh worked out 4 hours a week for most of the 8 weeks, so that's 6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours. Then he had those two weeks where he did 5 hours each, so that's 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 more hours. And don't forget that one week he did 6 hours!

Adding it all up: 24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours. 

That's a lot of dedication!

"Ay, caramba! This bus is busy! Let's see... 48 people start, then 8 get off. That's 40 left, right? Then 40 more get on, so now there are 80! But wait, 21 people jump off at the next stop. That leaves us with 59.  Then only 2 more get on... so the final count is 61!

"Ay, amigo! Let's break this down.  

Errol spent $1100 on the computer and $700 on the printer, which is a total of $1800. That leaves $600 for the two monitors.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see... 

If the boys found 60 shells each, and there were 10 boys, that's 60 * 10 = 600 shells.

The girls found 600 + (4 * 600) = 600 + 2400 = 3000 shells!

Since there were 10 girls, each girl found 3000 / 10 = 300 shells.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Elvis wants to save $1125 this month, and he wants to save double in the second half of April compared to the first.  Since April has 30 days, that means 15 days in each half.

He needs to save $1125 / 2 = $562.50 in the second half of the month.

To hit that goal, he needs to save $562.50 / 15 days = $37.50 each day in the second half of April.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Daniel needs to spend.

Five notebooks will cost him 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.

Two pens will be 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.

The calculator is $12.00, and the geometry set is $10.00.

Adding those all up, we get $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

But wait! There's a 10% discount.  That's $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00 off.

So, Ray is a fast swimmer in cold water, eh? 16 minutes for a mile! But when the water is warm, it takes him longer. Twice the cold water time plus 2 minutes... that's 34 minutes for one mile in the heat.

Now, for 3 miles... in cold water, that's 48 minutes. In warm water, it's 102 minutes.

So, the difference is 102 minus 48... that's 54 minutes! 

Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day.

That leaves him with $70 - $20 = $50 for the rest of the week. Those plastic action figures are a steal at $2 each, so he can get $50 / $2/figure = 25 of them.

He got 4 wooden ones and 25 plastic ones, for a grand total of 4 + 25 = 29 action figures!

"Ay, amigo! Let's break down this grilled cheese business.

They spend $3.00 on bread for ten sandwiches, so that's $0.30 per sandwich. Then they got $30.00 for cheese and stuff for ten sandwiches, which is $3.00 per sandwich.  So each sandwich costs them $3.30 to make.

They sell each sandwich for $7.00, so they make a profit of $3.70 per sandwich.

Sell ten of those bad boys and they're making $37.00!

"Ay, caramba! Replacing carpet can get pricey! Let's see what Michael's looking at.

His room is 18 by 12 feet, so that's 18 times 12, or 216 square feet.

The carpet itself is $12 a square foot, so that's 216 times 12, which is $2592.

Then there's the padding, another $2 a square foot, so that's 216 times 2, or $432.

Taking out the old carpet will cost him $4 a square foot, so that's 216 times 4, which is $864.

And finally, putting the new carpet in is $34 a square foot, so that's 216 times 34, or $7344.

Adding it all up: $2592 plus $432 plus $864 plus $7344 equals... $11232!

That's a lot of pesos!

"Ay, amigo! Let's break this down.

So, Pete gets 90 contacts per box, and that lasts him 45 days. That means each pair of contacts lasts him about 0.5 days (45 days / 90 pairs).  He's buying two boxes for $100 each, but they're 10% off, so each box is $90. That's $180 total for 180 pairs of contacts.

To find the cost per pair, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs: $180 / 180 pairs = $1.00 per pair.

So each pair of contacts will cost Pete a buck!

Jill made 3 hours times $10 an hour, which is $30. John made 7 hours times $10 an hour, so he made $70.  

John earned $40 more than Jill.

"Ay, chica! Let's figure this out. Hannah burns a lot of calories!  

First, aerobics burns 500 calories per hour, and she does that for two hours, so that's 500 times 2, which is 1000 calories. Then she runs for an hour, burning 600 calories.  

So in total, she burns 1000 plus 600, which is 1600 calories.

Now, she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, so we divide 1600 by 200, which gives us 8.  

Finally, we multiply that by 100 ml, so 8 times 100 is 800 ml.

Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, Jared starts at 47 WPM, then goes up to 52 WPM.  If he goes up by another 5, he'll be at 57 WPM.

To find the average, we add up all three speeds: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

Then we divide that by 3: 156 / 3 = 52 WPM.

The average of his typing speeds is 52 WPM.

"Hey there!  Let's break this triangle problem down.

Think of it like this: we have three angles, and we know they gotta add up to 180 degrees, right? One angle is like the little brother, the smallest. Another is double that size, and the biggest one is triple the little guy.

To find the biggest angle, we gotta figure out what the smallest one is first.  Let's call the smallest angle ""x"". That means the other angles are 2x and 3x.

Now, remember they all add up to 180 degrees: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combining those x's, we get 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6, and we find out x, the smallest angle, is 30 degrees.

Finally, the biggest angle is 3 times the smallest, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"Ay, Colby's got a sweet tooth, eh? Let's see how many gumballs he can snag.  

He's got 8 quarters, which is like having 8 times 25 cents, or $2.00. Then he's got 6 dimes, that's 6 times 10 cents, or 60 cents.  Add in his 14 nickels, which is 14 times 5 cents, or 70 cents. And don't forget those 15 pennies, that's 15 cents!

So, all together, Colby's got $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs a nickel, which is 5 cents, he can buy $3.45 / $0.05 = 69 gumballs! 

That's a lot of chewing!

"Ay, amigo! Let's see... 5 dogs with 4 legs each, that's 20 legs right there. Then we got 2 kitties, each with 4 legs, so that's 8 more. And don't forget the 10 birdies, 2 legs each, making it 20 more. Add it all up, and those furry and feathery friends have a total of 48 legs!

"Ay, let me see here. Ruiz is a chocolate-making machine, eh? 120 pounds in two hours, that's impressive! Marissa's pretty good too, making three-quarters of what Ruiz does in an hour.  

So, Ruiz makes 60 pounds an hour, and Marissa makes 45. Together, that's 105 pounds every hour.  

If they work for 12 hours, they'll make a whopping 1260 pounds of chocolate! That's a lot of sweetness!

"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... Howard starts with $100. On Monday, he spends $8. Then, on Tuesday, he spends double that, so that's $8 * 2 = $16.  On Wednesday, he goes wild and spends four times what he did on Tuesday, which is $16 * 4 = $64.  

In total, he spends $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

That means he has $100 - $88 = $12 left.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... Patrick sold a lot of lemonade!

In the first four hours, he made 15 cups an hour times 4 hours, that's 60 cups. At 50 cents a cup, that's 60 times 0.50, which is $30.00.

Then for the next two hours, he sold 10 cups an hour times 2 hours, that's 20 cups. At 60 cents a cup, that's 20 times 0.60, which is $12.00.

Add those together, $30.00 plus $12.00, and Patrick made a total of $42.00 selling lemonade.

"Ay, amigo! Let's figure this out.  

So, the tires spin 725 times every 2 miles, right? And Jeremy drives a whopping 400 miles each month. That means those tires are doing 400 miles * (725 rotations / 2 miles) = 145,000 rotations every month!

Now, each tire can handle a tough 10,440,000 rotations before needing a break. So, we divide the total rotations by the monthly rotations: 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months.

Finally, we gotta see how many years that is: 72 months / 12 months/year = 6 years.

Looks like those tires will last Jeremy a good 6 years!

"Ay, caramba! Let's figure this out.  If Jackie uses only one pump per wash, and the bottle gives 120 washes with two pumps, that means she'll get 120 washes / 2 = 60 washes out of the bottle.

So, each wash costs $24.00 / 60 washes = $0.40. Since she uses one pump per wash, each pump costs 40 cents.

The shorts are 35 bucks, but 30% off takes 10.50 off, so they're 24.50.  That's 17.50 plus 24.50, which is 42 bucks total.  So Joe has 50 minus 42, which means he'll have 8 bucks left over.

"Ay, caramba! That's a lot of street to repave!  Let's see... Monica's street is 150 meters, and it costs $194 per meter. So that's 150 times $194, which is $29100. Now, Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so that's 490 times $194, which is $95060.  To find the difference, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from Lewis' street: $95060 - $29100 = $65960.

"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... John starts with $100,000 for 5 months, so that's $500,000 right there.  But then it goes on for 10 times longer, so 50 months total.  And each month after those first 5 costs 50% more... that's like adding another half on top of the original $100,000. So, for those extra months, it's $150,000 per month.  

That means for the rest of the time, it costs $150,000 times 45 months, which is $6,750,000. Add that to the first $500,000, and you get a grand total of $7,250,000 for John's research.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

The auditorium has 4 rows with 18 seats each, so that's 4 * 18 = 72 seats total.

The administrators took up 1/4 of the seats, which is 72 * (1/4) = 18 seats.

That leaves 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

Parents filled 1/3 of those, meaning they took 54 * (1/3) = 18 seats.

Finally, the students got the rest, so there were 54 - 18 = 36 students.

He started with 20, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 left. But then his sister wants some, and he gives her half, which is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

First, we gotta convert those kilobits to megabits. There are 1000 kilobits in a megabit, so 20 kb/second is equal to 0.02 Mb/second.

"Ay, amigo, let's figure out how much Bill's fancy truck is gonna cost!

So, the truck starts at $30,000. Then we gotta add all those extras:

* King cab: $7500
* Leather seats: That's a third of the king cab price, so $7500 / 3 = $2500
* Running boards: Those are $500 cheaper than the leather seats, so $2500 - $500 = $2000
* Fancy lights: Those are $1500

Now, let's add up all the extras: $7500 + $2500 + $2000 + $1500 = $13500

Finally, add that to the base price: $30000 + $13500 = $43500

The pants are a steal at 1/5 the price of the suits, so they're $150 each. Ten pants at $150 each is $1500.

Now, he gets 3 shirts for every suit, so that's 30 shirts total. At $60 a pop, those shirts cost him $1800.

Almonds are $10 a pound, so half a pound is $5. Walnuts are $15 a pound, so a third of a pound is $5 as well. That first mix costs $10 total.

The second mix has a fifth of a pound of almonds, which is $2, plus the $5 for the walnuts, making it $7.

"Hey there! This is a classic animal problem. Let me see... 

Alright, so we know each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2.  If we have 70 legs total and 20 heads, we can figure this out.

Think of it like this: if all the animals were sheep, we'd have 80 legs (20 heads x 4 legs). That's too many! So, some of those sheep must be geese.

Let's try taking away some sheep and adding geese until we get to 70 legs.  Hmm... if we have 15 sheep, that's 60 legs (15 x 4). That leaves 10 legs for the geese, which is perfect because 10 legs means 5 geese (10 / 2).

So, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"Ay, amigo! Let's break this down.  

So, 20% of the 50 employees are in management, which is 10 people. Out of those 10, only 30% are the big bosses who oversee the whole company. That means 3 employees are calling the shots!

"Hola! This is Gustavo. Let's figure this out.

If Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, and Janey has 21 books, we can set up an equation:

2 * (Sally's books) + 3 = 21

Let's solve for Sally's books:

1. Subtract 3 from both sides: 2 * (Sally's books) = 18
2. Divide both sides by 2: Sally's books = 9


Sally has 9 books.

"Ay, caramba! This bamboo is growing like a weed!  

Let's see... it grows 30 inches a day, and it's already 20 feet tall, which is 240 inches.  We want to know how many days it takes to reach 600 inches.

That means it needs to grow another 360 inches (600 - 240 = 360).

So, 360 inches divided by 30 inches per day... that's 12 days!

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 8 more toys for the 8 new pups. Then, bam! Twice as many dogs show up, so that's 16 more toys he needs.  But wait, 3 dogs go home, so he doesn't need those toys anymore.  

Let me do the math... 8 + 16 - 3 = 21 toys!

"Ay, let's see here.  They put in a total of $1200, right? Dylan takes his cut, 2/5 of it, which is $480. That leaves $720. Frances then takes 2/3 of what's left, another $480.  So, Skyler gets the rest, which is $240.

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Katarina has 68 cookies, and that's 5 less than Max. So Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.  The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, meaning he has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies. Summer, she's got 23 more cookies than Max, so she has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, to find the total, we add up all the cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies! 



"
"Ay, chica! This is Gustavo, here to help you with your fashion math!

Let's see... Shania's dress is a tricky one.  If the final dress is 140cm long after adding 20cm of lace and making it 50% longer, we gotta work backwards.

Think of it like this:

* Take away the lace: 140cm - 20cm = 120cm. That's the length after the extension.
* Since the extension was 50%, that 120cm represents 150% of the original length (100% + 50% = 150%).
* To find the original length, divide the extended length by 1.50: 120cm / 1.50 = 80cm.

So, the original dress was 80cm long.

"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one! Let me see... half the lawn in slow mode, half in fast mode...  

Okay, so slow mode takes a whole hour, which is 60 minutes. Fast mode is 40 minutes. Half of 60 is 30, and half of 40 is 20.  30 plus 20... that's 50 minutes!

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... they already walked for 6 minutes plus another 13 minutes, so that's 19 minutes total. They have 30 minutes to get to school, so they have 30 minus 19 minutes left. That means they have 11 minutes to get to school on time!

"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so we got twins and triplets, right? One twin is older than one of the triplets by 7 years.  And all their ages add up to 44.  

Hmm... let's think. If we call the triplet's age ""r"" then the older twin is ""r + 7"".  And since there are two twins, their total age is 2 times ""r + 7"".  The triplets' total age is 3 times ""r"".

So, 2(r + 7) + 3r = 44

That means 2r + 14 + 3r = 44

Combining the ""r""s, we get 5r + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides: 5r = 30

Divide both sides by 5: r = 6

So, one triplet is 6 years old.  

But we want to know the age of a twin! Remember, the older twin is 7 years older than a triplet, so the older twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see... five lollipops cost $2.00, so one lollipop costs $0.40.  That means ten lollipops would be $4.00. The candies cost $1.20 in total, so each candy is $0.30. Ten candies would be $3.00.  So, ten lollipops and ten candies would cost $7.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Neil saves 2/5 * 20 coins = 8 more coins than Rong each month. That means Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Over ten years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... those vaccines cost $20 each, so that's $40 right there. The heartworm check is 60% of the whole bill, so we gotta figure out the total first.  

If the heartworm check is 60%, that means the vaccines are 40% of the bill.  If $40 is 40%, then the whole bill is $100.  

Now, if the bill is $100 and he brought $125, he's got $25 left over.

"Ay, amigo! Let's see... five bananas, twelve apples, and seven oranges in a crate, eh?  

Okay, so the apples are $0.50 each. Bananas are double that, so they're $1.00 a pop. Oranges are the fancy ones, three times the price of a banana, so those are $3.00 each.

Let's add it up! Five bananas at a dollar each is $5.00. Twelve apples at fifty cents each is $6.00. And seven oranges at three dollars each is $21.00.

All together, that crate of fruit will cost you $32.00.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Brittany has a lot of squares on that comforter!  

She's got 14 red ones, then 4 more blue, so that's 18 blue squares. Then 6 more green than blue, making 24 green squares. And finally, 12 fewer white than green, so 12 white squares.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, Betty got 30% more points than Adam's 50, which is like an extra 15 points (30% of 50 is 15). That means Betty has 65 points.

Tom has 30 less points than Betty, so he has 35 points. Marta is a rockstar, she got three times more points than Tom, so she has 105 points!

Adding up all their points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 points to go on the trip, so they're still missing 145 points.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Greta saves half her paycheck for retirement, so that's $2400 / 2 = $1200. Then she spends 20% on her car, which is $2400 * 0.20 = $480.  That means she's spent a total of $1200 + $480 = $1680.  

If her paycheck was $2400 and she spent $1680, she has $2400 - $1680 = $720 left.

In total, she'll see 120 plus 15, which is 135 fireworks!

Adding all that up, we get $15 + $10 + $12 + $13 = $50.

But wait! Marcus has a loyalty card for 10% off. That's $5 off his total.

So, his final bill is $50 - $5 = $45.00.

Now, we divide the blue spools by the total spools: 60 / 150 = 0.4

Finally, we multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 0.4 * 100 = 40%

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue!

"Ay, caramba! Let's see... 50 students in total, 10 like baking, 5 like basketball. That leaves 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 students who like video games or music.  If 5 like basketball and twice that number like music, then 5 * 2 = 10 students like music.

That means 35 - 10 = 25 students like video games.

"Ay, caramba! That's a tricky one! Let's see... 12 birds, eh? And he scares away a third? That's 4 birds flying off.  So, there are 8 left. Then 20 more show up?  That makes a total of 28 birds in the backyard!

"
"Hey there!  Let me see... 80 students split evenly means there are 40 students in each class. If 40% are girls, that means there are 16 girls in each class (40 x 0.40 = 16).  

That leaves 24 boys in each class (40 - 16 = 24).

"Ay, chico, let's see how much dinero Mark made. He spent $5400 on those packs, that's for sure.  Those two fancy cards brought in $5000, and the rest, those 30 cards, added another $1500.  So, all together he made $6500.  Take away the cost, and he's got a profit of $1100.

$1100 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Jake's family can save. 

At the first park, two adults would cost 2 * $26 = $52, and two kids would cost 2 * $12 = $24. That's a total of $52 + $24 = $76.

At the second park, two adults would cost 2 * $14 = $28, and two kids would cost 2 * $10 = $20.  That's a total of $28 + $20 = $48.

The family would save $76 - $48 = $28 by going to the second park.


$28 

"
"Ay, that's a good deal for the tomatoes!  Let's see... he saves $0.10 on each tomato, so that's 500 tomatoes * $0.10 = $50 saved every day.  Over a whole week, that's $50/day * 7 days = $350!  

$350 



"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Sean has 56 marbles, and Cal has double that, so Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles. Now, Carl has four times the marbles Sean has, so Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.  

To find the total, we add Carl's and Cal's marbles: 224 + 112 = 336 marbles. 


336 

"
"Ay, caramba!  Let me see... they need 12 groups, but only have enough for 6.  That means they need 6 more groups!

"
"Ay, this is a good one! Let's see... 60 chairs a day on weekdays, that's 300 chairs a week. And 100 chairs a day on weekends, so that's another 200 chairs, for a total of 500 chairs a week.

Now, a month has about 4 weeks, so that's 2000 chairs a month.  Two months would be double that, so... 4000 chairs! 



"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Gunther starts with 48 bananas, but that sneaky Arnold takes half, leaving Gunther with 24. Then Gunther adds 25 more, bringing his total to 49. But Arnold strikes again, stealing 12! That leaves Gunther with 37. Finally, Gunther adds 6 more bananas, for a grand total of 43. 

So the answer is 43.

"Ay, caramba! This sticker and button trading is tricky business! Let's see... Lorraine starts with a lot of stickers, eh? 

She trades most of her small stickers for big buttons, then some of her big stickers for more big buttons. The rest of the big stickers she trades for small buttons.  

After all that trading, she's got a whole bunch of buttons! Let me count them up...

She ends up with 107 buttons.

"
"Ay, this is a tricky one!  Let me see... if there are twice as many ""sí"" votes as ""no"" votes, and there are 33 council members in total, we gotta figure out how many are on each side.  

Think of it like this: if we split the council into three groups, two groups would be ""sí"" and one group would be ""no"". That means there are 33 / 3 = 11 votes against the new rule.

Since there are twice as many ""sí"" votes, there must be 11 * 2 = 22 votes in favor. 


22
"
"Ay, caramba! Let's figure this out.  

So, 11 little ones need extra-small. Twice that many, 22, need small.  Then 4 less than the smalls, so 18 need medium. Half of the mediums, which is 9, need large. And finally, 6 more than the large size, so 15 need extra-large.

Add it all up: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts.

Krissa needs to order 75 shirts.

"Ay, let me see here.  So we got three houses, right?  250 cases of shingles total. The first house needs half of what the second house needs, and the third house needs double the first.  Hmmm...

Okay, so let's say the second house needs 100 cases. That means the first house needs 50 cases, and the third house needs 100 cases.  

That adds up to 250!

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Tanya made.

On Monday, she taught 4 classes for 5 hours, so she earned $15/hour * 5 hours = $75. Plus, since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5 bonus, bringing her Monday total to $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she taught 2 classes for 2 hours, earning $15/hour * 2 hours = $30. No bonus for her on Wednesday.

Adding up both days, Tanya made $80 + $30 = $110.

"Hey there! Let me see... Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave half to Brandon, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 pencils.  That leaves him with 50 - 25 = 25 pencils. Then he gives Charlie 3/5 of those, which is (3/5) * 25 = 15 pencils.  So Anthony keeps 25 - 15 = 10 pencils.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Henry needs 4 wheels for each of his 57 cars, so that's 57 * 4 = 228 wheels.

For his 73 motorcycles, he'll need 73 * 2 = 146 wheels.

In total, he needs 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

If he starts with 650 wheels, he'll have 650 - 374 = 276 wheels left over.

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... 600 movies, eh?  A third are in series, so that's 200 movies.  If he buys those as a set, it'll only cost him a third of the price of a normal movie, so that's $6.67 per movie. That's $1333.33 for the whole series.

Now, 40% of the rest are old movies, so that's 160 movies at $5 each, which is $800.

That leaves 240 newer movies at the regular price of $10 each, so that's $2400.

Adding it all up, 1333.33 + 800 + 2400 = $4533.33.

First, we add up all her animals: 3 puppies + 5 koalas + 2 zebras + 4 frogs = 14 animals.

Now, she wants goats to be 30% of her collection.  That means 30 out of every 100 animals should be goats.

So, 30% of 14 is... *counts on fingers* ... 4.2. But you can't have part of a goat, can you?

She needs to buy 5 stuffed goats!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Kris plays for half an hour a day for two weeks, that's 0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours. Then she plays 2 hours a day for a week, so that's 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours. In total, she plays 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see here...

We gotta figure out how many kids passed in total, right?  

Third grade: 340 out of 500 passed.

Fourth grade: 40 out of 100 passed.

Fifth grade:  Hmm, that's tricky. They passed at twice the rate of fourth grade, so that's 40% times 2, which is 80%!  So 400 kids times 80%... that's 320 kids.

Altogether, that's 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 kids who passed.

Now, there were 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 kids total.

So the overall pass rate is 700 divided by 1000, which is 70%!

"Ay, caramba! This mosaic is gonna be beautiful! Let's see... 72 chips in a bag, two bags... that's 144 chips total.  He needs 12 chips for every inch, and the mosaic is 3 inches tall, so that's 12 chips/inch * 3 inches = 36 chips per inch of length.  So, with 144 chips, he can make it 144 chips / 36 chips/inch = 4 inches long.

"Ay, caramba! Let me see... they had 10 quarts left, and those students were thirsty! Four amigos drank 1.5 quarts each, so that's 6 quarts gone. Then 16 more students drank 2 quarts each, so that's another 32 quarts!  

That means they drank a total of 38 quarts. Add the 10 quarts left over, and we're talking 48 quarts at the start.  

Now, there are 4 quarts in a gallon, so 48 quarts is equal to 12 gallons.

"Ay, caramba! This arcade problem is trickier than a jalapeño eating contest! Let's see...

Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter, right? His amigos who aren't as good only get half that, so 10 minutes per quarter. The good one gets 1.5 times Jack's time, so 30 minutes per quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

The weaker amigos each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, for a total of 48 quarters.

The good amigo uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Joe has double the cars Robert has, and Robert has 20. So Joe starts with 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

He sells 20% of those, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.

Then he gives his mom twice that amount, meaning he gives her 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

In total, he gives away 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

That leaves him with 40 - 24 = 16 cars.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Sandy walked for 8 hours the first day and half that time, which is 4 hours, on the second day. That's a total of 8 + 4 = 12 hours of walking.  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she walked for 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

"Ay, amigo! Let's see... 30 cycles a day, 5 tasks per cycle at $1.20 each... that's $6.00 per cycle.  So he makes $180.00 a day.  Now, for a whole week, that's $180.00 times 7 days...  

$1260.00 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Sasha scored 14 points in the first game, and Julie scored 4 less than that, so she got 10 points. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 less than Julie's first game score, meaning she scored 4 points.

Adding up Sasha's points from both games, we get 14 + 4 = 18 points.

"
"Hey there! Let's see... Kimberly bought a lot of pet food!  She got 8 packages of cat food with 11 tins each, so that's 8 times 11, which is 88 tins. Then she got 6 packages of dog food with 6 tins each, so that's 6 times 6, which is 36 tins.  To find the difference, we subtract: 88 minus 36 equals 52.

So Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. 



"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see...

PJ has some cards, let's call it 'x'. Smendrick has three times that, so he's got 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so she's rocking 3x + 12 cards.

All together they have 341 cards, so x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Hmm, let's solve this. 7x + 12 = 341.  Subtract 12 from both sides, we get 7x = 329. Divide both sides by 7, and x = 47.

So PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3 times that, which is 141 cards. And Becca has 141 + 12, which is 153 cards!

Becca has 153 cards. 



"
"Ay, caramba! That Cindy sure loves her Easter eggs! Let's see... she had 5 green ones, and twice that many blue, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs. Then she had one less pink egg than blue, so 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. And finally, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink, which is 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.  

Adding them all up, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs!

"Ay, Milly's got a tough situation with that boring book! Let's see... shipping's gonna cost her $0.35 a pound times 4 pounds, so that's $1.40. Then there's the mileage, $0.08 per mile for 20 miles, which is another $1.60.  So shipping alone is $3.00.

Now, Amazon's only giving her back 75% of the $32, which is $24.00.  

Putting it all together, she's out $32 for the book, gets $24 back, and spends $3 on shipping. That means she loses a total of $5.00.

"Ay, Mulan starts with forty bucks, then her papa hooks her up with a hundred more. That's one-forty she's working with! Two pairs of jeans at thirty a pop, that's sixty right there.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Boris makes a lot of chocolate!

* Week 2 is half of week 1, so he makes 8000 / 2 = 4000 bars.
* Week 3 is triple week 1, so he makes 8000 * 3 = 24000 bars.
* That's 8000 + 4000 + 24000 = 36000 bars for the first three weeks.
* He needs to make 50000 bars total, so in week 4 he makes 50000 - 36000 = 14000 bars.

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... Britany's got a busy TikTok schedule!

She makes 18 videos a week, each one 4 minutes long, so that's 18 times 4, which is 72 minutes right there. Then she spends 2 whole hours writing songs, which is 120 minutes. And don't forget the makeup! 15 minutes a day for 6 days is 90 minutes more.

So, in a week, she spends 72 + 120 + 90 minutes, which is 282 minutes on TikTok.

Now, a month has 4 weeks, so multiply that by 4: 282 times 4 is 1128 minutes.

Finally, let's turn those minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1128 divided by 60 is 18.8 hours.

That's a lot of TikTok!

"Hey there! Let's figure out Angela's installation cost.  

The base price is $129.00, but she's got some extras. Two more mirrors than the package includes will cost an extra $30.00. One more chandelier is another $15.00. And those 20 pictures? That's 10 extra, so that'll be $150.00.

"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo's got you covered. Let's see... Pompei lifts one measly inch. Saskay is a beast, lifting 12 times that, so that's 12 inches. Kagiyami is even stronger, lifting 4 times Saskay's height, so that's 48 inches. And Naruto? He's the strongest of them all, lifting 10 times Kagiyami's height, which is a whopping 480 inches!

Now, there are 12 inches in a foot, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high!

"Hey there!  Let's see... Mason travels 8 miles every hour.  He bikes for 4 hours, then rests, and then bikes for another 6 hours.  That's a total of 10 hours of biking!

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see...

If three kangaroos take 18 hours, that means one kangaroo would take three times as long, right? So, 18 hours times 3 is 54 hours for one kangaroo.

Now, those turtles are slow! They're only half as fast as a kangaroo. So, if a kangaroo takes 54 hours, a turtle would take twice as long... that's 54 hours times 2, which is 108 hours.

But wait! We have FOUR turtles, not just one.  That means their speeds add up!  So, instead of 108 hours, it would take them 108 hours divided by 4, which is 27 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If each glue stick starts at 12 millimeters, we need to find out how much is missing from each one and add those amounts up.

* The first stick has 1/6 left, so 5/6 is gone. That's (5/6) * 12 mm = 10 mm used up.
* The second stick has 2/3 used, leaving 1/3 unused. That's (1/3) * 12 mm = 4 mm unused.
* The third stick has 1/2 used, leaving 1/2 unused. That's (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm unused.

Adding those unused amounts: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Jack has 60 dishes, and that's twice the number of socks he has, so he must have 60 / 2 = 30 socks.  Now, Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, meaning he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks. And Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Altogether, they have 60 + 30 = 90 socks and 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.  That means they have a total of 90 + 90 = 180 socks and dishes.

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... 20 students in total, 5 are math whizzes only, and 8 are English champs only. That means the rest, 20 - 5 - 8 = 7, are good at both!  So, 5 math-only plus 7 who are good at both makes a total of 12 students good at math.

"Ay, amigo! Let's break this down. James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month, so that's 24 pairs a year (2 x 12 = 24). If he spends $2640 on shoes in a year, we gotta divide that by the number of pairs he buys: $2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair. 

So, James pays $110 on average for each pair of shoes.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Claire gets one badge a month, right? Amber takes twice as long, so she gets one every two months. That means in a year, she gets 12 months / 2 months/badge = 6 badges. Wendy, she's a rockstar! She gets three times Claire's amount, so that's 1 badge/month * 3 = 3 badges a month. In a year, she's got 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges.  

So, Wendy has 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 more badges than Amber.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see...

If we call the number of books Fawn has ""F"", then Anne has F - 12, and Sofie has F + 13.  All together, that's 85 books. So, F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85.

Simplifying that, we get 3F + 1 = 85.  

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives us 3F = 84.

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find that F = 28.

Fawn has 28 books!

Then she nails 90% of the true/false ones, which is 18 out of 20.  Those are also worth 1 point each, so that's another 18 points.

Finally, she gets 60% of the long-answer questions right, which is 3 out of 5. Since those are worth 5 points each, she gets 15 points there.

Adding it all up: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points!

"Ay, let's see here. Isaias wants to make $2000 profit, and he's selling each chicken for $50. He's got 300 chickens, but he's only selling 3/5 of them, which is 180 chickens.  

So, he'll make 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000 from selling them.

To make a $2000 profit, that means he bought the chickens for $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Julie sold 14 glasses, and the boys sold the rest.  If they sold 32 glasses total, that means the boys sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses. Since they sold the same amount, each boy sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses.  

That means Julie sold 14 - 9 = 5 more glasses than Micah.

"Ay, let's see what Kelly's got going on here.  

Five packs of bacon for $10, that's $2 a pack.  Chicken's double the bacon, so each pack is $4, and six of those is $24. Strawberries are $4 a pop, so three packs are $12. Apples are half the price of strawberries, so $2 a pack, and seven of those are $14.

Adding it all up, that's $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

If Kelly had $65, she's got $65 - $60 = $5 left over.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one!  Let me see... if 20% of the microphones don't fit, that means 80% do.  So, 50 microphones times 80% is 40 microphones. And since each pair needs two microphones, that's 40 microphones divided by 2, which gives us 20 pairs.

Alright, so the orchids have 5 petals each, and Joelle has 5 of them. That's 5 times 5, or 25 petals total. The daisies have 10 petals each, and she has 4 of them. So that's 10 times 4, which is 40 petals.

To find the difference, we subtract the orchid petals from the daisy petals: 40 minus 25 equals 15.

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

So, 25 out of 100 plants are flowering. That's 25%!

"Ay, amigo! This is Gustavo here to help!

Let's see... the whatchamacallit spins like a crazy tornado at 121 meters per second, and it's eleven times faster than that slowpoke thingamabob. So the thingamabob spins at 121 meters per second divided by 11, which is 11 meters per second. Now, the whirligig is a real speed demon, spinning five times faster than the thingamabob. That means the whirligig spins at 11 meters per second times 5, which is 55 meters per second!

"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Ellen eats two carrots, a $6 salad, and a yogurt that costs half the price of the salad. That means the yogurt is $3.  So, the salad and yogurt together cost $9.  If she spends $11 total, that means the carrots cost $2. Since she buys two carrots, each one costs $1.

"Ay, this is a tricky one!  Tasha made some cash from lemonade and mowing, but we don't know exactly how much from lemonade alone. We need to know how many times she mowed Joe's lawn to figure that out.  

Think of it like this: every time she mowed Joe's lawn, she made $6.  If we knew how many times she did that, we could figure out her total mowing money and then subtract that from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Martha has 7 notebooks now, and she got 5 more, so she had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks before.  Joseph had 3 times that, so he had 2 * 3 = 6 notebooks. That means Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"Hey there! Gustavo here. Let's figure this out.

Anis rowed 1/5 more than Dijana's 50 miles, so he rowed 50 * (1/5) = 10 miles more. That means Anis rowed a total of 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Together, they rowed 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

"Ay, caramba! Let's figure this out.  

Jo needs 0.5 yards of material for each small mask, so for 20 small masks, that's 20 * 0.5 = 10 yards.

For the large masks, she needs 0.75 yards per mask, so 8 large masks need 8 * 0.75 = 6 yards.

In total, she'll need 10 + 6 = 16 yards of material.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Harold sleeps a lot, huh? 10 hours!  He works 2 hours less than that, so 8 hours. And he's a good dog owner, walking his pup for an hour. That's 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours gone already.  

That leaves 24 (hours in a day) - 19 = 5 hours for Harold to do whatever he wants!

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Farmer Smith's farm is a bit tricky. Twice Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres * 2 = 400 acres.  Then add another 100 acres, so Farmer Smith has 400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres.  

Altogether, they have 200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Benny threw a lot of bologna, eh?  

Okay, so he used 2 pieces for each red balloon, and he had 20 red balloons. That's 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna right there.

He threw 58 pieces total, so that means he used 58 - 40 = 18 pieces for the yellow balloons.

If each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces, then he must have had 18 / 3 = 6 yellow balloons.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Bruce works a lot! On Wednesday, he works double the time from Tuesday, so that's 5 hours * 2 = 10 hours. Then on Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, meaning 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours.

In total, he works 5 hours + 10 hours + 8 hours = 23 hours over the three days.

"Ay, caramba! That Larry sure loves his animals! Let's see... he's got 3 cats, and 3 times that many dogs, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.  He's got 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so that's 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.  His fish tank has 3 times the number of rabbits, so that's 7 * 3 = 21 fish. And his gerbils? That's 1/3 the number of fish, so he's got 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Adding them all up, Larry has 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets!

"Ay, amigo! Let's see... the bus goes 60 miles every hour for 5 hours, so that's 60 times 5, which is 300 miles. The car goes slower, 30 miles an hour for 8 hours, so that's 30 times 8, which is 240 miles.  To find the difference, we subtract: 300 minus 240. That's 60 miles!

"Hey there! Gustavo here, ready to tackle this age puzzle.

Let's see... Peter, Paul, and Jean's ages add up to 100 years. Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is the same as Paul's and John's ages combined.  

To figure out Peter's age, we gotta do some thinking.  Since Peter's age is Paul's age plus John's age, and Paul is older than John by 10 years, we can work backwards.

Let's say John is ""x"" years old. That means Paul is ""x + 10"" years old.  

Peter's age is then ""x + (x + 10)"" which simplifies to ""2x + 10"".

Now, remember their ages add up to 100. So, x + (x + 10) + Peter's age = 100.

We know Peter's age is 2x + 10, so let's plug that in: x + (x + 10) + (2x + 10) = 100

Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4x = 80

Divide both sides by 4: x = 20

So, John is 20 years old.

Now, to find Peter's age, we use the formula 2x + 10:

2 * 20 + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

There you have it! Peter is 50 years old.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Maria has 4 friends, and each friend gets 2 balloons, so that's 4 times 2, which is 8 balloons. Maria has 1 balloon too, so that's 8 plus 1, which is 9 balloons.

"Ay, Fern, this is a no-brainer! Let's see... the Widgeteer 3000 cranks out 60 widgets an hour, that's 1440 a day, and a whopping 43200 in a month!  The WidgetMaster 9000 only does 45 an hour, so that's 1080 a day and 32400 a month.

Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 will bring in $259200 a month, while the WidgetMaster 9000 only makes $194400. That's a difference of $64800!

Go for the Widgeteer 3000, mi amiga!

"Hey there! Let me see... Cameron's staying for 17 hours, right?  

So, the 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos, and those extra 5 hours will cost him 350 pesos (5 hours x 70 pesos per hour). That brings his total to 1350 pesos.

A full 24-hour stay would have cost him 1600 pesos.  

Looks like Cameron saves 250 pesos by going with the hourly rate!

"Ay, amigo! Let's figure this out. Those goats need 5 pounds each, so 15 goats need 15 * 5 = 75 pounds. Now, those sheep are a little trickier. They need twice the goats' amount minus 3 pounds, so that's (2 * 5) - 3 = 7 pounds each.  With 12 sheep, that's 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.  Add the goats' hay and the sheep's hay, and Nate needs a total of 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay.

"Ay, let's see here. John makes good money, 50 dollars an hour!  Six hours of work means he's got 300 dollars.  But hold on, he spends 50 on gas, so that leaves him with 250. Then he buys those pencils, 5 of them at 10 dollars each, so that's another 50 gone. Now he's down to 200. He wants to save 100, so that leaves him with 100 dollars for pens.  Each pen costs 25 dollars, so he can buy 4 pens.

She was there for 2.25 hours, so that's 2.25 times $35... that's $78.75.

Add that to the visit and the parts, and Patty charged a total of $178.75. 



"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... James got a deal on those CDs, but then he changed his mind about some.  

First, those 10 CDs would have cost him 10 times 15 dollars, which is 150 dollars. But he got 40% off, so that's 150 times 0.40, or 60 dollars off. That means he paid 150 minus 60, or 90 dollars for them.

Then he sold 5 of them for 40 dollars each, so he made 5 times 40, which is 200 dollars.

So, in the end, he had 200 dollars from selling them minus the 90 dollars he spent, which is 110 dollars.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... James swims 60% of the 20 miles, which is 12 miles. At 2 miles per hour, that takes him 6 hours. Then he rests for 3 hours, half the swimming time.  He's got 8 miles left, but now he's swimming slower, only 1 mile per hour. That last part takes him 8 hours.

"Hey there! Let me break this down for you.

Cayley makes 10% on each New York Times, which costs $5. So he earns $5 * 0.10 = $0.50 per Times.  He sells 6 of those, so that's $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

On the Wall Street Journal, he gets 8% commission on each $15 paper. That's $15 * 0.08 = $1.20 per Journal. He sells 10 of those, for a total of $1.20 * 10 = $12.00.

Adding those together, Cayley makes $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00 in commission.

"Hey there! This is Gustavo. Let me see... Bahati scored the most, right? And we know the total points were 45.  

Let's think:

* Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, and 10 more than Dinar.

Hmm, that means Azibo scored less than Bahati, but more than Dinar.

* If we say Azibo scored 'x' points, then Bahati scored 'x + 20' points, and Dinar scored 'x + 10' points.

* Adding those up: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

* That means 3x + 30 = 45

*  Subtract 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

* Divide both sides by 3: x = 5

So Azibo scored 5 points!

"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... Kim sleeps for 8 hours normally, which is 480 minutes. She was sleepwalking for 23 minutes, so we take that away: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.  But wait, she woke up 5 minutes early! So we subtract that too: 457 - 5 = 452 minutes. 

So Kim slept for 452 minutes on her bed that day.

"Hey there! Gustavo here, ready to tackle this problem.

Let's see... the hospital starts with 1000 beds and 1/5 are full, so that's 200 beds taken. That leaves 800 empty.  

Now, they get 50 new patients every day for two weeks, which is 14 days. So that's 50 * 14 = 700 more patients.

Adding those to the initial 200 occupied beds gives us 900 total occupied beds.

Finally, subtract that from the total number of beds: 1000 - 900 = 100.

So there are **100** unoccupied beds left.

Adelwolfe, Stan, and Alex caught a total of 339 Pokemon.  Stan caught 13 less than four times what Adelwolfe caught, and Alex caught 5 more than Stan.  

To figure out how many Stan caught, we gotta think like a detective. Let's call Adelwolfe's catch ""A"", Stan's catch ""S"", and Alex's catch ""X"".

We know:

* S = 4A - 13 (Stan's catch is tricky!)
* X = S + 5 (Alex is a bit of a show-off)
* A + S + X = 339 (All their catches add up)

Now, we gotta use our noggin'. Substitute those first two equations into the third one. It's like a Pokemon puzzle!

After some calculations, we find that Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

¡Ay, qué bien!

"Ay, amigo! Let's see... 20 minutes per episode, and half as many episodes as minutes... that means there are 10 episodes.  So, 10 episodes times 20 minutes each... that's 200 minutes of showtime!

"Ay, amigo! This bird is a traveler, eh? Let's see... 

First, she flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, that's 300 miles! Then she turns around and goes north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so that's 36 miles. Finally, she heads south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, another 110 miles.

To find the total distance, we add up the southward trips and subtract the northward trip: 300 miles - 36 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles.

That bird flew a long way!

"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Greta had a lot of brownies!  

She made 12, got 6 more from work, and her friends brought a whopping 48! That's 66 brownies in total. But then they ate 18...

So, Greta has 48 brownies left.  



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Nani's brother is 16, since he's twice Nani's age. Nani's sister is 6, because she's 2 years younger than Nani.  Adding them all up, Nani (8) + his brother (16) + his sister (6) equals 30 years old in total.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see... 3 racquets with synthetic gut at 15 minutes each, that's 45 minutes. Then 5 with polyester at 22 minutes each, so that's 110 minutes. And finally, 4 hybrid racquets at 18 minutes each, making it 72 minutes.  

Add those all up, and it's 227 minutes of stringing! 



"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... John's buying phones for his family. Two phones at full price, then the rest are half off.  

So, the first two phones are $600 each, that's $1200. The other two phones are half price, so they're $300 each, for a total of $600.

Adding those together, John spent $1800 on phones.

"Ay, caramba! Let's figure this out.  

Robert needs to find the fence's perimeter first. That's like walking all the way around the garden.  It's two times the length plus two times the width: 2 * 15 feet + 2 * 10 feet = 30 feet + 20 feet = 50 feet.

Now, he needs two slats for every foot of fence. So, 50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats.

He'll need 100 wooden slats.

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Mrs. Harrington had 12 boxes, gave away 4, and kept 2. That means she sold 6 boxes.  If each box has 20 oranges, she sold 6 * 20 = 120 oranges.

"Hey there!  Let me see... India has 4 more than half the number of states as the USA, which has 50. So, half the number of US states is 25, and India has 29.  That means together they have 29 + 50 = 79 states.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see how many hours Tyler needs to work. Those books cost $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.  He already has $14, so he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more. If he earns $5 an hour, he needs to work $25 / $5 = 5 hours.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... Sunny's got a sweet deal going on with those pies.

On Saturday, he sold 10 gingerbread and 6 apple pies. That's $60 for the gingerbread and $90 for the apple pies, for a total of $150.

On Sunday, he sold 15 gingerbread and 15 apple pies. That's $90 for the gingerbread and $225 for the apple pies, for a total of $315.

Add those two days together, and Sunny made a whopping $465!

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Emil's gonna be 24, and that's when he's half his dad's age, so his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48.

But Emil will also be twice his brother's age then, meaning his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12.

Since Emil is 19 now, his dad is 48 - 5 = 43, and his brother is 12 - 5 = 7.

Adding those up, his dad and brother are 43 + 7 = 50 years old combined.

"Hola! Let's see... Adrianne got 20 beads from her mom. Her sister gave her 10 more than that, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend doubled her mom's gift, so she got 20 * 2 = 40 beads.  In total, Adrianne has 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... Joe caught 3 pounds on Thursday, then 3 times that on Friday, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he got half of Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.  

In total, he has 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish. Since each serving is 3 pounds, he has 21 / 3 = 7 servings.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... Charlie's boots are five times bigger than Sophie's size five boots, so that means Charlie wears a size 25!  To find the average, we add their sizes together (5 + 25 = 30) and then divide by two (30 / 2 = 15).

The average shoe size is 15.

"Ay, caramba! Let's figure this out for Pat. 

First, we gotta know how many plants fit in that flower bed. It's 111 feet long, which is 1332 inches. Each plant needs 12 inches plus 18 inches of space, so that's 30 inches per plant.  

1332 inches divided by 30 inches per plant means Pat can fit 44 plants. But she already has 17, so she needs to buy 27 more.

At $6 a pop, that's gonna cost her $162. 



"
"Hey there! Let's see... Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, who eats 18 a day. So the brother eats 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.  In a week, that's 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels.

"Hola! Let's figure this out.  Katherine needs 3 petunias at $3.00 each, so that's 3 * $3.00 = $9.00 per basket for petunias. She also wants 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so that's 2 * $2.50 = $5.00 per basket for vines.  In total, each basket will cost $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00. Since she has 5 baskets, the total cost will be $14.00 * 5 = $70.00. 


$70.00

"Ay, caramba! Let's see... they got 30 pounds of soil, and those sunflowers are thirsty, needing 3 pounds each. Four sunflowers take up 12 pounds already (4 x 3 = 12). Then those carnations, needing 1.5 pounds each, take up another 15 pounds (10 x 1.5 = 15). That's 27 pounds gone already (12 + 15 = 27).  

That leaves 3 pounds for roses (30 - 27 = 3).  Since each rose needs 1 pound, they can plant 3 roses!

"Ay, amigo! Let's figure this out.  

Emily's a fast worker, eh? Peeling 6 shrimp a minute, that's something! So for 90 shrimp, that's 90 divided by 6, which is 15 minutes just for peeling.

Now, cooking those 90 shrimp... she does 30 in 10 minutes, so for 90, it's like doing three batches of 30. That's 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

Add the peeling time and the cooking time together, and you get 15 plus 30, which is 45 minutes. 

So, it'll take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook all those shrimp.

"Ay, amigo, let me see if I can help you with this.  

So, the AC cools the room 2 degrees every hour on low and 3 degrees on high. It ran on low for 3 hours, so that's 2 times 3, which is 6 degrees cooler. Then it ran on high for 4 hours, so that's 3 times 4, which is 12 degrees cooler. That's a total of 6 plus 12, or 18 degrees cooler.

But then they turned it off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up 2 degrees each hour, so that's 2 times 2, or 4 degrees warmer.

So, in the end, the room is 18 degrees cooler minus 4 degrees warmer, which is 14 degrees cooler than when they started.

"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see... Comet Halley comes around every 75 years, right? And Bill's dad saw it when he was 30. Bill saw it again when he was three times his dad's age then... so Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.  That means 90 / 75 = 1.2 comet cycles have passed.  So, Bill was 75 years old when he first saw the comet.

"Hey there! This is a fun one.  Let me see...

Think of it like this: if each kid gets one ""share,"" each adult gets two ""shares."" That means there are 6 shares total (4 kid shares + 2 adult shares). Since each adult has 2 out of the 6 shares, they each get 2/6 or 1/3 of the watermelon.

That's the same as 33.33%, but since we're dealing with slices, let's just say each adult gets **33.3%** of the watermelon.

"Hey there! Let me break this down for you.  

So, they charge $25 just to use the studio, and then $1.50 for each student. With 10 students, that's an extra $15 per session. That means each session costs $40 total.

They have classes 3 times a week, so that's $40 x 3 = $120 per week.

And in a month, with 4 weeks, they'd make $120 x 4 = $480.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Peter has 64 chocolate bars spread across 4 boxes, so each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars. Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, meaning each of her boxes has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.  That means Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... 3/5 of the 50 porcupines are female, so that's 30 mamas. Each mama has 4 babies a month, so that's 30 times 4, which is 120 little porcupines every month! In a whole year, that's 120 times 12, which is 1440 babies!  Add those to the original 50, and you get a grand total of 1490 porcupines!

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

Half of the 3000 students are over 16, so that's 1500 students. A quarter of those older students are guys, meaning 375 are male and 1125 are female.

The other half of the school, 1500 students, are under 16. Half of them are boys, so 750 are male and 750 are female.

Adding up all the girls, we get 1125 + 750 = 1875 female students.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Wanda and Ms. B are working hard to fill that tank.

On the first day, Wanda pumps in a quarter of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumps in three-quarters of what Wanda does, so that's 4500 gallons * 0.75 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumps in two-thirds of her first day's amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons. Ms. B only pumps in a third of her first day's amount, so that's 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

Adding up all the water they pumped, we get 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons + 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

That means they still need to pump in 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons to fill the tank completely.

"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Maria's power bank was losing charge while helping out her friends.  It lost 9% every hour for 5 hours, then 7% every hour for another 3 hours. That's a lot of juice! In the end, she had 28% left.

To figure out how much she started with, we gotta work backwards.  Think of it like a puzzle!

First, we gotta figure out how much charge was left *before* she started helping her friends.  Since she lost 66% total (45% + 21%), she had 34% left at that point.

But wait, there's more!  She used 6% of that 34% to charge her friends' phones. That means the 28% she had left represents 94% of what she had before helping them (34% - 6% = 28%).

So, to find the original charge, we can set up a little equation:

28% = 94% * Original Charge

Divide both sides by 94% to isolate the Original Charge:

Original Charge = 28% / 94% = about 29.79%



Let me know if you want to try another brain teaser!

"Hey there! Let me see... so the carrot price goes up by 5% each year, huh?  

* Year one, that's $120 times 0.05, which is $6 more, making them $126.
* Year two, another 5%, so $126 times 0.05 is $6.30, bringing the price to $132.30.
* Year three, we do it again! $132.30 times 0.05 is $6.62 (rounding that up a bit). That means the carrots are now $138.92.

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the carrots would cost about $139 after three years.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, we gotta figure out how many questions are easy, average, and difficult.  Since 40% are easy, that's 60 * 0.40 = 24 easy questions.

That leaves 60 - 24 = 36 questions for average and difficult, which means there are 36 / 2 = 18 of each.

Aries gets 75% of the easy ones right, so that's 24 * 0.75 = 18 easy questions correct.

She gets half the average and difficult ones right, so that's 18 * 0.50 = 9 correct for each type.

Adding it all up, she's sure to get 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right.

"Ay, amigo! Let's see here... those dwarves are hard workers!

So, one dwarf with just his hands can mine 12 pounds a day. With an iron pickaxe, he's twice as fast, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 pounds a day. Now, a steel pickaxe is even better! That's 50% more than the iron pickaxe, so he mines 24 * 1.50 = 36 pounds a day.

Now, we got 40 dwarves with those fancy steel pickaxes, and they're working for a whole month, 30 days!  Each dwarf mines 36 pounds a day * 30 days = 1080 pounds in a month.

So, all 40 dwarves together mine 1080 pounds/dwarf * 40 dwarves = 43200 pounds!

That's a lot of ore!

"Ay, this Marcus sounds like a real smooth talker! Let's see...

He's got a 50/50 shot of getting a sub, and subs never care about homework.  If his regular teacher shows up, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone more time. Even if she doesn't, he's got a 20% chance of pulling the ""dog ate my homework"" card.

So, let me think... 50% chance he's off the hook right away. That leaves 50% where he might have to do it.  Of that 50%, 40% get an extension, leaving 30% who are stuck.

That means there's a **30%** chance Marcus actually has to turn in his homework.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... 6000 seats total, minus 950 for the grads and 300 for the teachers... that leaves 4750 seats for everyone else.  Now, if we split those evenly between the 950 graduates, each one gets 5 tickets for their familia.

"Ay, caramba! That Grandpa sure loves his jelly beans!  Let's see... if he eats 75 big ones, and twice as many medium, that's 75 x 2 = 150 medium beans. And remember, 3 little ones are like one medium, so he can eat 150 x 3 = 450 small beans!

"Ay, Melissa's got a tough gig, but let's see how much she makes.  She's putting in 18 hours total (6 hours a day for 3 days).  That's $45 in pay, but she's gotta pay $9 for parking. So, after expenses, she's got $36 left.  That means she's making $2 an hour.

"Ay, this is a tough one! Let's see...

So, Jim's got $50,000 in loans each year for four years, that's a whopping $200,000! Plus, he missed out on making $25,000 a year for four years, so that's another $100,000.  

That means he needs to earn back a total of $300,000.  With his new fancy degree, he's making $75,000 a year.  

It'll take him 4 years to earn back all that dough.

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a bit of a head-scratcher, but Gustavo can figure it out.  

Let's see, the bed is 6 feet by 8 feet. Jim wants the fabric to be 2 feet longer and wider on each side, so that means we add 4 feet to the length and 4 feet to the width.

That makes the fabric 10 feet by 12 feet. To find out how much fabric he needs, we multiply those numbers together: 10 feet times 12 feet equals 120 square feet.

Jim needs 120 square feet of fabric.

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see here...

They delivered 425 letters on Monday. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's amount, so that's 425 / 5 + 17 = 102 letters.

Then on Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice the amount from Tuesday, meaning 2 * 102 + 5 = 209 letters.

Adding it all up, they delivered a total of 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... 10 people want the chicken salad at $6.50 each, so that's 10 times 6.50... which is $65.00. Then we got 6 people wanting pasta salad at $6.00 each, so that's 6 times 6... which is $36.00.  Add those together and we get $65.00 plus $36.00, for a grand total of $101.00. 


$101.00
"
"Ay, caramba! That's a tough one. Let's see...

His dad lost $5 on the first race. Then he won $11 on the second race. But then he lost $16.50 on the third race.  

That means he lost a total of $21.50 that day.  

To find the average, we divide that by 3 races: $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.

So the answer is $7.17. 


$7.17
"
"Hola!  Let me see... 26 countries, 5 cities each with 1000 people... that's a lot of people!  

If we multiply 26 countries by 5 cities, we get 130. Then we multiply that by 1000 people per city, and we get a total of 130,000 people.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Xavier grew to be 51 inches tall (4 feet is 48 inches plus his 3 extra inches). Cole is now 52 inches tall (50 inches plus his 2 extra inches). That means Cole is 1 inch taller than Xavier.

"Hey there! Gustavo here, ready to tackle this problem.

Let's see... they split $1920, the second person got $80 more than the first, and the third person got double the second person's share.  To figure out the first person's cut, we gotta do some thinking.

Let's say the first person got 'x' dollars. That means the second person got 'x + $80', and the third person got '2 * (x + $80)' which is the same as '2x + $160'.

Adding all that up, we get x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Combining the 'x's and the dollar amounts, we have 4x + $240 = $1920

Subtracting $240 from both sides gives us 4x = $1680

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that x = $420.

So the first person got $420. 


$420
"
"Ay, amigo! Let me see... 3 weeks is 21 days, right? And they worked 3/8 of a day, which is 9 hours. So each painter worked 21 days times 9 hours a day... that's 189 hours!

"Ay, caramba! This tennis ball problem is tricky, but Gustavo can solve it!

Let's see... if he got 19 balls in total, and the third set was half of the second, we gotta figure out what the second set was first.  Then we can add 4 to that for the first set.

Hmmm... thinking, thinking...

Ah! The answer is 10!  



"
"Ay, caramba! This depreciation is rough. Let's see... 21% less each year, eh?

* In 2008, the car is worth 20000 * (1 - 0.21) = $15800.
* Then in 2009, it's 15800 * (1 - 0.21) = $12478.
* Finally, in 2010, it's 12478 * (1 - 0.21) = $9860.62.

So the car is worth $9860.62 in 2010. 


9860.62
"
"Hola! Let me see... half of the books are in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books. Then 10% are in German, which is 50 * 0.10 = 5 books.  That means there are 25 + 5 = 30 books in English and German combined.  

So, there must be 50 - 30 = 20 books in Spanish.

"Ay, caramba! So James had a little fender bender, eh? That's gonna cost him.  

If his insurance is normally $120 a month, and it went up 60% because of the accident, that's an extra $72 a month.  So now he's paying $192 a month.

That means he's paying $2304 a year. Oof!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. They watch 4 movies on Saturday and half that on Sunday, so that's 4 / 2 = 2 movies on Sunday.  That means they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies each weekend. Over 4 weeks, they'd watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weeks = 24 movies.

"
"Hey there! Gustavo here, ready to help.

Let's see... Betsy took longer than Donovan, and together they took 98 minutes.  

If we think of Donovan's time as 'x', Betsy took 'x + 18' minutes.  

So, x + (x + 18) = 98

That means 2x + 18 = 98

Taking away 18 from both sides gives us 2x = 80

And dividing by 2, we find x = 40.

Donovan cooked for 40 minutes, so Betsy cooked for 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"
"Ay, caramba! That's a rough break, literally! Let's see... the cast is $200, the doctor charges $300 an hour, but she only saw her for half an hour, so that's $150.  Then there's the painkillers, 30 of them at $4 a pop, that's $120. And don't forget the parking, $6 an hour for two hours, so another $12.  

Adding it all up, that's $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482. Oof, that's a lot of pesos!


482 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If James gets 80 emails a day and 20% don't need a reply, that means he gets 80 * 0.20 = 16 emails that he can ignore.

That leaves 80 - 16 = 64 emails that need a response each day.

Over a 5 day work week, he'd respond to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

"Ay, caramba! That's a lot of classes! Let's see...

Monday had 32, Tuesday had double that, so 64. Wednesday had triple Monday's amount, so 96. Then Thursday had 30 and Friday had 25.

"Ay, chico! Let's figure this out.  Anthony's sending out a lot of coupons! He's got 700 small ones, and twice that many big ones, so that's 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

Now, those small coupons cost 5 cents each to mail, so that's 700 * $0.05 = $35.00. The big coupons cost 15 cents each, so that's 1400 * $0.15 = $210.00.

Adding those together, his total postage is $35.00 + $210.00 = $245.00.

"Ay, amigo! Let's figure this out. Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, right?  Since the store has that buy one get one half off deal, he'll pay full price for 3 pounds and half price for the other 3.

So, 3 pounds at $4.00 each is $12.00. The other 3 pounds at half price would be $2.00 each, for a total of $6.00.

Add those together, and he's spending $18.00 on butter.

"Ay, caramba! Let's figure out this fiesta cost!

Kayla's got a lot of amigos coming!  First, we gotta see how many are coming in total: 25 classmates + 7 dance friends + 13 family = 45 guests.

Uh oh, some can't make it. 45 guests - 4 no-shows = 41 guests at the party.

Now, the theater charges extra for more than 20 people. So, 41 guests - 20 guests = 21 extra guests.

That's 21 guests * $6 per guest = $126 extra.

Finally, add that to the starting price: $125 + $126 = $251.

Kayla's party will cost $251.

The third train rolls in an hour after the second one takes off, and it's a quick stop, gone right away. Finally, Paul's train, the fourth one, arrives 20 minutes after the third one leaves.  

So, Paul's gonna be waiting a total of 115 minutes.

"Hey there! Let me break this down for you.

Mr. Rogers got the watch for 75% of $2000, which is $1500. Then he sold it for 120% of that price, meaning he sold it for $1800.  That's a $200 discount from the original $2000 price.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%

So the answer is 10%.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Marcel made.

First, we know he sold 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each, so that's 150 * $450 = $67,500.

Then, he sold 45 BMX bikes at half the price of an MTB, which is $500 / 2 = $250 each. That brings in 45 * $250 = $11,250.

Finally, he sold 105 MTB bikes at $500 each, for a total of 105 * $500 = $52,500.

Adding all that up, Marcel earned $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250 from selling bikes that month.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tough one! Let me see... the Allosaurus ate 270 kilos, and that was only half of what was left after the velociraptors had their fill. So, before those sneaky raptors showed up, there must have been 270 kilos * 2 = 540 kilos.  But remember, that was only half of what the T-Rex left behind!  So, the triceratops must have started with 540 kilos * 2 = 1080 kilos of meat!

"Ay, painting a room, eh? Let's see... you got two big walls, 10 by 8 feet, that's 80 square feet each. So that's 160 square feet already. Then you got two smaller walls, 5 by 8 feet, so those are 40 square feet each, making another 80 square feet.  All together, that's 240 square feet to paint.

Now, each gallon covers 20 square feet, so you'll need 12 gallons. At $12 a gallon, that's gonna cost you $144.

"Ay, let's see here. Billy's a good guy, helping folks with their taxes.  

Okay, so he helps 2 people every hour, and he works 3 hours a day. That's 2 times 3, which is 6 people a day.

Now, from March 1st to April 19th, there are 31 days in March plus 19 days in April, so that's 50 days total. But he takes 20% of those days off.  20% of 50 is 10 days off.

So, he works 50 days minus 10 days, which is 40 days.

Finally, he helps 6 people a day for 40 days, so that's 6 times 40, which equals 240 people.

Billy helps 240 people.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... the big slide is 300 feet long and you go 60 feet every minute. So that's 300 divided by 60, which is 5 minutes to zoom down.

Now, the smaller slide is 240 feet long and you're flying down at 80 feet per minute. That's 240 divided by 80, which is 3 minutes.

"Hey there! Let me see... Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day, so that's 30 + 30 = 60 minutes of breaks daily. Over five days, that adds up to 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes.  

To get that in hours, we divide by 60, giving us 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Chris is 4, and Ben is twice his age, then Ben is 8 years old. Since Caroline is three times older than Ben, she's 8 * 3 = 24 years old.

"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... Lauren wants to live on 40% of her $100,000 salary during retirement, which is $40,000 per year.  She wants to do this for 20 years, so she needs a total of $800,000 saved up ($40,000 x 20).

Since she saves 20% of her salary each year, that's $20,000 saved annually.  To reach her goal of $800,000, she'll need to save for 40 years ($800,000 / $20,000).

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Anna started with $16 and spent $4, leaving her with $12. Then she bought two books and has $2 left. That means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on books.  Since she bought two books, each book cost $10 / 2 = $5.

"Ay, amigo! This is a bit of a brain teaser, but Gustavo can handle it.  

If the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, that means it blinks 51 times every minute. To find out how long it takes to blink 459 times, we divide 459 by 51. That gives us 9 minutes.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... Tate's got a lot of fishy friends!  

He starts with 7 boy fish and 12 girl fish. Then he gets more!  He adds 4 more boy fish and 4 more girl fish. That means he has 11 boy fish and 16 girl fish.

Hmm... 16 minus 11... that's 5!

Tate has **5** more girl fish than boy fish. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Amalia mowed the lawn for 4 hours. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so she spent 4 + 2 = 6 hours walking the dog. Dior took a whopping 4 hours longer than Amalia mowing, meaning she spent 4 + 4 = 8 hours doing laundry.  

To find the total time, we add up their individual times: 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.

"
"Hey there! Let me see... John drives 70 miles per hour and it takes him 2 hours to get to his parents. That means it's a 140-mile trip each way. Since he goes there and back, that's 280 miles for one visit.  He does this twice a month, so he drives 560 miles total.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Sofie walks 10 miles a day for 7 days, so that's 10 * 7 = 70 miles. Brian walks half that amount, so he walks 70 / 2 = 35 miles.

"Ay, caramba! Let me see if I can figure this out.  

Those first two workers are real speed demons, making 6 toys an hour each. That's 12 toys every hour from them! The other two are a bit slower, making 4 toys each per hour, so that's another 8 toys every hour.

So, in 10 hours, those four workers make 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.

That means they still need 400 toys - 20 toys - 200 toys = 180 more toys.

To make 180 toys in 10 hours, that fifth worker needs to make 18 toys every hour.

"
"Ay, let's see here. Kory's dog is a big boy at 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is a quarter of that, so that's 15 pounds. His second dog is half the size of Kory's, which is 30 pounds.  

So, Elijah's dogs weigh 45 pounds together (15 + 30).  Adding Kory's dog, we get a total of 105 pounds.

"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see... Kris got 7 stickers from someone and had 9 more, so that's 16 stickers total.  That means Luis gave Kris 16 stickers, and that was only half of what Luis had! So Luis had 16 times 2, which is 32 stickers.  Luis got those from Seth, and that was only half of what Seth had. So Seth must have started with 32 times 2, which is 64 stickers!

"Ay, Rani wants to know about fast cars, eh? That's my kind of question!  

So, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest, which is 5 times faster than a regular car. A regular car goes 120 mph, so the second fastest goes 5 * 120 = 600 mph.  

That means the fastest car is zooming at 1.25 * 600 = 750 mph!

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see... Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. So Sarah must have painted 9 eggs (30 - 12 = 18, then 18 / 2 = 9). That means Camden painted 21 eggs (9 + 12 = 21).

Now, Arnold and Madeline painted the same amount, and together they painted 26 eggs (56 total eggs - 30 = 26). So each of them painted 13 eggs (26 / 2 = 13).

Finally, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold (21 - 13 = 8).

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... 200 crayons divided by 8 crayons per box is 25 boxes.  That's a lot of boxes!  Each box weighs 8 ounces, so 25 boxes weigh 200 ounces. The crayons themselves weigh 200 ounces too.  So, 200 plus 200 is 400 ounces total.  Now, there are 16 ounces in a pound, so 400 ounces is equal to 25 pounds.

"
"Ay, let's see here. Valerie makes $5000 a month, which is half of what her brother makes. So her brother brings in $5000 * 2 = $10000. Together, they make $5000 + $10000 = $15000.  Their mama earns double that, so she makes $15000 * 2 = $30000.  Add it all up, and they've got $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000 every month!

45000 

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see... Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach, and that takes her 40 minutes.  So she's going 3 miles per hour on the sand. On the sidewalk, she's twice as fast, so that's 6 miles per hour.  Since the sidewalk is only 1 mile, it takes her 10 minutes to walk that part.  

Adding it all up, her whole walk takes 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Jane saves $4 a week, and she's already saved for 8 weeks, so that's $4 * 8 = $32.  She wants to have $60, so she needs $60 - $32 = $28 more. To get that extra $28, it'll take her $28 / $4 = 7 more weeks.

"
"Ay, amigo! Let's figure this out. If Bob has 60 marbles after getting 2 dozen more, that means he had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles before.  If he loses 10, he'll have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles left.

"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see... Donny needs his water at least 40 degrees, right?  He's got that cold water at 33 degrees, but it's bringing the whole mix down. That other water has to be pretty hot to make up for it.  

If we think about it, that unknown water needs to be at least 68 degrees to make the whole thing drinkable.

"Hey there! Let me see... 50 cows plus 20 chickens to start. Then he gets 20 more cows every day for three weeks, that's like 20 times 7 times 3... which is 420 more cows! And 10 chickens a day for three weeks, so 10 times 7 times 3... that's 210 more chickens!

So, 50 cows plus 420 is 470 cows. And 20 chickens plus 210 is 230 chickens.  

Altogether, that's 470 plus 230... which makes 700 animals!

"
"Ay, amigo! Let's break this down. Four packs of bagels at ten bucks a pop is forty dollars, right? But wait, there's a discount! Ten percent off means four dollars saved, so he's paying thirty-six dollars total.  Now, with thirty-six bagels in total, that's a dollar a bagel!

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... if it takes 3 potatoes less than 6, that's 3 potatoes, to make 1 less than 3 scoops, which is 2 scoops, then each scoop needs 1.5 potatoes.  Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so that's 18 scoops.  

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes per scoop = 27 potatoes!

"Ay, amigo! Let's see... Chester eats a lot of eggs!  

He eats 3 eggs a day for a whole month, that's 30 days, so that's 3 times 30, which is 90 eggs. Then he eats 5 eggs a day for another month, so that's 5 times 30, which is 150 eggs. In total, that's 90 plus 150, which is 240 eggs.

Now, there are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 240 by 12, which gives us 20 dozen eggs.

"
"Ay, amigo! Let's figure this out.  

We know there are 17 green jelly beans and double that in red, so that's 17 * 2 = 34 red ones. That's a lot of red!

Together, the green and red make 17 + 34 = 51 jelly beans.

If there are 60 jelly beans total, then there must be 60 - 51 = 9 blue jelly beans.

"Ay, amigo! Let's see... 5 men for every 9 women, that's a lot of ladies!  

So, 84 passengers total... that means each ""part"" of the ratio is 84 / 14 = 6 people.

That means there were 9 parts * 6 people/part = 54 women on the bus at first.

Now, 20 women get off... so there are 54 - 20 = 34 women left.

"
"Ay, amigo! Let's figure this out. Faraday's got sunflowers for $2 each and bouquets for $8. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so he makes $8 / 12 = $0.67 per sunflower in a bouquet.

That means each sunflower, whether solo or in a bouquet, brings in $2 + $0.67 = $2.67.

Over three days, he makes $2.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

He made $26 from single sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over three days.

So, he sold $82 / $2.67 per sunflower = 30.7 sunflowers.

Since you can't sell parts of a sunflower, Faraday sold 30 sunflowers after three days.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one. Let's see... Adam starts with $100, right? He buys rocks for $5 each, so that's 20 rocks. He sells them for $7 each, but only gets rid of 60% of them, which is 12 rocks. That means he makes $84.  

So, he loses $16.

"Ay, caramba! This is a lot of picture scenes! Let's see... 

If Lauren draws 5 big pictures a day, it'll take her 45 / 5 = 9 days for those.

For the medium ones, 36 / 6 = 6 days.

And the small ones, 49 / 7 = 7 days.

Adding those up, 9 + 6 + 7 = 22 days.

It'll take her 22 days to finish all those pictures!

"Hey there!  

To find Sid's average speed, we gotta add up all the miles he traveled and divide that by the total time he spent driving.

He went 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles total.

He drove for 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours total.

So, his average speed is 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"Ay, amigo! Let's break this down.  The first ticket has a 20% chance, right? The second one is three times more likely, so that's 20% times 3, which is 60%. To get the chance of both winning, we multiply those together: 20% times 60% equals 12%.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Jim had 27 seashells, and that's 5 more than Carlos, so Carlos found 27 - 5 = 22 seashells. Carlos found twice as many as Carrey, meaning Carrey found 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Altogether, they have 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

If they split them evenly, each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"
"Ay, amigo! Let's figure this out. The second song is 60% longer than the first, which is 5 minutes. That means it's 5 times 0.60, or 3 minutes longer. So the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.  

In total, the cassette is 5 + 8 = 13 minutes long.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... Linus is a smart cookie. He buys those devices for $20 and flips them for $40 each. That's a $20 profit per device!

On Monday, he made $20/device * 2 devices = $40.

On Tuesday, he made $20/device * 4 devices = $80.

Add those together, and he made a total of $40 + $80 = $120 in profit.

"
"Hey there! Let me see... Hortex makes 4200 bottles a day, and each bottle covers 20% of a person's energy needs.  So, they're covering 4200 * 0.20 = 840% of a person's daily energy needs.

To cover 100% for 2300 people, they'd need to cover 2300 * 100% = 230,000% of daily energy needs.

That means they need to make up 230,000% - 840% = 229,160% more.

Since each bottle covers 20%, they'd need to produce 229,160% / 20% = 7300 more bottles.


7300 

"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so Carla has eight babies, right? And three-quarters of them are in purple, which is six babies. The other two are in blue. Now, half of the purple babies have bows, so that's three babies.  And both blue babies have bows too. That means four babies have bows in total.

So, if a baby has a bow, there's a 50% chance it's wearing purple.

"Ay, caramba! Let me see... they got 5168 reports for the whole week, right? And 1907 on Monday and Tuesday, plus another 2136 on Thursday and Friday.  That's a lot of paperwork!

So, Monday through Friday they got 1907 + 2136, which is 4043 reports.  

To find out how many they got on Wednesday, we gotta subtract that from the total: 5168 - 4043 = 1125.

They got 1125 reports on Wednesday.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much money Abraham made.

He started with 80 square meters and sold half for $50, so that's 40 square meters gone. Then he sold another 1/4 of what was left, which is 10 more square meters for $30. That leaves him with 30 square meters. He sells those for $3 each, making another $90.

Adding it all up, he made $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.

That means he's collecting from a whopping 1440 apartments every week! Three times a week, mind you. That's 4320 collections!

At 40 cents a pop, he's making a cool $1728.00 every week. Not bad for a garbage man, eh?

"Hola! Gustavo here, ready to help with your avocado tree problem. Let's see...

* A 6-year-old tree makes 3 times the fruit of a 5-year-old, so that's 50 fruits * 3 = 150 fruits.
* A 7-year-old tree makes 7 times the fruit of a 5-year-old, so that's 50 fruits * 7 = 350 fruits.
* An 8-year-old tree makes 200 less fruits than a 10-year-old. A 10-year-old tree makes 20 times the fruit of a 5-year-old, which is 50 fruits * 20 = 1000 fruits. So, an 8-year-old makes 1000 fruits - 200 fruits = 800 fruits.

Adding up all the fruit from each year: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = 2350 fruits.

"Ay, amigo! This is a fun one! Let me see... the red rope is like the big boss, four times longer than the little blue rope. That blue rope is a bit shy, 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow one.  All three together make 37 centimeters.  

To find the red rope's length, we gotta think like a detective.  

The red rope is the key! It's four times the blue rope, so if we figure out the blue rope, we're golden. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow one.  

Hmmm... if we add up the red, blue, and yellow ropes, it's 37 centimeters. Let's play with those numbers!

"Ay, amigo! Let's break this down. Half the mural is yellow, so that's 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow.  The rest of the colors, red, white, and purple, share the other 6 pints equally. That means each of those colors used 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so that's 20 * 12 = 240 square feet per bedroom.  Since he has four bedrooms, that's 240 * 4 = 960 square feet total for the bedrooms.

The living room is five times bigger than one bedroom, so it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding up the bedrooms and living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

Finally, don't forget the rest of the house, which is 1000 square feet.  So the total area is 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

* He loses 10, leaving him with 40.
* He uses half, so that's 20 gone, leaving him with 20.
* Now he triples his money, so he's got 60 twenties.

"Ay, amigo! Let's break this down. Team A scores 4 goals in the first half, and Team B scores 2 less, so that's 2 goals. In the second half, Team B goes wild and scores 4 times their first half amount, which is 8 goals! Team A only scores a quarter of that, so that's 2 goals.

Adding it all up, Team A scores 6 goals total (4 + 2), and Team B scores 10 goals (2 + 8). That means there were a total of 16 goals in the match!

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see...

The teacher starts with 5 inches of chalk and uses 45% on Monday, leaving him with 55%. That's 2.75 inches (5 x 0.55).  He uses 20% each day, so that's 1 inch every 5 days (5 inches / 0.20 = 25, then 25 / 5 = 5).

He can use the chalk for 2 more full days before it's too small.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, there are 12 girls and 12 boys, making a total of 24 students. One-third of the girls, which is 4 girls, are on varsity. And one-fourth of the boys, which is 3 boys, are also on varsity. That means 7 students in total are on varsity.

If 7 students are on varsity, then 24 - 7 = 17 students are not on varsity.

"Hey there!  Let's see... Mike has 5 masks. Johnny got 2 more than three times that amount. So, three times Mike's masks is 5 times 3, which is 15. Then we add 2 more, making it 17 masks for Johnny.

"Ay, Mr. Marcellus got a bad deal with that milk!  Let's see... he had 4000 gallons, and 2 out of every 5 gallons went bad. That's 1600 gallons of sour milk!  If each gallon cost $3.50, he should get a refund of $5600. 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Let's call Wendy's age ""w"" and Colin's age ""c"".

We know Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years, so that means:

w = 5(c + 7)

And in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:

c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we gotta solve for ""c"", Colin's age.  

Let's solve the first equation for ""w"":

w = 5c + 35

Now we can plug that ""w"" into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify that:

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3

Let's get all the ""c"" terms on one side:

(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3

75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c

40/3 = (2/3)c

Now, solve for ""c"":

c = (40/3) * (3/2)

c = 20

So, Colin is 20 years old.

"Ay, amigo! Let's figure this out.  

If Bob spends $27,000 on books for 3 schools, that's $9,000 per school. Since he gets 100 books for $500, that means each book costs $5.

So, with $9,000 per school, he can buy 1800 books for each one!

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let me see...

If John is 28 now and Digimon is 20 years old, that means John was 8 when Digimon first came out.  Since he was twice as old as Jim back then, Jim must have been 4.  

So, if Jim was 4 twenty years ago, he's gotta be 24 now!

"Hey there! Let's figure out Jen's earnings. 

She works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, so that's 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours a week.

Her hourly rate is $1.50, so she makes 45 * $1.50 = $67.50 per week.

Since April has 4 weeks, her total earnings for the month would be $67.50 * 4 = $270.00.

Don't forget her perfect attendance bonus of $10!

That brings her total to $270.00 + $10.00 = $280.00 for April.

"Ay, let's see here. Jason did a lot of chores!  

He made $3.00 for laundry, $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 each time he took out the trash, and $0.50 each time he emptied the dishwasher.

Over two weeks, he emptied the dishwasher 6 times, did laundry once, took out the trash twice, and cleaned his room once.

So, let's add it all up:

* Dishwasher: 6 times * $0.50 = $3.00
* Laundry: $3.00
* Trash: 2 times * $0.75 = $1.50
* Room: $1.50

That's a total of $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00

Jason earned $9.00.

"Ay, amigo, let's break this down.  John spends $600 on 10 bottles of scotch, so each bottle costs $60. Now, he wants twice as many bottles of cognac, which is 20 bottles.  Cognac costs 50% more, so that's an extra $30 per bottle, making each bottle $90.  So, the cognac costs him 20 bottles * $90/bottle = $1800.  

Adding that to the scotch, he spends a total of $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"
"Ay, amigo! Let's figure this out. Mattison is 60 inches tall, and his house is seven times that, so 60 times 7 is 420 inches. The first floor is three times Mattison's height, so that's 60 times 3, which is 180 inches.  Now, Mattison and the first floor together are 60 plus 180, or 240 inches.  To find the height of the second floor, we subtract that from the total house height: 420 minus 240 is 180 inches.

So the roof is 180 inches above the second floor.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

John's classes are each 1/8 the size of Ali's class, which holds 120 students. That means each of John's classes can hold 120 / 8 = 15 students. Since John has two classes, they can hold a total of 15 * 2 = 30 students.

Adding that to Ali's class size, the combined capacity of both schools is 120 + 30 = 150 students.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see...

First, we gotta figure out how much space those jelly beans take up. That jar is 6 inches by 6 inches at the bottom, so that's 36 square inches. And it's 15 inches tall, so the whole thing holds 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

But those jelly beans don't fit perfectly, right? They're gonna leave some air gaps.  He said they only use about 80% of the space, so that's 540 * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches for the jelly beans.

Now, each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. So, we can fit 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans in there.

He thinks 30% are red, so that's 2880 * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

But wait! The real answer is 900.  So, he was off by 900 - 864 = 36 jelly beans.

At the third stop, everyone doubles up, so now there are 180 people on board.

The bus can hold 200, so there's room for 20 more amigos!

"Hey there! Let me break this down for you.

Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year, and that costs her $2 each time. So for 5 years, she spends 3 * $2 * 5 = $30.

Then the price jumps up by 150%! That means each visit now costs $2 + ($2 * 1.5) = $5.

For the next 3 years, she's still going 3 times a year, so that's 3 * $5 * 3 = $45.

In total, Pauline spends $30 + $45 = $75 on museum visits.

"Hey there! Gustavo here, ready to help.

Let's see... Ian's got a 40-foot board and wants to cut it into two pieces. The longer piece is four times bigger than the shorter one.  To find out how long the longer piece is, we gotta think about it like this:

* If the shorter piece is ""x"" feet long, the longer one is ""4x"" feet long.

* Together, they make up the whole board, so x + 4x = 40

* That means 5x = 40

* Divide both sides by 5, and we get x = 8.

* So the shorter piece is 8 feet long, and the longer one is 4 * 8 = 32 feet long!

"Ay, caramba! Let's figure this out.  

Aiden needs 80 meatballs, and he gets 16 from every pound of beef. That means he needs 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of beef.

"Ay, amigo, that's a tricky one! Let me break it down for you.  

First, you gotta pay $0.25 for each minute of those first 16 minutes. That's 16 times $0.25, which is $4.00.

Then, for the rest of the call, it's $0.20 per minute. You've got 36 minutes total, minus those first 16, leaving you with 20 minutes. So that's 20 times $0.20, which is another $4.00.

Add those two together, and you get a total of $8.00 for your call.

"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... Carly needs enough treats for everyone in her class, right?  Five people times two treats each is ten treats total.  She makes fewer cupcakes than brownies, so let's start by guessing a small number for cupcakes. If she made 3 cupcakes, she'd need to make 3 * 3 - 2 = 7 brownies. That's a total of 10 treats! 

So, Carly made **3** cupcakes.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Charlie makes.

Okay, so he charges $80 an hour normally, but gives veterans a 25% discount. That means he charges veterans $80 - ($80 * 0.25) = $60 an hour.

He has four regular lessons at $80 each, so that's 4 * $80 = $320.

He also has two lessons with veterans at $60 each, so that's 2 * $60 = $120.

Adding those together, Charlie makes $320 + $120 = $440 today.

"Ay, chica! Let's figure this out.  If Mary makes some strawberry cubes, and then blueberry cubes that are 5 times the strawberry amount minus 4, we gotta do some math!

She makes 116 cubes total, so let's say she makes 's' strawberry cubes. That means she makes 5s - 4 blueberry cubes.

All together, that's s + (5s - 4) = 116 cubes.

Combining those like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides, and we have 6s = 120.

Divide both sides by 6, and we find out she made 20 strawberry cubes.

Now, to find the blueberry cubes, we do 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 blueberry cubes.

"Hey there! Let's see... Ara's been ballin' for four years, scoring 21 points a game, and playing 40 games each year.  That's a lot of buckets!

So, she's played 4 years * 40 games/year = 160 games total.

And with 21 points per game, that's 160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points!

That's a whole lotta points, Ara!


3360

"Ay, caramba! That's a tricky one. Let's see... Brendan started with 10 marbles, dropped half, found 3, and then lost one that wasn't even a marble!  

So, he had 10 / 2 = 5 marbles on the ground. Then he found 3, so that's 5 - 3 = 2 left behind. Adding the ones he found, he had 2 + 3 = 5 marbles. But wait! He got rid of the bead, so he's left with 5 - 1 = 4 marbles.

"Ay, chico, this is a classic sales problem! Let's break it down.

Jason needs 15 cars sold, right?  And for every two people who walk in, he sells one car. So he needs 30 people to visit the dealership (15 cars x 2 people per car).

Now, for every 25 calls, he gets one visitor. That means he needs to make 750 calls to get those 30 visitors (30 visitors x 25 calls per visitor).

750 



"
"Ay, caramba! Sounds like Brianna's family is prepared for the dark! Let's see... they got 4 flashlights, one for each person.  And for the candles, half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 rooms times 4 candles, which is 16 candles. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's another 4 rooms times 5 candles, making 20 candles.  Adding all those up, they have 16 plus 20, which is 36 candles.  

So, in total, they have 36 candles plus 4 flashlights, for a grand total of 40.

"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Mitchell has a lot of chips! Two bags with 55 each, that's 110 chips total.  

With five people in his family, each person gets 22 chips.  



"
"Ay, amigo! Let's see... five minutes for the first side, then the next two take twice as long, so that's ten minutes each.  Then the last two are half the time of the first, so two and a half minutes each.  

Add it all up: five plus ten plus ten plus two and a half plus two and a half... that's thirty minutes!

"
"Ay, Dominick must have been in a sporty place!  If there were 20 helmets, and he saw half as many robots, that's 20 / 2 = 10 robots.  Then, since there were half as many helmets as footballs, there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.  

Adding them all up, he saw 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 items. 


70
"
"Ay, amigo! Let's see... Tim works 6 hours a day, which is 360 minutes. If each call takes 15 minutes, he can handle 360 divided by 15, which is 24 calls a day. Over a 5-day week, that's 24 times 5, or 120 calls. 

120 

"
"Ay, caramba! This varnish situation is tricky.  Let's see... the old varnish took 7 minutes per painting, so for 6 paintings, that's 7 times 6, which is 42 minutes.  But this new varnish is slower, taking 12 minutes per painting. For 6 paintings, that's 12 times 6, or 72 minutes.  

So, the new varnish takes 30 minutes longer.

"
"Ay, Crista has a lot of thirsty plants! Let's see... 

Four plants need half a cup, so that's 4 times 0.5, which is 2 cups. Then 8 plants need a whole cup each, so that's 8 cups.  The rest, 8 plants, need a quarter cup each, so that's 8 times 0.25, which is 2 cups.

Adding it all up, she needs 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water.

"
"Ay, caramba! Poor Phineas!  Let's see... half of 200 yards is 100 yards.  He hops that 100 yards at 20 yards a minute, so that's 5 minutes. Then he swims the other 100 yards at 10 yards a minute, taking him 10 minutes.  

Add those together, and it takes Phineas 15 minutes to get home.

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's figure this out. Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks, and each box has 8. So he needs 56 divided by 8, which is 7 boxes.  If each box costs $2.00, then 7 boxes will cost 7 times $2.00, which is $14.00. 


$14.00
"
"Ay, caramba! Let me see... the main phone is $20, and the other four are half that price, so each one is $10.  That means the extra phones cost $40 all together.  So the whole plan is $20 plus $40, which is $60.

"Ay, Derrick's makin' some serious dough!  He makes 10 dozen doughnuts a day, that's 120 doughnuts!  Sellin' them for $2 a pop, he's makin' $240 every day.  June has 30 days, so that's $240 times 30, which comes out to $7200.  

That's a lot of pesos! 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Jade uploads 7 photos per batch, and she does 6 batches a day, so that's 7 * 6 = 42 photos every day.  To upload all 210 photos, it'll take her 210 / 42 = 5 days.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Alicia's dry cleaning bill each week is:

* 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00
* 2 pants * $8.00/pant = $16.00
* 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00

That's a total of $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00 per week.

Over 5 weeks, she'd spend $47.00/week * 5 weeks = $235.00.


$235.00 

"
"Ay, amigo! So John's a speed talker now, eh?  Let's see... he starts at 150 words per minute, but after training, he's zippin' along at 2.5 times that speed. That's 375 words per minute!

Now, he's got 10 pages to get through, and each page has 450 words. That's a total of 4500 words.

To figure out how long it takes, we divide the total words by his speed: 4500 words / 375 words per minute = 12 minutes.

So, it'll take him 12 minutes to blaze through those pages!

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Conor saw 50 people on the first day, then 50 + 20 = 70 people on the second day. On the third day, there were 70 * 2 = 140 people. For the rest of the week, he saw 60 people each day for 4 days, so that's 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Adding it all up: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 people.

So Conor saw a total of 500 people at the beach that week. 



"
"Ay, caramba! This popcorn is poppin' like crazy! Let's see... 20 kernels first, then triple that, so 60 more. Then four times the first amount, that's 80!  Then half that in the last 30 seconds, so 40. And finally, 10 more from the leftover heat.  

Add it all up, and Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to munch on! 



"
"Ay, caramba! This lemonade situation sounds like a fiesta!  Let's see... 4 gallons of regular lemonade need 24 lemons (that's 6 lemons per gallon).  And for Allen's extra tart gallon, we need double the lemons, so that's 12 more.  In total, Tim needs 36 lemons to make everyone happy!

"
"Ay, chihuahua! Let's see... three German Shepherds eatin' 5 kilos each, that's 15 kilos right there. Two Bulldogs chowin' down on 3 kilos each, that's another 6 kilos. So, that's 21 kilos a day!  Now, a week has seven days, so multiply that 21 kilos by 7... that's 147 kilos of dog food they'll need for the whole week!

"
"Hey there! Let me see... 10 animals with two legs have 20 legs total (10 times 2). The 15 animals with four legs have 60 legs (15 times 4).  That means there are 80 legs in total on the farm! 


80
"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... 32 blocks total, 4 blue ones, and twice that many yellow, eh? That's 8 yellow blocks. So that's 12 blue and yellow together.  That leaves 32 - 12 = 20 red blocks! 


20
"
"Ay, amigo! Let's see... Elvis drove west for 5 hours at 18 mph, so that's 5 times 18, which is 90 miles. Then he drove east for 8 hours at 18 mph, so that's 8 times 18, which is 144 miles.  

Since he drove further east, we subtract the westward distance: 144 minus 90 equals 54 miles.

So Elvis is 54 miles east of his house. 



"
"Ay, caramba! That's a tough one. Let me see...

So, the boat starts at $9000.  The first year it loses 30%, which is $2700. That leaves it at $6300.

The second year, another 30% goes, which is $1890. Now it's worth $4410.

Finally, the third year it loses 20%, or $882. That means after three years, the boat is worth $3528. 


$3528
"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... 232 candies total, eh?  54 are red, double that is orange, so that's 108 orange. Half the red candies are yellow, so that's 27 yellow.  Add those up: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.  

Subtract that from the total to find the pink ones: 232 - 189 = 43.

There are **43** pink candies. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So Helen stayed in the hotel for 3 nights at $80 a night, which means the hotel cost her 3 * $80 = $240.

Each bus ride cost 10% of the hotel price, so each ride was $80 * 0.10 = $8. Since she took 7 bus rides, that's a total of $8 * 7 = $56 for the bus.

Adding the hotel and bus costs together, Helen spent $240 + $56 = $296 on her trip.

"
"¡Hola! Let's figure this out. Mazie started with 52 marbles, and Dallas ended up with 21 after losing some. That means Dallas had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles from Mazie.

"Ay, caramba! That's a heavy situation for John!  Let's see... the car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage is 250 pounds, and his two little ones are 75 pounds each. That's 150 pounds for the kids.  So, all together, that's 1600 pounds.  

Now, if he needs 1% of the weight to move it, that's 16 pounds.  

¡Buena suerte, John! 



"
"Ay, amigo!  To figure out how much crepe paper James needs, we gotta think about the whole fence. It's like a big rectangle, right?  We need enough streamer to go all the way around.  

So, the long side is 20 feet, and the short side is 15 feet.  Add those together, then multiply by 2, and that's how many feet of crepe paper James needs!

20 + 15 = 35
35 x 2 = 70

He needs 70 feet of crepe paper!

"
"Ay, those floods were terrible.  Poor families.  Let's see, Mamou started with 1360 meals and gave out 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals. That means she has 1360 - 142 = 1218 meals left. 

1218

"
"Hey there! Let me see... two brothers and three sisters, huh?  The sisters are all 16, and one brother is 12, which is half the older brother's age.  So the older brother is 24.  That means all the sisters together are 48 years old (16 x 3).  Adding it all up, the total age of all the siblings is 84!

"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... Anne is double Albert's height, so she's 36"" * 2 = 72"" tall. Jackie is a little shorter than Anne, by 2 inches, so she's 72"" - 2"" = 70"" now. But she grew 3 inches over the summer, so before that she was 70"" - 3"" = 67"" tall.

"Ay, amigo! Let's see... they make 5000 chocolate bars a day and sell them for $2 each. That's $10,000 a day! In a week, that's $70,000.  And over two weeks?  That's a sweet $140,000! 


$140000 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Jake spent.

Those T-shirts are a good deal! Since he gets one half off, the second one costs $8 / 2 = $4.  So the shirts cost $8 + $4 = $12 total.

The shoes are 40% off, which is a savings of $40 * 0.40 = $16. That means the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Adding it all up, Jake spends $12 + $24 = $36 at the store.


$36 

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see here... Ryan made $6 a week for three weeks, so that's $6 x 3 = $18. Then he spent $1.25 on each of his four ice cream cones, which is $1.25 x 4 = $5.  That leaves him with $18 - $5 = $13.  Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"
"Ay, caramba! Let's see... Ellen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a frame, so that's $105. Lani got sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each, so that's $30 + $200, which is $230.  Adding those together, they spent a total of $105 + $230 = $335.

"Ay, amigo! Let's break down this honey and jam business.

So, each jar costs $12 for passion fruit, $12 for jackfruit, and $20 for honey, making a total of $44 per jar. He sells each jar for $50, so he makes a profit of $6 per jar.

Selling 10 jars, he'd make a sweet profit of $60!

"Ay, amigo! Let's see what we got here. 

Thirty-two quarters is like having eight dollars right there. Then we got ninety-five dimes, that's nine dollars and fifty cents. One hundred twenty nickels, that's six bucks. And finally, seven hundred fifty pennies, which is seven dollars and fifty cents.

"
"Hey there! Let's see... Matthew's got 12 toy soldiers. Half of them, that's 6, would sell for $5 each, so that's 6 times 5, which is $30. The other 6 would sell for $7 each, so that's 6 times 7, which is $42.  Add those together, and Matthew would make $72! 



"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see... the dog digs a lot of holes, eh? 

So, 6 holes a day for 14 days... that's 84 holes in total.  But Nate fills 9 holes a day, and the dog digs 6 more each night. So, Nate is really filling 3 holes a day (9 - 6 = 3).

To fill all 84 holes, it'll take him 28 days (84 / 3 = 28).  That's 4 weeks!

"Ay, caramba! This Igor, he's a real piece of work! Let's see... Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, but Igor only brought 8. He got 16 Petri dishes instead of 14, and he had the right number of beakers, 7.  But he only put 29 things on the bench in total.  Hmm... that means he must have lost some beakers on the way.  

Let me see... 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes + 7 beakers = 31.  He was supposed to have 37 things, so he lost 37 - 29 = 8 things.  But he only brought 8 fewer test tubes than Dr. Grumpus wanted, so he didn't lose any beakers! 

Igor is lucky Dr. Grumpus is so patient!

"Ay, amigo! Let me break this down for you.

That vendor made a good deal! He bought those watermelons for $80 and sold them for a 25% profit. That means he made an extra $20! So, he sold all 50 watermelons for $100.

To find out how much each one cost, we just divide: $100 / 50 watermelons = $2 per watermelon.
