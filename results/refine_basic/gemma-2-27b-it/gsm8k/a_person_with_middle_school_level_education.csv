"Okay, so Janet starts with 16 eggs. She eats 3 and uses 4 for muffins, so that's 3 + 4 = 7 eggs gone.  That leaves her with 16 - 7 = 9 eggs to sell.

If she sells each egg for $2, she makes 9 * $2 = $18 at the market.


$18 

"
"Okay, so the robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber.  Then it needs half of that for white fiber, which is 1 bolt.  So in total, it needs 2 + 1 = 3 bolts.

"
"Okay, so Josh spent $80,000 on the house and then another $50,000 fixing it up. That's a total of $130,000 spent.

The repairs made the house worth 150% more, which means it's now worth 1.5 times what it was before. So, it went up in value by $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.

That means the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

If he sells it for $200,000 and spent $130,000, he made a profit of $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.


$70,000 

"
"Okay, so James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week.  And each sprint is 60 meters.  Hmm... let's see...

He runs 3 sprints * 3 days = 9 sprints a week.

Then 9 sprints * 60 meters each = 540 meters!

So he runs 540 meters a week. 



"
"Okay, so Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of food a day, and she already gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon.  That's 40 cups total.

If she has 20 chickens and they each need 3 cups, she needs 60 cups in total.

So, she needs to give them 20 more cups in the last meal. 


20 

"
"Okay, so Kylar's buying a bunch of glasses.  Every other one is cheaper, which is cool.  

Let's see... 16 glasses means he's getting 8 pairs. Each pair has one regular price glass for $5 and one on sale for 60% of $5.  

60% of $5 is $3, so each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8.

Since he's getting 8 pairs, it'll cost him $8 x 8 = $64.


$64 

"
"Okay, so Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has four times that amount, so they have 20 * 4 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, meaning they have 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.  

To find the total, we add up the sheep from all three places: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.



"
"Okay, so Carla starts downloading this huge file, right? It's 200 GB, which is like, a lot! She usually downloads 2 GB every minute.  

But then, ugh, Windows decides to update itself after she's already downloaded 40% of the file. That's 80 GB, I think?  

The update takes 20 minutes, and then she has to start all over again. So, she downloads the first 80 GB in 40 minutes (80 divided by 2). Then she has to download the rest, which is 120 GB, which takes another 60 minutes (120 divided by 2).

So, in total, it takes her 40 minutes + 20 minutes (for the update) + 60 minutes = 120 minutes to download the whole thing.


120 

"
"Okay, so John drives 60 miles an hour for 3 hours, that's 60 x 3 = 180 miles. Then he has to turn around and go back.

He's stuck in traffic for 2 hours, so he doesn't go anywhere during that time. Then he drives slow for half an hour, which is 30 miles per hour times 0.5 hours, so that's 15 miles.

He has 1.5 hours left to drive fast, and he's going 80 miles per hour, so that's 1.5 x 80 = 120 miles.

So in total, he drives 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles back home.

Since he drove 180 miles out and 135 miles back, he's 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home. 


45
"
"Okay, so Eliza makes $10 an hour for her first 40 hours. That's $400 right there (40 x 10 = 400).

Then she gets paid extra for the extra 5 hours.  That's called overtime.  It's 1.2 times her normal pay, so $12 an hour (10 x 1.2 = 12).

So her overtime pay is 5 hours times $12 an hour, which is $60 (5 x 12 = 60).

Add that to her regular pay and she made $460 this week (400 + 60 = 460).


$460 

"
"Okay, so the program got 60 downloads the first month. Then it got three times that much the next month, which is 60 times 3, or 180 downloads. But then the third month it went down by 30%, so we gotta figure out 30% of 180.  That's like 180 divided by 10, which is 18, and then times 3, which is 54. So it lost 54 downloads. That means the third month had 180 minus 54, which is 126 downloads.

To find the total, we add up all the downloads: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.



"
"Okay, so Toula bought a lot of yummy stuff! Let's see...

* Donuts: 3 dozens times $68 each is $204.
* Cupcakes: 2 dozens times $80 each is $160.
* Cheesecakes: 6 dozens times $55 each is $330.

Now, add it all up: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

So the total cost was $694. 



"
"Okay, so the tree costs $90 at first.  Then every year he makes $10.50 from selling lemons (7 lemons x $1.50 each) but it costs $3 to take care of it. So he makes $7.50 each year ($10.50 - $3.00).  

To figure out how long it takes to make back the $90, we divide: $90 / $7.50 = 12 years.


12 

"
"Okay, so Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.  Let's think backwards.

She sold half her vacuums at the orange house, so before that she had 5 x 2 = 10 vacuums.

Then she sold 2 to the red house, so she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuums.

Finally, she sold a third of her vacuums at the green house. That means the 12 vacuums represent two-thirds of her starting amount.

To find the original amount, we can think: if 12 is two-thirds, then one-third is 12 / 2 = 6 vacuums.

So, she started with 6 x 3 = 18 vacuums! 



"
"Okay, so 20% of the class likes contemporary dance, which is 20 students times 0.20, that's 4 students.  That leaves 16 students. Then 25% of those like jazz, so that's 16 times 0.25, which is 4 more students.  That means 12 students like hip-hop.  

So, 12 out of 20 students like hip-hop, which is 60%.


60 

"
"Okay, so the jewelry will go up by 2.5% of $5000, which is like 2.5 out of every 100 dollars.  That's $125 more!

The gadgets go up by 1.2% of $8000, which is like 1.2 out of every 100 dollars. That's $96 more.

So, the jewelry will make him more money. He should buy the jewelry!

The profit would be $125. 



"
"Okay, so the trains each go 80 miles one way and then 150 miles another way.  To find the total distance, you just add those together: 80 + 150 = 230 miles.


230 

"
"Okay, so Jill makes $20 each hour teaching and she teaches for 35 hours every week. That's 20 times 35, which is $700.  She also makes $30 an hour coaching for 15 hours a week. So that's 30 times 15, which is $450.

To find out how much she makes in a week, we add those together: $700 + $450 = $1150.

Now, there are 50 weeks in a year, so we multiply her weekly earnings by 50: $1150 times 50 is $57,500.

So her yearly salary is $57,500. 



"
"Okay, so she eats 3 eggs every day, and there are 7 days in a week, so that's 3 x 7 = 21 eggs a week.  

Then over 4 weeks, she eats 21 x 4 = 84 eggs.

A dozen has 12 eggs, so she eats 84 / 12 = 7 dozen eggs.


7 

"
"Okay, so Marissa wants to hike 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.  She already walked 6 miles in 2 hours. That means she has 6 miles left to go and only 1 hour to do it! To figure out how fast she needs to go, we divide the distance left (6 miles) by the time left (1 hour).  

So, she needs to walk at 6 miles per hour. 



"
"Okay, so we start with 10 liters of orange drink, and two-thirds of it is water, so that's 10 times (2/3) which is 6.67 liters of water.

Then we have 15 liters of pineapple drink, and three-fifths of that is water, so that's 15 times (3/5) which is 9 liters of water.

Oops, I spilled a liter of the orange drink, so now there's only 9 liters left.

Now we add up the water: 6.67 liters from the orange drink plus 9 liters from the pineapple drink equals 15.67 liters of water in total.


15.67 

"
"Okay, so Samantha is 31 and her cousin Raymond is older by 6 years, making him 37. Raymond had his son when he was 23, so his son is 37 - 23 = 14 years old.  That means Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.


14 

"
"Okay, so Billy sold DVDs to some of his customers.  Let's see... the first three people each bought one, so that's 3 DVDs. Then two more people bought two DVDs each, so that's 4 more.  

That means he sold a total of 7 DVDs. 


7
"
"Okay, so the candle burns for four hours. And it gets shorter by 2 centimeters every hour.  So, you gotta multiply 2 by 4, which is 8.

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter. 

"
"Okay, so the book is 25% off, which means Kyle paid 75% of the original price.  If $19.50 is 75%, we gotta figure out what 100% is.  

To do that, we can think of it like this:

* If 75% is $19.50, then 1% is $19.50 divided by 75.

*  $19.50 / 75 = $0.26

*  Since 1% is $0.26, then 100% (the whole price) is $0.26 times 100.

* $0.26 x 100 = $26.00


So the original price was $26.00. 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Marie spent $12 on chicken and $15 on milk. She also spent $6 on apples. That's a total of $33 so far.

If she paid $50 in total, that means she spent $17 on pizza ($50 - $33 = $17).

Each pizza box costs $8.50, so she must have bought 2 boxes ($17 / $8.50 = 2). 


2 

"
"Okay, so Mishka bought a bunch of clothes. Let's see... 3 pairs of shorts cost 3 times $16.50, which is $49.50.  The pants were $22.50 each, and she got 3 pairs, so that's $67.50.  And the shoes were $42 each, times 3, so that's $126.00.  

If we add all that up: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00


$243.00
"
"Okay, so Cynthia eats ice cream every day, and each carton has enough for 15 days.  If she eats it for 60 days, that's 60 / 15 = 4 cartons of ice cream.

Since each carton costs $4.00, she'll spend 4 * $4.00 = $16.00 on ice cream.


$16.00 

"
"Okay, so Henry biked 60 miles total. He stopped at 20 miles, then again 15 miles before the finish line.  That means his second stop was at 60 - 15 = 45 miles.  

So, he biked 45 - 20 = 25 miles between his stops.


25 

"
"Okay, so the cheaper heels cost $33. The other heels cost double that, so they're $33 x 2 = $66.  Together, the heels cost $33 + $66 = $99.

But the boots cost $5 more than that, so they're $99 + $5 = $104.


$104 

"
"Okay, so Darrell and Allen's ages are like a recipe, right?  It's 7 parts Darrell to 11 parts Allen.  And we know their total age is 162, like the total ingredients.

To figure out how much one ""part"" is, we divide their total age by the total parts: 162 / (7 + 11) = 162 / 18 = 9.

So, Darrell is 7 * 9 = 63 years old, and Allen is 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.


109 

"
"Okay, so Gunter's first friend guesses 80 jelly beans. The second friend says 20 more than half of that, so half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60. The third friend says 25% more than the first friend, so that's 80 times 0.25 which is 20, and then 20 more than 80 is 100.

To find the average, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Then we divide by 3 because there are three guesses: 240 / 3 = 80. 

So the average guess is 80. 



"
"Okay, so John has 10 dogs and each one takes half an hour to walk and stuff.  That's 5 hours a day just for walking all of them!  Since there are 7 days in a week, he spends 5 times 7, which is 35 hours a week taking care of those pups. 


35 

"
"Okay, so Gretchen has 110 coins total.  We know she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  

Hmm, let's see... if we take away those extra 30 gold coins, she'd have the same number of gold and silver coins. That means she'd have 110 coins / 2 = 55 of each.

But remember, she has 30 more gold coins! So she has 55 + 30 = 85 gold coins.


Answer: 85 

"
"Okay, so Raymond has 40 jewels.  Aaron has 5 more than half of that, so half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20.  Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels. Siobhan has 2 fewer than Aaron, so she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.


23 

"
"Okay, so Mike scores 4 points in the first part of the game. Then he gets even better and scores 25% more in the second part.  That means he scores 1 extra point (because 4 times 0.25 is 1). So in the second part, he scores 5 points.  

That means he scored a total of 9 points! 



"
"Okay, so Terry eats 2 yogurts every day, and that's 60 yogurts in a month.  The yogurts are $5 for every 4, so he needs 15 of those packs. That means he spends 15 times $5, which is $75.00. 


$75.00
"
"Okay, so John sells his Legos for $15 each and he has 13 of them. That means he made 13 times 15, which is $195.  He spends $20 on each video game and buys 8, so that's 8 times 20, or $160. He also has $5 left over, so before buying games he had $160 + $5 = $165.

That means he sold enough Legos to make $165, so he sold $165 divided by $15 per Lego, which is 11 Legos.

If he started with 13 and sold 11, he has 13 - 11 = 2 Legos left.


2 

"
"Okay, so John runs a lot!  He runs 60 miles every week, but only runs 3 days.  On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. The other two days he runs half as long, so that's 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

That means he runs 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 3 hours on the shorter days.

So in total, he runs 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours a week.

To find out how fast he runs, we divide the total miles by the total time: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

He runs 10 miles per hour! 


10
"
"Okay, so Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half as fast as she runs.  That means she runs at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

She walks four times slower than she runs, so she walks at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

She runs for one-third of the six hours, which is 6 / 3 = 2 hours. That means she runs 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

She walks for two-thirds of the time, which is 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours.  That means she walks 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

In total, she travels 12 + 6 = 18 miles. 


18
"
"Okay, so Suzy's phone is 1 year old. Ben's phone is twice as old as Suzy's, so it's 1 times 2 which is 2 years old. Brandon's phone is four times as old as Ben's, so it's 2 times 4 which is 8 years old. 

8 

"
"Okay, so Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet normally. But with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, which is 400 times 3, or 1200 feet! The dragon's fire only reaches 1000 feet, so she can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away and still hit it.


200 

"
"Okay, so Grandma made 5 pies and each pie had 8 slices, so that's 5 times 8 which is 40 slices in total.  If there were 14 slices left, then the guests ate 40 minus 14, which is 26 slices.


26 

"
"Okay, so the bag has 5 servings and each serving is 250 calories. That means the whole bag is 250 x 5 = 1250 calories.

You can only have 200 more calories today, right?  So, you can only eat part of a serving.

Let's see... 200 calories is less than a whole serving, so you can eat less than 60 grams.  Hmm, I'd say you could probably eat around 48 grams. 



"
"Okay, so Charlie makes 10 candles from each pound of beeswax. He needs enough to make 20 candles, so that's 2 pounds of beeswax.  Each pound costs $10.00, so 2 pounds cost him $20.00. If he sells each candle for $2.00, he'll make $40.00 from selling all 20.  

If he takes how much he made ($40.00) and takes away how much he spent ($20.00), he'll have $20.00 left over. That's his profit!


$20.00 

"
"Okay, so Meredith writes a lot of blog posts!  

Let's see... she writes 5 on Monday. Then on Tuesday, she writes 2/5 more than that, which is like 2 extra articles, so she writes 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she writes double the amount from Tuesday, so that's 7 x 2 = 14 articles.

In total, she writes 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours, she spends 26 x 4 = 104 hours writing. 


104 

"
"Okay, so Candice started with 80 sticky notes. Then she used 220 at work.  That's a total of 80 + 220 = 300 sticky notes.  If she had 23 left over, she must have bought 300 - 23 = 277 sticky notes.


277 

"
"Okay, so John got twice as many red ties as blue ones.  He spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie was $40. That means he bought $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.

Since he got twice as many red ties, he got 5 * 2 = 10 red ties.

Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so they cost $40 + ($40 * 0.50) = $60 each.

So, the red ties cost him 10 * $60 = $600.

In total, he spent $200 + $600 = $800 on ties.


$800
"
"Okay, so Tracy has 4 feet of wire, which is the same as 48 inches.  She cuts the wire into pieces that are 6 inches long.  To find out how many pieces she gets, we just need to divide the total length by the length of each piece: 48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces. 


8 

"
"Okay, so there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 apartments, that's 15 times 8 which is 120 apartments in total.  If 3/4 of them are full, then 1/4 are empty.  That means 120 divided by 4 is 30 empty apartments.


30 

"
"Okay, so Lloyd gets 252 eggs every day.  That's a lot of eggs!  If he sells them for $2 a dozen, let's see... there are 12 eggs in a dozen, so he makes 252 / 12 = 21 dozens of eggs each day.

That means he makes 21 * $2 = $42 each day.

In a week, he makes $42 * 7 = $294. 


294 

"
"Okay, so Tom sails for three hours at 10 miles per hour, so he goes 30 miles (10 x 3 = 30).  Then he has to go back 30 miles, but this time he's going slower, only 6 miles per hour.  

To find out how long that takes, we do 30 miles divided by 6 miles per hour, which equals 5 hours.


5 

"
"Okay, so Uriah needs to take out 15 pounds total. His comic books weigh a quarter pound each, and he's getting rid of 30 of them. That's 30 times 0.25, which is 7.5 pounds.  

That means he still needs to take out 7.5 more pounds. His toys weigh half a pound each, so he needs to take out 7.5 divided by 0.5, which is 15 toys.


15 

"
"Okay, so the mechanic makes $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire.

On Thursday, he fixed 6 truck tires, so that's 6 * $60 = $360. He also fixed 4 car tires, which is 4 * $40 = $160.  So on Thursday, he made $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, he only fixed car tires, 12 of them. That's 12 * $40 = $480.

To see how much more he made on the busier day, we do $520 - $480 = $40.


So the answer is $40. 

"
"Okay, so they brought home 7 kittens. Then their cats had babies! Patchy had three times the number of adopted kittens, so that's 7 x 3 = 21 kittens. Trixie had 12 kittens.  

So in total, they have 21 + 12 = 33 kittens from their cats, plus the 7 they already had. That means they have 33 + 7 = 40 kittens! 

40 

"
"Okay, so Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, leaving her with 28.  Since she puts 2 lollipops in each bag, she can make 14 bags. 


14
"
"Okay, so Peter spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, which means each movie costs him $14.  If he has $42, he can go to the movies 3 times. 



"
"Okay, so the truck can hold a total of 5000 pounds, but the truck and driver already weigh 3755 pounds. That means there's 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds left for the boxes.

Each box weighs 15 pounds, so we can fit 1245 / 15 = 83 boxes on the truck. 


83
"
"Okay, so Stephen's groceries cost $40.00. Then they added a fee of 25%, which is like a quarter of the price, so that's $40.00 / 4 = $10.00.  

Then they added $3.00 for delivery, so now it's $40.00 + $10.00 + $3.00 = $53.00.

Finally, he tipped $4.00, so the total is $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.


$57.00 

"
"Okay, so there are 6 groups of raspberries with 20 in each group. That's 6 times 20, which is 120 raspberries. Then there are 67 more raspberries just hanging out on the bush.  So, 120 plus 67 is... 187 raspberries! 



"
"Okay, so there are 25 oranges total. One is bad, 5 are unripe (20% of 25), and 2 are sour.  That means there are 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges that aren't good.

If 8 are bad, then 25 - 8 = 17 oranges are good! 


17 

"
"Okay, so Janet spent $500 on stuff for the brooch and then another $800 to have someone make it. That's $500 + $800 = $1300.

Then she had to pay 10% for insurance.  10% of $1300 is $130 (I did that in my head!).

So, all together she spent $1300 + $130 = $1430.


$1430 

"
"Okay, so Marcy works for a long time, right? 40 years gets you a good pension!  But she gets extra money after 20 years.  

She quits after 30, so she gets the extra money for 10 years. That extra money is 5% of her regular pension, which is $50,000. So that's $50,000 times 0.05, which is $2,500 extra each year.

So, her total pension is $50,000 plus $2,500, which is $52,500.


$52,500 

"
"Okay, so Aleena pays $140 each month for the first six months. That's $140 times 6, which is $840.

Then her price goes down by 10%, so she saves $14 each month ($140 times 0.10). That means she pays $126 each month for the last six months.

So for the last six months, she pays $126 times 6, which is $756.

To find the total, we add the cost of the first six months and the last six months: $840 + $756 = $1596.


$1596
"
"Okay, so Sophia drove 100 miles and needed 4 gallons to fill her tank back up. That means her car gets 25 miles per gallon (100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 MPG).  Her gas tank holds 12 gallons, so she can drive 300 miles on a full tank (25 MPG * 12 gallons = 300 miles).


300 

"
"Okay, so Jim watches TV for 2 hours. Then he reads for 1 hour because that's half the time he watches TV.  So that's 2 + 1 = 3 hours a day.

He does this 3 times a week, so that's 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours a week.

Over 4 weeks, he spends 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

"Okay, so each school has 2 teams with 5 players each, so that's 10 players per school.  And then there are 2 coaches per school too. So that's 12 people from each school. Since there are 4 schools, we do 12 times 4, which is 48.


48 

"
"Okay, so there were 175 diamonds.  There were 35 less rubies than diamonds, so there were 175 - 35 = 140 rubies. There were twice as many emeralds as rubies, so there were 140 * 2 = 280 emeralds.  To find the total, we add them all up: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 gems.


595 

"
"Okay, so there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls. That means there are 60 * 2 = 120 boys.  

That's a lot of boys!  

So there are 120 + 60 = 180 students total.

If there are 5 students for every teacher, then there are 180 / 5 = 36 teachers.


36 

"
"Okay, so Bailey got $5 every week for 8 weeks, which is $5 x 8 = $40.  If she has $100 now, she must have started with $100 - $40 = $60.


$60 

"
"Okay, so Judy teaches a lot of dance classes! Let's see... she teaches 5 classes each day from Monday to Friday, so that's 5 times 5 which is 25 classes. Then she teaches 8 more on Saturday.  So in total, she teaches 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so that's 33 times 15, which is 495 students in total.

If each student pays $15, then she makes 495 times 15 dollars, which is $7425.00! 


$7425.00
"
"Okay, so the first recipe has 20 steps. The second one has twice that, so it has 20 * 2 = 40 steps.  To make both dishes, Kelian needs to read 20 + 40 = 60 steps.


60 

"
"Okay, so Tommy sells brownies for $3 each and he sold 43 of them. That's 43 times 3, which is $129.  He sells cheesecake for $4 a slice and sold 23 slices. So that's 23 times 4, which is $92.  To find out how much he made in total, we add the brownie money and the cheesecake money: $129 + $92 = $221.


$221
"
"Okay, so Shiela bought 5 phones at $150 each, so that's 5 times 150, which is $750.  

But there's also a 2% interest for each phone, so that's 2% of 150, which is $3 for each phone. Since she bought 5 phones, the total interest is $3 times 5, which is $15.

So, in total, she has to pay $750 plus $15, which is $765.

Now, she's paying this over 3 months, so we divide $765 by 3, which is $255 each month.



"
"Okay, so Artie's selling flowers for about $2 or $3 a pot since he's rounding.

* He sells a bunch of marigolds, 12 pots, and those are like $3 each, so that's 12 times 3, which is 36 bucks.
* Petunias are cheaper, $2 each, and he sells 9 of those, so that's 9 times 2, which is 18 bucks.
* Then he's got begonias, 17 of them at $2 each, so that's 17 times 2, which is 34 bucks.

If you add all that up, 36 plus 18 plus 34, he makes 88 dollars! 



"
"Okay, so the top level is 16 square feet, and each level below is double the size.  That means the level below the top is 16 times 2, which is 32 square feet. The level below that is 32 times 2, so that's 64 square feet. And the bottom level is 64 times 2, which is 128 square feet.

To find the average, we add up all the levels: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

Then we divide that by the number of levels, which is 4: 240 divided by 4 is 60.

So the average square footage of a level is 60. 



"
"Okay, so Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 1 cup of food a day for the first 180 days, that's like half a year.  Then it's 2 cups a day for the rest of the year.  

A bag has 110 cups, so let's see... 180 days is a lot of cups!  

Hmm,  I'd need a calculator for that.  

*grabs calculator and does some math*

Okay, so she needs 5 bags of food for the whole year. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Sarah does a lot of laundry, 400 pounds! Raymond does half of what Sarah does, so he does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds. David does way less, only a fourth of what Sarah does, so he does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.  That means Raymond does 200 - 100 = 100 more pounds of laundry than David.


100 

"
"Okay, so Vincent wants to get the best deal on flowers.  

If he buys the packs of 3, that's 18 flowers / 3 flowers per pack = 6 packs. That'll cost him 6 packs * $2.50 per pack = $15.00

If he buys the packs of 2, he needs 18 flowers / 2 flowers per pack = 9 packs. That's 9 packs * $1.00 per pack = $9.00

He saves $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00 by buying the packs of 2!


$6.00 

"
"Okay, so the groomer costs $100, but John gets 30% off because he's new.  That means he saves $30 (cause 30% of 100 is 30). So the grooming costs $70.


$70
"
"Okay, so they started with 24 liters.  The girls each got 1/6 of that, which is 4 liters.  So together they took 8 liters (4 x 2). Then the boy got 6 liters. That's a total of 14 liters used up (8 + 6).  

If they started with 24 and used 14, there's 10 liters left. 


10 

"
"Okay, so Charlie starts with 10 stickers. Then he gets a bunch more - 21 from the store and 23 for his birthday!  That's 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers.

But then he gives some to his sister (9) and uses some for a card (28). So we gotta take those away: 54 - 9 - 28 = 17

Charlie has 17 stickers left. 



"
"Okay, so Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 4 times Grace's weight minus 2 pounds, so that's 4 * 125 = 500 pounds, and then 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.  To find their combined weight, we add their weights together: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.


623 

"
"Okay, so Dan has 3 rose bushes, and each one has 25 roses. That's 3 times 25, which is 75 roses in total.  Each rose has 8 thorns, so we need to multiply 75 by 8.  That gives us 600 thorns! 



"
"Okay, so they played 22 games total.  And they won 8 more games than they lost.  Hmm... let me think.  

If we think of it like, if they lost zero games, they would have won 22. But they lost some, so they won 8 *more* than that.

So they won 22 - 8 = 14 games.

Wait, no, that's not right. If they lost zero games, they'd win 22.  But they lost some, so they won 8 *more* than that.

So they won 22 + 8 = 30 games. 


Answer: 30 

"
"Okay, so Gene goes on 4 vacations every year, and he's been doing that since he was 23.  He's 34 now, so that's 34 - 23 = 11 years of vacations.

That means he's been on 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations!

So he has 44 quilt blocks. 


44
"
"Okay, so Greg's alarm is annoying!  

First, it rings 4 times. Then it rings 3 times longer than that, so that's 4 times * 3 = 12 times.

The last time it rings for half as long as the second time, which is 12 times / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total, we add up all the times it rings: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times. 


22 

"
"Okay, so Sylvie gets a raise every year after working at the company for five years.  It's 10% of what she made before.

* First year after five years, she gets $60 extra ($600 times 0.10). So she makes $660.
* The next year, she gets another 10% raise, which is $66 ($660 times 0.10). Now she makes $726.
* One more year, she gets another $72.60 raise ($726 times 0.10). That brings her to $798.60.


So after three more years, Sylvie makes $798.60 a month. 

"
"Okay, so Harald sold way less than Marilyn.  If they sold 88,000 together and Marilyn sold 10 times more than him, let's think about it like this:

Imagine Harald sold 1 copy. Marilyn would have sold 10 copies. That's a total of 11 copies.

So, if they sold 88,000 copies, we need to figure out how many times bigger 88,000 is than 11.

88,000 divided by 11 is 8,000.

That means Harald sold 8,000 copies.


8000
"
"Okay, so Christina invited 16 friends, but some might not come. She figures only 3 out of every 4 friends will actually be there.  That means 16 friends times 3/4 equals 12 friends will probably show up.

She needs 3/4 of a gift bag for each friend, so that's 12 friends times 0.75, which is 9 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2, so 9 gift bags times $2 each is $18.


$18 

"
"Okay, so each grown-up dino eats 10 pounds of potato salad.  There are 20 grown-ups, so that's 20 times 10, which is 200 pounds.

Little dinos eat half as much, so they eat 5 pounds each. With 5 little dinos, that's 5 times 5, which is 25 pounds.

To get the total, we add the grown-up salad and the little dino salad: 200 plus 25 is 225 pounds.

Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad! 



"
"Okay, so Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Jan has three times the pets Marcia has, so Jan has 6 x 3 = 18 pets.  

To find the total, we add up all the pets: 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.


28 

"
"Okay, so James is 10 and Corey is one year older, making Corey 11. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so she's 9.  Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson must be 4. 


4
"
"Okay, so Lee is super fast and runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Gerald is a little slower, like 2 seconds slower than Lee.  That means Gerald takes 40 seconds.

But Gerald started eating healthier and got 10% faster!  

To find out how much faster, we do 40 seconds times 0.10, which is 4 seconds.

So Gerald takes off 4 seconds from his old time: 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.


36 

"
"Okay, so there are 60 dogs.  And for every dog, there are 2 cats, so that's 60 * 2 = 120 cats.

That means there are 60 + 120 = 180 dogs and cats altogether.

The problem says there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

To find the total number of pets, we add up all the animals: 168 rabbits + 180 dogs and cats = 348 pets.


348 

"
"Okay, so there are 200 kids in total.  Two-fifths of them are boys, so that's 200 divided by 5 times 2, which is 80 boys. That means there are 120 girls.

Two-thirds of the girls are in Girl Scouts, so that's 120 divided by 3 times 2, which is 80 girls.  

That means 120 minus 80 equals 40 girls aren't in Girl Scouts.


40 

"
"Okay, so James slept for two-thirds of the time Harry did. That means James slept for (2/3) * 9 hours = 6 hours.  Harry slept 3 more hours than James because 9 - 6 = 3.


3 

"
"Okay, so Freda's sauce is half the size of the tomatoes she starts with.  She made 32 ounces of sauce, and each can makes 8 ounces, so she used 32 / 8 = 4 cans.  Each can has 3 tomatoes, so she used 4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes.


12 

"
"Okay, so there were 30 cars at first, and 5 took a different way out. That leaves 25 cars. Then 20 cars went through the jam in the last 15 minutes.  So, 25 - 20 = 5 cars must have gone through in the first 15 minutes. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Mary starts with 2 plants on each of her 40 window ledges, that's 2 * 40 = 80 plants. Then she gets 18 more, so she has 80 + 18 = 98 plants. But she gives one plant from each ledge away, so that's 40 plants she gives away.  That leaves her with 98 - 40 = 58 plants.


58 

"
"Okay, so Jerome's first friend rang the doorbell 20 times. His second friend rang it 5 more times than that, so that's 20 + 5 = 25 times. The third friend rang it 10 more times than the fourth friend, who rang it 60 times. So the third friend rang it 60 + 10 = 70 times.  

To find the total, we add up all the rings: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 rings. 


175 

"
"Okay, so Solo has to read a bunch of pages from different books. Let's see... 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 equals 39 pages total. He already read 15, so he has 39 - 15 = 24 pages left.  He has 4 days to finish, so he needs to read 24 / 4 = 6 pages each day.


6 

"
"Okay, so John drinks water with every meal, that's like 4 glasses a day on weekdays.  And he does that for 5 days, so that's 20 glasses. On the weekend he skips the water at dinner, so he only drinks 3 glasses a day times 2 days, which is 6 glasses.  

So, 20 plus 6 is 26 glasses! 


26
"
"Okay, so the fog goes 3 miles every 10 minutes.  The whole city is 42 miles across.  

Hmm, let's see... 42 divided by 3 is 14. So the fog has to travel 14 of those 3-mile stretches.

If each stretch takes 10 minutes, then 14 stretches would take 14 times 10 minutes, which is 140 minutes.


140 

"
"Okay, so Poppy puts down 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces. That leaves 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces. Then her mom puts down 750 / 3 = 250 more.  So in total they put down 250 + 250 = 500 pieces. That means there are 1000 - 500 = 500 pieces left.


500 

"
"Okay, so Cody eats three times more than Amir, who eats 5 cookies. That means Cody eats 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.  

To find the total, we add how many they each eat: 15 + 5 = 20 cookies.


20 

"
"Okay, so John has three boxes, right? Each one is 5 by 6 by 4 inches on the outside, but the walls are 1 inch thick. That means we gotta figure out how big the inside is.

If the walls are 1 inch thick, that means we take 1 inch off each side of the outside measurements. So, the inside of each box is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

To find the space inside one box, we multiply those numbers together: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since he has three boxes, we multiply that by 3: 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches.


72 

"
"Okay, so Frankie watched a lot of TV! Let's see...

He watched 1 hour of TV on Monday and Tuesday, so that's 2 hours. Then on Thursday he watched 1 hour plus a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. And on Friday he watched 2 hours.  That's a total of 5.5 hours.

He watched 7 hours total, so he must have watched 1.5 hours on Wednesday. Since each of those 30-minute shows is half an hour, he watched 3 of them on Wednesday. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Henry has 110 cookies now, but he dropped 5, so that means he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies before that.  He also made 15 extra cookies, so he planned to make 115 - 15 = 100 cookies. Since he wanted to make twice as many as last year, he baked 100 / 2 = 50 cookies last year.


50
"
"Okay, so the gas costs $3.00 per gallon, and they get $0.20 back for each gallon.  If they buy 10 gallons, that's 10 times $3.00, which is $30.00. Then they get 10 times $0.20 back, which is $2.00. So, $30.00 minus $2.00 is $28.00. 


$28.00 

"
"Okay, so Beatrice ate 2 times 24 roll-ups, which is 48. Marcell ate 3 times 14 roll-ups, which is 42.  That means they ate a total of 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups. Since there are two of them, they ate an average of 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups each.


45 

"
"Okay, so Julia's boat is leaking, bummer!  Let's see... it takes on 2 liters of water every 10 feet she rows.  She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so she rows 1.25 feet every second.  If it takes her 64 seconds to get to shore, that means she rows 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.

So, she rows 80 feet and takes on water every 10 feet, so that's 80 feet / 10 feet/leak = 8 times.  

Since each leak is 2 liters, she takes on 8 leaks * 2 liters/leak = 16 liters of water. 


16 

"
"Okay, so there are 4 teachers, and each one uses the whiteboard for 2 lessons a day. That means the whiteboard gets used 4 teachers * 2 lessons = 8 times a day.

And they clean it 3 times every lesson, so it gets cleaned 8 times * 3 cleanings = 24 times a day.


24 

"
"Okay, so Ryan plants 2 flowers every day for 15 days. That's 2 x 15 = 30 flowers. But 5 of them didn't grow, so he has 30 - 5 = 25 flowers.


25 

"
"Okay, so Jamal's phone holds way more pictures than Brittany's. It's like, six times more!  Brittany's phone can only hold 300 pictures, and Jamal's can hold 1800.

If Brittany's phone could hold 300 pictures, and that's 50 times more than the ducks in Jamal's picture, then there must be 300 divided by 50 ducks in the picture.

That means there are 6 ducks in Jamal's picture. 


6
"
"Okay, so Sasha bought some wood a while back, and now it's worth more!  

She's got ten of those 2x4 boards, and she paid $10 for each one. That's 10 times 10, which is $100.

Now they're worth more, so she can sell them for $15 each. That's 10 times 15, which is $150.

She also has five of the bigger 4x4 boards. Those cost $16 each, so that's 5 times 16, which is $80.

She can sell those for $24 each now, so that's 5 times 24, which is $120.

So, all together she'll make $150 + $120, which is $270.

But she spent $100 + $80, which is $180 to buy them.

So her profit is $270 - $180, which is $90!


$90
"
"Okay, so Katy uses sugar and water in a 7 to 13 ratio. That means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.  If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined, we gotta figure out how much of that is just sugar.

Think of it like this:

*  The ratio is like splitting 120 into 20 equal parts (7 + 13 = 20).
* Each part is worth 120 / 20 = 6.
* Since the sugar part is 7, she used 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.


So the answer is 42. 

"
"Okay, so John has 3 kids, and he buys each of them 2 pairs of shoes. That's 3 times 2, which is 6 pairs of shoes in total.

Each pair costs $60, so 6 pairs would cost 6 times 60, which is $360. 


$360
"
"Okay, so they had 2 containers with 5 cars in each, that's 2 times 5 which is 10 cars.  Then they got more cars and had 30 in total. So they got 30 minus 10 which is 20 more cars. Since each container has 5 cars, they must have gotten 20 divided by 5 which is 4 more containers.


4 

"
"Okay, so Adrien made 30% more than Lylah, which means if Lylah made $100, Adrien made $130.  

Four years ago, Adrien made $40,000, and that's like his $130.  To find out what Lylah made four years ago, we can set up a proportion:

$130 / $40,000 = $100 / x

Cross-multiplying, we get:

$130x = $4,000,000

Dividing both sides by $130, we find Lylah made about $30,769.23 four years ago.

Now, Adrien's salary went up by 40%, so four years later he's making $40,000 + (0.40 * $40,000) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also went up, so four years later she's making $30,769.23 + (0.30 * $30,769.23) = $40,000.

Finally, to find their total salary, we add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries: $56,000 + $40,000 = $96,000.



$96,000
"
"Okay, so Miguel uses 2 pads a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. That means he uses 2 times 30, which is 60 sheets every week.  

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he uses 60 times 4, which equals 240 sheets a month.


240 

"
"Okay, so Morisette has 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael has twice the apples, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 apples. He has half the oranges, so that's 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Together they have 5 + 10 = 15 apples and 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.  That means they have a total of 15 + 12 = 27 fruits!


27 

"
"Okay, so Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. Then she slept 2 hours less each of the next two days, so that's 8 - 2 = 6 hours each night.  That's 6 + 6 = 12 hours for those two days.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those 6 hours, so that's 6 + 1 = 7 hours each night.  Since there are 4 more days left in the week, that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Finally, to find the total, we add up all the hours: 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.


48 

"
"Okay, so Rosie runs super fast at first! 10 miles every hour for 3 hours, that's 30 miles already!  Then she slows down to 5 miles an hour.  She runs for another 4 hours at that speed, so that's 20 more miles.  

If you add those together, she runs a total of 50 miles. 



"
"Okay, so Jennie stamped a third of the 60 letters, which is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.  That means there were 30 - 20 = 10 letters in the stamped pile to begin with.


10 

"
"Okay, so Julia had 12 spoons at the end. Her husband gave her 5, and she used 3, so before that she had 12 - 5 = 7 spoons.  Then, since she used 3, she must have started with 7 + 3 = 10 spoons.


10 

"
"Okay, so Dylan had 38 chicken sausages. He got 6 more fish sausages, so that's 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.  To find the total, we add the chicken and fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82 sausages.


82 

"
"Okay, so Lily made 50 friends. Amy made 20 more than that, so she made 70 friends.  If you add them together, they have a total of 120 friends. 


120 

"
"Okay, so Dillon's mom sells stuff at the store. Watermelons are expensive, they cost three times what a pepper costs! Peppers are $15 each, so a watermelon is $45. Oranges are $5 cheaper than a watermelon, so they're $40.

Dillon needs to buy a lot of stuff: 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. Let's see...

* Watermelons: 4 x $45 = $180
* Peppers: 20 x $15 = $300
* Oranges: 10 x $40 = $400

Now, let's add it all up: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880

Dillon's gonna spend $880 at the store! 



"
"Okay, so the hospital sees a lot of people every day!  

They see 500 people, and each person is there for 24 minutes. That's a lot of time!

The doctors get paid $150 every hour, and the hospital charges people $200 an hour.  

To figure out the profit, we gotta see how much money the hospital makes and then take away how much they pay the doctors.

Hmm, let me think... 


The hospital makes $10,000 profit. 

"
"Okay, so first, a third of the elves quit because of the vomit. That's 60 elves divided by 3, which is 20 elves.  

Then, 40 elves are left. But then 10 more quit because kids kicked them! So, 40 elves minus 10 elves is 30 elves.

30 

"
"Okay, so Joseph spent $500 in May. Then in June, he spent $60 less, so that's $500 - $60 = $440.  To find the total, we add up his spending for both months: $500 + $440 = $940.


$940 

"
"Okay, so Pam rode the roller coaster twice and Fred rode it four times. That's 2 + 4 = 6 roller coaster rides.  Then they each rode the luge twice, so that's 2 + 2 = 4 luge rides.

In total, they went on 6 + 4 = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so they used 10 * 6 = 60 tickets.


60 

"
"Okay, so Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. Then on Tuesday, he walked 6 times that amount, which is 4 times 6 = 24 miles.  That means he walked a total of 4 + 24 = 28 miles on Monday and Tuesday.

Since he walked 41 miles total, he must have walked 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday.

"Okay, so Tom gets 4 car washes every month, and each one costs $15.  To find out how much he spends in a year, we gotta do some multiplying!

First, we figure out how much he spends each month: 4 car washes * $15/car wash = $60.

Then, we multiply that by the number of months in a year: $60/month * 12 months = $720.

So Tom spends $720 on car washes every year. 



"
"Okay, so Brian had 20 games but lost 5, so that means he has 15 left. Bobby has 3 times that amount, which is 15 x 3 = 45. But then Bobby has 5 fewer than that, so he has 45 - 5 = 40 games.


40 

"
"Okay, so there are 27 unicorns in total, and a third of them are in Scotland. That's 27 divided by 3, which is 9 unicorns.  Then, two-thirds of those Scottish unicorns are girls. So that's 9 times 2 divided by 3, which equals 6. 

There are 6 female Scottish unicorns. 

"
"Okay, so Rory's subs cost $7.50 each, and she got two, so that's $7.50 times 2, which is $15.00. The chips are $1.50 each, and she got two of those, so that's $1.50 times 2, which is $3.00. The cookies are a dollar each, and she got two, so that's $1.00 times 2, which is $2.00.

So far, her total is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00, which is $20.00.  But then there's a 20% delivery fee, so we gotta do 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00.  

Now her total is $20.00 + $4.00, which is $24.00.  But she also wants to tip $5.00, so her final total is $24.00 + $5.00, which is $29.00.


$29.00
"
"Okay, so Mark took two tests. The first one had 75 questions, and he could do 5 questions every hour. He had 8 hours for that test, so he finished 5 times 8, which is 40 questions. That means he didn't finish 75 minus 40, or 35 questions on the first test.

The second test had 100 questions, and he still did 5 questions each hour. This time he had 6 hours, so he finished 5 times 6, which is 30 questions.  He didn't finish 100 minus 30, or 70 questions on the second test.

In total, he didn't finish 35 plus 70, which is 105 questions. 


105
"
"Okay, so there are 12 blue gumballs.  Four times that amount is 12 x 4 = 48.  Then you add 22 more, so there are 48 + 22 = 70 pink gumballs.


70 

"
"Okay, so there are 20 cars in total.  12 are automatic and 4 are manual. That means 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 cars are semi-automatic.

To find the percentage, we do (4 semi-automatic cars / 20 total cars) * 100% = 20%

So the answer is 20%. 



"
"Okay, so there are 700 bees total.  We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees.  

Let's think about it like this: if we have a group of queen bees, there are twice that many baby bees, and then twice that many worker bees.

Hmm, that means if we split the bees into groups, there's one group of queens, two groups of babies, and four groups of workers. That's 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 groups in total.

Since there are 700 bees total, and 7 groups, each group must have 700 / 7 = 100 bees.

So there are 4 groups of worker bees, and each group has 100 bees, which means there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.


400
"
"Okay, so Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day. If he worked those 2 hours instead, he'd make $10 an hour, so that's $10 x 2 = $20 a day.  

If he does that every day for a week, he'd make $20 x 7 = $140.


140 

"
"Okay, so John buys some stuff, right?  Let's see... milk and eggs are food, so no extra tax on those.  That's $2 + $3 = $5.

The other stuff, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps, those have tax.  That's $3 + $3 + $4 = $10.  

Then we gotta add 10% tax to the $10, which is like a dollar, so that's $10 + $1 = $11.

Finally, we add the food and the non-food stuff together: $5 + $11 = $16.


$16 

"
"Okay, so Kim's got 3 clients already and thinks he'll get 5 more. That's 3 + 5 = 8 clients total.

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each, so that's 2 * $2 = $4 per client on bleach.  For all the clients, that's 8 * $4 = $32.

They also need cloths, which cost $5 a pack. So that's 8 * $5 = $40 for cloths.

His total spending is $32 + $40 = $72.

He makes $92 each week, and his spending is $72, so his profit is $92 - $72 = $20.


$20 

"
"Okay, so John has a lot of pineapples!  He has 10 big fields, and each one has 100 pineapples. That's 10 times 100, which is 1000 pineapples in total.

But he can only pick them every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year. So he picks them 4 times a year (12 divided by 3).

That means he gets 1000 pineapples each time he picks, and he picks 4 times, so he gets 1000 times 4, which is 4000 pineapples in a whole year!


4000 

"
"Okay, so Johnny has three boxes of Legos. One has 500 pieces. Another one is three times bigger, so that's 500 x 3 = 1500 pieces. The last box is a quarter the size of the first one, so that's 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 pieces.

2125 

"
"Okay, so Debra saw 30 bees leave at first. Then 30 / 2 = 15 bees came back.  

Then she saw double the first amount leave, so that's 30 * 2 = 60 bees.

That means a total of 30 + 60 = 90 bees flew out of the hive.

Since all the bees came back eventually, 90 bees returned in the last 6 hours. 


90 

"
"Okay, so Brittany's mom paid for one adult ticket and one kid ticket, which costs $12 and $10. That's $22 total.  If she got $8 back, she must have given the cashier $30. 


$30
"
"Okay, so Charlie has 12 friends, and that's three times more than Dorothy.  So Dorothy has 12 / 3 = 4 friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so he has 4 * 4 = 16 friends.

16 

"
"Okay, so Steve has to go farther, but he's on a bike, which is faster.  Tim's on a skateboard, so he's slower.  Let's see... Steve goes 3 miles, and there are 5280 feet in a mile, so that's 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet. Tim only goes 2 miles, so that's 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.

Steve bikes at 440 feet per minute, so it takes him 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes. Tim goes 264 feet per minute, so it takes him 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

That means Steve gets home 40 - 36 = 4 minutes earlier! 



"
"Okay, so Shawnda charges 25 cents per tire.  

Let's see... 5 bikes have 2 tires each, so that's 5 times 2 which is 10 tires.

Then there are 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 times 3 which is 9 tires.

And one unicycle has 1 tire.

So in total, she inflated 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents, she made 20 times $0.25 which is $5.00. 


$5.00
"
"Okay, so Carl has 10 packs of cookies and each pack has 6 cookies, so that's 10 times 6 which is 60 cookies.  Each cookie costs a dime, so 60 cookies times 10 cents is $6.00. If he pays with a ten dollar bill, he gets $4.00 back.


$4.00 

"
"Okay, so Dave ate 14 fries. Then that sneaky seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.  So there were 14 + 7 = 21 fries left.

Then those mean pigeons ate 3 fries each, and there are 3 pigeons, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. That leaves 21 - 9 = 12 fries.

The raccoon was a real jerk and took two-thirds of those, which is (2/3) * 12 = 8 fries.  That leaves 12 - 8 = 4 fries.

Finally, the ants got the last fry, so there were 4 + 1 = 5 fries before the ants showed up.

To find out how many fries were in the pack at the beginning, we add up all the fries: 5 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 14 = 43 fries! 



"
"Okay, so Kimo has class three times a day on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and each class is an hour long. That's 3 times 1, which is 3 hours each of those days.  

Then on Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two classes that are each two hours long. So that's 2 times 2, which is 4 hours each of those days.

That means he has 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 hours of class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

And he has 4 + 4 = 8 hours of class on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

So in total, he has 9 + 8 = 17 hours of class each week.

There are 16 weeks in a semester, so he has 17 times 16 = 272 hours of class in a semester. 


272
"
"Okay, so Bill makes a lot of yummy stuff! Let's see...

* He makes 300 rolls, and each is 4 inches long, so that's 300 times 4, which is 1200 inches.
* The croissants are 6 inches each, and he makes 120, so that's 120 times 6, which is 720 inches.
* The baguettes are tricky because they're 2 feet long.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 times 12, which is 24 inches long. He makes 60 baguettes, so that's 60 times 24, which is 1440 inches.

Now we gotta add up all the inches: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

But the question wants to know how long it is in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide 3360 by 12, which gives us 280 feet.


280 

"
"Okay, so the monkeys eat 200 bananas a month, the gorillas eat 400, and the baboons eat 100. That's 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas every month.

Since he needs enough for two months, he needs 700 x 2 = 1400 bananas. 


1400 

"
"Okay, so Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field, so he runs 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. That's like running 80 yards each time (40 yards there and 40 yards back), so she runs 34 * 80 = 2720 yards just doing that.  

In total, Kelly runs 100 yards + 2720 yards = 2820 yards.

Kelly runs 2820 - 1500 = 1320 yards farther than Blake.


Answer: 1320 

"
"Okay, so Raphael bought 4 pens at $1.50 each, so that's 4 times 1.50 which is $6.  Then he got 2 notebooks at $4 each, so that's 2 times 4 which is $8.  And the bond paper was $20.  

To find the total, we add it all up: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.



"
"Okay, so Finn starts with 11 tadpoles. Then 6 more pop up, so that's 11 plus 6, which is 17. But then 2 hide, so we take 2 away from 17.  That leaves 15 tadpoles.


15 

"
"Okay, so on Monday there's 17 feet of water. Then on Tuesday they add 7 more feet, so that's 17 + 7 = 24 feet.  

On Wednesday, the water level is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday.  Two-thirds of 24 is like cutting the 24 feet into three equal parts and taking two of them.  That's 16 feet!


16 

"
"Okay, so Anakin caught a bunch of sea creatures: 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. That's 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 sea creatures.

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he got 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. He also caught 3 fewer seahorses, so he got 6 - 3 = 3 seahorses. And he caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he got 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

That means Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 sea creatures.

Together they caught 19 + 13 = 32 sea creatures! 


32
"
"Okay, so the marbles start at $20.  Then every two months they go up by 20% of that price, which is like $4. So after two months they cost $24.

If we keep doing that for 36 months, that's 18 times the price goes up.  So it's like $20 plus $4 eighteen times.

That's $20 + $72 which is $92!


$92 

"
"Okay, so there are 5 red cars and each costs $4, so that's 5 times 4 which is $20.  An action figure costs $5 and there are 3, so those cost 5 times 3 which is $15. The doll costs the same as 3 action figures, so it's also $15.  If you add up the cost of all the toys, it's $20 + $15 + $15 which equals $50.


50 

"
"Okay, so if Jackie does her own taxes, she misses out on making $35 three times because she loses 3 hours of work. That's $35 x 3 = $105.

The accountant costs $90, so she'd actually save money by doing her own taxes.  She'd have $105 - $90 = $15 more.


$15 

"
"Okay, so Elvira has €1500 and the computer stuff costs €1090.  Then she gets a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102.  

Let's add up the extra stuff: €157 + €74 + €102 = €333

Now add that to the computer price: €1090 + €333 = €1423

Finally, subtract that from her total money: €1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira has €77 left for clothes! 


€77
"
"Okay, so Sandra needs 3 eggs for each flan, and she's making 15 flans. That's 3 times 15, which is 45 eggs.  Her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits. So, she needs to babysit 45 divided by 9, which is 5 times.


5 

"
"Okay, so Seth is twice as old as Brooke.  That means if Brooke is 10, Seth is 20.  

In two years, they'll both be older. Brooke will be 12 and Seth will be 22.  

If we add those together, 12 + 22 = 34.  

Wait, the problem says their ages in two years will add up to 28, not 34.  Let's try a smaller number for Brooke's age.

If Brooke is 6, then Seth is 12. In two years, Brooke will be 8 and Seth will be 14. 8 + 14 = 22.  That's still too low.

Hmm, how about if Brooke is 7? Then Seth is 14. In two years, Brooke will be 9 and Seth will be 16. 9 + 16 = 25.  Still not quite there.

Let's try Brooke being 8.  That means Seth is 16. In two years, Brooke will be 10 and Seth will be 18. 10 + 18 = 28!

That's it! Seth is 16 years old. 


16
"
"Okay, so Ethel has $8.  Jimmy has twice that amount plus $2 more.  Twice Ethel's money is $8 x 2 = $16.  Then add the extra $2, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.


$18
"
"Okay, so Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. So that's 20 times 5 which is 100 miles. Then on the weekend he walks 10 miles each day, so that's 10 times 2 which is 20 miles.  If you add those together, 100 plus 20, he walks a total of 120 miles in a week.


120 

"
"Okay, so the hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times that, so it's $25 x 3 = $75.  The pants cost the same as the average of the hat and jacket.  So, the hat and jacket together cost $25 + $75 = $100.  Half of that is $100 / 2 = $50, so the pants cost $50.

To find the total cost, we add up the hat, jacket, and pants: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.


$150 

"
"Okay, so there are a bunch of creepy crawlies! Let's see... 80 spiders with 8 legs each is 80 times 8, which is 640 legs. Then there are 90 insects with 6 legs, so that's 90 times 6, which is 540 legs. And lastly, those 3 weird mutants have 10 legs each, so that's 3 times 10, which is 30 legs.  

If we add all those up, 640 plus 540 plus 30, we get a total of 1210 legs! 


1210
"
"Okay, so Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age, so she's also 8. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so she's 8 x 2 = 16. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so she's 16 + 3 = 19.  

To find the total age, we add up all their ages: 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51.


51 

"
"Okay, so Jessica has to pay $300 for school, $200 for her card, and $500 for her house, that's $1000 in total.

She wants to pay extra, like half again as much, so that's $1000 times 0.50 which is $500 more.

So each month she pays $1000 + $500 = $1500.

In a whole year, that's $1500 times 12 months, which is $18000. 



"
"Okay, so Billy's got a lot of potatoes to peel!  

He spends a minute and a half on each one peeling, and that's 60 potatoes, so that's 60 times 1.5 minutes... which is 90 minutes just for peeling.

Cutting is way faster, only 5 seconds each. So that's 60 times 5, which is 300 seconds.  

But there are 60 seconds in a minute, so 300 seconds is 5 minutes.

Altogether, that's 90 minutes plus 5 minutes, so it takes him 95 minutes to get all those potatoes ready. 


95 

"
"Okay, so they make $10 for every gallon they sell because 20 glasses times 50 cents is $10.  It costs them $5 to make each gallon, so they make $5 profit on each one. They made $25 profit total, so they sold 5 gallons (because $25 divided by $5 is 5).  Since lemons cost $3 per gallon, they spent $15 on lemons (because $3 times 5 is $15).


$15 

"
"Okay, so there are 240 runners in total, and 80 are Japanese. That means 160 runners are Chinese.  If 60 of them are boys, then there must be 100 girls on the Chinese team. 


100 

"
"Okay, so Zaid makes $6000 a month. He spends $1500 on rent because that's a quarter of his money. Then he spends $2000 on gas, which is a third of his money.  That's $3500 gone already.

He has $2500 left, and he gives half of that to charity, so that's $1250 gone. Now he only has $1250 left.

He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so that's $900 gone.

That means he has $1250 - $900 = $350 left. 


$350
"
"Okay, so Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 less than Bo, so Monic has 36 crabs. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 46 crabs.  If you add them all up, 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs. 


122 

"
"Okay, so Lloyd makes $10 for every hour he helps with math.  In the first week, he helped for 5 hours, so he made 10 * 5 = $50.  The next week he helped for 8 hours, so he made 10 * 8 = $80.  To find out how much he made in total, we add those together: $50 + $80 = $130.


$130 

"
"Okay, so the winner got 3/4 of the votes, which is like saying they got 3 out of every 4 votes.  If there were 80 kids who voted, we gotta figure out what 1/4 of that is.  

80 divided by 4 is 20.  So 1/4 of the votes is 20.

That means the winner got 3 times that amount, which is 60 votes.

If the winner got 60 votes, the loser got the rest, which is 80 - 60 = 20 votes.


20 

"
"Okay, so Sandra got 40 white carnations. She got 4 times that many red roses, so that's 40 x 4 = 160 red roses. 


160 

"
"Okay, so Jan is 30 now, which means two years ago she was 28.  Half of 28 is 14.  Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than that, so he was 19.  That means Mark is 21 now. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, she's 23! 


23
"
"Okay, so Team 1 is super fast, all running the same time. That's 55 seconds each, so they finish in 55 times 4, which is 220 seconds.

Team 2 is trickier. The first person is slow, taking 60 seconds. Then each person after gets 3 seconds faster. So the second person takes 57, the third takes 54, and the last one takes 51.  If you add those up, it's 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Team 2 takes 222 seconds and Team 1 takes 220 seconds, so Team 1 wins by 2 seconds! 


2 

"
"Okay, so Jerry has a 50/50 chance of rolling a number bigger than 3, right?  There are three numbers bigger than 3 (4, 5, and 6) and six sides total.

To get two even numbers in a row, he has to get an even number first, which is half the time. Then he has to get another even number, which is also half the time. So that's half times half, which is a quarter chance, or 25%.

That means it's 50% - 25% = 25% more likely he'll roll a number bigger than 3.


25 

"
"Okay, so Jenna's mom picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half of that.  Half of 20 is 10.  So Jenna picked 10 apples.  

To find the total, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number her mom picked: 10 + 20 = 30.

They picked a total of 30 apples. 


30
"
"Okay, so there are 160 pieces of straw total. The hamsters used 50 pieces (10 hamsters times 5 pieces each) and the rabbits used 20 pieces. That means the rats used 90 pieces (160 - 50 - 20 = 90).

If each rat gets 6 pieces, there are 15 rats (90 / 6 = 15).

Since the rats are in 3 cages, there are 5 rats in each cage (15 / 3 = 5). 


5 

"
"Okay, so Mandy owes Benedict $100, right? And every month, she has to pay an extra 2% because of the interest.

So after one month, she owes $100 plus 2% of $100, which is $2. That means she owes $102.

The next month, she owes 2% of $102, which is $2.04. So now she owes $104.04.

And then the last month, she owes 2% of $104.04, which is $2.08.  That brings the total to $106.12.


$106.12 

"
"Okay, so the trader buys the wheat for $20 a bag and it costs $2 more to move each bag. That means each bag costs him $22 in total before he sells it. He sells each bag for $30, so he makes $8 profit on each one.  If he made $400 profit, he must have sold 50 bags. 


50
"
"Okay, so they spent $20.25 on tickets and $4.50 less on food, so food cost $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The rides cost $33 each, and they went on two, so that's $33 x 2 = $66.

Adding it all up, they spent $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102 in total.

Since there are three friends, each friend pays $102 / 3 = $34. 


$34
"
"Okay, so John collects peaches for 3 hours, and he gets 2 peaches every minute.  That's a lot of peaches!

First, you gotta figure out how many minutes are in 3 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 times 60, which is 180 minutes.

Then you multiply the number of minutes by how many peaches he gets each minute: 180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.


360 

"
"Okay, so the ducks need 3.5 pounds of bugs each week.  And there are 10 ducks, so that's 3.5 times 10 which is 35 pounds of bugs for all of them in a week.

There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total bugs by 7 to see how much they need each day. 35 divided by 7 is 5.


5 

"
"Okay, so Tom starts with 50 trees.  Each year he plants 10 more, but chops down 2, so that's like adding 8 trees every year.

After 10 years, he's added 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.

So now he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

But wait, 30% of them die! That's 130 trees * 0.30 = 39 trees.

So, he has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left. 


91 

"
"Okay, so on Friday there were 18 pink flamingos. Then on Saturday they took away a third, which is 18 divided by 3, which is 6. So there were 12 pink ones left. They painted those 6 white and put them back. Then on Sunday they added 18 more pink ones. So there were 12 + 18 = 30 pink ones.  And there were still only 6 white ones. That means there were 30 - 6 = 24 more pink ones than white ones.


24 

"
"Okay, so Violetta wants 5 crayons and each one costs $2. That means she'll spend 5 * $2 = $10 on crayons.

Since she has $20, she'll get $20 - $10 = $10 in change. 


$10
"
"Okay, so a pen costs the same as a pencil and eraser together. The pencil is $1.20 and the eraser is $0.30, so the pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

If one pen costs $1.50, then 8 pens would cost $1.50 x 8 = $12.00 


$12.00
"
"Okay, so they have 200 pounds of carrots and need to give 2 pounds to each of the 40 restaurants.  That means they'll use 80 pounds (40 x 2 = 80).  

If they start with 200 and use 80, they'll have 120 pounds left over. 


120 

"
"Okay, so there are 23,786 people in Soda.  If 8417 are men and 9092 are women, let's add those together: 8417 + 9092 = 17,509.

That means there are 17,509 grown-ups. To find out how many kids there are, we subtract that number from the total: 23,786 - 17,509 = 6277.

There are 6277 kids in Soda. 



"
"Okay, so Elaine starts with 20 cards. Then she gets three times that, which is 20 x 3 = 60 cards.  That's a lot of cards!

The next month she gets 20 less than that, so 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the last month, she gets double the amount from the first two months combined. That's 60 + 40 = 100 cards, and double that is 100 x 2 = 200 cards.

To find the total, we add up all the cards: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

Wow, she has 320 cards now! 



"
"Okay, so Mark edits 1000 sentences a week, and half of those are for Publisher A. That's 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so he makes 500 * $0.05 = $25 from them.

Publisher B pays double what Publisher A does, so they pay him $0.05 * 2 = $0.10 per sentence.

He also edits 500 sentences for Publisher B, so he makes 500 * $0.10 = $50 from them.

In total, he makes $25 + $50 = $75 a week.  

That's 7500 cents! 


7500
"
"Okay, so Baldur gets 5 pails in the morning and 6 in the afternoon. That's 11 pails total.  Each pail has 5 liters, so he gets 11 times 5 liters, which is 55 liters. 


55 

"
"Okay, so John gets a bonus of $5000 right away, that's awesome!  Then his paycheck goes up by 5% which is like an extra $100 each week.  So now he makes $2100 a week.  There are 52 weeks in a year, so he makes $2100 times 52 which is $109,200.  Don't forget to add the bonus!  That means he made a total of $114,200 that year.


114200 

"
"Okay, so Josie has 10 acres of grapes, and each acre makes 5 tons of grapes. That's 10 times 5, which is 50 tons of grapes!

Then, each ton makes 2 barrels of wine, so she gets 50 times 2 barrels, which is 100 barrels of wine. 


100 

"
"Okay, so Carl eats 2 slices of cheese on his sandwich every day, and he eats a sandwich every day for a whole week. That's 2 slices x 7 days = 14 slices.

He also eats omelets with cheese 3 days a week. Each omelet has one more slice than his sandwich, so that's 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.  So for the omelets, it's 3 slices/omelet * 3 omelets = 9 slices.

And then he used 8 slices for his macaroni and cheese.

To find the total, we add up all the slices: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices.


31 

"
"Okay, so Janet starts with 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, that's 32 pens total. Then she gets 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so that's 6 times 9 which is 54 blue pens. She also gets 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so that's 2 times 6 which is 12 red pens.  

So now she has 32 pens + 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 98 pens!


98 

"
"Okay, so Brinley wants a 93 average, and she's already taken five tests.  To figure out what she needs on the last one, let's do some math!

If she wants a 93 average across six tests, that means she needs a total of 93 times 6, which is 558 points.

She already has 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 points.

To get to 558, she needs 558 - 438 = 120 points on her last test.


120 

"
"Okay, so Micheal rides his bike a lot!  

First, he rides 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time. That's 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers every week. He does that for four weeks, so that's 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Then he changes things up and rides only twice a week, but goes farther each time, 60 kilometers! So that's 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers each week. He does this for 3 weeks, so that's 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

To find the total, we add up the kilometers from both parts: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

Micheal rode a total of 860 kilometers! 



"
"Okay, so Joe has a lot of candy!  Let's see... each chocolate bar is 40 grams, and there are 25 of them, so that's 40 times 25 which is 1000 grams.  The candied apples are half the weight of the chocolate bars, so they each weigh 20 grams.  He has 80 of those, so that's 20 times 80 which is 1600 grams.  

To find the total weight, we add the weight of the chocolate and the apples: 1000 plus 1600 is 2600 grams.


2600 

"
"Okay, so Rose bought 4 cakes on Monday. Then on Tuesday, she bought three times that amount, which is 4 times 3, or 12 cakes.  On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the amount she got on Tuesday, so that's 12 times 5, which equals 60 cakes.  To find the total, we add up all the cakes: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.


76 

"
"Okay, so twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than half a dozen plates.  Half a dozen plates cost $6000 each, so that's 0.5 * $6000 = $3000.

If the cups cost $1200 less, they cost $3000 - $1200 = $1800.

There are 20 dozen cups, and a dozen has 12 cups, so that's 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the price of one cup, we divide the total cost by the number of cups: $1800 / 240 = $7.50.


$7.50 

"
"Okay, so Sara needs $30 for the jacket and $40 for the shoes, which is $70 in total. She already has $30 from babysitting and her savings.  That means she needs to earn another $40.

If she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, she needs to mow 10 times to get enough money.


**Answer:** 10 

"
"Okay, so Jerry's got these chickens, right? Red ones lay 3 eggs a day, and white ones lay 5. He gets 42 eggs total every day.  And he has two more white chickens than red ones.  

Hmm... let's see. If we say he has 'r' red chickens, then he has 'r + 2' white chickens.  

So, the red chickens lay 3r eggs, and the white chickens lay 5(r + 2) eggs.  That all adds up to 42 eggs.

Let me write that out: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Okay, now I gotta solve for 'r'.  

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4


Jerry has 4 red chickens! 

"
"Okay, so the park is a rectangle, right?  That means it has two long sides and two short sides.  

The long sides are 6 miles each, and the short sides are 1.5 miles each. To walk all the way around, you gotta add up all the sides: 6 + 6 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 15 miles.

He walks 3 miles every hour, so it takes him 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours.


5 

"
"Okay, so on the first day, Sloane saw 100 people. Then the next day she saw 50 more than that, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 people.  

That means in the first two days she saw 100 + 150 = 250 people.

If she saw 500 people total, then on the third day she saw 500 - 250 = 250 people.


250 

"
"Okay, so the big pool is losing water at the same rate as the small pool, right?  They both lose 4 gallons every minute.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now it has four times as much. That means the big pool is losing water faster, even though they both leak at the same rate.

Hmm... let's see. If the small pool has 'x' amount of water now, the big pool has 4x. Four minutes ago, the big pool had 2x.

Since they both lost water, the big pool lost 16 gallons (4 gallons per minute times 4 minutes) and the small pool also lost 16 gallons.

So, four minutes ago, the big pool had 2x + 16 gallons, and now it has 4x gallons.

That means 2x + 16 = 4x.

If we take away 2x from both sides, we get 16 = 2x.

And if we divide both sides by 2, we get x = 8.

So the small pool has 8 gallons now. 



"
"Okay, so Lori needs to make $352.00 to buy the shoes and belt.  If she makes $8.00 every hour, she needs to work 44 hours. 



"
"Okay, so Janeth borrowed $2000 and has to pay back 10% extra. That means she owes $200 more, right? So, in total, she owes $2200.

If she pays $165 each month for a whole year (12 months), she'll pay $165 times 12, which is $1980.

If she pays back $1980 but owes $2200, then she still owes $220.


Answer: $220 

"
"Okay, so there are 4 roses, and there are 7 more dahlias.  That means there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.  

In total, there are 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers.


15 

"
"Okay, so Harriet is 21 now. Adrian is three times her age, so he's 21 x 3 = 63 years old. Zack is twice Harriet's age, so he's 21 x 2 = 42.

In three years, Harriet will be 24, Adrian will be 66, and Zack will be 45.  

To find the average, we add those ages up: 24 + 66 + 45 = 135. Then we divide by 3 because there are three people: 135 / 3 = 45.


45 

"
"Okay, so Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri got 10 more than half of Naomi's score, so that's 68 divided by 2 which is 34, plus 10 more, making 44 points. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she got 68 plus 17, which is 85 points.

If they all scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points, then Jojo must have scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.


54 

"
"Okay, so Carmen does crosswords for 10 minutes each and she did 3 of those. That's 10 times 3, which is 30 minutes.  Then she does sudokus for 5 minutes each and did 8 of those. So that's 5 times 8, which is 40 minutes.  

To find the total time, we add the crossword time and the sudoku time: 30 + 40 = 70 minutes.


70 

"
"Okay, so Celine started with 120 liters and used 90 liters. That means she had 120 - 90 = 30 liters left.  Then she collected double that amount in rainwater, so that's 30 * 2 = 60 liters.  

If she adds that to what was already in the tank, she has 30 + 60 = 90 liters now.


90 

"
"Okay, so Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 less petunias than that, so he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.  

To find the total, we add the geraniums and petunias: 90 + 50 = 140 flowers.


140 

"
"Okay, so they spent $15000 the first year. Then they spent $15000 divided by 3, which is $5000 the second year.  To find the total, we add those together: $15000 + $5000 = $20000


$20000
"
"Okay, so Carlos pays $30 for each hour he has the canoe, and he has it for 3 hours. That means he pays 30 x 3 = $90.

Benji pays $18 each hour for the raft, and he uses it for 5 hours. So he pays 18 x 5 = $90 too.

To find out how much they pay together, we add their costs: $90 + $90 = $180.



"
"Okay, so Andrew takes 6 days on the bus.  The car is twice as fast, so that's 6 / 2 = 3 days in the car.  

To go there and back, it's 6 days + 3 days = 9 days total. 


9 

"
"Okay, so James starts with 40 water Pokemon cards, but loses 8, so he has 32 left.  He also gets 14 more grass cards, so he has 34 grass cards now.  

That means he has 30 fire + 34 grass + 32 water = 96 cards total.

To find the chance of picking a water card, we do 32 (water cards) divided by 96 (total cards) and multiply by 100% to make it a percentage. That's about 33%.


33 

"
"Okay, so Chad's burrito starts at $6.50. Then he adds stuff, like extra meat for $2.00, cheese for a buck, avocado for another dollar, and two sauces at 25 cents each, so that's 50 cents.  Oh, and he gets the meal deal for $3.00 more.  So far, that's $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00. But wait, he has a gift card for $5.00!  So he only has to pay $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.


$9.00
"
"Okay, so Kalinda puts in 4 pieces every minute, and her mom does half of that, which is 2 pieces a minute.  Together they do 4 + 2 = 6 pieces every minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces, so it will take them 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

That's one whole hour! 


1 

"
"Okay, so there were 120 watermelons at first. Ashlyn took 30% of them, which is like 30 out of every 100.  That's 36 watermelons (30/100 * 120 = 36).

So, there were 84 left (120 - 36 = 84). Then she took 3/4 of those, which is like 63 watermelons (3/4 * 84 = 63).

That means there were 21 watermelons left over (84 - 63 = 21).


21 

"
"Okay, so Mark buys 12 cars, and each one costs $20,000. That's 12 times 20,000, which is $240,000.  

But wait, there's tax! It's 10% of the car price, so that's $240,000 times 0.10, which is $24,000.

So now the cars cost $240,000 plus $24,000, which is $264,000.

Oh, and he has to pay $1000 to register each car. That's 12 times $1000, which is $12,000.

Finally, we add that to the price of the cars and tax: $264,000 plus $12,000 equals $276,000.

So Mark pays $276,000 for everything. 



"
"Okay, so Kylie got 5 more shells than Robert on Monday, and he got 20. That means Kylie got 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

Then on Tuesday, she doubled her Monday amount, so she got 25 * 2 = 50 shells.


50 

"
"Okay, so there were 50 ants. Dax found half that many bugs, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bugs.  

To find the total number of insects, we add the ants and bugs: 50 + 25 = 75 insects.


75 

"
"Okay, so there were 36 penguins chilling in the snow. Then, a third of them went swimming, which is 36 divided by 3, that's 12 penguins.  Another third went to eat, so that's another 12 penguins.  

So, 12 plus 12 is 24 penguins who aren't sunbathing anymore. That means 36 minus 24 equals 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.


12 

"
"Okay, so Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes a day, and his girlfriend eats half that, which is 3.  That means they eat a total of 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes a day.

If they eat 9 tomatoes a day, in a week they eat 9 x 7 = 63 tomatoes.

Each vine gives 3 tomatoes a week, so they need 63 / 3 = 21 vines.


21 

"
"Okay, so John has 20 friends and they each want 4 slices. That's 20 times 4, which is 80 slices in total.  Each pizza has 8 slices, so he needs 80 divided by 8, which is 10 pizzas. 

10 

"
"Okay, so Ram has 25 pens.  He can use 5 empty pens to make a new one.  That means he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

So he'll have his original 25 plus the 5 new ones, which is 30 pens! 


30
"
"Okay, so Johnny starts with $20 and adds $10 more, so that's $30 total.  If his money triples, it's like multiplying by 3: $30 x 3 = $90.

$90 

"
"Okay, so Jessa is 20. Joan is 5 years older than her, so Joan is 25. Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, making her 23.  If you add their ages together (20 + 25 + 23), you get 68.


68 

"
"Okay, so 30% of the students left through exit A, which is 300 students (cause 30/100 times 1000 is 300).

That means 700 students were left. Then, 3/5 of those students left through exit B, so that's 420 students (cause 3/5 times 700 is 420).

So, 280 students must have left through exit C. 



"
"Okay, so John has 54 candies and that's twice the amount Robert has.  That means Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so he has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James.


21 

"
"Okay, so Dolly has two books and Pandora has one. If they share, Dolly gets to read three books (her two plus Pandora's one). Pandora also gets to read three books (her one plus Dolly's two).  So together they read six books! 

6 

"
"Okay, so Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but now he only has 3.  Each of them sends him 2 letters a week, and he sends 2 back. That means he gets 3 * 2 = 6 letters a week, and he sends 6 letters a week too.

So that's 6 + 6 = 12 letters he writes and gets every week.

Each letter has 5 pages, so that's 12 * 5 = 60 pages he writes and reads every week.

He writes one page every 6 minutes, so 60 pages takes him 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 360 / 60 = 6 hours writing every week. 


6
"
"Okay, so Jason gets 1000 minutes a month. He talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day, and that's 15 times 30 days, which is 450 minutes. He also used another 300 minutes talking to other people.  So, he used 450 plus 300, which is 750 minutes.  That means he has 1000 minus 750, or 250 minutes left.


250 

"
"Okay, so Griffin started with 24 fries. Kyle took 5, and Billy took twice that, which is 10 fries. So together they took 15 fries. That means Griffin had 9 fries left. Then Colby took 3 less than Kyle, so he took 2 fries.  That leaves Griffin with 7 fries.  Since he ended up with 27, Ginger must have given him 20 fries! 



"
"Okay, so there's a bunch of snails in two tanks. One tank has 4 snails and the other has 32. That's a difference of 28 snails (32 - 4 = 28).

The problem says that difference in snails is twice the number of fish in *both* tanks.  So, we gotta divide that snail difference by 2 to find out how many fish are in each tank.

28 snails / 2 = 14 fish 


14 

"
"Okay, so the makeup artist charges $250 every hour, and it takes 6 hours each day to do Jean's makeup. That means it costs $250 * 6 = $1500 every day.

She needs it done 4 times a week, so that's $1500 * 4 = $6000 a week.

The movie takes 5 weeks, so the total cost before any discounts is $6000 * 5 = $30000.

But wait, there's a 10% discount! That means Jean saves $30000 * 0.10 = $3000.

So, Jean pays $30000 - $3000 = $27000 for all the makeup. 


$27000
"
"Okay, so Isabelle spent a bunch on the party: $12 for cake stuff, $43 on presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invites, and $22 on goodie bags.  That's a lot!

To find out how much each person pays, we gotta add it all up first: $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Then, since there are three people paying (Isabelle and her two parents), we divide the total by 3: $96 / 3 = $32


$32 

"
"Okay, so the chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag has 50 pounds of onions. That's 4 times 50, which is 200 pounds of onions in total.

Onions cost $1.50 per pound, so 200 pounds would cost 200 times $1.50.  That's $300.00!


$300.00 

"
"Okay, so Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday, that's 5 + 13 = 18 cookies total.

Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister on Monday, so she ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many as her sister, so she ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

That means Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies total.

Each cookie has 200 calories, so Sue ate 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.

Her sister ate 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister.


5600
"
"Okay, so there are 60 kids in the whole school.  Half are boys and half are girls, so that's 30 boys and 30 girls.  The first two classes have 15 + 12 = 27 girls. That means there are 3 girls in the third class. Since each class has 20 kids, there must be 20 - 3 = 17 boys in the third class.


17 

"
"Okay, so Travis starts with 61 apps. He gets rid of 9, so now he has 61 - 9 = 52 apps. Then he adds 18 more, so he has 52 + 18 = 70 apps. 

70 

"
"Okay, so Rick killed a bunch of animals. Last night it was 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today he got way more wolves, like three times as many cougars as yesterday, which is 12 cougars.  And he got 36 wolves today!  

So that's 10 + 36 = 46 wolves total.

And for cougars, it's 15 + 12 = 27 cougars total.

Altogether, he killed 46 + 27 = 73 animals. 

73 

"
"Okay, so Bill starts on the 3rd floor.  He goes up to a floor that's 4 times his starting floor plus 6 more.  

So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then you add 6, which makes 18.

Bill is on the 18th floor now! 



"
"Okay, so Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down 30% less than that, so she went down 30 - (30 * 0.30) = 21 times. Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, so he went down 21 * 4 = 84 times. 


84
"
"Okay, so there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, that's 10 times 20, which is 200 cows. Then Mr. Sylas gets 40 more cows.  So now there are 200 plus 40, which is 240 cows.

He puts the new cows in all the stalls, so now each stall has 240 cows divided by 20 stalls, which is 12 cows per stall.

If we want to know how many cows are in 8 stalls, we do 8 stalls times 12 cows per stall, which equals 96 cows.


96 

"
"Okay, let's see...

* He's got 100 pennies, which is a dollar.
* 40 nickels is like having 40 times 5 cents, so that's $2.00.
* 20 dimes is 20 times 10 cents, which is another $2.00.
* And 40 dollar bills is just $40.00!

So, if you add it all up: $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank. 



"
"Okay, so the tree is 200 feet tall and each 10-foot part weighs 400 pounds.  That means there are 20 parts to the tree (200 / 10 = 20).

So the whole tree weighs 8000 pounds (20 x 400 = 8000).

But termites ate 30% of it, which is like 2400 pounds (8000 x 0.30 = 2400).

That means the tree now weighs 5600 pounds (8000 - 2400 = 5600).


5600 

"
"Okay, so Nancy has 8 books that are each 50 cents late. That's 8 times 50 cents, which is 4 dollars.  Then she has to pay another 2 dollars because some of the books were late for more than a week. So in total, she owes 4 dollars plus 2 dollars, which is 6 dollars.

"Okay, so Andrea has 52 apples, and that's 8 more than Jamal.  That means Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Let's add up all the fruit: Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

Together they have 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.


168 

"
"Okay, so Carla needs two cups of flour for every 12 cookies.  She's making 36 today and 30 tomorrow, so that's 66 cookies total.  

Let's see... 66 divided by 12 is 5.5. So she needs 5 and a half dozens of cookies.  Since each dozen needs 2 cups of flour, she'll need 5.5 times 2 cups, which is 11 cups of flour.


11 

"
"Okay, so there are 9300 pennies, and we want to know how much two-thirds of them are worth in dollars.

First, we gotta figure out how many pennies are in two-thirds:

Two-thirds of 9300 is like saying (2/3) * 9300 = 6200 pennies.

Now, we know we have 6200 pennies.  There are 100 pennies in a dollar, so we divide: 6200 pennies / 100 pennies/dollar = $62.00


$62.00 

"
"Okay, so Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles each, that's 5 times 50 which is 250 marbles. Then she gets 20 more, so she has 250 plus 20, which is 270 marbles. 


270
"
"Okay, so Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half that, which is 3 trees.  Harry has twice the number Ferdinand has, which is 6 trees, plus 5 more, so he has 11 trees. That means Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 


8
"
"Okay, so Carmen has $100. Samantha has $25 more than that, so she has $125. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so she has $175.  To find out how much they have together, we add it all up: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.


400 

"
"Okay, so the house costs $350,000, but there's more to pay! The brokerage fee is 5% of the price, so that's like 5 out of every 100 dollars.  That's $17,500 more. Then there's the transfer fee, which is 12% of the price, so that's $42,000 more.

So, the total cost is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Mrs. Cruz only wants to spend $400,000, so she's $9,500 short. 


$9,500
"
"Okay, so Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000.  He had to pay some fees, like 3% for transfer stuff and 5% to the broker who helped him sell it. That's $12,000 for the transfer and $20,000 for the broker, so that's $32,000 in fees total.

He also had to pay back $250,000 that he still owed on the house.

So, to find out how much money he actually got, we do $400,000 (selling price) minus $32,000 (fees) minus $250,000 (loan) which equals $118,000.


$118,000 

"
"Okay, so it takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees. Then it takes longer to get to 400 degrees, like 40% longer.  That's 20 times 0.40 which is 8 more minutes. So, it takes 28 minutes total to heat up.

Then it takes 5 minutes less to cook than to heat up, so that's 28 minus 5, which is 23 minutes.

So, all together it takes 28 minutes to heat up plus 23 minutes to cook, which is 51 minutes. 


51 

"
"Okay, so he spent $5 on each newspaper ad and got 50 of them. That's 50 times 5, which is $250.  Then he spent $75 on each TV ad and got 15 of those. So that's 15 times 75, which is $1125.  To find the total, we add those together: $250 + $1125 = $1375.


$1375 

"
"Okay, so the juggler has 16 balls, and half are golf balls, which is 16 divided by 2, so that's 8 golf balls.  Then, half of those golf balls are blue, so that's 8 divided by 2, which equals 4. 

There are 4 blue golf balls. 

"
"Okay, so Mary has three bags of M&Ms. The first one has 300, the second one has 12 more than that, so that's 312. The third bag is kinda messed up and only has half the amount of the first bag, which is 150.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762

So Mary has 762 M&Ms in total. 



"
"Okay, so John has two houses, and each house has three bedrooms.  If each bedroom has two windows, that's 2 times 3, which is 6 windows per house from the bedrooms.  But wait, there are also 4 more windows in each house that aren't in bedrooms. So that's 6 plus 4, which is 10 windows per house. Since he has two houses, we do 10 times 2, and that gives us 20 windows total!


20 

"
"Okay, so she spends $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

If she paid with $20.00, her change is $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00


$5.00 

"
"Okay, so the sweater body needs 900 stitches. The collar is a tenth of that, so that's 90 stitches. The rosette is double the collar, so that's 90 x 2 = 180 stitches.

That means the body, collar, and rosette use 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

The whole sweater is 1800 stitches, so each sleeve uses (1800 - 1170) / 2 = 315 stitches.


315 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Rylan bought a bunch of seeds!  Let's see... 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 each is 20 times 40, which is $800.  Then she got 80 packets of celery seeds at $30 each, so that's 80 times 30, which is $2400.  To find the total, we add those together: $800 plus $2400 equals $3200.


$3200 

"
"Okay, so Sean has a lot to memorize! His song has 54 lines.  The first scene is double the song, which is 54 x 2 = 108 lines. But he only says a third of those, so that's 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

The second scene is 6 more lines than the song, so 54 + 6 = 60 lines. And he says 4 out of every 5 lines, so that's 60 x (4/5) = 48 lines.

To find the total, we add up all his lines: 36 + 48 + 54 = 138 lines. 

Whew, that's a lot of lines to remember!


138 

"
"Okay, so Carly starts with 80 cards.  First, we gotta figure out how many have the letter A. That's 2 out of every 5 cards, so that's (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Now she has 80 - 32 = 48 cards left. Half of those have B, so that's (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

That leaves 48 - 24 = 24 cards.  Five-eighths of those have C, so that's (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

Finally, 24 - 15 = 9 cards have the letter D. 


9 

"
"Okay, so Matthew takes 3 minutes for each small hole and he's digging 30 of those. That's 3 times 30, which is 90 minutes.  

Then he takes 10 minutes for each big hole and he's digging 15 of those. That's 10 times 15, which is 150 minutes.

Now we add those together: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is equal to 240 divided by 60, which is 4 hours.

"
"If their ages add up to 20 now, in 10 years they'll both be older.  So you gotta add 10 years to each of their ages, which means adding 20 to their total age now.

20 + 20 = 40 

40 

"
"Okay, so Ruby is way older than Sam right now.  In 9 years, Ruby will be three times Sam's age.  That means Sam will be a lot older too!

Let's see... if Ruby is 6 times older than Sam now, and in 9 years she'll be three times Sam's age, we gotta figure out how old Sam is now.

Hmm... I think Sam is 6 years old now. 



"
"Okay, so Peter bought 20 popsicles and each one cost 25 cents.  That's 20 times 0.25, which is $5.00. Then he got 4 ice cream bars at 50 cents each. So that's 4 times 0.50, which is $2.00.  To find the total, we add those together: $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00


$7.00 

"
"Okay, so a cobra has 70 spots and that's double the spots a mamba has.  That means a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras with 70 spots each, so they have a total of 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

There are 60 mambas with 35 spots each, so they have 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

All together, that's 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Half of that is 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.


2450
"
"Okay, so Maddy needs to feed a bunch of people! Let's see... 12 players times 2 guests each is 24 guests.  Then add the players and coaches, that's 12 + 24 + 3 = 39 people total.

Each pizza feeds 3 people, so she needs 39 divided by 3, which is 13 pizzas. If each pizza is $15, then 13 times 15 is... $195!

 
$195 

"
"Okay, so Katerina uses 8 topaz stones that are each 1 inch long, so that's 8 inches total for the topaz.  Her necklaces are 25 inches long, so the silver beads take up 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each bead is 1/4 inch long, so she uses 17 / 0.25 = 68 beads.


68 

"
"Okay, so Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40, and Margot wrote 60. That's 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories in the first week.

Then they doubled their stories in the second week. So Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

That means they wrote 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories in the second week.

To find the total, we add the stories from both weeks: 120 + 240 = 360 stories.


360 

"
"Okay, so Ann's brother is 9 * 2 = 18 years old right now.  In three years, he'll be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.


21 

"
"Okay, so Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents, so that's 5 times 25, which is 125 cents.  She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is 10 cents, so that's 2 times 10, which is 20 cents.  

So she has 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The pop costs 55 cents, so she'll have 145 - 55 = 90 cents left.


90 

"
"Okay, so there are 24 stars in the rows of 8 and 12 stars in the rows of 6. That's 36 stars total.  

That means there are 40 stars left for the rows of 5 (76 total stars - 36 stars = 40 stars).

Since each row of 5 has 5 stars, there must be 8 rows of 5 (40 stars / 5 stars per row = 8 rows).


8 

"
"Okay, so they need to move 80 flagstones and each one is 75 pounds. That's a lot of weight!  If each truck can only hold 2000 pounds, let's see... 80 times 75 is 6000 pounds total.  

Hmm, 6000 divided by 2000 is 3.  

They'll need 3 trucks. 


3 

"
"Okay, so the fast car is going 60 miles an hour, and the slow car is going half that, which is 30 miles an hour.  If the fast car goes 480 miles, we need to figure out how long it takes the slow car to go that same distance.

To do that, we can think about it like this: if the slow car goes 30 miles every hour, how many hours does it take to go 480 miles?  

It would take 16 hours! 



"
"Okay, so Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less, which is 17 medals.  That means they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals together.

If they have 10 times less medals than the total, then there must be 39 x 10 = 390 medals given out in total.


390 

"
"Okay, so there are 40 chocolate bars in total (8 packets x 5 bars). The adults get 24 bars (4 adults x 6 bars). That leaves 16 bars for the kids.  If 8 kids share those, they each get 2 bars. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Susan works for three hours, but she takes a 30 minute break. That means she actually works for 2 and a half hours.  

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 and a half hours is 150 minutes.

She makes $5 every 10 minutes, so we gotta see how many times 10 goes into 150. That's 15 times!

So she makes $5 times 15, which is $75. 


$75
"
"Okay, so Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 less than Mike, so he has 18 points. Tony has double Mike's points, which is 42 points.

After the third round, they have 21 + 18 + 42 = 81 points total.

Mike and Tony both get an extra point because they have more than 20 points. So now they have 81 + 1 + 1 = 83 points.


83 

"
"Okay, so Will has 15 oranges. His oldest son is 8, and his youngest is 4 because 8 divided by 2 is 4.  Together they wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. That means there are 15 - 12 = 3 oranges left. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Darren does a lot of exercises! 

On the first day, he does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. That's 100 + 50 + 20 = 170 exercises.

On the second day, he does 20 more pushups, so that's 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. He does 10 fewer squats, so that's 50 - 10 = 40 squats. And he doubles his dumbbell presses, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

On the second day, he does 120 + 40 + 40 = 200 exercises.

In total, over the two days, he does 170 + 200 = 370 exercises. 


370
"
"Okay, so they eat 0.2 kg of rice twice a day, so that's 0.2 x 2 = 0.4 kg per person each day.

Since there are 5 people, they eat a total of 0.4 x 5 = 2 kg of rice every day.

A 42 kg bag will last them 42 / 2 = 21 days.

That's 21 / 7 = 3 weeks! 


3 

"
"Okay, so Sam wanted to sell 120 crates of bread. He couldn't sell any on Monday or Friday, so that's two days less.  He sold a bunch over the weekend, then some more on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Let's add it all up: 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

He was trying to sell 120, but only sold 65, so he was 120 - 65 = 55 crates short.


55 

"
"Okay, so Carmen starts at $200. Then three other people bid, and each time the price goes up by $50.  So that's $50 + $50 + $50 = $150 more.  

That means the desk ends up costing Carmen $200 + $150 = $350.


$350 

"
"Okay, so John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home, so that's 60 miles a day. He works 5 days a week, so that's 60 times 5, which is 300 miles a week.  

He works for 50 weeks a year, so he drives 300 times 50, which is 15,000 miles a year.

Each mile costs $2, so that's 15,000 times 2, which is $30,000.

He also gives his driver $150 extra every month, and there are 12 months in a year, so that's 150 times 12, which is $1,800.

To find the total, we add the mileage cost and the bonus: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.


$31,800
"
"Okay, so Peter wants to exercise twice as long on Tuesday as he did on Sunday and Monday put together.  

Sunday was 23 minutes and Monday was 16 minutes, so that's 23 + 16 = 39 minutes total.

To exercise twice that long on Tuesday, he needs to go for 39 x 2 = 78 minutes.


78 

"
"You only need one piece of paper to make a 32-page tabloid! You just fold it in half. 



"
"Okay, so Annika started with $50. She spent half of that on food, which is $25. Then she spent another $10 on rides.  That means she spent a total of $25 + $10 = $35.  If she started with $50 and spent $35, she has $15 left.


$15
"
"Okay, so Elise sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice that many in the first year, so that's 45 x 2 = 90 books.  

That means she sold a total of 90 + 45 = 135 books in the first two years.

Since she has 50 books left, she sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in total.

That means she sold 200 - 135 = 85 books in the second year.

Each book costs $20, so she made 85 x $20 = $1700 in the second year.


$1700 

"
"Okay, so Watson works a lot! 10 hours a day is a long time.  

He makes $10 for every hour, so that's 10 times 10, which is $100 each day.

He works 5 days a week, so he makes $100 times 5, which is $500 a week.

But wait, there's a bonus! He gets an extra $300 if the company does good. So that's $500 plus $300, which is $800 a week.

April has 4 weeks, so he makes $800 times 4, which is $3200 for the whole month.


$3200 

"
"Okay, so John wins 80% of the time, which is like, really good!  If he arm wrestles 20 people, he probably wins a lot.  

To figure out how many he loses to, we gotta do some math. If he wins 80%, that means he loses 20% of the time.  

So, 20 people times 20% is 4 people. 


4 

"
"Okay, so they make 60 loaves. They sell 40 in the morning, which is like two-thirds of them. That leaves 20 loaves.  Then they sell half of those in the afternoon, so that's 10 loaves. 


10 

"
"Okay, so Joey loses 8 pounds in a month, which is like 2 pounds each week. Sandy takes longer to lose weight, like 4 weeks to lose the same amount Joey loses in one week. So, it would take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same 8 pounds.


4 

"
"Okay, so the ice cream is cheaper by $2 each now.  If you buy two tubs, that's $2 x 2 = $4 saved on ice cream.

The milk is 50 cents cheaper each, and you're getting four, so that's $0.50 x 4 = $2 saved on milk.

In total, you save $4 + $2 = $6! 



"
"Okay, so the serum gives you an extra arm every three days, and an extra leg every five days.  Let's see... after 15 days, that's five sets of three days for the arms, so that's 5 new arms! And for the legs, that's three sets of five days, so that's 3 new legs.  

That means a total of 8 new limbs! 


8
"
"Okay, so Theo has $6000.  He spends $600 on suits because 6 suits times $100 each is $600.  The suitcases cost $150, and the plane ticket is $1200 because it's $700 more than 5 times the price of a suit.

That means he's already spent $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

He wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $1950 = $4050 left.

If he wants to save $2000, he can spend $4050 - $2000 = $2050 on gifts. 


$2050
"
"Okay, so there are three people who eat 3 eggs each, so that's 3 times 3 which is 9 eggs. Then there are 2 people left who eat 2 eggs each, so that's 2 times 2 which is 4 eggs.  

That means they eat a total of 9 plus 4, which is 13 eggs every day. In a week, that's 13 times 7, which equals 91 eggs.


91 

"
"Okay, so Quinn is 30. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so she's 27.  Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so he's 32! 


32
"
"Okay, so Cera is 46 now, so six years ago she was 40. Noah was half her age then, so he was 20.  The problem says Chile's population was 3000 times Noah's age back then, so that's 3000 * 20 = 60,000 people. But that was just half the population now, so Chile has 60,000 * 2 = 120,000 people now.


120000 

"
"Okay, so there are 105 players in total.  The offense has twice as many players as the defense, and the special teams has half as many as the defense.  

Let's think about it like this: if we knew how many players were on defense, we could figure out the rest.  

Hmm... let's try some numbers. If there were 30 players on defense, then there would be 60 on offense (30 x 2) and 15 on special teams (30 / 2). That adds up to 105 players!


So the answer is 30. 

"
"Okay, so Martha invited a bunch of people. Two families have 6 people each, so that's 2 times 6, which is 12 people. Then three families have 4 people each, so that's 3 times 4, which is 12 more people.  That's a total of 24 people.

But then 8 people got sick and couldn't come. And 2 more people already had plans. So 8 plus 2 is 10 people who couldn't make it.

That means 24 minus 10 equals 14 people came to the party.


14 

"
"Okay, so Solomon starts with 50 marbles. Then he gets 20 more from Johanna, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 marbles. His dad gives him 2/5 times the amount he got from Johanna, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now he has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2 kgs, so all his marbles weigh 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.


156 

"
"Okay, so the pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep.  To find out how much water it holds, we gotta multiply those numbers together: 6 times 4 times 5 equals 120. So it holds 120 cubic feet of water.

Since it costs 10 cents to fill each cubic foot, we multiply 120 by 0.10. That gives us $12.00.


$12.00 

"
"Okay, so there are 30 boys.  There are 3 times as many girls, so that's 30 x 3 = 90 girls.  There are also 30 / 10 = 3 nongendered kids.

If you add them all up, there are 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 kids in the class. 


123
"
"Okay, so they need 3 electric wires for every 1 electric pole.  If they need 45 wires, that means there must be 15 poles because 45 divided by 3 is 15.


15 

"
"Okay, so there were 25 guys and 15 girls at the party.  That's 40 people total. Then a quarter of them left, which is 10 people. So 30 people stayed. If 22 of them are guys, that means 8 girls are left. 


8
"
"Okay, so the book costs $4, and the magazine is half that price.  That means the magazine costs $2. The pen is $1 cheaper than the magazine, so it costs $1. 


$1
"
"Okay, so Jam has 26 pencils total, and 2 of them aren't in boxes. That means she has 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in boxes.

If she and her sister have 24 + 46 = 70 pencils all together, they'd need enough boxes to hold all of them.

If each box holds, like, 8 pencils, they'd need 70 / 8 = 8.75 boxes.  You can't have part of a box, so they'd need 9 boxes. 


9 

"
"Okay, so Shannon wants her iced coffee super cold.  Each ice cube makes it 13 degrees colder but also makes it 12 ml weaker.  She needs to make it 65 degrees colder, so that's 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes.  That's 5 cubes * 12 ml/cube = 60 ml weaker just from the ice.

Then she adds 15 ml of cream, so it's 60 ml + 15 ml = 75 ml weaker in total.


75 

"
"Okay, so they got 7 new records, and you need 2 old ones to get a new one.  That means they traded in 7 times 2, which is 14 old records.


14 

"
"Okay, so there are 100 people working at the company.  Two-fifths of them are junior programmers, which is like saying 100 divided by 5 is 20, and then 2 times 20 is 40 junior programmers.

That means there are 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Junior programmers make $2000 each, so all the juniors together make 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers make $400 more than juniors, so they make $2000 + $400 = $2400 each.

All the seniors together make 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

To find the total, we add the junior and senior salaries: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.


So the company pays $224,000 to all the programmers each month.

"Okay, so 20 people were on the bus before the last stop.  Then 7 people got off, so there were 20 + 7 = 27 people on the bus.  Before that stop, 8 people got on, so there were 27 - 8 = 19 people. And 5 people got on at the first stop, so there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus at the beginning.


14 

"
"Okay, so Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2, so he has 22 left. Then he gives 14 to his friends, leaving him with 8. On his way home, he buys double the amount he gave away, which is 14 times 2, or 28 more lollipops! Now he has 8 plus 28, which is 36.  He eats 3 that night, so he has 33 left. Then he eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 31 lollipops. 


31
"
"Okay, so the phone is at 60% and needs to get to 100%. That means it needs 40% more charge.

It charges 1% every 3 minutes, so to get 40% it'll take 40 times 3 minutes, which is 120 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 120 minutes is equal to 2 hours. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Then her mom gives her a bunch more, so she has 17! But then she gives 3 to Ella.  That means she has 14 left. 


14
"
"Okay, so they spent $80 last time and get $1 off for every $20, so that's $80 / $20 = $4 in rewards.

This time they spent $43, and the coupon took twice the rewards off, so that's $4 * 2 = $8 off from the coupon.

So, they saved $4 + $8 = $12 total.

That means they paid $43 - $12 = $31 this time.


$31 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out.

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours, so that's $15 * 2000 = $30,000. But then they take out 20% for taxes, which is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. So Job A leaves Nick with $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Job B is a bit trickier. It's a flat $42,000, but they take out $6,000 right off the bat for property tax. That leaves $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. Then they take 10% for taxes on what's left, which is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. So Job B gives Nick $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Job B pays Nick $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400 more than Job A.


$8,400
"
"Okay, so there are 220 castles in Scotland, and 40% of them are ruins. That's like 220 divided by 100, which is 2.2, then times 40, which is 88 ruined castles.

Half of those are unmanned, so that's 88 divided by 2, which is 44.


44 

"
"Okay, so Furniture United wants $1350 first and then $350 every month for 6 months. That's like 6 times $350, which is $2100.  So that's $2100 plus the $1350, which is $3450 total.

Cozy Homes wants $1100 first and then $250 every month for 9 months. So that's 9 times $250, which is $2250.  Add that to the $1100 and it's $3350.

Hmm, $3450 minus $3350 is $100.  

So Furniture United is $100 more expensive. 



"
"Okay, so they have 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns altogether.  If they split them up evenly, each person gets 24 / 4 = 6 guns. 


6
"
"Okay, so Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for each batch of suckers, and he's making 8 batches. That's 30 times 8, which is 240 ounces.  Then he needs 70 ounces for the fudge.  So in total, he needs 240 plus 70 ounces, which is 310 ounces.


310 

"
"Okay, so Maria starts with 8 shares at $8 each, that's 8 times 8, which is $64.

The first year, the price goes up 50%, so that's half of $8, which is $4 more per share. Now each share is worth $12.

The next year, the price goes down 25%, which is a quarter of $12, or $3. So each share is now worth $9.

Since she has 8 shares, they're worth 8 times $9, which is $72.


$72 

"
"Okay, so Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times that, so he ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs. John ate half of what Thomas ate, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.  That means John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. 


1 

"
"Okay, so there are 200 students in total.  Two groups are the same size, and the third group is 10 smaller.  

Let's think about it like this: if we take those 10 students and add them to the smaller group, then all three groups would be the same size.

So, 200 + 10 = 210 students would be split evenly into three groups.

That means each of the bigger groups would have 210 / 3 = 70 students.

Since the smallest group is 10 less than that, it has 70 - 10 = 60 students.


60
"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and they're all chickens or cows. He has double the amount of chickens compared to cows.  

To figure out the total number of legs, we gotta think about how many cows and chickens there are. If we say there are 'x' cows, then there are '2x' chickens.

If we add those together, we get x + 2x = 60 animals. That means 3x = 60, so x = 20 cows.

That means there are 20 * 2 = 40 chickens.

Cows have 4 legs each, so that's 20 * 4 = 80 legs from the cows.

Chickens have 2 legs each, so that's 40 * 2 = 80 legs from the chickens.

In total, all the animals have 80 + 80 = 160 legs!


160 

"
"Okay, so Josh starts with 3 balls. Then he adds one more each week for four weeks, so that's 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 balls.

But then he drops 3!  Two come back, but one is gone. So he has 6 - 3 + 2 = 5 balls left. 


5 

"
"Okay, so the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.  The beetle and toad are the same as the frog, so they're also 50 pounds. The snake is 10 pounds heavier than the frog, making it 60 pounds. The bird is 20 pounds lighter than the frog, so it's 30 pounds.

If you add up all the animals, it's 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

But don't forget the container weighs 20 pounds too! So the total is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.


210 

"
"Okay, so Laurel got 24 outfits at first. Then she got double that at her shower, which is 24 times 2, or 48 outfits.  That's a lot of clothes!  Then her mom gave her 15 more.  To find the total, we add them all up: 24 + 48 + 15 = 87 outfits. 


87
"
"Okay, so Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 more, which is like 5000 divided by 5, which is 1000 meters more. So now he runs 6000 meters a day.

June has 30 days, so he runs 6000 meters times 30 days, which is 180,000 meters! 


180000 

"
"Okay, so Juice Box A costs $4. Juice Box B is $5 more, so it's $4 + $5 = $9. Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, making it $4 + $7 = $11.  

To find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we do $11 - $9 = $2.


$2 

"
"Okay, so there are 40 tables with 4 legs each, that's 40 times 4 which equals 160 legs. Then there are 50 tables with 3 legs each, so that's 50 times 3 which is 150 legs.  To find the total, we add those together: 160 plus 150 equals 310 legs.


310 

"
"Okay, so Jenny buys a bag of 36 cookies every week. Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so that's 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.  

Together they eat 20 + 7 = 27 cookies. That means Jenny eats 36 - 27 = 9 cookies. 


9 

"
"Okay, so Davos got a good deal!  

Each shirt was $30, but he saved 40%, which is like $30 / 100 * 40 = $12 off each shirt.

So each shirt cost him $30 - $12 = $18.

Since he bought two shirts, he paid $18 * 2 = $36 in total.


$36 

"
"Okay, so they used to make $1000 a day selling tractors (10 tractors x $100 each). Now they make $1100 a day selling silos (5 silos x $220 each).  That's $100 more each day!

To figure out the percentage, I think of it like this:  $100 is 10% of $1000. So they're making 10% more now.


10 

"
"Okay, so Madeline spends $25 a week on dog food, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so that's $25 x 4 = $100 a month on food.

Then she spends $20 on treats each month and $100 on medicine each month.

To find out how much she spends in a year, we add up her monthly costs: $100 + $20 + $100 = $220 per month.

Finally, we multiply that by 12 months to get the yearly cost: $220 x 12 = $2640.


2640 

"
"Okay, let's see...

* Yoga is one hour.
* Cooking class is three times longer than yoga, so that's 1 hour * 3 = 3 hours.
* Cheese tasting is half an hour.
* The museum is half as long as cooking, so that's 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours.
* Errands take 2 hours.

Adding it all up: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours


8 

"
"Okay, so they need 30 pots for the daisies and double that for roses, which is 30 x 2 = 60 pots.  That's a total of 30 + 60 = 90 pots.  Since April already has 100, she has 100 - 90 = 10 pots leftover.


10 

"
"Okay, so Andrea started with $36. She bought a sweater for $11, so she had $36 - $11 = $25 left. Then she gave her brother $4, leaving her with $25 - $4 = $21.

That means Andrea saved $21. 



"
"Okay, so John did a bunch of stuff on vacation. He boated for 6 hours and swam for half that time, which is 3 hours. He also watched three shows that were each 2 hours long, so that's 6 hours of shows.

That means he spent 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours doing those things.  

We know that was only 30% of his whole vacation. To figure out his total vacation time, we can think of it like this: if 15 hours is 30%, then 10% is 15 hours / 3 = 5 hours.

That means his whole vacation was 5 hours * 10 = 50 hours long!

He spent 40% of that time sightseeing, so he spent 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours sightseeing.


20 

"
"Okay, so Annabelle wants a phone that costs $400 and she already has $80.  

From her first job, she'll make $10 an hour for 20 hours, so that's $10 * 20 = $200.

Her second job pays $5 an hour for 15 hours, so that's $5 * 15 = $75.

Altogether she's made $200 + $75 = $275 from her jobs.

Now add that to her savings: $275 + $80 = $355.

She needs $400 and has $355, so she still needs $400 - $355 = $45. 


$45
"
"Okay, so the shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The next tree is 5 feet taller than that, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.  

To find out how tall the tallest tree is, we add the heights of the first two trees: 6 + 11 = 17 feet. Then we double that because the tallest tree is twice as tall: 17 x 2 = 34 feet.


34 

"
"Okay, so Dean starts with $28.  The cars cost $2 each, and he buys 6, so that's 6 times 2, which is $12. The teddy bears are $1 each, and he gets 5, so that's 5 times 1, which is $5.  

So the cars and bears cost $12 + $5 = $17. That means he has $28 - $17 = $11 left. Then his mom gives him another $10, so he has $11 + $10 = $21.


$21 

"
"Okay, so Morgan has $90 and she needs to pay for herself too. Mini-golf is $5, arcade tokens are $5, and go-karts are $10 a ride, and she wants to ride those twice, so that's $10 x 2 = $20.  

That means each friend costs $5 + $5 + $20 = $30 to hang out with.

Morgan has $90 and it costs her $30 to have fun, so she has $90 - $30 = $60 left for friends.

She can invite $60 / $30 per friend = 2 friends. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Marisa gets $5 every day.  She spends $1 on lollipops, which leaves her with $4 to save each day. If she does this for 5 days, she'll save a total of $20. 


$20.00
"
"Okay, so Billy had $10 and spent some on candy.  We know gumballs cost 5 cents each and he bought 40, so those cost him $2.00 (40 x $0.05 = $2.00). That means he had $8.00 left after buying candy ($10 - $2 = $8.00).

He spent half of that on candy, so the candy cost $4.00 ($8.00 / 2 = $4.00).

Since candy costs $1.50 a pound, he bought 2.67 pounds of candy ($4.00 / $1.50 = 2.67).


2.67 

"
"Okay, so Carver is 45.  That's 5 years less than double his son's age.  To figure out the son's age, we gotta think backwards.

If Carver was double his son's age, he'd be 5 years older, so 45 + 5 = 50.

That means double the son's age is 50.  So, the son's age is 50 / 2 = 25.


25 

"
"Okay, so the train goes 75 miles, then 100 miles, and then 50 miles less than that total to get back to the start.  That means the trip back is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

So the whole trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

It does that three times a day, so that's 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles a day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so it can go 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days before needing service. 


20 

"
"Okay, so a Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds. A collie bed is right in the middle, so it needs (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds of stuffing.

He's making 4 chihuahua beds, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

For the collie beds, he needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, he needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing. 


23
"
"Okay, so John drives 200 miles to his friend's house, but then he has to go 10 extra miles because of a detour. That means he drives 210 miles going there.  He goes 70 miles per hour, so that takes him 3 hours (210 / 70 = 3).

Then he drives home, which is 240 miles, and he goes 80 miles per hour. That also takes 3 hours (240 / 80 = 3).

So the whole trip takes 6 hours (3 + 3 = 6).


6 

"
"Okay, so there are 96 kids in fourth grade, and 43 are girls. That means there are 96 - 43 = 53 boys.  But 4 boys were absent, so there were 53 - 4 = 49 boys at school.


49 

"
"Okay, so there are twice as many boys as girls, meaning there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys.  

To find the total, we add the boys and girls: 12 + 6 = 18 kids.


18 

"
"Okay, so Jane needs 42 points to pass. She already has 15 + 18 = 33 points.  That means she needs 42 - 33 = 9 more points on her last test.


9 

"
"Okay, so 3 people got kicked out for not wearing masks. Then 3 times 4 is 12, and 12 minus 5 is 7 people who got kicked out for stealing.  That's a lot of shoplifters!  Then 7 times 3 is 21 people who got into fights over stuff on sale.  So that's 3 plus 7 plus 21, which is 31 people in total for those reasons.  If 50 people got kicked out, then 50 minus 31 is 19 people who got kicked out for other stuff.


19 

"
"Okay, so Erin has 14 points now, and that's three times more than Sara. Sara has 8 points.  That means Erin had 24 points before she scored more.  If she has 24 now and 14 now, she must have had 10 points before.


10 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much all the senior gifts will cost.

The picture frames are $20 each, and there are 44 seniors, so that's 44 times 20, which is $880.

Each frame also needs to be etched, and that costs 20% more.  20% of 20 is 4 dollars, so each frame costs $4 extra to etch.  That means etching all the frames will cost 44 times 4, which is $176.

Two seniors get pins that cost $5 each, so those are 2 times 5, which is $10.

One-fourth of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 divided by 4, which is 11 officers.  They each need cords that cost $12, so that's 11 times 12, which is $132.

Now we add up all the costs: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198



"
"Okay, so the wallpaper costs $400, but if you make it yourself you save 20%.  That means you save $80 (because 20% of 400 is 80). So, making it yourself would cost $320.


$320 

"
"Okay, so they sold 14 shoes on Friday. Then on Saturday, they sold double that, which is 14 times 2, so 28 shoes.  On Sunday, they sold half of what they did on Saturday, which is 28 divided by 2, so 14 shoes. But then 6 people brought shoes back, so they actually sold 14 minus 6, which is 8 shoes on Sunday.

To find the total, we add up all the shoes sold each day: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 shoes.


50 

"
"Okay, so Hallie dances for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays.  On Saturdays, she dances for twice as long as Tuesday, which is 1 hour * 2 = 2 hours.

So in total, she dances 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 hours a week. 

5 

"
"Okay, so they bought a bunch of stuff worth $400,000, but 40% of it was broken.  That means 60% of it worked.  To find out how much the good stuff cost, we gotta do 60% of $400,000.

60% is like 60 out of 100, so we can do (60/100) * $400,000 = $240,000


$240,000 

"
"Okay, so Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them give 1 kg of milk each, and the other half give 2 kg each.  

That means 15 sheep give 1 kg of milk, so that's 15 kg total.

The other 15 sheep give 2 kg each, so that's 30 kg total.

If you add those together, she gets 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg of milk every day.


45 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Sherman had 12 rolls and gave 6 to her kids. That leaves 6 rolls for the chickens.  She cuts each of those rolls into 8 pieces, so that's 6 times 8, which is 48 pieces.


48 

"
"Okay, so half the class likes blue, which is 40 / 2 = 20 kids.  That leaves 20 kids who like other colors.  If a fourth of those like green, that's 20 / 4 = 5 kids.  So the rest, 20 - 5 = 15 kids, must like yellow!


15 

"
"Okay, so Lucy made $56 selling apples on Monday, and each apple costs $4. That means she sold $56 / $4 = 14 apples on Monday.

Then she picked 12 apples on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she picked double that amount, so she picked 12 * 2 = 24 apples.

To find the total, we add up the apples from each day: 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples.


50 

"
"Okay, so Lindsay has 50 socks to wash. She washes 10 pairs, which is 20 socks (10 times 2). Then she washes 15 more socks that were just by themselves.  So she washed 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

That means she missed 50 - 35 = 15 socks. 


15
"
"Okay, so Rachel starts with 23 cookies and then gets a bunch more from Janet, so she has 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.  But then her brother eats a ton, 44 cookies!  That means she has 65 - 44 = 21 cookies left. 


21
"
"Okay, so Karan borrowed some money and has to pay it back with interest.  

First, we gotta figure out how much extra she has to pay because of the interest. It's 10% of the money she borrowed, which is $3650, for five months.  

That means the interest is (10/100) * $3650 * 5 = $1825.

So, in total, she has to pay back $3650 + $1825 = $5475.

Since she pays the same amount each month, we divide that by 5 months: $5475 / 5 = $1095.


So the answer is $1095. 

"
"Okay, so Cho hiked for a long time! 14 kilometers every hour for 8 hours is a lot of walking. That's 14 times 8, which is 112 kilometers. Chloe only hiked for 5 hours at 9 kilometers an hour. So she hiked 9 times 5, which is 45 kilometers.  To find out how much farther Cho hiked, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance. 112 minus 45 is 67.

So Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe. 



"
"Okay, so Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has double his silver pesos, so she has 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos.  She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, meaning she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

To find the total, we add up all the silver pesos: 50 + 100 = 150. Then we add up all the gold pesos: 80 + 120 = 200. Finally, we add the silver and gold pesos together: 150 + 200 = 350 pesos.


350 

"
"Okay, so Millie spends $18 on stuff to make the lemonade.  She can make 36 cups (3 pitchers times 12 cups each). If she sells each cup for a dollar, she'll make $36.  

So, she makes $36 and spends $18, which means she makes a profit of $18.

But she sells 4 cups every hour, so she's making $4 every hour.  

That means her profit per hour is $2. 



"
"Okay, so Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares left, and that's like 2 out of 5 of his whole land.  To find out how much he started with, we gotta figure out what 5 out of 5 would be.

If 2 out of 5 is 12.8 hectares, then 1 out of 5 is 12.8 divided by 2, which is 6.4 hectares.

So, 5 out of 5 (the whole thing) is 6.4 times 5, which equals 32 hectares.


32 

"
"Okay, so there are 52 people in the choir, and half are girls, so that's 52 / 2 = 26 girls.  But then half of them can't make it, so that's 26 / 2 = 13 girls who can't sing.  That means 26 - 13 = 13 girls can sing.  And the teachers help out, so there are 13 + 3 = 16 people singing.


16 

"
"Okay, so Wilson needs an 80 to get the car.  Let's add up his test scores: 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400.  Then we divide that by 5 because he took 5 tests: 400 / 5 = 80.

80 

"
"Okay, so 6 erasers cost 6 times $2, which is $12.  And 8 pencils cost 8 times $3, which is $24.  If you add those together, 12 plus 24 is 36.


36 

"
"Okay, so James takes 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.  He takes way fewer to Mr. Yu, only a third of that amount.  So that's 66 divided by 3, which is 22 messages for Mr. Yu.  

To find the total, we add them up: 66 + 22 = 88 messages.


88 

"
"Okay, so David gets the bracelet for $30 and can ride all the rides. Dasha has to buy tickets for each ride. That's 9 rides times 2 tickets per ride, which is 18 tickets.  Since each ticket is $2, she spends 18 times 2, which is $36.  

David saved $36 - $30 = $6. 


6
"
"Okay, so Monica has a bunch of gifts to wrap! Let's see... 6 for family, 4 for friends, and 2 for teachers. That's 12 gifts total. She has 144 inches of ribbon, and wants to use it all for bows.  

If she uses the same amount for each bow, she can use 144 inches divided by 12 gifts, which equals 12 inches per bow.


12 

"
"Okay, so Betty and Sam have popsicles in a 5:6 ratio, which means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  They have a total of 165 popsicles together.

To figure out how many more popsicles Sam has, we need to see how many popsicles are in each ""part"" of the ratio.  

If we add the ratio parts (5 + 6 = 11), and then divide the total popsicles by that (165 / 11 = 15), we know each ""part"" is worth 15 popsicles.

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.

Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

That means Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Okay, so Tim's cable is $60 a month. Netflix is $10. Hulu and Disney Plus together are usually $20, but he gets a deal for bundling them, so he saves 20% of $20, which is $4. That means they only cost him $16 together. So, all his streaming stuff costs $10 + $16 = $26.  He saves $60 - $26 = $34 by switching!


$34 

"
"Okay, so Carol spends 4 hours writing, then half of that recording, which is 2 hours.  Then she spends 90 minutes editing, which is the same as 1 and a half hours.

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we gotta add up all the time first: 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

Now we divide the editing time (1.5 hours) by the total time (7.5 hours) and multiply by 100 to get the percentage: (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

"
"Okay, so Wendy has a bookshelf with 6 rows and 6 columns, that's like 6 times 6 which is 36 spots for books.  She wants to double that, so that's 36 times 2 which is 72 books. But wait, she wants 20 *more* than double, so we add 20 to 72. That means she needs 92 books! 


92 

"
"Okay, so Erica starts with 20 cards and her dad gives her 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 more cards.  That means she has 20 + 30 = 50 cards total.

Then she gives 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.  

So she has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

But wait! She gets 17 more from family and friends, so she ends up with 21 + 17 = 38 cards.


38 

"
"Okay, so Jenny starts with 12 slices. Bill gets a third, which is 4 slices, and Mark gets a fourth, which is 3 slices.  That's 7 slices gone already. If Jenny eats 2, then there are 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 slices left. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Mark needs $300 for the bike and he already has $50. That means he needs to save $250 more.  If he makes $10 each day, it will take him 25 days to save enough. 


25
"
"Okay, so Nancy saw 90 spiders.  Then she saw 90 spiders divided by 3, which is 30 millipedes.  

Then she saw twice the number of millipedes, so that's 30 times 2 which is 60. But then she saw 12 less than that, so 60 minus 12 is 48 stink bugs.

To find the total, we add up all the bugs: 90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 168 bugs. 


168 

"
"Okay, so Erica is 30. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth is 35.  Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 42. That means Alice is 12 years older than Erica. 


12
"
"Okay, so John drinks two glasses of milk, and each glass has 8 ounces. That's 2 times 8, which is 16 ounces of milk total.  Milk has 3 calories in every ounce, so 16 times 3 is 48 calories.


48 

"
"Okay, so he works 4 weeks a month, and each week has 6 days, so that's 4 times 6 which is 24 days every month.  

In a year, there are 12 months, so he works 24 times 12 days, which is 288 days.

He makes $50 each day, so he earns 288 times 50 dollars, which is $14,400 in a year.


$14,400 

"
"Okay, so Mark needs four times the normal amount of stuff for his brownies.  That means he needs 3 cups of flour times 4, which is 12 cups of flour. Flour comes in 2-cup bags, so he needs 12 divided by 2, which is 6 bags of flour.

He needs 1 cup of milk times 4, which is 4 cups of milk. Milk comes in 2-cup bottles, so he needs 4 divided by 2, which is 2 bottles of milk.

He needs 6 bags of flour minus 2 bottles of milk, which is 4 more bags of flour.

"
"Okay, so Mel saves 5 hours of AC time each day.  That means he's using it 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours a day.

His AC uses 900 watts each hour, so that's 900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watts a day.

But the question wants to know how much he saves, so we gotta figure out how many watts he used before: 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watts a day.

He saves 7200 watts - 2700 watts = 4500 watts each day.

Now, there are 1000 watts in a kilowatt, so he saves 4500 watts / 1000 watts/kilowatt = 4.5 kilowatts each day.

Over 30 days, that's 4.5 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatts.


135 

"
"Okay, so there are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. Then there's one with 36 stripes, and another with half of that, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.  

In total, all the zebras have 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

Since there are 4 zebras, the average is 88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra.


22 

"
"Okay, so Tyson needs enough sandwiches for 20 people, and each sandwich feeds 4. That means he needs 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich uses 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so he needs 5 pounds of each.

Meat costs $7 per pound, so that's 5 * $7 = $35.

Cheese costs $3 per pound, so that's 5 * $3 = $15.

In total, he'll spend $35 + $15 = $50 on meat and cheese. 


$50.00
"
"Okay, so Allan starts with 40 cannolis, and he has twice that amount of corn, which is 40 x 2 = 80 corns.

Then he buys 60 more cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

But he buys 40 less corn than cannolis, so he gets 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

That means he has 80 + 60 = 140 corns in total.

Finally, he has 140 corns + 100 cannolis = 240 corns and cannolis altogether.


240 

"
"Okay, so Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps. He does half of them going to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. Then he walks 1,000 more with his friend. That's 6,000 steps total.  If he only needs 2,000 more steps after his jog, he must have done 2,000 steps jogging. 


2,000
"
"Okay, so Toby has a book with 45 pages and each page has 200 words. That's a lot of words!  He reads super fast, 300 words every minute.  He needs to be at the airport in an hour, but it takes 10 minutes to get there.

Let's see... 45 pages times 200 words per page is 9000 words total.  If he reads 300 words a minute, it'll take him 30 minutes to finish the book.  

So, reading takes 30 minutes, plus 10 minutes to get to the airport, that's 40 minutes total. He has a whole hour, so he'll be 20 minutes early!


20 

"
"Okay, so they hired 40 people in May and paid them $15 an hour for 40 hours a week. That's like $15 times 40, which is $600 a week.  Then they worked 4 weeks in May, so that's $600 times 4, which is $2400 each person made in May.

Since there were 40 people, the company paid out $2400 times 40, which is $96,000 in May.

In June, a quarter of the people left, so that's 40 divided by 4, which is 10 people. That means 30 people were left.

They still made $2400 each in June, so the company paid $2400 times 30, which is $72,000 in June.

To find the total, we add the May and June amounts: $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000


$168,000 

"
"Okay, so Sally starts with $10.00. The taffy is kinda tricky. One pound is $3.00, but the second pound is half off, so that's $1.50.  So the taffy costs $3.00 + $1.50 = $4.50. The seashells are $1.50, and the magnets are $0.25 each, and she got 4, so those are $1.00.

Let's add up what she spent: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

If she started with $10.00 and spent $7.00, she has $3.00 left. 


$3.00
"
"Okay, so Tim buys fireworks that cost $400, and then another pack that's twice as much, so that's $400 * 2 = $800.  

That means the fireworks cost $400 + $800 = $1200 before the discount.

He gets 20% off, so the discount is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

That makes the fireworks $1200 - $240 = $960.

And don't forget the big finale firework for $150!

So in total, he spent $960 + $150 = $1110. 



"
"Okay, so Shannon eats 2 cookies every night, and she wants them to last a whole month, which is 30 days.  That means she needs 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.

Her recipe only makes 12 cookies at a time, which is a dozen. So, she needs to make 60 / 12 = 5 dozens of cookies.


5 

"
"Okay, so 1% of the candles will explode, right? That's 500 candles out of 50,000.  And then 5% of *those* stinky ones will smell like wet dog. So that's 5% of 500, which is 25 candles. 


25
"
"Okay, so each blouse is normally $20, but they're 30% off.  That means each one is $6 cheaper (cause 30% of 20 is 6). So each blouse costs $14.  If she buys 4, it's $14 times 4, which is $56.


$56 

"
"Okay, so Joanne got 30 apples from the tall trees and half that from the short trees, which is 15.  Her sister got double the apples from the tall trees, so that's 30 x 2 = 60 apples. And she got three times the apples from the short trees, so that's 15 x 3 = 45 apples.

Together they got 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tall and short trees.

That means Joanne got 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.


350
"
"Okay, so we've got camels and dromedaries hanging out.  They have a total of 180 heads, which means there are 180 animals all together.  

We also know they have 304 humps. Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one.

Hmm, let's think... if we had all camels, there would be double the humps, right? So, we know there have to be some dromedaries to make the hump number lower.

This is kinda tricky, but I think we can figure it out! 


Let me see... 56 dromedaries! That would be 56 humps.  

Let me double check... 180 - 56 = 124 camels. That's 248 humps from the camels.  

56 dromedaries + 248 humps from the camels = 304 humps!

I think there are **56** dromedaries. 

"
"Okay, so Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for the first four days, so that's 200 x 4 = 800 kilometers.

Then he traveled less for two days, only 30% of the first four days, which is 800 x 0.30 = 240 kilometers.

He took a break for one day, so no kilometers there.

In the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for seven days, so that's 300 x 7 = 2100 kilometers.

To find the total, we add up all the kilometers: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.


3140 

"
"Okay, so Peter's locker is like a quarter the size of Zack's.  If Peter's is 5 cubic inches, then Zack's must be 5 times bigger, which is 25 cubic inches.  Timothy's locker is twice as big as Zack's, so it's 25 times 2, which is 50 cubic inches. 


50 

"
"Okay, so Stanley's comb fell from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet.  Oliver is at 3,000 feet.  That means Oliver has to climb 3,000 feet to get to where the comb is. 


3000
"
"Okay, so Mr. Josue got $4000 from the first bank. The second bank gave him double that, which is $4000 x 2 = $8000.  

That means he got a total of $4000 + $8000 = $12000 from the banks.

He already had $5000, so now he has $5000 + $12000 = $17000!


$17000 

"
"Okay, so there were 50 cats on the rock. Then, 4 boats came and each took 5 cats, so that's 4 times 5 which is 20 cats gone.  That leaves 50 minus 20, which is 30 cats.

Then, 3 out of every 5 of those cats ran off, so that's 30 divided by 5, which is 6, and then times 3, which is 18 cats.

So, 30 minus 18 is 12 cats left on the rock.


12 

"
"Okay, so Bill gets a deal for the first 6 months, then the price goes up. Let's see...

* The first part is easy: 6 months times $8 is $48.
* Then it's $12 a month for 8 months, so that's 8 times 12, which is $96.
*  Finally, it goes up to $14 a month for another 8 months. That's 8 times 14, which is $112.

Now we add it all up: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

So two years of the streaming service cost Bill $256. 



"
"Okay, so Cole got both jeans on sale, right? The tattered ones were $28, and the jogger ones were $6 cheaper, so they were $22.  He saved a total of $6, but we don't really need that info to figure out how much more the jogger jeans cost originally.

Since the jogger jeans were the same price as the tattered jeans before the sale, they cost the same amount originally.


0 

"
"Okay, so they have 4 big buses that can fit 60 people each. That's 4 times 60, which is 240 people. Then there are 6 smaller buses that hold 30 people each, so that's 6 times 30, which is 180 people. And lastly, there are 10 tiny vans that hold 15 people each, so that's 10 times 15, which is 150 people.

If you add all those up, 240 plus 180 plus 150, you get 570 people!


570 

"
"Okay, so Lillian made 3 bird feeders and bought 3 more.  The ones she bought each get 20 birds, so that's 3 times 20, which is 60 birds.  But her homemade ones are way cooler, they get 10 more birds each, so that's 30 birds per feeder!  So those get 3 times 30, which is 90 birds.  

If you add those together, she gets 60 + 90 = 150 birds!


150 

"
"Okay, so the bagel cost $4. The soup was 25% more, so that's like a quarter more. A quarter of $4 is $1, so the soup cost $4 + $1 = $5. The cake was half the price of the bagel, so it cost $4 / 2 = $2.  

To find the total, we add up the prices: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.


11
"
"Okay, so Kenny wants to go to the amusement park and needs $100. He has some Pokemon cards he's gonna sell for $1.50 each. He keeps some for himself, but after selling some, he has $50 left over to spend at the park.  

That means he made $50 from selling the cards, right?  

If each card is $1.50, he sold $50 / $1.50 = 33 cards.

But he only sold 2/3 of his cards, so to find out how many he started with, we gotta do a little more math. If 33 cards is 2/3, then 1/3 is 33 / 2 = 16.5 cards.

That doesn't make sense, you can't have half a card! So let's think... if 1/3 is about 16 cards, then 3/3 (the whole amount) is about 16 x 3 = 48 cards.

So Kenny probably started with about 50 cards. 


50 

"
"Okay, so the caterer thought half the people would want two hot dogs, so he made enough for 36 / 2 = 18 people to have two. That's 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs, plus another 18 for the rest, for a total of 54 hot dogs.

But then 40 people showed up!  That means only 54 / 2 = 27 people could get two hot dogs.

So 40 - 27 = 13 people didn't get a second hot dog. 


13
"
"Okay, so Indras' name has 6 letters.  Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name.  Half of Indras' name is 6 divided by 2, which is 3.  So her sister's name has 3 plus 4 letters, which is 7 letters.  That means together they have 6 + 7 = 13 letters in their names.


13 

"
"Okay, so Charlotte's pots and pans are $120, the bowls are $20, and the utensils are 5 times $5, which is $25.  That's a total of $120 + $20 + $25 = $165 before the discount.

But wait, everything's 20% off!  So we gotta figure out 20% of $165.  That's like 20 cents out of every dollar, so 20% of $165 is $33.

Finally, we take the original price and subtract the discount: $165 - $33 = $132.


$132.00 

"
"Okay, so Dora wants to buy stuff that costs $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.  She has $2 + $16 = $18.  

She needs $19 - $18 = $1 more. 


$1
"
"Okay, so Thaddeus killed 100 dragons. Arthur killed 3/4 of that, which is 75. Walter killed twice as many as Arthur, so he got 150.  Bruce killed 1/5 of what Walter did, so he killed 30 dragons. 


30 

"
"Okay, so they split 15 gallons of gas into 5 containers, so each container has 3 gallons (15 / 5 = 3).  Josey needs a quarter of a container, which is 0.75 gallons (3 / 4 = 0.75).  

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, Josey needs 6 pints of gas (0.75 x 8 = 6).


6 

"
"Okay, so George had $5 and spent 1% of it, which is like 5 cents. That means he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95 on snacks.

He bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents, so that's 3 * $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

That means he spent $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 on candy bars.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so he bought $3.75 / $0.75 = 5 candy bars.


5 

"
"Okay, so Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5. That means he had 20 left to share.  He has 4 friends, so if he splits them evenly, each friend gets 5 lollipops. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Rory starts with a 20-ounce cake and cuts it into 8 slices.  She and her mom each eat one, so that's 2 slices gone. That leaves 6 slices left.  If the whole cake was 20 ounces, and there are 8 slices, each slice weighs 20 divided by 8, which is 2.5 ounces.  So, the 6 slices left weigh 6 times 2.5, which is 15 ounces.


15 

"
"Okay, so Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22. That's a total of 56 oranges!  They're sharing with 6 friends, so there are 8 people in total. If they split the oranges evenly, each person gets 7 oranges. 


7 

"
"Okay, so Antoine needs a lot of onions!  He's using double the normal amount, which is 2 pounds times 2, so that's 4 pounds of onions.  Those onions will cost him 4 times $2, which is $8.  The beef stock is $2 a box and he needs two boxes, so that's another $4.  All together, the soup stuff costs $8 + $4 = $12.  Since he's making enough for 6 people, each serving costs $12 divided by 6, which is $2. 


$2
"
"Okay, so Bernadette's drive is four times longer than Wayne's drive, which takes 4 minutes. That means Bernadette's drive is 4 times 4, which is 16 minutes long.  She also wants to get there 5 minutes before Wayne. So, she needs to leave 16 minutes + 5 minutes = 21 minutes before Wayne.


21 

"
"Okay, so Billie's room is 360 square feet.  And it's 3 yards long, which is the same as 9 feet. To find the width, we divide the area by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now, to find the perimeter, we add up all the sides: 9 feet + 40 feet + 9 feet + 40 feet = 98 feet.


98 

"
"Okay, so Elizabeth has one pack of red beads and two packs of clear beads. That's 1 pack + 2 packs = 3 packs total.

Margareth has 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red, so that's 3 packs + 4 packs = 7 packs total.

Each pack has 20 beads, so Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads.

Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

To see how many more beads Margareth has, we do 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 beads.


80 

"
"Okay, so Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.  The oven makes it hotter by 5 degrees every hour, and he bakes for 3 hours. So that's 5 times 3, which is 15 degrees hotter.  Now the house is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

But then he opens a window. For every 10 minutes the window is open, it gets 2 degrees colder. He opens it for 30 minutes, which is like three 10-minute chunks. So it gets 2 times 3 = 6 degrees colder.

That means the final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees. 



"
"Okay, so Jon takes 40 minutes to swim, 80 minutes to bike, and 50 minutes to run, for a total of 170 minutes.

James is faster swimming, taking only 90% of Jon's time, which is 36 minutes. But James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so that's 85 minutes.

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes longer than Jon. That means James took 160 minutes total (170 - 10).

If we subtract the swimming and biking times from James's total time, we get his running time: 160 - 36 - 85 = 39 minutes.


So James took 39 minutes to run. 

"
"Okay, so Movie C is 1 hour and 15 minutes long, which is 75 minutes. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than that, so it's 80 minutes. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it's 80 minutes divided by 4. That's 20 minutes!


20 

"
"Okay, so Michael's horse eats half a bale of hay for every mile it runs.  If it runs 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, that's like running 16 miles (because 30 minutes is half an hour).

So, the horse eats 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so 8 bales cost 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is $30 total.

If the hay costs $24 and he has $30, he has $30 - $24 = $6 left over. 



"
"Okay, so Rozanne has a bunch of eggs. Four dozen is like 4 times 12, which is 48 eggs. Then she has 2 more, so that's 50 eggs total.  Each glass needs 5 eggs, so she can make 50 divided by 5, which is 10 glasses. If each tray holds 5 glasses, she can put out 10 divided by 5, which is 2 trays.


2 

"
"Okay, so Joey starts with 214 points and gets 26 more, so he has 214 + 26 = 240 points. Marcy starts with 225 and gets 10 more, so she has 225 + 10 = 235 points.  To see how much Joey is winning by, we do 240 - 235 = 5.

Joey is winning by 5 points. 



"
"Okay, so the salesman spent $576 on the sneakers. He made $340 from the flash sale, and then $775 from the department store.  If you add those together, he made $1115.  

To find his profit, you subtract what he spent from what he made: $1115 - $576 = $539.

So his profit was $539. 



"
"Okay, so Beatrice has two types of crayon packs. Six packs have 8 crayons each, so that's 6 times 8, which is 48 crayons.  The other four packs have 16 crayons each, so that's 4 times 16, which is 64 crayons.  

To find the total, we add those together: 48 plus 64 equals 112 crayons.


112 

"
"Okay, so the super ticket is $20, but you get popcorn and a soda for just $1 more. That's $21 total.

If you didn't get the super ticket, you saved $2, so you spent $19.  The movie ticket is $12, and the soda is $3, so the popcorn must have cost $4. 


$4
"
"Okay, so the balloons cost $900 for 20 of them at first. That means each balloon cost $900 / 20 = $45.

Then the price went up by $20, so each balloon now costs $45 + $20 = $65.

If Bentley buys 170 balloons, it'll cost him $65 x 170 = $11050.


Answer: 11050 

"
"Okay, so the car goes 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, that's 60 x 2 = 120 miles. Then it goes 30 miles per hour for 1 hour, so that's another 30 miles.  

In total, it went 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

It drove for 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we do 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.


50 

"
"Okay, so Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3, leaving her with 5.  Those are worth 5 times $800, which is $4000. She got 2 rubies in the trade, and those are worth 2 times $1200, so that's $2400.  If you add those together, she has $4000 + $2400 = $6400 worth of jewels.


$6400 

"
"Okay, so Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, and that's 4 + 4 = 8 apples together.  If they eat 8 apples every day for 30 days, they eat a total of 8 * 30 = 240 apples.

"Okay, so Bob has a lot of raised beds to fill!  Let's see... each bed is like a big box, right?  

* It's 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.

To find out how much dirt each box holds, we gotta multiply those numbers together: 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.

* So each bed needs 32 cubic feet of soil.

He has 10 beds, so that's 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet of soil in total.

* Each bag of soil has 2 cubic feet, so he needs 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

If each bag costs $12, then 160 bags will cost 160 x $12 = $1920.

Wow, that's a lot of money for dirt!


$1920
"
"Okay, so there are 15 red cards.  There are 60% more green cards than red cards, so that's like 15 times 0.60 which is 9 more green cards.  That means there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Then, there are as many yellow cards as red and green cards combined, so that's 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

To find the total, we add up all the colors: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.


78 

"
"Okay, so there were 50 fairies at first. Then 50 / 2 = 25 more fairies came.  That means there were 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. But then 30 flew away, so there are 75 - 30 = 45 fairies left.


45 

"
"Okay, so there are 8 puppies + 12 puppies = 20 puppies in total.

Out of those, 3 puppies + 4 puppies = 7 puppies have spots.

To find the percentage, we do (7 puppies / 20 puppies) * 100 = 35%. 

So 35% of the puppies have spots! 



"
"Okay, so the farmer has a lot of feed! Let's see...

* He's got 2 boxes of sugar cubes, and each box weighs 1 pound, so that's 2 pounds.
* He has 4 bags of carrots, and each bag has 12 pounds, so that's 4 times 12, which is 48 pounds.
* He's got a ton of hay! 42 bales times 75 pounds each is... hmm... carry the one... 3150 pounds!
* And 20 sacks of oats at 65 pounds each is 20 times 65, which is 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add it all up: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds of feed!

His truck can only carry 2250 pounds at a time, so he'll need to make 4500 divided by 2250... which is 2 trips. 



"
"Okay, so Grayson gets 2 cents for each can and she drinks 3 cans, so that's 3 times 2 which is 6 cents.  She gets 3 cents for each bottle and drinks 5, so that's 5 times 3 which is 15 cents.  That means she makes 6 plus 15, or 21 cents each week.  In a month, which is 4 weeks, she makes 21 times 4, which is 84 cents.


84 

"
"Okay, so Toni has way more plants than Frederick. Frederick only has 10, but Toni has 60% more than that.  60% of 10 is 6, so Toni has 16 plants (10 + 6).

Shondra has 7 less plants than Toni, so she has 9 plants (16 - 7).


9 

"
"Okay, so Leila gave Ali half of her money, which is $100 / 2 = $50.  

Ali started with $21 and got $50 more, so now he has $21 + $50 = $71.


$71 

"
"Okay, so Ashley's pizza is $15.  If she wants to tip 1/5 of that, we gotta divide the price by 5: $15 / 5 = $3.  

So her tip is $3.  

To find the total, we add the tip to the pizza price: $15 + $3 = $18.

Ashley should give the delivery guy $18. 



"
"Okay, so Finley starts in first place. Then she goes back 5 spots, so she's in 6th place.  Then she moves up 2 spots to 4th place.  Uh oh, then she goes back 3 spots to 7th place. But then she moves up one spot at the end, so she finishes in 6th place! 


6
"
"Okay, so Miss Maria has a lot of cards! Let's see... she has 6 groups of basketball cards with 25 in each, so that's 6 times 25, which is 150 cards. Then she has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 in each, so that's 5 times 40, which is 200 cards.  

That's a total of 150 plus 200, which is 350 cards. But she keeps 50 for herself, so she gives away 350 minus 50, which is 300 cards.

If each student gets 10 cards, then she has 300 divided by 10, which is 30 students.


30 

"
"Okay, so Becky got 20 apples for 45 cents each, so that's 20 times 45 cents, which is $9.00. But she got a dollar off, so she paid $8.00.

Kelly also got 20 apples, but hers were 50 cents each, so that's 20 times 50 cents, which is $10.00. She got a 10% discount though, so 10% of $10.00 is $1.00 off. That means she paid $9.00.

So Kelly paid $9.00 and Becky paid $8.00, which means Kelly paid $1.00 more.


$1.00 

"
"Okay, so each room has two sheets, right? And one big comforter.  Then there are twice as many pillowcases as sheets, so that's 2 times 2 which is 4 pillowcases. And there are twice as many towels as pillowcases, so that's 4 times 2 which is 8 towels.

So each room has 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry.

If there are 80 rooms, that's 15 times 80 which is 1200 pieces of laundry in total. 


1200 

"
"Okay, so Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.  Then he gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday, which is 10 more shoes.  On Wednesday he gets 15 more pairs, that's 30 shoes! And on Friday he gets a bunch more, 30 pairs, so that's 60 shoes.  

So now he has 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes!

But then on Saturday he gets rid of 180 shoes.  

That means he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes left.


120 

"
"Okay, so Mary has a bunch of sprinkles, right?  She can make 8 cupcakes with each jar, and she has 6 jars. That's 8 times 6, which is 48 cupcakes!  If each pan holds 12 cupcakes, she'll need 48 divided by 12, which is 4 pans. 

4 

"
"Okay, so Theo bought a pen for $2. The paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen.  That means the paper cost 3 * $2 = $6, then minus $1, so it was $5.

So the pen was $2 and the paper was $5, for a total of $2 + $5 = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10, so her change is $10 - $7 = $3. 


$3
"
"Okay, so there were 30 kids in the class with 10 pencils each, so that's 30 times 10 which is 300 pencils. Then they used a fifth of them, so that's 300 divided by 5, which is 60 pencils gone.  That leaves 300 minus 60, which is 240 pencils. But then they only had a third of those left at the end, so that's 240 divided by 3, which is 80 pencils.


80 

"
"Okay, so Matt wants 5 cookies.  His dad said he gets half the number of carrot sticks he eats plus 2 extra.  

That means if we take away the 2 extra cookies, Matt wants to eat 3 cookies from the carrot sticks (5 - 2 = 3).

Since he gets half a cookie for each carrot stick, he must eat 6 carrot sticks to get 3 cookies (3 x 2 = 6).


6 

"
"Okay, so the shark is 10 feet long, which is 120 inches. The remoras are each 6 inches, and there are two of them, so that's 12 inches total.  

To find the percentage, you do (length of remoras / length of shark) times 100. So it's (12 / 120) times 100, which equals 10%.


10 

"
"Okay, so if 20 kids don't have computers, and that's one-fourth of the class, then the whole class must be four times bigger.  So, 20 times 4 is 80.

80 

"
"Okay, so Jason has 3 weeks to break in his shoes, which is like 21 days.  He walks 4 days a week, so that's 21 times 4, which is 84 days.  He needs to walk for 240 minutes total.  So, 240 minutes split up over 84 days is... hmm... let me see... 240 divided by 84 is about 2.86 minutes each day. 


2.86 

"
"Okay, so Sarah spent $300 and each book cost $15.  That means she bought 300 / 15 = 20 books.

If she gives them to her 4 kids equally, each kid gets 20 / 4 = 5 books. 


5 

"
"Okay, so there are 32 kids in Gina's class.  Some have allergies, so we gotta figure out how many don't.

Nine kids have dairy allergies, and 6 have peanut allergies. But 3 kids have BOTH, so we can't count them twice.

Let's see... 9 dairy allergies minus the 3 who also have peanut allergies is 6 kids with just dairy allergies. Then 6 peanut allergies minus the 3 with both is 3 kids with just peanut allergies.

So, 6 plus 3 plus 3 equals 12 kids with some kind of allergy.

That means 32 total kids minus 12 with allergies equals 20 kids with no allergies!


20 

"
"Okay, so they have 3 groups of employees, and each group has 200 people. That's 3 times 200, which is 600 employees going.  Then there are 7 tour guides for each group, so that's 3 groups times 7 tour guides, which is 21 tour guides.  

To find the total, we add the employees and tour guides: 600 + 21 = 621 people.


621 

"
"Okay, so the plane tickets cost $5000 each, and there are two people, so that's $5000 x 2 = $10,000.

The hotel is normally $1500 a night, but it's more expensive because it's a busy weekend.  20% of $1500 is $1500 x 0.20 = $300 more each night.

So the hotel costs $1500 + $300 = $1800 per night.

They stay for 3 nights, so the hotel costs $1800 x 3 = $5400.

To find the total cost, we add the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.


$15,400 

"
"Okay, so Ben has 4 blue paints and Jasper has half of that, which is 2.  Ben has 3 yellow paints, and Jasper has three times that, so he has 9 yellow paints.  That means Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 paints in total.


11 

"
"Okay, so the 2010 penny is three-quarters the weight of the 1959 penny, which weighs 48 grains.  That means the 2010 penny weighs 3/4 * 48 grains = 36 grains.

To find the total weight, we add the weight of both pennies: 36 grains + 48 grains = 84 grains.


84 

"
"Okay, so they need $200 total. Keegan made $83 and Tashay made $91.  Let's add that up: $83 + $91 = $174.  

They need $200 and they have $174, so they need $200 - $174 = $26 more.


$26 

"
"Okay, so Luri has three times as many songs as Gabriel, who has 20. That means Luri has 20 x 3 = 60 songs.

Gabriel can fit 100 songs total and has 20, so he can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs.

Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs.

That means Gabriel can add 80 - 40 = 40 more songs than Luri.


40 

"
"Okay, so Stetson ate 2/5 of the 60 oranges, which is like saying he ate (2/5) * 60 = 24 oranges.

Since he pays $10 for each orange, he gave up 24 * $10 = $240.


$240 

"
"Okay, so Jillian's shoes cost $80.  Her bag cost 3 times that amount minus $20.  So, 3 times the shoe price is $80 x 3 = $240. Then we take away $20, so the bag cost $240 - $20 = $220.


$220 

"
"Okay, so James runs 12 miles each day, and he does that for 5 days. That means he runs 12 times 5, which is 60 miles a week.  

Since he runs 10 miles every hour, we gotta see how many times 10 goes into 60. That's 6!

So James runs for 6 hours a week. 



"
"Okay, so Uncle Ben has four horses and each one eats 5 pounds of oats for each meal. He feeds them twice a day, so that's 5 times 2 which is 10 pounds of oats per horse every day.  

Since he has four horses, that's 10 times 4, or 40 pounds of oats he needs each day.

If he needs to feed them for five days, he'll need 40 times 5, which is 200 pounds of oats.

Each bag has 50 pounds, so he needs 200 divided by 50, which is 4 bags of oats. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Jana has a bunch of puppies, 27 to be exact.  And most of them are Pomeranians, like two-thirds of them.  That means there are 18 Pomeranians.  Then, a third of those Pomeranians are girls. So, there are 6 girl Pomeranians. 


6
"
"Okay, so we need to find the average highest temperature.  That means adding up the highest temperatures from all three places and then dividing by 3.

Southlandia: -48 degrees
Northlandia: 21 degrees
Midlandia: -3 degrees

Adding those together: -48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

Then dividing by 3: -30 / 3 = -10


-10 

"
"Okay, so the toy car costs $12 and he already has $4. That means he needs $8 more. If he saves $2 each day, it will take him 4 days to save up enough money. 



"
"Okay, so Jaime has 64 eggs and each tray holds 24.  If he has two trays, that's 24 x 2 = 48 eggs that can fit.  

That means he has 64 - 48 = 16 eggs leftover. 


16
"
"Okay, so the small pizza is $8. The big one is three times that, so it's $8 times 3 which is $24.  To find the total, we add the two prices together: $8 + $24 = $32.

$32 

"
"Okay, so Heather gets double the razors because of the buy one get one free deal. That means she's getting 8 razors total.  

The razors cost $4 a pack, and she's buying two, so that's $8. But then she gets $2 off with the coupon, so they only cost $6.

That means each razor costs $6 divided by 8, which is 75 cents. 

But the question wants the answer in cents, so it's just 75. 


75
"
"Okay, so there are nine cheerleaders who are all 64 inches tall, and one who is 60 inches.  That means the tallest part of the pyramid is 64 inches times 9, which is 576 inches. Then you add the shortest cheerleader's height, 60 inches, so the bottom part of the pyramid is 636 inches tall.

To figure out how tall that is in feet, you divide by 12 because there are 12 inches in a foot.  636 divided by 12 is 53 feet.


53 

"
"Okay, so Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour she's at work.  She works for 8 hours a day, so that's 8 times 5 minutes, which is 40 minutes of walking each day.  If she does that for 5 days, she walks a total of 40 times 5, which is 200 minutes.


200 

"
"Okay, so Brett is 14 now. In four years, he'll be 18.  His sister Angela will be three times Brett's age then, so she'll be 18 times 3 which is 54. But that's in four years, so right now she's 50. 

50 

"
"Okay, so Paul drives twice a day and spends $6 in the morning and $2 in the afternoon. That's $6 + $2 = $8 every day.

He does this for 14 days, so he spends $8 x 14 = $112.


112 

"
"Okay, so Ashley brought 5 boxes of oranges, and each box has 10 oranges, so that's 5 times 10, which is 50 oranges. Brianne brought 20 more than that, so she brought 50 plus 20, which is 70 oranges.  Together they have 50 plus 70, which is 120 oranges.  Each pie needs 3 oranges, so they can make 120 divided by 3, which is 40 pies!


40 

"
"Okay, so Mark's got two choices for his wife's party.  The first place costs $200 no matter what, but he has to pay extra for food, like $5 per person. The second place is $25 per person, and food is already included.

To figure out when they cost the same, we gotta think about how many people would make the costs equal.  

Let's say 10 people come.

* The first place would be $200 (the flat fee) + $50 for food (10 people x $5) = $250
* The second place would be $250 (10 people x $25)

See, they're the same! So the answer is 10. 


10
"
"Okay, so they found 43 bugs total.  Let's see... Lily found more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found. Hmm...

I think the best way to do this is to think about Bodhi's bugs first.  If David found half of what Bodhi found, and they found 43 bugs together, Bodhi must have found a lot!

Let's say Bodhi found 18 bugs. That means David found 9 bugs (half of 18).  

That leaves 16 bugs for Lily (43 total bugs - 18 Bodhi bugs - 9 David bugs = 16 Lily bugs).


So Lily found 16 bugs. 

"
"Okay, so Mariah used a quarter of the yarn, which is like 364 divided by 4, that's 91 yards. Her grandma used half, so that's 364 divided by 2, which is 182 yards.  To find the total, we add those together: 91 plus 182 equals 273 yards.


273 

"
"Okay, so Cherrie has 5 friends. Two of them want a bunch of gifts, like 5 each! That's 2 times 5, which is 10 gifts.  The other three friends only want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 gifts.  

So she bought 10 plus 6, which is 16 gifts. But wait, she got 10 more just for fun! That means she has 16 plus 10, which is 26 gifts in total. 


26
"
"Okay, so the chair is 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet wider than that, so it's 8 feet wide.  The couch is twice the width of the rug, which is 16 feet, plus 2 more feet, so it's 18 feet long.


18 

"
"Okay, so Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, and those are the only ones we don't know the price of.  She spent $2 on grape gum and $1 on green apple gum, so that's $3 total. That means the strawberry gum cost $7 - $3 = $4. Since she got two packs, each pack cost $4 / 2 = $2.


$2 

"
"Okay, so Frederick wants to make a bunch of popsicle sticks. He can get more sticks from a 2x8 piece of wood, even though it costs a little more.  He's got $24, and each 2x8 costs $6. So he can buy 4 of them. Each 2x8 makes 400 sticks, so he can make 4 times 400, which is 1600 popsicle sticks!


1600 

"
"Okay, so Mario has 6 dogs and each dog needs 4 snowshoes. That means he needs 6 times 4, which is 24 snowshoes.  Each pair costs $12.00, so 24 snowshoes would cost 24 times $12.00.  

Let me do that on my calculator... 24 times 12 is $288.00.


$288.00 

"
"Okay, so Janet takes the bus twice a day, and that costs $2.20 each time.  So that's $2.20 x 2 = $4.40 every day.

If she does that for a whole week, it's $4.40 x 5 = $22.00.

But if she buys a pass for $20, she saves $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00!


$2.00 

"
"Okay, so the farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep.  The zoo has double the cows the farm has, so that's 30 x 2 = 60 cows. The farm has half the sheep the zoo has, so that's 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Let's add up all the animals: 30 cows + 10 sheep + 60 cows + 20 sheep = 120 animals.


120 

"
"Okay, so Rose bought a lot more than Sophia!  If Rose got 12 onions and that's 4 times what Sophia got, then Sophia got 12 onions / 4 = 3 onions.  And Rose got 4 potatoes, which is 4 times what Sophia got, so Sophia got 4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato.

That means Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 things in total. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.  That's a lot!  He has until July, so let's see... that's like, a bunch of months.  

To lose a pound, you gotta burn 3500 calories, right? So he needs to burn 30 times that much.  

30 times 3500 is... hmm...  carry the one... 105,000 calories!

Now, how many days are there until July?  Let's say it's about 200 days.

So, 105,000 calories divided by 200 days is... 525 calories a day.

Andy needs to burn 525 more calories than he eats every day to reach his goal. 



"
"Okay, so Gerald makes $30 each day at his job.  If he works all week, that's 7 days times $30, which is $210. Then he spends $100, so he has $210 - $100 left. That means he has $110 left.


$110
"
"Okay, so Hannah runs 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, so she runs 8 times 0.25 which is 2 kilometers.  She needs 60 ml of water for every kilometer, so for 2 kilometers she needs 2 times 60 which is 120 ml of water.


120 

"
"Okay, so Julie starts with $500. She spends 20% on clothes, which is like 20 out of every 100 dollars.  That's $100 on clothes.

So she has $500 - $100 = $400 left.

Then she spends 25% of that on CDs. That's like 25 out of every 100 dollars, which is another $100.

So she has $400 - $100 = $300 left.


$300 

"
"Okay, so the house and lot together cost $120,000.  The house is three times more expensive than the lot.  That means if we think of the lot as one part, the house is three parts.  That's a total of four parts.

To find out how much one part is worth, we divide the total cost by four: $120,000 / 4 = $30,000.

Since the lot is one part, it costs $30,000. The house is three parts, so it costs $30,000 x 3 = $90,000.


$90,000 

"
"Okay, so Tara bought a bunch of bags, right?  She got 8 packs with 5 bags in each pack, so that's 8 times 5 which is 40 bags.  Each pack cost $4, so all the bags cost 40 times $4, which is $160.

Then she sold them for $8 each, so she made 40 times $8, which is $320.

To find out her profit, you subtract the cost from the money she made: $320 - $160 = $160.

So Tara made a profit of $160. 



"
"Okay, so Joe throws a lot of punches!  He does 25 each minute, and each round is 3 minutes long.  There are 5 rounds, so that's 3 times 5, which is 15 minutes of fighting.  

If he throws 25 punches every minute, and he fights for 15 minutes, he throws 25 times 15 punches, which is 375 punches!


375 

"
"Okay, so Suzanne made 36 cookies. Josh made a fourth of that, so he made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies. Kelsie made twice as many as Josh, so she made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies. 


18
"
"Okay, so Ali has four ten dollar bills, which is 4 times 10, so that's $40. He also has six twenty dollar bills, so that's 6 times 20, which equals $120.  

That means he has $40 + $120 = $160 in total.

He gives half of that to his sister, so he gives her $160 / 2 = $80.

That leaves him with $160 - $80 = $80.

Then he spends 3/5 of that on dinner, which is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

So, after buying dinner, he has $80 - $48 = $32 left. 



"
"Okay, so Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house, which is 120 minutes. Royce takes twice as long as that, so that's 120 x 2 = 240 minutes. But then Royce takes an extra 40 minutes, so it takes him 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.


280 

"
"Okay, so Martha's making a lot of stuff! Let's see... each kid needs 2 skeins for a hat, 4 for a scarf, 12 for a sweater, 1 for mittens, and 2 for socks.  That's 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 skeins per kid.

Since she has three kids, she needs 21 x 3 = 63 skeins of wool. 


63
"
"Okay, so Chris has a ton of math problems! Let's see...

He did 12 on Monday, and then 12 times 3 is 36 on Tuesday.  That's 12 + 36 = 48 problems done already.

He had 100 to start, so he has 100 - 48 = 52 left.

On Wednesday, he did a quarter of those, which is 52 divided by 4, or 13 problems.

That means he has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left for Thursday. 


39
"
"Okay, so Tony picks 6 quarts an hour. Bobby picks one less, so he gets 5 quarts. Kathy picks twice as much as Bobby, so she gets 5 times 2 which is 10 quarts. Ricky picks 2 less than Kathy, so he gets 10 minus 2 which is 8 quarts.  To find the total, we add up what everyone picks: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts.


29 

"
"Okay, so they started with 200 loaves. Then they sold a bunch, 93 in the morning and 39 in the afternoon, so that's 93 + 39 = 132 loaves sold.  

That means they had 200 - 132 = 68 loaves left. But then the store brought back 6, so they ended up with 68 - 6 = 62 loaves.

"
"Okay, so Jackson has 36 red tulips and can fit 6 in each row, so that's 36 divided by 6 which equals 6 rows.  Then he has 24 blue tulips and fits 8 in a row, so that's 24 divided by 8 which equals 3 rows.  

In total, he'll have 6 rows + 3 rows = 9 rows of flowers. 


9 

"
"Okay, so Heather has 27 cups of raisins and wants to use them for three things.  That means each thing gets 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Each batch of cookies needs 3/4 cup of raisins.  To see how many batches she can make, we do 9 / (3/4) which is the same as 9 * (4/3) = 12 batches.


12 

"
"Okay, so Ada uses 12 things called kilowatts every hour.  Each one of those kilowatts costs $1.50.  So each day she spends 12 times $1.50, which is $18.00.

She wants to add something that uses 2 more kilowatts each hour. That means she'll use 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts each hour.

Now she'll spend 14 times $1.50, which is $21.00 each day.

That means her bill will go up by $21.00 - $18.00 = $3.00 every day.

In a whole week, that's $3.00 times 7 days, which is $21.00 more.


$21.00 

"
"Okay, so if one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means they paint 1/10 of the house each day.  If we have 5 people, they'd paint 5 times faster, so they'd paint 5 * (1/10) = 1/2 of the house every day.  That means it would take them 2 days to paint the whole thing!  Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take them 2 * 24 = 48 hours.


48 

"
"Okay, so Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 more chairs than sofas, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has three times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 22 * 3 = 66 chairs.

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, meaning she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Altogether, they have 20 + 64 = 84 sofas.

And they have 22 + 66 = 88 chairs.

So, in total, they have 84 + 88 = 172 sofas and chairs. 



"
"Okay, so Tom spent $48 total, and the CD cost $4. That means the headphones cost $48 - $4 = $44.  If he didn't buy the headphones, he could have bought $44 / $4 = 11 more CDs!


11 

"
"Okay, so Josh worked out for 4 hours a week most of the time. That's 4 hours x 6 weeks = 24 hours.

Then he did extra one time for 5 hours for two weeks, so that's 5 hours x 2 weeks = 10 hours.

And one more time he did 6 hours.

So in total, it's 24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours! 


40
"
"Okay, so there are 48 people on the bus at first. Then 8 get off, and 5 times that many, which is 40, get on. So now there are 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 people.

Then at the next stop, 21 people get off, and 3 times less than the first stop get on, so that's 8 / 3 = 2 people get on.

So after the second stop, there are 80 - 21 + 2 = 61 people on the bus.


61 

"
"Okay, so Jame is gonna be 27 in 5 years, so right now he's 22.  In 8 years, he'll be 30. His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age then, so the cousin will be 55.  But that's in 8 years!  So the cousin is 47 now. That means the cousin is 25 years older than Jame.


25 

"
"Okay, so Errol spent $1100 on the computer and $400 less on the printer, so the printer cost $700.  That means the computer and printer together cost $1800.  

He spent $2400 total, and $1800 of that was on the computer and printer, so the two monitors cost $600.  If each monitor cost the same, then one monitor cost $300.


$300 

"
"Okay, so there are 20 kids, and they split into two groups of 10, boys and girls. The boys each found 60 seashells. The girls found the same amount as the boys plus four times that amount. So, they found 60 + (4 * 60) = 300 seashells.  Since there are 10 girls, each girl found 300 / 10 = 30 seashells.


30 

"
"Okay, so George has 3 candies now, and he ate 5, so he must have had 3 + 5 = 8 candies before.  Nick has twice as many as George, so Nick has 8 x 2 = 16 candies.


16
"
"Okay, so Chenny is 10. Alyana is 4 years younger, so she's 6. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, making her 8 years old. 


8
"
"Okay, so the first book is 31 mm thick, and the second one is 50 mm. The third book is 5 mm thinner than the second, so it's 45 mm thick (50 - 5 = 45). The last book is double the first book, so it's 62 mm thick (31 x 2 = 62).

To find the total, we add up all the thicknesses: 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm.


188 

"
"Okay, so Emma wants to make 72 vlogs this month.  She already made 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs.

That means she needs to make 72 - 54 = 18 more vlogs.


18 

"
"Okay, so the bill is $50, and they want to split it in half, so that's $25 each. But then you gotta add a 20% tip on top of that.  20% of $50 is $10, so you're paying an extra $10.  So, $25 plus $10 is $35.


$35 

"
"Okay, so this guy gets $6 at first. Then he gets $5 more, so he has $11. The next day he gets another $10, so now he has $21.  He spends $8, leaving him with $13.  If he triples that, he has $39! 


$39
"
"Okay, so Elvis wants to save $1125 this month.  He wants to save double the amount each day in the second half of April compared to the first half.  April has 30 days, so that's 15 days in each half.

That means he needs to save $1125 divided by 2, which is $562.50 in the second half of the month.

To find out how much he needs to save each day in the second half, we do $562.50 divided by 15 days, which equals $37.50.


$37.50 

"
"Okay, so Verna buys 3 apples for $1.50 each, so that's 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.

Then she gets 5 oranges at $0.80 each, which is 5 x $0.80 = $4.00.

And lastly, she buys 6 peaches at $0.75 each, so that's 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

To find the total, we add up all the prices: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

If she paid with $20, her change is $20 - $13 = $7.00 


$7.00
"
"Okay, so Jairus makes 80 cents for each task and Jenny makes 50 cents. They both do 20 tasks.  Let's see... Jairus makes 16 bucks because 0.80 times 20 is 16. Jenny makes 10 bucks because 0.50 times 20 is 10.  That means Jairus makes 6 dollars more than Jenny.


$6 

"
"Okay, so Jeff gets four times more than Brad.  That means if we think of Brad's money as one part, Jeff gets four parts. That's a total of five parts.

Since they split $100, each ""part"" is worth $100 divided by 5, which is $20.

Jeff gets four parts, so he gets 4 * $20 = $80.


Answer: $80 

"
"Okay, so Jeff walks 3 miles to work and then 3 miles back home, so that's 6 miles each day. If he works 5 days a week, he walks 6 times 5 which is 30 miles. 


30 

"
"Okay, so Elise writes the alphabet twice, which is 26 letters times 2, so that's 52 letters. Then she writes half the alphabet, which is 26 divided by 2, so that's 13 more letters.  That's a total of 65 letters so far. Then she writes all those letters again, so that's another 65.  

If you add those together, 65 plus 65 is 130. 


130 

"
"Okay, so Ali calls 3 families first. Then each of those families calls 3 more, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 families.  Then those 9 families each call 3 more, so that's 9 times 3, which is 27 families.  And then those 27 families each call 3 more... so that's 27 times 3, which is 81 families. 

81 

"
"Okay, so Mark lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, that's 10 * 3 = 30 pounds total.  If he weighed 70 pounds at the end, he must have weighed 70 + 30 = 100 pounds before he got sick.


100 

"
"Okay, so James has 80 toys. Jonathan wants his set to be five times bigger, so that's 80 x 5 = 400 toys.  But he needs 2 more toys to get to that number, so he has 400 - 2 = 398 toys right now.


398 

"
"Okay, so Daniel needs to buy a bunch of stuff for school. Let's see... five notebooks cost 5 times $1.50, which is $7.50. Two pens cost 2 times $0.25, so that's $0.50. The calculator is $12, and the geometry set is $10.  

Adding those all up, it's $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

But wait! There's a 10% discount. That means 10% of $30 is $3 off.

So, Daniel only has to pay $30 - $3 = $27.


$27
"
"Okay, so Carly buys 5 hamburgers that cost $4 each, so that's 5 times 4 which is $20.  Then she gets 10 packs of fries at 30 cents each.  That's 10 times 0.30, which is $3.  And she gets 5 drinks at $2 each, so that's 5 times 2, which is $10.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

If she pays with a $50 bill, her change is $50 - $33 = $17.


$17
"
"Okay, so Antonella sold $2500 worth of stuff.  For the first $1000, she gets 30%, which is $300.  Then for the rest, which is $1500, she gets 10%, so that's $150.  If you add those together, she made $450! 



"
"Okay, so Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so that's 2 times 24 which is 48 bottles. He needs 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, so that's 70 times 2 which equals 140 bottles.  He needs to buy 140 bottles minus the 48 he already has, which is 92 more bottles.


92 

"
"Okay, so Ray swims a mile way faster in cold water.  

In cold water, it takes him 16 minutes to swim a mile.  

In warm water, it takes him twice that time plus 2 more minutes, so that's (16 x 2) + 2 = 34 minutes per mile.

For 3 miles in cold water, it would take him 16 x 3 = 48 minutes.

For 3 miles in warm water, it would take him 34 x 3 = 102 minutes.

That means he takes 102 - 48 = 54 minutes longer in warm water.


54 

"
"Okay, so John makes $2 every hour, and he works 5 hours a day. That means he makes $2 x 5 = $10 each day.

He works 4 days a week, so he makes $10 x 4 = $40 every week.

To save $80, it will take him $80 / $40 = 2 weeks. 


2 

"
"Okay, so the fish sub costs $40.  The cold-cut combo is three times that much, so it's $40 x 3 = $120.  

To find the total, we add the two prices together: $40 + $120 = $160.


$160 

"
"Okay, so there are 21 buttons total.  Some have two holes, and some have four.  Let's see... 7 buttons have two holes, so that's 7 times 2, which is 14 holes. The rest of the buttons have four holes, so that's 21 minus 7, which is 14 buttons.  Those have 14 times 4 holes, which is 56 holes.  

If we add those together, 14 plus 56, we get 70 holes! 


70
"
"Okay, so Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. Zack's is half that size, so it's 24 divided by 2, which is 12 cubic inches. Peter's locker is a quarter the size of Zack's, so it's 12 divided by 4. That means Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches. 

3 

"
"Okay, so Octavia drinks half the coffee she's supposed to. Juan drinks ten times more than her, which is a lot of coffee!  His doctor wants him to only drink 4 cups a day.  To figure out how much less he needs to drink, we gotta think about how much he drinks now.  If Octavia drinks half the recommended amount, and Juan drinks ten times that, he's drinking ten times more than half the recommended amount.  

So, to find out how much less he needs to drink, we gotta subtract 4 from that amount. 



"
"Okay, so they have 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, that's 3 times 10 which is 30 hamsters. Then they have 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so that's 3 times 5 which is 15 guinea pigs.  To find the total, we add the hamsters and guinea pigs: 30 plus 15 equals 45.


45 

"
"Okay, so Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than him, so she weighs 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so he weighs 260 pounds.

To find the average, we add up their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

Then we divide that by 3 because there are three friends: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.


180 

"
"Okay, so the sun starts at 32 degrees and goes up 5 degrees every hour for 10 hours.  That means it goes up a total of 50 degrees (5 x 10 = 50).

So, to find the final angle, we add the starting angle and how much it went up: 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.


82 

"
"Okay, so James has two sons. One is 12, and the other is 8 because he's 4 years younger.  That means James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Each pack has 5 candles, so he needs 20 / 5 = 4 packs of candles.

If each pack costs $3, then he'll spend 4 * $3 = $12 on candles.


$12 

"
"Okay, so Judy read for 15 minutes every night for a week, that's 15 x 7 = 105 minutes.

She reads 2 pages every 1.5 minutes, so in the first week she read 105 / 1.5 = 70 pages.

Then she read 100 pages the next week, so in total she read 70 + 100 = 170 pages.


170 

"
"Okay, so Cody and Trevor started with 12 sandwiches. Cody ate a third, which is like 12 divided by 3, so he ate 4 sandwiches. Trevor ate a quarter, which is 12 divided by 4, so he ate 3 sandwiches.  

Together they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

That means there are 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches left. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Shiloh is 44 now, and in 7 years he'll be 51.  The problem says in 7 years he'll be three times as old as his nephew.  So, if we divide Shiloh's age in 7 years by 3, that'll tell us the nephew's age in 7 years.  51 divided by 3 is 17.  That means the nephew will be 17 in 7 years.  If he's 17 then, he's 10 now! 


10
"
"Okay, so the tooth fairy gave Sharon $5 for her first tooth. Then she got $1 for each of the next three teeth, so that's $1 x 3 = $3.  For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half of $1, which is $0.50 per tooth. So that's $0.50 x 2 = $1.

If you add it all up, it's $5 + $3 + $1 = $9. 


$9.00
"
"Okay, so Richie scored 80 goals.  Mark scored 20 less than Richie, so he scored 60 goals. Anna scored 45 less than Richie, so she scored 35 goals.  To find the total, we add them all up: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 goals.


175 

"
"Okay, so Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so he made 21 times 4 which is $84.  Liam only made $63.  That means Mitchell made $84 - $63 = $21 more than Liam.


$21 

"
"Okay, so Peter has $70 and wants to spend it evenly over a week. That's like $10 a day.

He buys wooden figures for the first four days, and each one costs $5. So he buys 4 figures for a total of $20.

That leaves him with $50 for the rest of the week. Plastic figures are $2 each, so he can buy 25 of those.

In total, he has 4 wooden figures + 25 plastic figures = 29 action figures! 


29 

"
"Okay, so the kitten cost $200 to get fixed. Then she needed three shots that were $20 each, so that's 3 times 20, which is $60.  Oh no, the kitten broke some stuff! Four vases at $12 each, so that's 4 times 12, which is $48.  

Let's add it all up: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

That kitten is expensive! 



"
"Okay, so Ford grows 40 roses each week.  The flower shops want 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses every week.

That means he's short 65 - 40 = 25 roses every week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he's short 25 * 4 = 100 roses every month. 


100 

"
"Okay, so Katina starts with $3000. She takes out $100 each month, and there are 12 months in a year, so that's $100 x 12 = $1200 she takes out each year.

Over two years, she takes out $1200 x 2 = $2400.

If she started with $3000 and takes out $2400, she'll have $3000 - $2400 = $600 left.


$600 

"
"Okay, so they spend $3 on bread, and that makes 10 sandwiches.  That means each sandwich costs 30 cents for bread. They also spend $30 on cheese and stuff for 10 sandwiches, so that's $3 per sandwich for that stuff.

So each sandwich costs $3.30 to make (30 cents + $3). They sell each sandwich for $7, so they make $3.70 profit on each one.

If they sell 10 sandwiches, they make $3.70 x 10 = $37.00 profit! 


$37.00
"
"Okay, so Kate has a lot of crayons!  She has 3 boxes with 64 crayons in each, so that's 3 times 64, which is 192 crayons.  She makes crayon muffins with 8 crayons each, so she can make 192 divided by 8, which is 24 muffins. If she sells each muffin for $1.50, she'll make 24 times $1.50, which is $36.00. 


$36.00
"
"Okay, so Michael's room is 18 feet by 12 feet, so that's 18 times 12 which is 216 square feet.

The carpet itself costs $12 per square foot, so that's 216 times $12, which is $2592.

Then he needs padding, which is $2 per square foot, so that's 216 times $2, which is $432.

Taking out the old carpet costs $4 per square foot, so that's 216 times $4, which is $864.

And finally, putting the new carpet in costs $34 per square foot, so that's 216 times $34, which is $7344.

Now we add all that up: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232



"
"Okay, so Mack saw birds for a whole week. Let's add up all the birds he saw each day: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds.

Now, to find the average, we divide the total birds by the number of days: 280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds per day.


40 

"
"Okay, so Diane starts with 20. Then she adds half of 20, which is 10, so now she has 30.  She divides that by 5 and gets 6. Then she takes the starting number, 20, and subtracts 12, which is 8. Finally, she multiplies 6 by 8 and gets 48. 


48
"
"Okay, so the boy has 5 cards, and his brother has 3 less. That means the brother has 2 cards (5 - 3 = 2).  To find the total, we add the number of cards they each have: 5 + 2 = 7.

They have a total of 7 cards. 

"
"Okay, so Maggie's oven is running hot. It's like, 18 degrees hotter than it should be at 450.  That means it's off by 4%.  

If she needs it to be 520, she gotta figure out what 4% of 520 is. That's like, 20.8 degrees. So she should set it to 520 minus 20.8, which is 499.2 degrees.


499.2 

"
"Okay, so the first movie is an hour and a half, which is 90 minutes. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes, so that's 2 times 60 minutes plus 5 minutes, which is 125 minutes.  

To find the total time, we add those together: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.


215 

"
"Okay, so Herb's house cost $76,000. Juan's house is 30% cheaper, so we gotta figure out what 30% of $76,000 is.  That's like 30 out of every 100, so we do (30/100) times $76,000 which equals $22,800.

Now we subtract that from Herb's house price to find out how much Juan's house costs: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Finally, we add the two prices together to get the total: $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.


So the combined value of both houses is $129,200. 

"
"Okay, so Judy brought 12 cups and twice that many dishes, which is 12 x 2 = 24 dishes. That means she brought 12 + 24 = 36 things in total.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so that's 24 + 20 = 44 dishes. Her friend brought 40 + 44 = 84 things.

To find the total, we add what they both brought: 36 + 84 = 120 utensils.


120 

"
"Okay, so Pete gets 90 contacts in a box, and that lasts him 45 days. That means each box has enough for two contacts a day.  If he buys two boxes, that's 180 contacts total.  Each box is $100, but it's on sale for 10% off, so each box costs $90. Two boxes would cost $180.  

So, 180 contacts for $180 means each pair costs $1.00.


$1.00 

"
"Okay, so Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, that's 3 hours total.  John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 4 hours. On Sunday, he worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 3 hours. That means John worked a total of 7 hours.

Jill made 3 hours times $10 an hour, which is $30. John made 7 hours times $10 an hour, which is $70.  

John made $40 more than Jill. 


$40
"
"Okay, so Hannah burns 500 calories every hour doing aerobics, and she does that for 2 hours, so that's 500 x 2 = 1000 calories.

Then she burns 600 calories running for an hour.  

So in total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, so she needs to drink 1600 / 200 = 800 ml of water.


800 

"
"Okay, so there are blue, red, and green jelly beans.  The blue ones are the base amount. There are 1% fewer red ones than blue ones, and 1% more green ones than blue ones.  If there are 4500 jelly beans total, we gotta figure out how many more green ones there are than red ones.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let's say there are 100 blue jelly beans to make it easier. That means there are 99 red ones (1% less) and 101 green ones (1% more).

But we need to figure this out for 4500 jelly beans, not 100.  

Let's see... if 100 blue jelly beans is like a small part of 4500, then we need to figure out how many times bigger 4500 is than 100.  

4500 divided by 100 is 45. So, we multiply our little example by 45!

* Blue: 100 * 45 = 4500
* Red: 99 * 45 = 4455
* Green: 101 * 45 = 4545

Now we subtract the red from the green: 4545 - 4455 = 90

So there are 90 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans! 



"
"Okay, so Jared starts at 47 WPM, then goes up to 52 WPM. If he goes up by 5 more, that's 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

To find the average, we add up all three speeds: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156. Then we divide by 3 because there are three speeds: 156 / 3 = 52.

So the average is 52 WPM. 


52
"
"Okay, so if Martin eats Cheerios he loses weight, and if he eats donuts he gains weight.  Let's see...

Cheerios for 5 weeks means he loses 1.25 pounds a week times 5 weeks, so that's 6.25 pounds less.

Donuts for 5 weeks means he gains 1.75 pounds a week times 5 weeks, so that's 8.75 pounds more.

To find the difference, we do 8.75 minus 6.25, which is 2.5 pounds.


2.5 

"
"Okay, so Alex invited 100 people, and they each bring 2 friends, so that's 100 times 2 which is 200 friends.  That's 300 people already! Then she invited 10 more friends, and 8 of them are bringing their spouses, so that's 8 more people.  So in total, she needs 300 plus 10 plus 8, which is 318 seats.

"Okay, so the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. The Dachshund is twice that, so it weighs 20 pounds. The Papillon is one-fourth the weight of the Dachshund, which is 5 pounds.  Finally, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the Papillon's weight, so it weighs 220 pounds.

"
"Okay, so the boots on Amazon cost $16 plus $4 for shipping, which is $20 total. On eBay, they're $13 plus shipping, but shipping is double Amazon's price, so that's $4 times 2, which is $8.  So eBay shipping is $8, and the boots are $13, for a total of $21. That means the boots are $21 - $20 = $1 more expensive on eBay.

"
"Okay, so the beanstalk starts at 4 feet and gets twice as tall each day.  Mark's window is 20 feet up.

* Day 1: It's 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet tall.
* Day 2: It's 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet tall.
* Day 3: It's 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet tall!

So it takes 3 days.

"
"Okay, so John eats 200 grams of mushrooms a day, and every 100 grams has 3 grams of protein.  That means he's getting 6 grams of protein each day (because 200 / 100 = 2, and 2 * 3 = 6).

If he eats that much every day for a week, he's getting 42 grams of protein in total (because 6 * 7 = 42).

"
"Okay, so Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. That means if we cut his current age in half, it'll be how old he was 5 years ago.  

To figure out how old he'll be in 3 years, we gotta know how old he is now. Let's say he's 10. If he was half that age 5 years ago, he was 5.  

So, if he's 10 now, in 3 years he'll be 13!

"
"Okay, so George needs two implants that cost $2000 each, so that's $2000 times 2 which is $4000.  Then he wants a fancy crown for one of them that costs an extra $500. So the total for everything is $4000 plus $500, which is $4500.

He already paid $600, so he still owes $4500 minus $600, which is $3900.

He makes $15 every hour at work. To figure out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the money he owes by how much he makes per hour: $3900 divided by $15 is 260 hours.


260 

"
"Okay, so we know all the angles in a triangle have to add up to 180 degrees, right?

One angle is like the base, let's call it *x*.  Another angle is double that, so it's 2*x*. And the last angle is triple the base, making it 3*x*.

If we add them all up, it's *x* + 2*x* + 3*x* = 180 degrees.

That means 6*x* = 180 degrees.  To find *x*, we divide both sides by 6, and we get *x* = 30 degrees.

The biggest angle is 3*x*, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"
"Okay, so Colby has a bunch of coins. Let's see... eight quarters are like having two dollars (8 x 25 cents = 200 cents, which is $2.00).  Six dimes are 60 cents, fourteen nickels are 70 cents, and fifteen pennies are 15 cents.

If we add all that up, he has $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs a nickel, which is 5 cents, he can buy $3.45 / $0.05 = 69 gumballs! 


69 

"
"Okay, so there are 5 dogs, and each dog has 4 legs, so that's 5 times 4, which is 20 legs. Then there are 2 cats, and they each have 4 legs too, so that's 2 times 4, which is 8 legs.  Lastly, there are 10 birds, and they have 2 legs each, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 legs.  

If you add all those up, 20 + 8 + 20 = 48 legs.


48 

"
"Okay, so Jamaal starts with 8 pounds.  He makes it 50% heavier, which is like half of 8, so that's 4 more pounds.  That makes it 12 pounds. But then he goes down 2 pounds, so he's using 10 pounds now.


10 

"
"Okay, so Steve starts with 5 games. Then he gets 1 new game each month for a whole year, that's 12 more games! Plus 5 more for Christmas, so that's 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games after the first year.

The next year he gets even more games, 2 each month, so that's 24 more games (2 x 12 = 24). Plus another 5 for Christmas, so he has 22 + 24 + 5 = 51 games.

In the third year, he's buying 4 games a month, which is 48 games (4 x 12 = 48). And 5 more for Christmas, bringing his total to 51 + 48 + 5 = 104 games!

So Steve has 104 games after 3 years. 



"
"Okay, so the plane goes 1200 miles in 3 hours. That means it travels 400 miles every hour (1200 / 3 = 400).  

To go another 2000 miles, we gotta figure out how many times 400 miles fits into 2000.  

2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.


So it would take **5** more hours. 

"
"Okay, so Ruiz makes a lot of chocolate! He can make 120 pounds in just two hours. Marissa is pretty good too, she makes three-quarters as much as Ruiz in just one hour.  

If they both work for a whole day, which is 12 hours, we gotta figure out how much they make together.

First, let's see how much Ruiz makes in an hour: 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 of that, so she makes 3/4 * 60 pounds/hour = 45 pounds per hour.

Together, they make 60 pounds/hour + 45 pounds/hour = 105 pounds every hour!

In a whole day, that's 105 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1260 pounds of chocolate!


1260 

"
"Okay, so Howard starts with $100. On Monday he spends $8, then on Tuesday he spends double that, which is $16.  On Wednesday he spends four times what he spent on Tuesday, so that's $16 x 4 = $64.

To find out how much he has left, we add up all the money he spent: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Then we subtract that from his starting amount: $100 - $88 = $12.

Howard has $12 left. 



"
"Okay, so Patrick sold lemonade for a long time!  

First, he sold 15 cups every hour for 4 hours. That's 15 x 4 = 60 cups!

And each cup cost 50 cents, so he made 60 x $0.50 = $30.00

Then he sold 10 cups every hour for 2 hours, so that's 10 x 2 = 20 cups.

Those cups cost 60 cents each, so he made 20 x $0.60 = $12.00

To find out how much he made in total, we add the two amounts: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00


$42.00
"
"Okay, so the car's tires go around 725 times every 2 miles.  If Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that's 400 / 2 = 200 sets of 2 miles.

So the tires spin 200 * 725 = 145,000 times each month.

Each tire can handle 10,440,000 spins before it needs to be replaced.

So, 10,440,000 spins / 145,000 spins per month = 72 months.

That's 72 months / 12 months per year = 6 years. 

The tires will last for 6 years. 



"
"Okay, so the big shampoo bottle costs $24.00. It says you get 120 washes if you use 2 pumps each time. But Jackie only uses 1 pump, so she'll get twice as many washes, right? That's 120 washes * 2 = 240 washes.

So, each wash costs $24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10.  Since she uses one pump per wash, each pump costs 10 cents. 


10
"
"Okay, so Joe has $50 and wants to buy a shirt for $25 and shorts for $35.  That's a total of $25 + $35 = $60 before the sale.

But wait! There's a 30% off sale, so we gotta figure out how much that is. 

30% of $25 is $7.50 (I did 25 times 0.30 on my calculator).

30% of $35 is $10.50 (35 times 0.30).

So the shirt is now $25 - $7.50 = $17.50 and the shorts are $35 - $10.50 = $24.50.

That means the total cost is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00.

Joe started with $50 and spent $42.00, so he has $50 - $42.00 = $8.00 left. 


$8.00
"
"Okay, so he needs 1/4 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.  If he's making 4 dozen a day, that's 4 * (1/4) = 1 pound of butter each day.  

Since there are 7 days in a week, he'll need 1 * 7 = 7 pounds of butter for the whole week. 


7 

"
"Okay, so repaving Monica's street costs $194 per meter and it's 150 meters long. That means it costs $194 * 150 = $29100.

Lewis' street is way longer at 490 meters. So repaving his street would cost $194 * 490 = $95060.

To find out how much more it costs for Lewis' street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street: $95060 - $29100 = $65960.


$65960 

"
"Okay, so John starts with $100,000 for 5 months. That's $100,000 times 5, which is $500,000.

But then it takes him way longer, 10 times longer! That's 50 months total.  

For the rest of the time, he needs 50% more money each month. So, that's like adding half of $100,000, which is $50,000. So now each month costs $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000.

He needs that extra money for 45 months (50 total months - 5 starting months). So that's 45 times $150,000, which is $6,750,000.

Finally, we add the starting cost and the extra cost: $500,000 + $6,750,000 = $7,250,000.

His research cost $7,250,000. 



"
"Okay, so the first guy ate 6 ounces of steak. The second guy ate 8 little beef tips, and each one was 1 ounce, so that's 8 ounces. The third guy got a big steak that was a whole pound, and a pound is 16 ounces.  The last two guys didn't eat any meat.

So, 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces of meat.


30 

"
"Okay, so there are 1000 people in the group, and they each post 3 times a day.  That means there are 1000 times 3, which is 3000 posts every day!

March has 31 days, so we do 3000 times 31. That's 93,000 posts in the whole month!


93000 

"
"Okay, so Gary does laundry twice a week, and each time he uses 20 gallons of water. That's 2 * 20 = 40 gallons a week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so he uses 40 * 52 = 2080 gallons a year.

Water costs $0.15 per gallon, so he spends 2080 * $0.15 = $312 a year on laundry water.


$312 

"
"Okay, let's see... Scarlett spent $10 on the aquarium. Then she got rocks for $2.50 each, and she bought two bags, so that's $2.50 times 2, which is $5.  The coral was $2 each, and she got three, so that's $2 times 3, which is $6. The fish were 50 cents each, and she got 20, so that's 20 times $0.50, which is $10. And the fish food was $2.

So, to find the total, we add it all up: $10 + $5 + $6 + $10 + $2 = $33.00 


$33.00
"
"Okay, so the beanstalk starts at 3 inches. Then it doubles, so that's 3 times 2 which is 6 inches.  Then it grows 4 more inches, so 6 plus 4 is 10 inches.

"
"Okay, so Prince sells a lot of meat! He sells 15 kilograms every hour, and he works for 10 hours a day. That means he sells 15 times 10, which is 150 kilograms of meat every day.

Bill's bull is pretty big, weighing 750 kilograms.  To figure out how many days it'll take Prince to sell all that meat, we divide the total weight of the bull by how much he sells each day: 750 divided by 150 is 5.


5 

"
"Okay, so there are 4 rows with 18 seats each, that's 4 times 18 which is 72 seats total.  The administrators took up a quarter of them, so that's 72 divided by 4, which is 18 seats.  That leaves 72 minus 18, or 54 seats. The parents took up a third of those, so that's 54 divided by 3, which is 18 seats.  That means there were 54 minus 18, or 36 seats left for the students.


36 

"
"Okay, so there are 6 poles at each intersection, and each pole has 4 street lights. That means there are 6 * 4 = 24 street lights at each intersection.

Since there are 4 intersections, there are a total of 24 * 4 = 96 street lights.

But, 20 of them aren't working, so there are 96 - 20 = 76 street lights working. 


76 

"
"Okay, so one DVD can be played a thousand times before it breaks.  One DVD has already been played a bunch, 356 times.  The other one has only been played 135 times.  

So, the first DVD can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times.

The second DVD can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

If you add those together, you get 644 + 865 = 1509 times.


1509 

"
"Okay, so John went to physical therapy twice a week for 6 weeks. Each time he went, it was for 2 hours. That means he did 2 times 2, which is 4 hours of therapy each week.  

Over 6 weeks, that's 4 times 6, or 24 hours total.

Each hour costs $125, so 24 times 125 is... $3000! 



"
"Okay, so Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. At school, he chews one piece every two hours, and school is 8 hours long, so he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces at school.

Then he chews one on the way home and one after dinner, so that's 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces gone.

That leaves him with 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.

Before bed, he gives half of his gum to his sister, which is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces left.

"
"Okay, so Charmaine will be 16 in 12 years. That means she's 16 - 12 = 4 years old right now.  

In 4 more years, she'll be 4 + 4 = 8 years old.

"
"Okay, so the baseball coach spent 9 times 3 dollars, which is 27 dollars. The basketball coach spent 8 times 14 dollars, which is 112 dollars.  If you subtract 27 from 112, you get 85 dollars. 


$85 

"
"Okay, so Arianna has 10 rows of flowers and each row has 20 flowers. That's 10 times 20, which is 200 flowers in total. But only 4 out of every 5 flowers bloomed.  So, we need to do 200 times 4/5.  That equals 160 flowers.


160 

"
"Okay, so Ashley has 20 kb per second.  That's pretty fast!  But to figure out how fast it is in Mb per hour, we gotta do some math.

First, there are 1000 kb in 1 Mb, so 20 kb is like 0.02 Mb.

Then, there are 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 3600 seconds in an hour.

So, Ashley's speed is 0.02 Mb per second times 3600 seconds, which is 72 Mb per hour. 


72 

"
"Okay, so the tow truck towed 10 cars each day for the first three days, so that's 10 x 3 = 30 cars.

Then it towed 4 fewer cars each day for the rest of the week, so that's 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day.

There are 7 days in a week, and it already towed for 3, so that leaves 7 - 3 = 4 days.

So for those last 4 days, it towed 6 x 4 = 24 cars.

In total, it towed 30 + 24 = 54 cars that week.


54 

"
"Okay, so Adam needs to be 4 feet tall.  He's 40 inches now, which is 3 feet and 4 inches.  He needs to grow another 8 inches to be 4 feet tall. Since he grows 2 inches every year, it will take him 4 years to grow tall enough. 


4 

"
"Okay, so James sold 10 cars for $25,000 each, so that's 10 times 25,000 which is $250,000.  But the company had to pay for the cars first, and that was 30% of $250,000, which is $75,000.  So they made a profit of $250,000 minus $75,000, which is $175,000. James gets 10% of that, so he made $17,500.


$17,500
"
"Okay, so 25% of the surfers can stay up on the big wave, and that's 25 out of 100 surfers.  Then, 60% of those 25 surfers are girls, which is 15 girls.  That means 10 surfers who stayed up are boys.


10 

"
"Okay, so the diamond is $2000. The gold one is 4/5 of that, so it's like 4/5 times $2000 which is $1600.  The silver one is $400 cheaper than the gold one, so it's $1600 - $400 = $1200.

To find the total, we add them all up: $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800 



"
"Okay, so Max got 16 snowflake stamps. He got 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so that's 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.  He got 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, meaning he got 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total, we add up all the stamps: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps.


45 

"
"Okay, so Tom needs to make up 75 miles. He's going 15 miles per hour faster than Bob.  

That means it will take him 75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours to catch up.


5 

"
"Okay, so Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so he caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.  Tommy caught 3 more than Darren, so he caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.


14 

"
"Okay, so Manny's classes cost $60 total. His parents will only pay if each class costs $10 or less.  If there are 10 classes, that means they'd only pay $100 total.

So, Manny can spend $40 more before his parents say no. That means he can miss 4 classes because each one costs $10. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Jewel does 50 customers a day. Julie is twice as fast, so she does 50 x 2 = 100 customers a day.  Together they do 50 + 100 = 150 customers each day.

In a week, that's 150 x 7 = 1050 customers!


1050 

"
"Okay, so Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times that, which is 20 miles.  Reggie also ran 3 more miles than Lynn.  That means Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.


17 

"
"Okay, so apples are $1.30 each and oranges are $1.10 each.  Five apples would cost $6.50 (because 1.30 times 5 is 6.50) and five oranges would cost $5.50 (because 1.10 times 5 is 5.50).  

If you add those together, five apples and five oranges would cost $12.00. 


$12.00
"
"Okay, so the hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep.  That means it's 6 times 4 times 3, which is 72 cubic feet of dirt.

He takes 3 seconds to dig out each cubic foot, so it'll take him 72 times 3 seconds, which is 216 seconds to dig the whole hole. 


216 

"
"Okay, so the truck starts at $30,000.  The king cab costs an extra $7,500.  The leather seats are $7,500 divided by 3, which is $2,500. The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they're $2,000. The lights are $1,500.

So, all the extras cost $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500.

Adding that to the base price, the truck costs $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500.


$43,500 

"
"Okay, so Tim's getting a raise of 5% on his $20,000 a month salary. That means he gets an extra $1000 each month ($20,000 x 0.05 = $1000).

So now he makes $21,000 a month ($20,000 + $1000 = $21,000).

And he also gets a bonus equal to half his old salary, which is $10,000 ($20,000 / 2 = $10,000).

That means each month he makes $31,000 ($21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000).

In a year, he'll make $372,000 ($31,000 x 12 = $372,000).


$372,000 

"
"Okay, so James buys a bunch of stuff for his new wardrobe. Let's see...

* He gets 10 suits at $750 each, so that's 10 * $750 = $7500.
* The pants are cheaper, they're 1/5 the price of a suit, so $750 / 5 = $150 each. He buys 10 of those, so that's 10 * $150 = $1500.
* For every suit, he gets 3 shirts, and he has 10 suits, so that's 10 * 3 = 30 shirts. Each shirt is $60, so 30 * $60 = $1800.

Now, to find the total, we add up everything: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.


$10800
"
"Okay, so they put out 20 articles a day together, and there are 28 days in February.  If you multiply those together, you get 560 articles.

"
"Okay, so Steve is 60, and his wife is 4 years older, so she's 64. Their son is half his mom's age, which is 64 divided by 2, so he's 32.  His wife is 3 years younger than him, so she's 29. 


29 

"
"Okay, so each bag has 8 portions and each portion is 2 kilograms. That means one bag has 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms of flour.  If we have three bags, we multiply that by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

"
"Okay, so Alisa biked for a longer time and faster than Stanley.  Let's see... 12 miles an hour for 4 and a half hours... that's 12 times 4.5 which is 54 miles!  Stanley biked 10 miles an hour for 2 and a half hours, so that's 10 times 2.5 which is 25 miles.  

If we add those together, 54 plus 25 is 79 miles.


79 

"
"Okay, so Bill digs through the soil pretty fast, 4 feet every hour.  That means the soil part will take him 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

The clay is tougher, so he only digs half as fast. That means he digs 4 feet / 2 = 2 feet of clay every hour.  So the clay will take him 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

To find the total time, we add the time for the soil and the clay: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

"
"Okay, so Howie needs cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and all 25 of his classmates. That's 1 + 1 + 25 = 27 people.

Since he wants to give each person two cupcakes, he needs 27 x 2 = 54 cupcakes.

"
"Okay, so Fishio started with 2000 likes. Then after a few weeks, she had 70 times that amount, which is 2000 times 70, so that's 140,000 likes!  Then she got 20,000 more, so now she has 140,000 plus 20,000, which equals 160,000 likes.

"
"Okay, so Clara got a good deal on Tuesday! She saved $2 on 20 pomegranates, which is way better than paying full price.  

Then on Wednesday, the price went up a lot, but they had a discount.  

Let's see... 20 pomegranates at $30 each is $600.  Then they took 10% off, which is $60. So she paid $540 on Wednesday.

That means the difference is $540 - $398 = $142.


**Answer:** 142 

"
"Okay, so Ariadne sold $400 worth of red hats, and that was only half of what she made from green hats. So she made $400 * 2 = $800 from green hats.

That means in the first month she made $400 + $800 = $1200 total.

The next month she made 3/4 of what she made the first month, so she made $1200 * (3/4) = $900.

To find out how much she made in two months, we add the two months together: $1200 + $900 = $2100.


$2100
"
"Okay, so James gets a free hour, which is cool. That means he only has to pay for 3 hours. The first hour is $15, but then each hour after that is double, so the next two hours are $30 each.  

Let me see... $15 plus $30 plus $30 is $75.


75 

"
"Okay, so Sally started with $200 and now has $420. That means she got $420 - $200 = $220 this week.  But she should have gotten $300.  So they took out $300 - $220 = $80 from her paycheck.

"Okay, so Lori needs enough deviled eggs for 16 people, and each person wants 3 halves. That's 16 times 3, which is 48 deviled egg halves.

Since each egg makes 2 halves, she needs 48 halves divided by 2 halves per egg, which is 24 eggs.

A dozen has 12 eggs, so she needs 24 eggs divided by 12 eggs per dozen, which equals 2 dozen eggs.

"
"Okay, so Shiela needs to write 15 pages total. She already did 1/3 of it, which is like 5 pages.  That means she has 10 pages left to write. 


10
"
"Okay, so Mike has to read 200 pages in 30 days, and he wants to read 10 pages each day.  That means it will take him 20 days to finish the book (200 pages / 10 pages/day = 20 days).  

If he finishes in 20 days, and he has 30 days to do it, he'll be done 10 days early!

"
"Okay, so the plane cost a lot upfront, $150,000. Then every month he spends $5000 on the hanger and double that on fuel, so that's $5000 * 2 = $10,000 on fuel.  

That means each month costs him $5000 + $10000 = $15,000.

Over a whole year, that's $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

So in total for the first year, it cost him $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.


$330,000 

"
"Okay, so Finley cooked rice for 30 minutes. Pork took 20 minutes longer than that, so pork took 50 minutes.  

Then, beans took half the time it took to cook the rice and pork together. That's 30 + 50 = 80 minutes total. Half of 80 is 40 minutes for the beans.

To find the total cooking time, we add up the time for each thing: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.


120 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much more the first mix costs than the second mix.

The first mix has half a pound of almonds, which cost $5, and a third of a pound of walnuts, which cost $5 too. So that's $5 + $5 = $10 total.

The second mix has a fifth of a pound of almonds, which is $2, and the same amount of walnuts, so that's $2 + $5 = $7 total.

The difference is $10 - $7 = $3. 


$3
"
"Okay, so Lee has sheep and geese, right?  Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2.  We know there are 70 legs total and 20 heads.

Let's think about it... if all the animals were sheep, there would be way too many legs! So there have to be some geese.

Hmm... this is tricky. Maybe we can try guessing and checking?  Let's say there are 10 sheep. That's 40 legs. That leaves 30 legs for the geese, which means there would be 15 geese (30 / 2 = 15). But wait, 10 sheep and 15 geese is 25 heads, not 20!

Okay, let's try fewer sheep. How about 15 sheep? That's 60 legs. That leaves 10 legs for the geese, which means there would be 5 geese (10 / 2 = 5).  And 15 sheep plus 5 geese is 20 heads!

So I think there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm. 



"
"Okay, so Roger's coffee usually costs $5 a pound, but it's more expensive this time. It's 20% more, so that's like adding a dollar, right?  So the new price is $6 a pound.

He drinks a pound a day, and there are 7 days in a week, so that's 7 pounds of coffee. That's 7 times $6, which is $42.

Oh, and he got a donut for $2. So, all together it cost $42 + $2 = $44. 


$44
"
"Okay, so Gus spent $20.00 total.  The chips cost $4.00, the chicken was $8.00, and the soda was $1.00.  If you add those up, that's $13.00.  So the apple pie must have cost $7.00. 


$7.00
"
"Okay, so James delivers a bunch of newspapers.  He does 198 for District A and 209 for District C. That's 198 + 209 = 407 newspapers.

If he delivers 600 total, then he must deliver 600 - 407 = 193 to District B.


193 

"
"Okay, so John's class is 4 times a week and each class is 2 hours long. That's 4 times 2, which is 8 hours a week.  He does that for 6 weeks, so that's 8 times 6, which is 48 hours total.

He learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, so we gotta divide the total hours by 1.5.  48 divided by 1.5 is 32.


32 

"
"Okay, so there are 150 teachers, and 60% of them are history teachers. That means 150 x 0.6 = 90 teachers teach history.  

That leaves 150 - 90 = 60 math teachers.

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours, so all the math teachers sleep a total of 60 x 6 = 360 hours.


360 

"
"Okay, so Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 of that, which is like saying 3/4 * $120 = $90.  Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so she has $90 + $60 = $150.

If they put all their money together, they'd have $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.  

To split that evenly, we divide: $360 / 3 = $120.

So each person would have $120. 



"
"Okay, so the game is normally 4 quarters long, and each quarter is 12 minutes. That's 4 times 12, which is 48 minutes. But then they played 5 extra minutes because it was a tie. So, the whole game was 48 plus 5, which is 53 minutes long. 


53
"
"Okay, so 20% of the 50 employees are managers, which is 10 people.  Then, 30% of those managers oversee the whole company.  So that's 10 times 0.30, which equals 3 people.


3 

"
"Okay, so she needs 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons for each muffin.  If she's making 16 muffins, that's 8.25 x 16 = 132 tablespoons in total.


132 

"
"Okay, so they have 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds of candy all together.  If they split it evenly, each person gets 12 / 3 = 4 pounds of candy. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Adam bought 7 candies of type A at 50 cents each, so that's 7 times 0.50 which is $3.50.  He also got 10 candies of type B at 75 cents each, so that's 10 times 0.75 which is $7.50.  

In total, his candies cost $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00.

If he paid with $15, his change is $15 - $11.00 = $4.00.


$4.00 

"
"Okay, so Christina had 12 good days total. She already had 8 good days, then one more good day, and then another good day.  That's 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 good days.

If she had 12 good days total and already had 10, then she has 12 - 10 = 2 good days left. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Janey has 21 books, and that's 3 more than double what Sally has.  

To figure out how many books Sally has, we gotta work backwards.

If we take away those extra 3 books Janey has, she'd have 18 (21 - 3 = 18).

That 18 is double the number Sally has, so Sally has 9 books (18 / 2 = 9).


9 

"
"Okay, so the bamboo grows 30 inches every day.  It's already 20 feet tall, which is 240 inches.  We want to know how many days it takes to get to 600 inches.

First, we need to see how much more it needs to grow: 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches.

Then, we divide that by how much it grows each day: 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.


12 

"
"Okay, so James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs. Then 8 more dogs show up, so he needs 8 more toys. That's 12 toys total.

But wait, there are now twice as many dogs! That's 8 dogs times 2, which is 16 dogs.  So he needs 16 more toys, making it 28 toys.

Then 3 dogs leave, so he doesn't need those 3 toys anymore. 28 minus 3 is 25.

James needs 25 toys. 



"
"Okay, so they put in $1200 total. Dylan put in 2/5 of that, which is like $480.  Then Frances put in 2/3 of what was left, which is also $480.  So to find out how much Skyler put in, we subtract Dylan's and Frances' money from the total: $1200 - $480 - $480 = $240.


$240 

"
"Okay, so Carol and Jennifer have 20 + 44 = 64 signatures already. They want to get to 100, so they need 100 - 64 = 36 more signatures. 


36
"
"Okay, so Karen makes double what Lorie makes, which is $10 an hour. That means Karen makes $10 * 2 = $20 an hour.

If she works 3 hours a day, she makes $20 * 3 = $60 each day.

Over two days, she'd make $60 * 2 = $120.


120 

"
"Okay, so if 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, that means each potato makes 6 hash browns (36 divided by 6 is 6).  If you have 96 potatoes, you can make a whole bunch of hash browns!  You'd multiply 96 by 6, which is 576.


576 

"
"Okay, so Jack and his friends weigh a total of 720 kg (8 adults * 80 kg each + Jack's 80 kg).  The elevator can only hold 700 kg.  That means they're going over by 20 kg! 


20 

"
"Okay, so Katarina has 68 cookies. Max has 5 more than her, so he has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies. The Cookie Monster has 12 less than Max, so he has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies. Summer has 23 more than Max, so she has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total, we add up all the cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies. 



"
"Okay, so Shania made her dress longer by half its original size, which is like adding 50% more. Then she added 20cm of lace at the bottom.  If the dress is 140cm long now, we gotta figure out how long it was before.

Let's think:

* If the dress is 140cm now and that includes the extra 20cm of lace, then without the lace it was 140 - 20 = 120cm long.

* That 120cm is the original length PLUS half the original length.

* So, the original length is like 120cm divided into two equal parts.

*  120cm / 2 = 60cm


The original dress was 60cm long. 

"
"Okay, so Chris mows his whole lawn in an hour on turtle mode, which is 60 minutes.  Rabbit mode is faster, taking only 40 minutes. If he does half the lawn on each, that's 60 minutes divided by 2, which is 30 minutes for the turtle part. Then the rabbit part is 40 minutes divided by 2, which is 20 minutes.  So, 30 plus 20 is 50 minutes.


50 

"
"Okay, so they already walked for 6 minutes to the library, and then another 13 minutes to the fire station. That's 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.  They have 30 minutes total, so they have 30 - 19 = 11 minutes left to get to school.


11 

"
"Okay, so Catherine buys apples for $4. Then she gets 2 kilos of bananas at $2 each, so that's $4 for the bananas.  And the oranges are $3 a kilo, and she gets 2 kilos, so that's $6.  

Let's add it all up: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14. 


14
"
"Okay, so Celinda bakes double the amount Greta does, which is 30 * 2 = 60 cookies.  That means they baked a total of 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.  If they ate 10, there are 90 - 10 = 80 cookies left for the box.


80 

"
"Okay, so there's one twin who's older than one of the triplets by 7 years.  If all their ages add up to 44, we gotta figure out how old the twin is.

Hmm... let's see.  There are two twins, so let's say each twin is 't' years old. And there are three triplets, so each triplet is 'r' years old.

We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so  t = r + 7.

And we know that all their ages together equal 44, so 2t + 3r = 44.

Let's try plugging in 'r + 7' for 't' in the second equation:

2(r + 7) + 3r = 44

That's 2r + 14 + 3r = 44

Combining the 'r's, we get 5r + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides: 5r = 30

Divide both sides by 5: r = 6

So one triplet is 6 years old.

Now, remember the twin is 7 years older than the triplet, so the twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old! 



"
"Okay, so John has 3 hours before dinner, which is 180 minutes.  He has 20 minutes of math, 40 minutes of reading, and 20 minutes of history, so that's 80 minutes of homework total.  If we subtract his homework time from the time before dinner, he has 100 minutes left for a nap! 


100
"
"Okay, so Manolo buys 5 lollipops for 40 cents each, that's 5 times 40 cents, which is $2.00.  

That means the candies cost $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

If the candies cost $1.20 for 4 of them, then one candy costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

So 10 lollipops would cost 10 times 40 cents, which is $4.00.

And 10 candies would cost 10 times 30 cents, which is $3.00.

In total, that's $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.


$7.00 

"
"Okay, so Rong saves 20 coins each month, and Neil saves 2/5 more than that.  That means Neil saves 20 x (2/5) = 8 more coins than Rong.

So Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins each month.

Over ten years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.


5760 

"
"Okay, so John's dog needs two shots that cost $20 each, so that's $20 x 2 = $40.  The heartworm check is 60% of the whole bill, but we don't know the whole bill yet.  

Let's add up what we know: $40 for the shots.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total, so it's like 60 cents out of every dollar.  Since the shots are $40, the heartworm check is $40 x 0.60 = $24.

Now we know the whole bill is $40 + $24 = $64.

John brought $125, so he has $125 - $64 = $61 left. 


$61
"
"Okay, so they got 5 bananas, and each banana costs the same as two apples. Apples are 50 cents each, so bananas are $1.00 each.  That's $5.00 for the bananas.

Then there's 12 apples, and those are 50 cents each, so that's $6.00.

Oranges are tricky, they cost three times what a banana costs, so they're $3.00 each. With 7 oranges, that's $21.00.

Let's add it all up: $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00


$32.00
"
"Okay, so Brittany has a bunch of squares on her comforter. Let's see... she has 14 red ones. Then she has 4 more blue ones than red, so that's 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  She has 6 more green squares than blue, so that's 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. And she has 12 fewer white squares than green, so she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

To find out how big the comforter is, we add up all the squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, her comforter is 68 square feet big! 


68
"
"Okay, so Mia has 8 high chairs and 5 times that many regular chairs, which is 8 * 5 = 40 regular chairs.  That means she has a total of 40 + 8 = 48 chairs.

But she needs enough chairs for 42 adults and 15 babies, so that's 42 + 15 = 57 people.

She needs 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs. 


9 

"
"Okay, so half of the deer are bucks, right? That's 50 deer / 2 = 25 bucks.

Then, 20% of those bucks have 8 points.  So, 25 bucks * 0.20 = 5 bucks.


5 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out.

Betty got 30% more points than Adam, who has 50. That means Betty got 50 + (30/100 * 50) = 65 points.

Tom has 30 less points than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta did really well! She got 3 times more points than Tom, meaning she has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up all their points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 points to go on the trip, so they still need 400 - 255 = 145 more points. 


145
"
"Okay, so Great Grandma Jones has 3 kids.  Each of those kids has 3 kids, so that's 3 times 3 which is 9 grandkids. Then each of those grandkids has 3 babies, so that's 9 times 3 which is 27 great-grandbabies. 


27 

"
"Okay, so Greta makes $2400.  She saves half of that for retirement, which is $1200. Then she spends $480 on her car.  If you add those together, that's $1680 she spent.  

If she started with $2400 and spent $1680, she has $720 left. 


$720.00
"
"Okay, so there's space for 20 pencils, but 4 are missing. That means there are 16 pencils left in the box.  Since pencils come in pairs, we gotta divide the number of pencils by 2.  16 divided by 2 is 8.

So there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box. 

"
"Okay, so the city is shooting off a ton of fireworks! They have 15 boxes with 20 fireworks in each, so that's 15 times 20 which is 300 fireworks. Hannah can only see 40% of those, so we gotta do 300 times 0.40, which is 120 fireworks.  

Then Hannah's setting off her own fireworks, 3 boxes with 5 in each, so that's 3 times 5 which is 15 fireworks.

Finally, we add those together: 120 plus 15 equals 135 fireworks!


135 

"
"Okay, so there are 20 people going to the movies.  Each person gets 2 drinks and 3 snacks, so that's 20 x 2 = 40 drinks and 20 x 3 = 60 snacks.

That's a total of 40 + 60 = 100 drinks and snacks.

If each one costs $2, then they spent 100 x $2 = $200.


$200 

"
"Okay, so Gissela's truck can carry 4000 pounds. Gordy's truck is bigger and can carry 800 more pounds than that, so it can carry 4000 + 800 = 4800 pounds.

Together, Gissela and Gordy can carry 4000 + 4800 = 8800 pounds.

If all three trucks together can carry 11600 pounds, then Gary's truck must carry 11600 - 8800 = 2800 pounds.


2800 

"
"Okay, so there are 8 guys and 6 girls. The girls each ate 3 dumplings. The guys ate 1 more than the girls, so they ate 4 dumplings each.

Let's see... 8 guys times 4 dumplings each is 32 dumplings.  The girls ate 6 girls times 3 dumplings each, which is 18 dumplings.

So, Larry cooked 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings! 


50
"
"Okay, so Gerald and Julia split $100, and Gerald got 3 out of 5 parts. That means he got $60 (because 3 parts times $20 per part is $60).  If he spent $10 on a book, he has $50 left.


Answer: 50 

"
"Okay, so the cat is super fast, running 15 feet every second! The turtle is way slower, like 5 times slower.  That means the turtle only goes 3 feet every second (15 / 5 = 3).

If the turtle crawls for 40 seconds, it'll cover 120 feet (3 x 40 = 120).


120 

"
"Okay, so they want to raise $6300 and they already have $2100.  That means they need $4200 more.

If they raise $700 each hour, they need to raise for 6 more hours to get to their goal. 


6
"
"Okay, so Colorado City uses a bunch of water from the river, right?  They use 40% of it. And then, most of that water, like 80%, goes to factories and stuff.  So, to figure out how much they use for other things, like homes and stuff, we gotta do some math.

If 80% is for factories, then 20% is for everything else. And since they use 40% of the whole river's water, they use 20% of 40%, which is 8%.


8 

"
"Okay, so Alex makes $12 each day tutoring.  If she tutors for two whole weeks, that's 14 days (cause 7 days in a week times 2 is 14).  So, she'd make $12 x 14 = $168.


168 

"
"Okay, so they make 100 quarts of chocolate in 2 hours, which means they make 50 quarts each hour.  And they make 50 quarts of vanilla in 4 hours, so that's 12.5 quarts each hour.  

Together, that's 50 + 12.5 = 62.5 quarts every hour.

If they make that much every hour, in 48 hours they'd make 62.5 * 48 = 3000 quarts!


3000 

"
"Okay, so Marcus bought a bunch of stuff. Let's see... 5 croissants cost 5 times $3, which is $15.  Then 4 cinnamon rolls cost 4 times $2.50, so that's $10. The quiches are $12 because 3 times $4 is $12. And the muffins are $13 because 13 times $1 is $13.

So all that stuff together is $15 + $10 + $12 + $13 = $50.

But wait! He has a discount card for 10% off.  That means he saves $5 because 10% of $50 is $5.

So his total is $50 - $5 = $45. 


$45.00
"
"Okay, so ice cream is $1.50 a scoop, and if you buy two you get one free. That means every three scoops cost $3.00. Erin has $6.00, so she could buy two sets of three scoops, which is six scoops! 


3 

"
"Okay, so Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day and Amy eats 3.  That means after a week, Ginger eats 28 pieces (4 x 7) and Amy eats 21 pieces (3 x 7).  

After two weeks, Ginger eats 56 pieces (4 x 14) and Amy eats 42 pieces (3 x 14).

So Ginger has 44 pieces left (100 - 56) and Amy has 58 pieces left (100 - 42).

That means Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger (58 - 44).


14 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Boarden needs to cover two-thirds of his bathroom, which is 36 square feet.  That means he's covering 36 divided by 3, which is 12, and then times 2, so 12 times 2 is 24 square feet.

He needs 24 tiles for every square foot, so he'll need 24 times 24 tiles, which is 576 tiles.


576 

"
"Okay, so James paid $20 just to get in and then $1.50 for every pound of blueberries he picked. He got 30 pounds, so that's 30 times $1.50, which is $45.  

So in total, picking cost him $45 + $20 = $65.

If he bought them at the store, it would have cost $2.50 a pound times 30 pounds, so that's $75.

He saved $75 - $65 = $10 by picking his own blueberries!


Answer: 10 

"
"Okay, so they wanted to buy 500 computers at $700 each, but the price went up by 10%.  That means each computer costs $70 more.

So, each computer now costs $700 + $70 = $770.

To find the total cost, we multiply the new price by the number of computers: $770 * 500 = $385,000


$385,000 

"
"Okay, so he used 6 eggs and each egg has 75 calories, so that's 6 times 75 which is 450 calories.  The cheese and ham are each 2 ounces. Cheese has 120 calories per ounce, so that's 2 times 120, which is 240 calories. The ham is 40 calories per ounce, so 2 times 40 is 80 calories.  

Now we add it all up: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.


770 

"
"Okay, so pencils are 50 cents each, and you got 6 of those, so that's 6 times 50 cents, which is $3.00. Erasers are 25 cents each, and you got 8, so that's 8 times 25 cents, which is $2.00.  

In total, that's $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00.

If you paid with a $10 bill, your change would be $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00.


$5.00 

"
"Okay, so 100 people want to work at Google.  Only 30 of them get to have an interview. Then, only 20% of those people get a job offer. That's like 6 people. And then, only one-third of those people actually take the job. So, that's 2 people! 



"
"Okay, so Goldy gave away 3 sacks + 4 sacks = 7 sacks of rice.

Since each sack has 25 kilograms, she gave away a total of 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms of rice.


175 

"
"Okay, so Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, that's 3 + 5 = 8 boxes this week. Last week she only got 4 boxes.  So she bought 8 - 4 = 4 more boxes this week.

"
"Okay, so Helga's a super fast clog dancer!  Let's see...

When her arms are down, she taps 300 times with one foot and 250 with the other, so that's 300 + 250 = 550 taps every minute.

She dances with her arms down for 3 minutes, so that's 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.

When her arms are up, she taps 200 times with each foot, so that's 200 * 2 = 400 taps per minute.

She dances with her arms up for 2 minutes, so that's 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

In total, she taps 1650 + 800 = 2450 times!


2450 

"
"Okay, so Ron's car will get messed up for $450 if the pothole stays.  But if he fixes it, he has to pay $120 'cause the city is being mean, and then $75 for the stuff to fix it.  So, $120 plus $75 is $195.  That means he saves $450 - $195 = $255 by fixing it himself.


$255 

"
"Okay, so they started with 170 big chairs and 23 little chairs.  Then they took away 20 big chairs and 13 little chairs to fix.  

Let's see... 170 minus 20 is 150 big chairs left. And 23 minus 13 is 10 little chairs left.

So, 150 plus 10 is 160 chairs in total.


160 

"
"Okay, so there are 5 pizzas with 12 slices each, that's 60 slices total. Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, so they ate 2/3 * 12 slices/pizza * 3 pizzas = 24 slices.  The other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which is 3/4 * 12 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 18 slices.  

So in total, they ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices. That means there are 60 - 42 = 18 slices left.


18 

"
"Okay, so the cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog is faster and eats them in 2/3 of that time, which is 20 minutes.  

To find the average, we add the cat's time and the dog's time: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

Then we divide that total time by 2 because we're finding the average: 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes.


25 

"
"Okay, so Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long.  That's like 96 inches plus 4 inches, so it's 100 inches long!

It says his shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  So if we take away 10 inches from Topher's shoe size, we get 90 inches.

That 90 inches is 9 times the size of Bobby's shoe.  If we divide 90 inches by 9, we find out Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long.


**Answer:** 10 

"
"Okay, so Hannah is having a rough time. Let's see... she breaks windows on a quarter of the student cars, and there are 64 student cars.  That's 64 divided by 4, which is 16 cars. Each of those has 4 windows, so that's 16 times 4, which is 64 windows.

Then she breaks windows on three-quarters of the teacher cars. There are 32 teacher cars, so that's 32 times 3 divided by 4, which is 24 cars. Each teacher car has 2 windows, so that's 24 times 2, which is 48 windows.

Finally, we add up the windows she broke: 64 plus 48 is 112 windows. 


112 

"
"Okay, so Candy has a bunch of thread, right?  Let's see... 15 light blue and 45 dark blue, that's 60 blue spools in total.  She has 150 spools all together.  

To find the percentage, I think you do something like... 60 divided by 150, which is 0.4.  Then you move the decimal over two spots, so that's 40%!


40% 

"
"Okay, so 5000 people were waiting to vote. By midday, 2 out of every 5 people had voted. That's like 2/5 times 5000, which is 2000 people.

So, 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were still waiting.

Then, by 4 o'clock, 2 out of every 3 of those people voted. That's 2/3 times 3000, which is 2000 people.

That means 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people still hadn't voted.


1000 

"
"Okay, so Parker chews 4 pieces of gum every day, and he wants it to last for a whole month, which is 30 days.  A pack has 15 pieces.  

Let's see... he needs 4 pieces a day times 30 days, so that's 120 pieces in total.  

If each pack has 15, then he'll need 120 divided by 15, which is 8 packs.


8 

"
"Okay, so they need enough graham crackers for 9 kids who want 2 smores each, that's 9 times 2 which is 18 smores. Then there are 6 adults who want 1 smore each, so that's 6 more smores.  That's a total of 18 plus 6, which is 24 smores.

Each box has enough for 8 smores per sleeve, and there are 3 sleeves in a box, so that's 8 times 3 which is 24 smores per box.

They need enough for 24 smores, and each box makes 24 smores, so they only need 1 box! 


1 

"
"Okay, so Dora is 15. Her dad is twice her age plus 8 more years, so he's (15 * 2) + 8 = 38 years old. Her mom is 4 years younger than her dad, so she's 38 - 4 = 34 years old.

To find their total age, we add them all up: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 

So the answer is 87. 



"
"Greg found $20 and has 3 siblings, so he needs to split the money 4 ways (including himself).  That means each person gets $5. 



"
"Okay, so Cindy has two books that weigh 2 pounds each, so those are 2 x 2 = 4 pounds. Her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. Her history book is double her English book, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 pounds.  

To find the total, we add up all the weights: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds.


17 

"
"Okay, so Candidate A got 20 votes out of 100. Candidate B got 50% more than that, so that's like half of 20, which is 10, plus 20, so Candidate B got 30 votes.  That means Candidate C got the rest, which is 100 - 20 - 30 = 50 votes.


50 

"
"Okay, so Boris starts with 100 apples, and Beck has 23 less, so Beck has 77.  If Boris gives Beck 10, Beck has 87. Boris then has 90.  That means Boris has 3 more apples than Beck now. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Peter starts with 32 ounces of water.  He uses 12 ounces for the big cubes (3 cubes x 4 ounces each), 14 ounces for the medium cubes (7 cubes x 2 ounces each), and 4 ounces for the small cubes (8 cubes x 0.5 ounces each).

If you add all that up, he used 30 ounces of water.  That means he has 2 ounces left over. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Clara has 20 books and that's twice the number Steven has.  That means Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so she has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.


4 

"
"Okay, so a gallon of milk costs $5, and a half-gallon costs $3 because it's $2 cheaper.  

If Cecelia buys 10 gallons, that's 10 * $5 = $50.

And for the half-gallons, she buys 16 * $3 = $48 worth.

Adding those together, she spends $50 + $48 = $98. 



"
"Okay, so 10 kids like to bake and 5 like basketball. That's 15 kids total.  If 10 more kids like music than basketball, then 5 * 2 = 10 kids like music.  

That means 50 - 15 - 10 = 25 kids like video games.


25 

"
"Okay, so Jeremy starts with 12 birds. Then, he scares away a third of them, which is like 12 divided by 3, which is 4 birds.  That means 8 birds are left. Then, 20 more birds show up, so there are 8 plus 20, which is 28 birds in total.


28 

"
"Okay, so there are 80 students in total, and they're split into two classes, so each class has 40 kids.  If 40% are girls, that means 60% are boys.  

To find out how many boys are in each class, you do 40 students * 60% which is 24 boys.


24 

"
"Okay, so Mara starts with 2 slices, then adds 3 more. That's 2 + 3 = 5 slices.  Then she triples them, so she has 5 x 3 = 15 slices!  But then she eats 2, so there are 15 - 2 = 13 left.  Uh oh, her friend takes 5, so that leaves 13 - 5 = 8 slices.


8 

"
"Okay, so Melissa has to groom a bunch of animals this week. Let's see... 8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses is a total of 28 animals.  

Since there are 7 days in a week, she'll groom 28 animals / 7 days = 4 animals each day.


4 

"
"Okay, so Mark spent 3 times $1800 on the packs, which is $5400.  He got two really good cards worth $4000 and $1000, so that's $5000 right there. Then he got 30 more cards worth $50 each, so those are worth $1500.  

If you add up all the money he made from the cards, it's $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find his profit, you subtract how much he spent from how much he made: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

So Mark made a profit of $1100. 



"
"Okay, so Jake's family has 2 adults and 2 kids.  

The first park costs $26 per adult and $12 per kid, so that's 2 * $26 = $52 for the adults and 2 * $12 = $24 for the kids.  That's a total of $52 + $24 = $76 for the first park.

The second park is $14 per adult and $10 per kid. So that's 2 * $14 = $28 for adults and 2 * $10 = $20 for kids. That's $28 + $20 = $48 for the second park.

If they go to the second park, they'll save $76 - $48 = $28.


$28
"
"Okay, so he saves $0.10 on each tomato.  Since he sells 500 tomatoes a day, that's 500 x $0.10 = $50 saved every day.

If he saves $50 a day, then in a week he saves $50 x 7 = $350.


$350 

"
"Okay, so Sean has 56 marbles. Cal has twice that amount, which is 56 x 2 = 112 marbles. Carl has four times the amount Sean has, so he has 56 x 4 = 224 marbles.  To find the total for Carl and Cal, we add their marbles together: 224 + 112 = 336 marbles.


336 

"
"Okay, so they have 54 students and want to split them into 12 groups.  If they make groups of 9, that's 6 groups.  To get to 12 groups, they need 6 more groups.


6 

"
"Okay, so Candy rents out chairs. On weekdays she rents 60 a day, and that's 5 days a week, so that's 60 times 5 which is 300 chairs. On weekends she rents 100 a day, and there are 2 weekend days, so that's 100 times 2 which is 200 chairs.  

That means she rents out 300 plus 200, which is 500 chairs every week.

In a month, there are 4 weeks, so she rents 500 times 4 which is 2000 chairs each month.

If she does this for two months, she'll rent out 2000 times 2 which is 4000 chairs.


4000 

"
"Okay, so Gunther starts with 48 bananas. Then that sneaky Arnold takes half, which is 24 bananas.  That leaves Gunther with 24 bananas.

Gunther adds 25 more, so now he has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

But then Arnold steals 12 more!  That means Gunther only has 49 - 12 = 37 bananas left.

Finally, Gunther adds 6 more, so he ends up with 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.


Answer: 43 

"
"Okay, so there are 4 roommates splitting a $100 bill. That means each roommate pays $25 each month.  If there are 12 months in a year, each roommate pays $25 times 12, which is $300 for the whole year.


$300 

"
"Okay, so Jeff had a bunch of glasses and plates for a party. He started with 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 times 12, so that's 96 glasses. He also had 4 dozen plates, which is 4 times 12, or 48 plates.

But then some stuff broke! 10 glasses broke, so he has 96 minus 10, which is 86 glasses left. And 6 plates broke, so he has 48 minus 6, which is 42 plates left.

To find out how many glasses and plates he has total now, we add them up: 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128.


128 

"
"Okay, so Lorraine has a lot of stickers! Let's see...

She trades most of her small stickers for big buttons, which is a good deal because big buttons are worth more. Then she trades some of her big stickers for even more big buttons.  The rest of her big stickers she trades back for small buttons.

Hmm, if you add up all the buttons she gets from each trade, it comes out to 107 buttons! 



"
"Okay, so Joey played 2 games on Monday, then 1 on Friday. On Saturday, he played twice as many as Monday, so that's 2 times 2 which is 4 games.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 games. 

So Joey played 7 games last week. 

"
"Okay, so there are 33 people voting, and twice as many people voted yes than no.  That means if we split the council into three groups, one group voted no and two groups voted yes.

So, 33 people divided by 3 is 11. That means 11 people voted no.

Since twice as many voted yes, then 11 x 2 = 22 people voted yes.


22 

"
"Okay, so Krissa has a lot of kids to buy shirts for! Let's see...

* She needs 11 extra-small shirts.
* Twice as many kids need small, so that's 11 x 2 = 22 small shirts.
* Four less kids need medium than small, so that's 22 - 4 = 18 medium shirts.
* Half as many kids need large as medium, so that's 18 / 2 = 9 large shirts.
* Six more kids need extra-large than large, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 extra-large shirts.

To find the total, we add them all up: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts.


75 

"
"Okay, so the bag is 5% off, which means it's cheaper than the sticker price.  

First, you gotta figure out how much the discount is. 5% of $140... hmm... that's like 5 out of every 100 dollars. So, 5% of $140 is $7.

Then you take that $7 off the original price: $140 - $7 = $133.


So the bag costs $133 after the discount. 

"
"Okay, so John has a lot of music!  

He has 20 playlists with 300 songs each, so that's 20 * 300 = 6000 songs total.

Each song is 10 hours long, so all those songs together are 6000 * 10 = 60,000 hours of music!

60000 

"
"Okay, so 20 out of 50 people like horse #2. That leaves 30 people. Then 60% of those 30 people like horse #7.  So that's 18 people.  That means 12 people must like horse #12! 



"
"Okay, so if 6 Pomeranian girls are one-third of all the Pomeranians, then there are 6 x 3 = 18 Pomeranians total.  Since Pomeranians are two-thirds of all her puppies, Jana has 18 x 3 / 2 = 27 puppies.


27 

"
"Okay, so Jayden has $70 and his sister gives him half of her $90, which is $45.  That means he has $70 + $45 = $115.  The camera costs $200, so he still needs $200 - $115 = $85.


$85 

"
"Okay, so they need 250 cases total. The second house needs a regular amount, let's call it 'x'. The first house needs half of that, so that's x/2. The third house needs double the first house, so that's 2 * (x/2) which is just x.

So, it's like this: x/2 + x + x = 250

That means 2.5x = 250

If we divide both sides by 2.5, we get x = 100.

That means the third house needs 100 cases of shingles! 


100
"
"Okay, so Leila spent 3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6.  Jack spent 5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5. And Chase spent $3 on lettuce.  

If you add those up, they spent a total of $6 + $5 + $3 = $14 on salad stuff.


14 

"
"Okay, so George has a lot more pears than bananas.  If he has 200 bananas and 45% more pears, that means he has 200 * 0.45 = 90 more pears.

So he has 200 + 90 = 290 pears.

In total, he has 290 pears + 200 bananas = 490 fruits! 


490 

"
"Okay, so Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on a ball. That means she has $60 left for candy bars.  Each candy bar costs $5, so she could buy $60 / $5 = 12 candy bars.


12 

"
"Okay, so Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges for every liter of juice.  If he wants to make 4 liters, he'll need 5 times 4, which is 20 kilograms of oranges.

Each kilogram costs $3, so 20 kilograms will cost 20 times 3, which is $60. 


$60
"
"Okay, so Ezra read 300 books, and that's twice as many as Ahmed.  That means Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Ezra read 150 more books, so now he's read 300 + 150 = 450 books.

Together they read 450 + 150 = 600 books.


600 

"
"Okay, so Tanya gets paid $15 for each hour she teaches. On Monday, she taught for 5 hours, so she made 15 times 5 which is $75.  She also taught more than 3 classes that day, so she gets an extra $5. That means she made $75 + $5 = $80 on Monday.

On Wednesday, she taught for 2 hours, so she made $15 times 2 which is $30. She didn't teach more than 3 classes that day, so she doesn't get the extra $5.

To find out how much she made in total, we add up what she made on Monday and Wednesday: $80 + $30 = $110.


110 

"
"Okay, so they sold 5 of each vanilla scent, and they have 4 vanilla scents, so that's 5 x 4 = 20 vanilla scents sold.

They sold 2 of each fruity scent, and they have 8 fruity scents, so that's 2 x 8 = 16 fruity scents sold.

They sold 20 - 16 = 4 more vanilla scents than fruity scents.


4 

"
"Okay, so Bennet makes $60 from selling his eggplants.  That means he needs to make another $75 from the corn.  If he has 25 ears of corn, he needs to sell each one for $3 to make that much money. 


$3
"
"Okay, so Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 on Sunday, that's 12 hours total. She reads for 3 hours, so she has 12 - 3 = 9 hours left.  She spends a third of that time on video games, which is 9 / 3 = 3 hours. That means she plays soccer for 9 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage, we do (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100% = 50%. 

So she spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer. 


50
"
"Okay, so Anthony starts with 50 pencils. He gives half to Brandon, which is 25 pencils. That leaves him with 25 pencils. Then he gives Charlie 3/5 of those, which is 15 pencils.  So Anthony keeps 25 - 15 = 10 pencils.


10 

"
"Okay, so Jack drives 150 miles to the museum and then 150 miles back home, that's 300 miles total.  If he drives 75 miles per hour, that means it takes him 4 hours to get there and 4 hours to get back.  So that's 8 hours of driving. Plus the 6 hours at the museum, he's gone for a total of 14 hours. 


14 

"
"Okay, so Henry needs wheels for 57 cars and 73 motorcycles. Cars need 4 wheels each, and motorcycles need 2.  

Let's see... 57 cars times 4 wheels is 228 wheels. And 73 motorcycles times 2 wheels is 146 wheels.  

That means he needs 228 + 146 = 374 wheels total.

He has 650 wheels, so he'll have 650 - 374 = 276 wheels left over.


276 

"
"Okay, so if the laptop is $1000 and it's 20% off, you gotta figure out what 20% of 1000 is.  That's like 20 out of every 100, so you multiply 1000 by 0.20 (which is the same as 20/100).  That's $200 off! So you'd pay $800. 



"
"Okay, so Mike has a lot of movies!  Let's see... a third of his 600 movies are in series, so that's 600 divided by 3, which is 200 movies.  Those are cheaper, like getting a deal for buying the whole set.  They're only a third of the price of a normal movie, so each one costs $10 times (1/3), which is $3.33.  So those 200 movies cost 200 times $3.33, which is $666.67.

Now, he has 600 minus 200, which is 400 movies left.  Forty percent of those are old movies, so that's 400 times 0.40, which is 160 movies. Those are $5 each, so they cost 160 times $5, which is $800.

That leaves 400 minus 160, which is 240 movies that are normal price. Those cost $10 each, so they're 240 times $10, which is $2400.

Finally, we add up all the costs: $666.67 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67 



"
"Okay, so Winston got 6 pounds of peaches at $2 a pound, so that's 6 times 2 which is $12.  Then he got 8 pounds of plums at $1 a pound, so that's 8 times 1 which is $8.  And lastly, he got 6 pounds of apricots at $3 a pound, so that's 6 times 3 which is $18.  

To find out how much he spent in total, we add up the cost of each fruit: $12 + $8 + $18 = $38.00 



"
"Okay, so they drove for 4.5 hours (6 hours total - 1.5 hours hiking) at 50 miles per hour. That means they drove 225 miles (4.5 hours * 50 miles per hour).

Then they hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, so they hiked 30 miles (1.5 hours * 20 miles per hour).

To find the total distance, we add the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.


255 

"
"This problem is kinda tricky!  

We know Ava does better in some ways, but worse in others.  To figure out who wins, we'd need to know how many enemies each girl jumps on, how many berries they get, and how much time is left on the timer when they finish. 

Since we don't have those numbers, we can't say for sure who wins.  It depends on all those things! 

"
"Okay, so they spent $64 on four pizzas, and two of them cost $30.  That means the other two pizzas cost $34 altogether.  If they cost the same, each of those pizzas cost $17. 


$17
"
"Okay, so they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, that's 3 x 5 = 15 times.

Then there are two days where they ride twice as much, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 times each day.

For those two days, they ride a total of 6 x 2 = 12 times.

Adding it all up, they ride 15 + 12 = 27 times in a week. 


27 

"
"Okay, so Bob starts with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He buys a bunch more, but we don't know how many are orange or white.  

After he gets the new fish, he has twice as many orange fish as white fish. That means if he has, say, 6 white fish, he must have 12 orange fish.

We know he bought 17 fish total. Let's see... if he bought 4 white fish, that would make 8 white fish total (4 he started with + 4 new ones).  That means he'd have 16 orange fish (twice the white fish).  

Hmm, that doesn't work because 16 orange fish plus 8 white fish is only 24 fish, not the 24 he should have after buying 17 more.

Let's try if he bought 3 white fish. That would be 7 white fish total and 14 orange fish.  That adds up to 21 fish, which is still not right.

Wait! If he bought 4 white fish, that would be 8 white fish total and 16 orange fish. That's 24 fish total, which is right!



So the answer is 4. 

"
"Okay, so Andy drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home every day. That's 10 miles a day.  He does that 5 days a week, so that's 10 times 5, which is 50 miles a week.

His car gets 10 miles per gallon, so he uses 50 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 5 gallons of gas each week.

Gas costs $3 a gallon, so 5 gallons times $3 a gallon is $15.


$15 

"
"Okay, so Carrie got ten twenties, which is like ten times $20, so that's $200.  She also got 140 quarters, and each quarter is $0.25, so that's 140 times $0.25, which is $35.

She spent three-fifths of the twenties, so that's like 3/5 times $200, which is $120.

To find out how much she spent total, we add up the twenties she spent and the quarters: $120 + $35 = $155.


155 

"
"Okay, so Ricardo has 5 tomato plants and each one gives him 22 tomatoes. That's 5 times 22, which is 110 tomatoes.  He also has 8 eggplant plants and each one gives him 4 eggplants. So that's 8 times 4, which is 32 eggplants.  To find the total, we add the tomatoes and eggplants: 110 + 32 = 142.

So Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his garden. 



"
"Okay, so Samwell sold 40 TVs in total.  A quarter of them were smart TVs, which is 40 divided by 4, that's 10 smart TVs. Then he sold 5 analog TVs because that's 40 divided by 8.  So, 10 plus 5 is 15 TVs that weren't OLED. That means he sold 40 minus 15, which is 25 OLED TVs.


25 

"
"Okay, so the trip costs $300, and the school is paying for half, which is $150.  That means John still needs $150. Since he already has $50, he's missing $100.


$100 

"
"Okay, so it's 45 degrees during the day but way colder at night, like 33 degrees colder!  That means it's only 12 degrees at night.  Brrr!  The pipes will freeze if it gets below 32 degrees, so Carson needs to warm things up by 20 degrees (32 - 12 = 20). Each log heats things up by 5 degrees, so he needs to burn 4 logs. 


4 

"
"Okay, so there are 90 people and they need to be in groups of 9. That means there are 10 groups total (90 / 9 = 10).  

Three-fifths of the groups brought back seashells, so that's 6 groups (10 x 3/5 = 6).

Each person in those groups brought back 2 seashells, and there are 9 people in each group, so that's 18 seashells per group (2 x 9 = 18).

Finally, we multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by the number of seashells per group: 6 groups * 18 seashells/group = 108 seashells.


108 

"
"Okay, so there were 172 people on the train. Then 47 got off, and 13 got on, so that's 172 - 47 + 13 = 138 people. Then 38 more got off, so there are 138 - 38 = 100 people left on the train.


100 

"
"Okay, so Damien finds 10 bottle caps every day, and each one is worth 25 cents. That means he makes 10 times 25 cents, which is $2.50 each day.

If he does that for a whole month of 30 days, he'd make $2.50 times 30, which is $75.00! 


$75.00
"
"Okay, so Jamie makes $20 for every hour she works.  She worked 8 hours like normal, so that's $20 x 8 = $160.

But she worked 3 extra hours, which is overtime.  Overtime pays more! It's 150% of her normal pay, so that's $20 x 1.50 = $30 per hour for overtime.

For those 3 overtime hours, she made $30 x 3 = $90.

To find her total pay, we add her regular pay and overtime pay: $160 + $90 = $250.


$250
"
"Okay, so there are 12 girl lions, and half that number of boy lions, which is 6.  Then there are 14 baby lions.  If you add them all up, there are 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 lions in total. 


32 

"
"Okay, so the jeans are normally $40, but they're 25% off.  That means they're cheaper by $10 (because 25% of 40 is 10). So the jeans cost $30 now. If Mike pays with a $50 bill, he'll get $20 back. 


$20.00
"
"Okay, so they start with 200 people. Then they add 20 more each month for three months, so that's 20 * 3 = 60 new people.

That means they have 200 + 60 = 260 people working there.

If each person makes $4000, then they pay out 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000 in total.


1040000 

"
"Okay, so they sing ""Deck the Halls"" two times and that song is 150 seconds long, so that's 150 times 2 which is 300 seconds. Then they sing ""Jingle Bells"" once, and that's 240 seconds.  So to find the total time, we add 300 and 240, which is 540 seconds.


540 

"
"Okay, so Billy gets paid $11.50 an hour now. Sally makes $10.50 an hour. If they both work 20 hours, Billy makes $230 ($11.50 x 20) and Sally makes $210 ($10.50 x 20).  That means Billy makes $20 more than Sally.


$20 

"
"Okay, so three loaves of bread would cost 3 times $2, which is $6. Two bagels would cost 2 times $1, which is $2.  That means three loaves cost $4 more than two bagels.


$4 

"
"Okay, so Pierson scored 278 points. Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score.  Half of Pierson's score is 278 divided by 2, which is 139. Then we add 11 to that, so Nikita scored 150. To find the total, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score: 278 + 150 = 428.


428 

"
"Okay, so there are 40 classes with 25 kids in each, so that's 40 times 25 which is 1000 kids.  Each kid plants one tree, so that's 1000 trees. Then there are 3 teachers per class, so that's 40 times 3 which is 120 teachers. Each teacher plants 2 trees, so that's 120 times 2 which is 240 trees.  

So in total, they plant 1000 plus 240 trees, which is 1240 trees! 


1240
"
"Okay, so Bubbles has a bunch of stuffed animals: 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. That's 14 in total.  She wants goats to be 30% of her collection.  

To find out how many goats that is, I did 14 times 0.30, which is 4.2.  Since you can't have part of a stuffed animal, she needs to buy 5 goats. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Kris wants to play for 30 hours total.  Let's see... she plays for half an hour each day for two weeks, that's 14 days. So that's 0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours.

Then she plays 2 hours a day for a whole week, which is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

Adding those together, she's played 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

She needs to play 30 hours total, so she still needs to play 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 more hours.


9 

"
"Okay, so the second car is going 10 miles per hour faster.  That means every hour it gets 10 miles ahead of the first car. After two hours, it will be 20 miles ahead! 


20
"
"Okay, so the diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300, so that's $600 + $300 = $900.  

But there's also a 30% extra charge to make it.  That means 30% of $900 is extra.  

30% of $900 is like 30/100 times $900, which is $270.

So, the total cost is $900 + $270 = $1170.


$1170 

"
"Okay, so let's see...

Third grade: 340 out of 500 passed.

Fourth grade: 40 out of 100 passed.

Fifth grade:  They passed twice as much as fourth grade, so that's 40 * 2 = 80 out of 100 passed.

So, 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 kids passed in total.

And there are 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 kids total.

That means 700 out of 1000 passed, so the pass rate is 70%. 


70
"
"Okay, so Milo needs 12 chips for every inch of his mosaic, and it's gonna be 3 inches tall. That means he needs 12 * 3 = 36 chips for every inch of length. He has two bags with 72 chips each, so that's 2 * 72 = 144 chips total.  

To find out how long he can make it, we divide the total chips by the chips per inch: 144 chips / 36 chips/inch = 4 inches.

So he can make his mosaic 4 inches long. 


4
"
"Okay, so they had 10 quarts left.  Four kids drank 1.5 quarts each, so that's 4 times 1.5 which is 6 quarts. Then 16 kids drank 2 quarts each, so that's 16 times 2 which is 32 quarts.  

So in total they drank 6 plus 32 which is 38 quarts.

That means they started with 38 plus the 10 they have left, so 48 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, they started with 48 divided by 4 which is 12 gallons.


12 

"
"Okay, so Dale started with 100 candies, but then he sold 150. That's weird, right?  He must have gotten more!  He got 100 more, so now he has 200 candies. Since he already sold 150, he needs to sell 50 more. 


50
"
"Okay, so they start with 10 students.  Then each month, the number doubles.  So after one month, there's 20, then 40, then 80, then 160, and finally 320 by the end of May.

That means 310 more students joined! 



"
"Okay, so Felix made $105 and each branch costs 25 cents to climb.  To find out how much he climbed, we gotta divide the total money by the price per branch: $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches.

If he worked 5 days, we divide the total branches by the number of days: 420 branches / 5 days = 84 branches per day.


84 

"
"Okay, so Rose picks a bunch of flowers, right? Let's see...

* First, she gets 3 flowers with 5 petals each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 petals.
* Then she gets 4 flowers with 6 petals each, so that's 4 * 6 = 24 petals.
* Next, she gets 5 flowers with 4 petals each, so that's 5 * 4 = 20 petals.
* Finally, she gets 6 flowers with 7 petals each, so that's 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

That's a total of 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

But wait, she drops one of each kind of flower!  So that's 5 petals gone.

So, there are 101 - 5 = 96 petals left in the vase. 


96
"
"Okay, so they started with 35 marshmallows. They used 9 for each of their s'mores, so that's 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows gone.  They also dropped 3, so that's 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows gone.

That means they have 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows left. Since each s'more needs one marshmallow, they can each have 14 / 2 = 7 s'mores.


7 

"
"Okay, so Jack plays for 20 minutes with one quarter. His friends who aren't as good only get 10 minutes per quarter, and his really good friend gets 30 minutes.  They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

Let's see... Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters.

His not-so-good friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters, and there are two of them, so that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The really good friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters.

In total, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is $0.25, they spend 68 * $0.25 = $17.00. 



"
"Okay, so Tanya uses the same amount of zest and fragrance. Let's say she uses 1 ounce of each.  She uses twice as much salt as zest, so that's 2 ounces of salt. She also uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so that's another 2 ounces.  

Now, she uses twice as much oil as salt, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 ounces of oil.

So the answer is 4! 



"
"Okay, so John bought 3 goats and each goat cost $500. That's 3 times 500, which is $1500.  He also got 2 cows, and each cow was $1500. So that's 2 times 1500, which is $3000.  To find out how much he spent total, we add the cost of the goats and the cows: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.


$4500 

"
"Okay, so Paul needs 63 cupcakes total. He already has 8 chocolate ones and 40 toffee ones.  That means he has 48 cupcakes already (8 + 40 = 48).  

To find out how many more he needs, we subtract: 63 - 48 = 15.

He needs to buy 15 more cupcakes. 



"
"Okay, so Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20. That means Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Then he sells 20% of his cars, which is like 20/100 * 40 = 8 cars.

He gives his mom twice the number he sold, so that's 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

In total, he gave away 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

So, Joe has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.


16 

"
"Okay, so they raised $175,000 total, but $50,000 came from other places. That means the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Since there are 20 students, each student raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250. 


$6,250
"
"Okay, so Sandy walked for 8 hours the first day.  The second day she walked half that time, so that's 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

That means she walked a total of 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

To get that in minutes, we multiply by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour: 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.


720 

"
"Okay, so Hunter saw 50 cars at first. Then 20 more came, so there were 70 cars. But then half of them left, which is like 70 divided by 2. That's 35 cars. 


35 

"
"Okay, so John does a lot of work!  Let's see... he does 30 sets of tasks each day, and each set has 5 tasks.  If each task pays him $1.20, that means he makes $6.00 for each set.  So, in a day he makes $6.00 times 30, which is $180.00.  

If he works for a whole week, that's 7 days, so he makes $180.00 times 7, which is $1260.00.


$1260.00 

"
"Okay, so Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Julie got 4 less than that, so she scored 10 points.  In the second game, Sasha scored 6 less than Julie did in the first game, so she scored 4 points.  To find Sasha's total points, we add up her scores from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.


18 

"
"Okay, so Kimberly has a lot of pets! Let's see... she has 8 packs of cat food and each one has 11 cans, so that's 8 times 11 which is 88 cans of cat food.  She has 6 packs of dog food with 6 cans each, so that's 6 times 6 which equals 36 cans of dog food.  To find the difference, we do 88 minus 36, which is 52.

So Kimberly has 52 more cans of cat food than dog food. 



"
"Okay, so PJ has some cards, let's call it 'x'. Smendrick has three times that amount, so he has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so she has 3x + 12 cards.

If we add up all their cards, it should equal 341. So, x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Let's solve for x:

*  Combine the 'x' terms: 7x + 12 = 341
*  Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329
*  Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

Now we know PJ has 47 cards.  Becca has 3 times that plus 12, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.


153
"
"Okay, so Cindy had 5 green eggs. She had twice that many blue eggs, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs.  She had one less pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  Then she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

To find the total, we add them all up: 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs. 


27
"
"Okay, so Milly's book cost $32, but she's only getting $24 back from Amazon.  That's already a loss of $8. Then she has to pay to ship it back. It costs 35 cents per pound to ship, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so that's $1.40. Plus, it costs 8 cents per mile to ship, and it's 20 miles away, so that's another $1.60.  

So shipping costs $3 total ($1.40 + $1.60).

That means she loses $8 (from the refund) + $3 (for shipping) = $11. 




"
"Okay, so Mulan starts with $40 and gets $100 from her dad, so she has $140.  The jeans cost $30 each, and she buys two, so that's $60. Then the bag is $20.  So in total, she spends $60 + $20 = $80.  If she started with $140 and spent $80, she has $60 left.


$60 

"
"Okay, so Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars every month.  In the first week he makes 8,000. Then in the second week he only makes half of that, which is 4,000.  The third week is crazy busy, he makes three times the first week, so that's 8,000 times 3, which is 24,000 bars!

That's a lot of chocolate!  So in the first three weeks he made 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

To get to 50,000 for the whole month, he needs to make 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars in the last week.


14000 

"
"Okay, so Britany makes a lot of TikToks! Let's see... she makes 18 videos a week, and each one is 4 minutes long.  That's 18 times 4, which is 72 minutes just for the videos.

Then she spends 2 whole hours writing songs, which is 120 minutes. And she does her makeup for 15 minutes every day for 6 days, so that's 15 times 6, which is 90 minutes.

So in total, each week she spends 72 + 120 + 90 minutes on TikTok, which is 282 minutes.

But we want to know how much time she spends in a month, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So we multiply 282 by 4, and that's 1128 minutes.

That's a lot of TikTok!  

1128 

"
"Okay, so the basic install is $129.  She needs 2 extra mirrors, and each extra thing costs $15, so that's 2 times 15, which is $30.  She also has one extra chandelier, so that's another $15.  And she has 10 extra pictures, so that's 10 times 15, which is $150.  

Let's add it all up: $129 + $30 + $15 + $150 = $324.00 


$324.00
"
"Okay, so Eva has $20.00. Anthony has $10.00 more than Eva, so he has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00. Roy saved 40% more than Anthony. That means he saved an extra (40/100) * $30.00 = $12.00.  So Roy has $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.


$42.00 

"
"Okay, so Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. Saskay can lift it 12 times higher, so that's 12 inches. Kagiyami can lift it 4 times higher than Saskay, so that's 12 times 4, which is 48 inches. Naruto is super strong and can lift it 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so that's 48 times 10, which is 480 inches.  

But we need to know how many feet that is. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 480 inches is 480 divided by 12, which equals 40 feet.


40 

"
"Okay, so Mason bikes 8 miles every hour.  He bikes for 4 hours, then rests, and then bikes for another 6 hours.  

To find out how far he went in total, we gotta do some multiplying!

* First 4 hours: 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
* Next 6 hours: 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Now we add those together: 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles


80 

"
"Okay, so three kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. That means one kangaroo would take three times as long, which is 54 hours.

If a turtle is half as fast as a kangaroo, it would take a turtle 54 hours times 2, which is 108 hours to cross.

But we have four turtles, so they'd be four times faster than one turtle. That means it would take them 108 hours divided by 4, which is 27 hours.


27 

"
"Okay, so Kora made 20 dishes. Rory made 20 more than that, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. Jada made twice as many as Rory, so she made 40 * 2 = 80 dishes.  To find the total, we add up all the dishes: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.


140 

"
"Okay, so the laptop costs $600, but it's $200 cheaper if she trades in her old one. That means it'll cost $400.

She got $150 from her job and her mom gave her $80.  She also needs $50 more, so that means she has $150 + $80 + $50 = $280.

If she needs $50 more to buy the laptop, she must have $280 - $50 = $230 in her purse.

$230 

"
"Okay, so Adam has 3 big apples and each one makes 5 slices, that's 3 times 5 which is 15 slices. Then he has 5 small apples and each one makes 3 slices, so that's 5 times 3 which is 15 slices too.  That means he has a total of 15 plus 15, which is 30 slices. But he eats 15, so there are 30 minus 15 slices left.

15 

"
"Okay, so the farmer gets 5 liters from each cow every day. He has 3 cows, so that's 5 x 3 = 15 liters.

He wants 25 liters, so he needs 25 - 15 = 10 more liters.

Since each cow gives 5 liters, he needs 10 / 5 = 2 more cows. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Patrick has three glue sticks.  Let's see...

* The first one has 1/6 left, so that means 5/6 of it is gone.
* The second one has 2/3 gone, leaving 1/3 left.
* The third one has 1/2 gone, so 1/2 is left.

If each glue stick starts at 12 millimeters, we gotta figure out how much is missing from each one:

* The first one is missing 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm
* The second one is missing 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm
* The third one is missing 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm

Now, let's add up how much is missing from all of them: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm


20 

"
"Okay, so Gabriel needs $10,000 for a car and $800 for a phone. That's a total of $10,800. He already has $5000 from his job and $200 from his brother, so that's $5200.  

If we subtract what he has from what he needs, it's $10,800 - $5200 = $5600.

He still needs $5600. 



"
"Okay, so Thea gave the guy $80 because four $20 bills is $80.  The hat only cost $70, so she got $10 back.


$10
"
"Okay, so Craig starts with $40 because two twenty dollar bills are forty bucks.  The squirt guns cost $12, and the water balloons cost $9.  If you add those together, he spent $21.  So, he has $19 left.


$19 

"
"Okay, so Jack has 60 dishes.  That means he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks because he has twice as many dishes as socks.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Altogether they have 60 + 30 = 90 socks and 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.

That means they have 90 + 90 = 180 socks and dishes in total! 


180
"
"Okay, so there are 20 kids in the class. 5 are only good at math, and 8 are only good at English. That means the rest must be good at both!  

20 - 5 - 8 = 7 kids are good at both.

So, 5 who are only good at math plus the 7 who are good at both means 12 kids are good at math.


12 

"
"Okay, so the concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes.  They're taking out 10 minutes for intermission, so that leaves 110 minutes for the bands. Each band needs 10 minutes (2 to get on, 6 to play, and 2 to get off).  If we divide the total time by how long each band needs, we get 110 minutes / 10 minutes/band = 11 bands.


11 

"
"Okay, so Brenda starts with $300.  Each year she earns three-quarters of that, which is like 3/4 times $300, which is $225.

So after one year she has $300 + $225 = $525.

After two years, she earns another $225, so she has $525 + $225 = $750.

And after three years, she gets another $225, bringing her total to $750 + $225 = $975.


$975 

"
"Okay, so there are 40 white shirts and half of them have collars, so that's 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars.  That means 20 white shirts don't have collars.

Then there are 50 floral shirts, and 20 of them have buttons. So 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts don't have buttons.

Finally, we need to find the difference: 30 floral shirts without buttons - 20 white shirts without collars = 10


10 

"
"Okay, so the farmer has a lot of eggs!  He can fit 30 eggs on each tray, and he has 900 eggs total.  That means he has 900 / 30 = 30 trays of eggs.

If he sells each tray for $2.50, he'll make 30 * $2.50 = $75. 


$75
"
"Okay, so Mr. Smith starts with 55 goats on Farm X and 45 on Farm Y.  He sells 10 from Farm X, so that leaves him with 45 goats there. Then he sells twice that amount from Farm Y, which is 20 goats. So Farm Y has 45 - 20 = 25 goats left.

To find the total, we add up the goats on both farms: 45 + 25 = 70 goats.

"Okay, so James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month, and that's 2 times 12 months, which is 24 pairs a year.  He spends $2640 on all those shoes.  To find out how much each pair costs, we gotta divide the total money by the number of pairs: $2640 divided by 24 pairs equals $110 per pair.


$110 

"
"Okay, so you buy three baskets of green food, and each one costs $25, so that's 3 times 25, which is $75.  Then you get three baskets of red food, and each one is $18, but you get $2 off each one. So the red food costs 3 times 18, which is $54, then take off $6 because of the discount. That means the red food is $48.  

Finally, you add the cost of the green food and the red food: $75 + $48 = $123.


$123 

"
"Okay, so they have 90 rooms and wanna clean half, which is 45 rooms.  Each room takes 20 minutes.  So that's 45 times 20... which is 900 minutes.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 900 minutes is 15 hours.


15 

"
"Okay, so they build 12 houses the first year. Then they build three times that many the next year, which is 12 times 3, or 36 houses.  So after two years, they built 12 plus 36, which is 48 houses.

The third year they double the number they already built, so that's 48 times 2, which is 96 houses.

In total, they built 48 plus 96 houses, which is 144 houses! 


144 

"
"Okay, so this is kinda like a puzzle!

Let's see... if I'm 2 years older than my sister, and 3 years younger than my brother, that means my brother is 5 years older than my sister.

My mom's age is tricky, it's like three times my brother's age minus one year.  

All together, our ages add up to 87. Hmm... this is tough! I'd need to try some guessing and checking to figure out everyone's exact age. 



"
"Okay, so Mr. Jackson has 27 kids and each kid needs 2 glue sticks. That's 27 times 2, which is 54 glue sticks.  The glue sticks come in packs of 8, so he needs to figure out how many packs make 54.  

Hmm, 8 times 6 is 48, and 8 times 7 is 56. So he needs to buy 7 packs to have enough for everyone. 


7 

"
"Okay, so the river starts with 4000 gallons. Then it rains a lot and doubles, so that's 4000 times 2 which is 8000 gallons.  The next day it goes up by 6000 more gallons, so 8000 plus 6000 is 14000 gallons.

14000 

"
"Okay, so 10 people get sick, and each one makes 6 more people sick every day.  

So after one day, it's 10 times 6, which is 60 more people. That's 70 people sick.

Then the next day, those 70 people each make 6 more sick, so that's 70 times 6, which is 420. Now there are 490 sick people.

On the third day, 490 times 6 is 2940.  So that's 3430 people sick in total! 

3430 

"
"Okay, so Rafaela got $20 from each of the 40 people, so she made 20 times 40 which is $800.  Julieta got 10% less than Rafaela, so we gotta figure out what 10% of $800 is. That's $80.  So Julieta made $800 - $80 which is $720.

To find out how much they made together, we add Rafaela's tips and Julieta's tips: $800 + $720 = $1520.


$1520 

"
"Okay, so Jennifer started with 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges each to her 3 daughters, so that's 3 daughters * 2 oranges/daughter = 6 oranges. Then she gave her son 3 oranges.  In total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.  That means she has 12 - 9 = 3 oranges left.


3 

"
"Okay, so Claire gets one badge each month. Amber takes twice as long, so she gets one badge every two months. That means in a whole year, she gets 12 months / 2 months per badge = 6 badges.

Wendy is super fast! She gets three times as many badges as Claire, so she gets 1 badge/month * 3 = 3 badges each month. In a year, that's 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges.

So Wendy gets way more badges than Amber.  Wendy gets 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 more badges than Amber.


30 

"
"Okay, so Paige bakes for 5 hours, and she makes 2 loaves each hour. That's 5 times 2, which is 10 loaves.  Each loaf has 8 slices, so she has 10 times 8, or 80 slices. If each slice sells for 50 cents, she makes 80 times $0.50, which is $40.00. 


$40.00
"
"Okay, so Gretchen has 70 gold coins, and she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. That means she has 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.  

To find the total, we add the gold and silver coins: 70 + 40 = 110 coins.


110 

"
"Okay, so Mr. George had 600 burritos.  There were 50 kids, and each kid ate 10 burritos, so that's 50 x 10 = 500 burritos.  Mr. George ate 20, so that's 500 + 20 = 520 burritos gone.  

That means there were 600 - 520 = 80 burritos left over.


80 

"
"Okay, so they have 12 red cars and 2 less green cars than that, so 10 green cars. Then they have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, which is 30 blue cars.  That's 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars.  If they have 75 cars total, then they must have 75 - 52 = 23 yellow cars. 


23 

"
"Okay, so this is kinda like a puzzle!

Let's see... Fawn has some books, Anne has a few less, and Sofie has even more than Anne.  

If we add up all their books, it's 85.  Hmm...

I think the best way to figure this out is to think about how many books Anne has. If Fawn has 'F' books, Anne has 'F - 12' books. And Sofie has 'F + 13' books.

So, F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) has to equal 85.

That means 3F + 1 = 85.

If we take away 1 from both sides, we get 3F = 84.

And then, if we divide both sides by 3, we find out that F = 28!

So Fawn has 28 books. 



"
"Okay, so Daisy's potatoes weigh 5 pounds. Her sweet potatoes weigh twice that, so they're 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.  Her carrots weigh 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes, so they weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.


7 

"
"Okay, so Greg needs enough jello for 30 kids to have 4 cups each. That's 30 times 4, which is 120 jello cups.

Each box makes 10 cups, so he needs 120 divided by 10, which is 12 boxes.

If each box costs $1.25, then 12 boxes will cost 12 times $1.25, which is $15.00. 


$15.00
"
"Okay, so the phones cost $700 each, and he bought 5, so that's 700 times 5 which is 3500 bucks.  He paid with 4000, so the change is 4000 minus 3500.  That's 500 dollars! 



"
"Okay, so Madeline and Keenan spend $400 on food each month. Madeline pays for most of it, like 60%.  That means Keenan pays the other 40%.  

To find out how much Keenan pays each week, we gotta figure out what 40% of $400 is.  That's $160.

Then, since there are four weeks in a month, we divide $160 by 4. That's $40 per week.


$40 

"
"Okay, so Tobias ate a lot of pizza! Let's see...

* On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, which is like 24 pieces (I did that in my head!).
* Then he ate 10 more pieces on the second day.
* On the third day, he ate some of what was left. There were 26 pieces left (60 - 24 - 10 = 26).  He ate 7 out of every 13 of those, so that's 14 pieces (I had to do a little dividing for that one).

So, in total, he ate 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces! 


48
"
"Okay, so David wants to buy some soda and water.  

Soda costs $3 a bottle, and he wants 3 bottles, so that's 3 times 3 which is $9.

Water costs $2 a bottle, and he wants 2 bottles, so that's 2 times 2 which is $4.

In total, it will cost $9 + $4 = $13.00 


$13.00
"
"Okay, so David starts with $12.48.  Each bolt costs 3 cents, and he's buying 16 of them.  

First, I need to figure out how much all the bolts cost.  That's 16 times $0.03, which is $0.48.

Then I subtract that from what David started with: $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left. 



"
"Okay, so Ella makes $33 for every 3 hours of walking dogs.  To figure out how much she'd make in 12 hours, we gotta see how much she makes per hour.  

If she makes $33 for 3 hours, that means she makes $11 each hour ($33 divided by 3).

So, if she walks dogs for 12 hours, she'd make $132 ($11 per hour times 12 hours).


$132 

"
"Okay, so Paul starts with 52 marbles and gets 28 more, so that's 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.  But then he loses a quarter of them. A quarter of 80 is 80 / 4 = 20 marbles.  If he loses 20, he has 80 - 20 = 60 marbles left.


60 

"
"Okay, so Amy's test has different types of questions worth different points. Let's see...

* She gets 8 out of 10 multiple-choice right, and each is worth 1 point, so that's 8 points.
* For true/false, she gets 18 out of 20 right, which is also 18 points.
* On the long answer, she gets 3 out of 5 right, and those are worth 5 points each, so that's 15 points.

If you add those up, 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points! 


41
"
"Okay, so Isaias wants to make $2000 extra. He's selling each chicken for $50, and he's got 300 chickens but only selling 3/5 of them.  

First, let's see how many chickens he's selling: 300 chickens * (3/5) = 180 chickens.

Then, we figure out how much money he'll make from selling them: 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.

Since he wants to make $2000 profit, that means he bought the chickens for $9000 - $2000 = $7000.


$7000 

"
"Okay, so Julie sold 14 glasses. Micah and Mitchell sold the rest, which is 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.  Since they sold the same amount, Micah sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses.  That means Julie sold 14 - 9 = 5 more glasses than Micah.


5 

"
"Okay, so Iris spent $400 on her hair.  Her manicure cost 1/4 of that, so it was $400 / 4 = $100. Her pedicure cost 3/4 of the manicure price, which is $100 * (3/4) = $75.

To find out how much she spent in total, we add up all the costs: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.


$575 

"
"Okay, so Sarah makes $2 for every meter of rope she sells, and she has 20 meters. That means she'll make 20 times 2, which is $40.  

The new rope costs $1.50 per meter, and she needs 20 meters, so that's 20 times 1.50, which is $30.

If she earns $40 and the new rope costs $30, she'll have $40 - $30 = $10 left over.


$10 

"
"Okay, so Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, so she's 8 years old now.  If we want to know when she'll be three times her current age, that's 8 times 3, which is 24.  So, we need to figure out how many years it takes to go from 8 to 24. That's 16 years! 


16
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

The bacon costs $10 for 5 packs, so each pack is $10 / 5 = $2.

The chicken costs twice as much as the bacon, so each chicken pack is $2 * 2 = $4.  Six packs of chicken cost $4 * 6 = $24.

Strawberries are $4 each, and she has 3 packs, so those cost $4 * 3 = $12.

Apples are half the price of strawberries, so they're $4 / 2 = $2 each. Seven packs of apples cost $2 * 7 = $14.

Adding it all up: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

If Kelly had $65, she has $65 - $60 = $5 left. 


$5
"
"Okay, so Elaina's final concert is like, double the length of her normal ones, plus she plays an extra 15 minutes at the end.  If the whole thing is 65 minutes long, we gotta figure out how long her normal concerts are.

If we take away the 15 minutes from the encore, that leaves us with 50 minutes.  Since that 50 minutes is double the length of a normal concert, we just gotta divide it in half.

So, her normal concerts are 25 minutes long! 



"
"Okay, so Argo starts with 200 toys. He gives away a bunch to his friends: 40 to Alyssa, 80 to Bonnie, and 30 to Nicky.  To find out how many he has left, you gotta add up the toys he gave away and then subtract that from the starting amount.

So, 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys given away.

Then, 200 - 150 = 50 toys left.

Argo has 50 toys left. 



"
"Okay, so they make 125 on Tuesday and 125 on Wednesday, that's 125 + 125 = 250.  Then on Friday they make double Tuesday's amount, so that's 125 x 2 = 250.  

Now we add all three days: 250 + 250 = 500 chimichangas! 



"
"Okay, so the singer has 50 microphones, but 20% of them can't fit. That means 10 microphones don't have a spot (50 x 0.20 = 10).  

That leaves 40 microphones that can be used (50 - 10 = 40). Since microphones are paired up, he can make 20 pairs (40 / 2 = 20).


20 

"
"Okay, so Jerry sees 6 birds in the bushes. Then he sees 2/3 of that number flying, which is like 6 divided by 3, which is 2, and then times 2, so that's 4 birds.  He also sees 3 groups of 8 birds eating, so that's 3 times 8, which is 24 birds.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 birds. 


34 

"
"Okay, so Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5. That means she had 50 cookies left.  Then she split those cookies evenly into 5 jars.  So, each jar would have 10 cookies. 


10
"
"Okay, so Joelle has 5 orchids with 5 petals each, that's 5 times 5 which is 25 petals.  Then she has 4 daisies with 10 petals each, so that's 4 times 10 which is 40 petals.  To find the difference, we do 40 minus 25, which equals 15.

15 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Smith has 100 plants. A quarter of them are inside, so that's 25 plants.  That leaves 75 plants. Two-thirds of those are outside, which is 50 plants.  So the rest, 25 plants, must be flowering plants. That means 25 out of 100 plants are flowering, which is 25%!


25% 

"
"Okay, so the whatchamacallit is super fast at 121 meters per second.  It goes 11 times faster than the thingamabob, so the thingamabob is going 121 divided by 11, which is 11 meters per second.  The whirligig is 5 times faster than the thingamabob, so it's going 11 times 5, which is 55 meters per second.


55 

"
"Okay, so Ellen eats two carrots, a salad for $6, and yogurt. The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.

That means the salad and yogurt together cost $6 + $3 = $9.

If her whole lunch costs $11, then the carrots cost $11 - $9 = $2.

Since she buys two carrots, each carrot costs $2 / 2 = $1. 


$1
"
"Okay, so Mark works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, that's 40 hours total.  His pay went up to $12 an hour.  So to find out how much he makes in a week, you do 40 hours times $12 an hour. That's $480!


$480 

"
"This problem is kinda tricky!  We know Tasha made $80 total, but we don't know how much she made from mowing.  

She mowed Joe's lawn some number of times, Kamala's lawn three times that amount, and Alba's lawn five times that amount.  Since we don't know how many times she mowed Joe's lawn, we can't figure out exactly how much she made from mowing.  

So, we can't know for sure how much she made from lemonade. 



"
"Okay, so Martin weighs 55 kg. Carl is 16 kg heavier, so he weighs 55 + 16 = 71 kg.  Christian is 8 kg heavier than Carl, so he weighs 71 + 8 = 79 kg.  Harry is 5 kg lighter than Christian, so he weighs 79 - 5 = 74 kg.


74 

"
"Okay, so John rents his car a lot! He makes $25 each hour, and he rents it for 3 hours, 10 times a month.  That's 10 times 3, which is 30 hours of renting.  So he makes 30 times $25, which is $750. But he has to pay $500 for the car, so he makes $750 - $500 = $250 profit.


$250 

"
"Okay, so Martha has 7 notebooks now, and she got 5 more, so she had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks before. Joseph had 3 times that amount, so he had 2 * 3 = 6 notebooks. That means Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.


1 

"
"Okay, so Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 more than that, which is like 50 divided by 5, which is 10. So Anis rowed 10 more miles than Dijana, meaning he rowed 60 miles.  

To find the total, we add Dijana's miles and Anis's miles: 50 + 60 = 110 miles.


110 

"
"Okay, so Susan had 100 cookies, but her husband ate 4. That leaves 96 cookies.  She has 6 nephews, so if she splits them evenly, each nephew gets 16 cookies. 


16
"
"Okay, so Denise read 10 pages yesterday and then 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. That's a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages for Denise.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and zero today, so he read 13 pages total.

Denise read 28 - 13 = 15 more pages than Daniel.


15
"
"Okay, so Calvin has enough soup for 4 big bowls or 8 little bowls.  He and his wife are big bowls, and his kids are little bowls. That's 2 big bowls and 2 little bowls eaten.

That means there are 4 bowls left over, right? And since there are 2 kids, they each get 2 bowls! 


2
"
"Okay, so William bought 5 notebooks and each notebook costs $1.50. That means the notebooks cost 5 times $1.50, which is $7.50.  The pen costs $0.50.  So, in total, he spent $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00


$8.00
"
"Okay, so Jo needs to make a bunch of masks.  She uses 2 yards of material for 4 small masks, so that's 0.5 yards per small mask.  For 20 small masks, she'd need 20 times 0.5 yards, which is 10 yards.

For the big masks, she uses 2.25 yards for 3 masks, so each big mask takes 0.75 yards. For 8 big masks, she'd need 8 times 0.75 yards, which is 6 yards.

In total, she needs 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards of material. 


16
"
"Okay, so Deepa saw 9 movies three times each, that's like 9 times 3 which is 27 times in total!  She spent $216, so to find out how much each ticket cost, we gotta do $216 divided by 27. That's $8! 


$8
"
"Okay, so Harold sleeps a lot, 10 hours!  He works less than that, 8 hours. And he walks his dog for an hour.  That's 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours already gone.  There are 24 hours in a day, so he has 24 - 19 = 5 hours left.


5 

"
"Okay, so Tim starts with 7 blue boxes and 9 red boxes. He uses 3 blue ones for fishing, so he has 7 - 3 = 4 blue boxes left.  He uses a third of his red boxes, which is 9 / 3 = 3 red boxes. That means he has 9 - 3 = 6 red boxes left.  

So, he has 4 + 6 = 10 boxes left in total. 


10 

"
"Okay, so Joseph had twice as many books as Sarah, who has 9. That means Joseph had 9 x 2 = 18 books. But then he lost 2, so he has 18 - 2 = 16 books left. 


16
"
"Okay, so Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives 6 to Jamie (because 30 divided by 5 is 6) and then 10 to Donald.  That's a total of 16 marbles gone.  If he started with 30 and gave away 16, he has 14 left.


14 

"
"Okay, so Duncan is 60 now, but eight years ago he was 52.  That means Adam was half Duncan's age back then, so Adam was 26 four years ago.  If Adam was 26 four years ago, he's 30 now. In eight more years, he'll be 38! 


38
"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 200 acres. Farmer Smith has twice that amount plus 100 more, so that's 200 x 2 = 400 acres, and then add 100 more, making it 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

To find the total, we add both farms together: 200 + 500 = 700 acres.


700 

"
"Okay, so Colby makes 20 cents for each package. He does 10 less than 50 an hour, so that's 40 packages.  That means he makes 40 times 20 cents, which is $8.00 every hour. If he works 8 hours, he makes $8.00 times 8, which is $64.00.


$64.00 

"
"Okay, so he drinks a bottle every 30 minutes. A normal Sudoku takes him 45 minutes, but a hard one takes four times longer, so that's 45 times 4 which is 180 minutes.  That's like 3 hours. If he drinks one bottle every 30 minutes, he'd drink 2 bottles an hour. So in 3 hours, he'd drink 3 times 2, which is 6 bottles.


6 

"
"Okay, so Benny used 2 pieces of bologna for each red balloon and he had 20 red balloons. That's 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna right there.

He used 58 pieces total, so he used 58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna on the yellow balloons.

Since each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna, there were 18 / 3 = 6 yellow balloons.


6 

"
"Okay, so Jon drives 100 miles every day, and there are 30 days in a month. That means he drives 100 times 30, which is 3000 miles in a month.

He needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, so he'll need 3000 divided by 1000, which is 3 tune-ups. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday. Then on Wednesday, he works twice that, so that's 5 times 2 which is 10 hours. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, so that's 10 minus 2, which is 8 hours.  

To find the total, we add up all the hours: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.


23 

"
"Okay, so Julia and Nadine pooled their money together. They spent $11 on a cake, $3 on balloons (since a dozen is 12 balloons and they cost 50 cents each for two), and $14 on ice cream (2 tubs at $7 each).  That means they spent a total of $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they split the cost, their mom gave each of them $28 / 2 = $14. 


$14
"
"Okay, so Kira has 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit.

Lola eats 2, so there are 14 - 2 = 12 pieces left.


12 

"
"Okay, so there are 6 kids playing tennis and double that playing volleyball, so that's 6 times 2 which is 12 kids.  Then there's 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so that's 16 plus 22 which is 38 kids.  

Now we add up all the kids: 12 plus 16 plus 22 equals 56 kids.


56 

"
"Okay, so they sold 300 lollipops because 30 students sold 10 each.  If they sold them for 80 cents each, they made 300 x $0.80 = $240. But they spent 300 x $0.50 = $150 to buy them. So they made a profit of $240 - $150 = $90.


$90 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Larry has 3 cats, and he has 3 times that many dogs, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has three times as many fish as rabbits, meaning he has 7 * 3 = 21 fish.

His gerbils are 1/3 the number of fish, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total, we add up all his pets: 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets.


47 

"
"Okay, so Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats double that, which is 4 slices.  Together they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices every day.  

The loaf has 24 slices, so it will last them 24 / 6 = 4 days. 

4 

"
"Okay, so Martha starts collecting shells when she's 5 and she gets one new shell each month.  By the time she turns 10, she'll have been collecting for 5 years. That's 5 years times 12 months a year, which is 60 months. Since she gets one shell a month, she'll have 60 shells! 


60 

"
"Okay, so Lana has 27 cups and puts them in 3 rows, so that's 9 cups in each row.  Since she wants the same amount of chamomile and mint in each row, she'd have 9 cups / 2 types of tea = 4.5 cups of each.

"Okay, so the sloth takes 4 hours for each trip up and down the tree.  If he has 8 hours, he can do 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

He needs 24 berries total, so he needs to get 24 / 2 = 12 berries each time he goes down.


12 

"
"Okay, so the pool has 10,000 gallons, and they use half of that to fill the tank. That means the tank has 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons.

They use 500 gallons each day, so after 6 days they've used 500 * 6 = 3,000 gallons.

That means there's 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 gallons left in the tank.


2000 

"
"Okay, so Colby has $150 for movies this month. Let's see how much he's already spent.

* Fridays and Saturdays are $10 a ticket, and he saw 5 of those, so that's 5 * $10 = $50.
* Other days are $7 a ticket, and he saw 8 of those, so that's 8 * $7 = $56.
* Popcorn is $8 a tub, and he got 2 tubs, so that's 2 * $8 = $16.
* Candy is $2 a box, and he got 4 boxes, so that's 4 * $2 = $8.

Adding all that up, he spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

That means he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

A Friday movie costs $10, popcorn is $8, and candy is $2, for a total of $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

So, he can see **1** more movie tonight! 



"
"Okay, so Andrew made a bunch of mini pastries.  Let's see...

A regular cinnamon roll has 600 calories, but a mini one is only 1/3 of that, so it has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

He made 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so that's 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories!

A regular blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini one has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

He made 300 mini blueberry muffins, so that's 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

To find the total calories, we add them up: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.


85000 

"
"Okay, so Rita takes out a bunch of Junebugs every day. Let's see...

* Monday: 39 Junebugs
* Tuesday: 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs
* Wednesday: 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs
* Thursday: 48 Junebugs
* Friday: 57 Junebugs

To find the average, we add them all up: 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Then we divide by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60 Junebugs


60 

"
"Okay, so the bus goes super fast at 60 miles every hour for 5 hours. That means it went 60 * 5 = 300 miles!

The car is slower, going 30 miles each hour for 8 hours. So it went 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To see how much farther the bus went, we subtract: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.


60 

"
"Okay, so Sophie has a bunch of toys: 31 blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 rings. That's 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 toys.

She has 62 toys total, so she must have 62 - 48 = 14 bouncy balls. 


14
"
"Okay, so Peter, Paul, and Jean are 100 years old all together. Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is Paul's age plus John's age.  

Hmm, let's see... If we know Paul is older than John, and Peter is the oldest because he's their ages combined, Peter must be 50! 



"
"Okay, so Maria gave her 4 friends 2 balloons each, that's 4 times 2 which is 8 balloons.  She had 1 for herself, so that's 9 total at first. Then her mom gave everyone 3 more, so that's 5 people times 3 balloons, which is 15 more balloons.  

So, 9 plus 15 is 24 balloons in total! 


24
"
"Okay, so they have 10 people giving 5 boxes each, that's 10 times 5 which is 50 boxes.  Then they add the 10 they already have, so that's 60 boxes total.  Each table holds 2 boxes, so they need 60 divided by 2, which is 30 tables.  They already have 15, so they need 30 minus 15, which is 15 more tables.


15 

"
"Okay, so Zoey spits 40 seeds and each one goes 10 feet, so that's 40 times 10 which equals 400 feet. Sydney spits 35 seeds times 12 feet each, so that's 35 times 12 which is 420 feet.  To find the average, we add those together, 400 plus 420 is 820. Then we divide that by 2 because there are two of them, and 820 divided by 2 is 410.


410 

"
"Okay, so Fern wants to make the most money, right?

The Widgeteer makes 60 widgets every hour, and the WidgetMaster makes 45.  If it runs all day, that's 24 hours, so the Widgeteer makes 60 x 24 = 1440 widgets a day! The WidgetMaster makes 45 x 24 = 1080 widgets a day.

In a month, that's 30 days, so the Widgeteer makes 1440 x 30 = 43200 widgets. The WidgetMaster makes 1080 x 30 = 32400 widgets.

Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer makes 43200 x $6 = $259200 in a month. The WidgetMaster makes 32400 x $6 = $194400 in a month.

That means Fern makes $259200 - $194400 = $64800 more with the Widgeteer! 



"
"Okay, so Cameron stays for 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours, and then 70 pesos for each extra hour.  

So, he needs to pay for 5 extra hours (17 - 12 = 5). That's 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.

In total, he pays 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

A 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos, so he saves 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.


250 

"
"Okay, so each goat eats 5 pounds of hay.  The sheep eat 2 times the amount of hay a goat eats, which is 10 pounds, and then 3 pounds less, so they eat 7 pounds.

There are 15 goats, so that's 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay.

There are 12 sheep, so that's 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay.

In total, Nate needs 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay. 

159 

"
"Okay, so John makes $50 each hour and worked for 6 hours, so he made 50 * 6 = $300.

Then he spends $50 on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = $250 left.

He buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each, so those cost 5 * 10 = $50.

Now he has 250 - 50 = $200 left.

He wants to put $100 in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = $100 left for pens.

Each pen costs $25, so he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, that's 20 times 15 which is 300 letters. His brother spelled words with 50 more letters than Craig, so that's 300 plus 50, which is 350 letters.  To find the total, we add Craig's letters and his brother's letters: 300 plus 350 equals 650.


650 

"
"Okay, so there are 8 kids in each row, and 7 rows for each school.  That means each school has 8 times 7, which is 56 kids. Since there are 5 schools, we do 56 times 5, which equals 280 kids.


280 

"
"Okay, so the teacher has 9 coupons and each one gets her 100 bottles of juice, so that's 9 times 100 which is 900 bottles.  Then she gives each of the 29 kids 2 bottles, so that's 29 times 2 which is 58 bottles.  If she starts with 900 and gives away 58, she has 900 minus 58 left.  That's 842 bottles!


842 

"
"Okay, so Patty charges $40 just to come over. Then she charges $35 for every hour she works, even if she doesn't work a full hour.  She worked for 2 and a quarter hours, so that's 2.25 hours times $35, which is $78.75.  Plus, the parts cost $60.  So, in total, it's $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75. 


$178.75
"
"Okay, so James got 10 CDs for $15 each, so that's 10 times 15 which is $150.  But they were 40% off, so we gotta figure out what 40% of $150 is.  That's like 150 divided by 100 times 40, which is $60 off. So he paid $150 minus $60, which is $90.

Then he sold 5 of them for $40 each, so that's 5 times 40, which is $200.

Finally, we subtract the $90 he spent from the $200 he made, which is $200 minus $90, so he ended up with $110.


$110 

"
"Okay, so Jen has 6 yams and each one sells for $1.50, so that's 6 times 1.50 which is $9.00.  Then she has 10 sweet potatoes at $2.00 each, so that's 10 times 2, which is $20.00. And lastly, she has 4 carrots at $1.25 each, so that's 4 times 1.25, which is $5.00.

If we add all that up, $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

So Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything. 


$34.00
"
"Okay, so James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 12 miles.  

He swims that at 2 miles per hour, so that takes him 12 miles / 2 mph = 6 hours.

Then he rests for half that time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

He has 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles left to go.

But now he's swimming slower, only 1 mile per hour, so that takes him 8 miles / 1 mph = 8 hours.

Adding it all up, it took him 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours to cross the lake. 


17
"
"Okay, so Sam had 70 loaves. Seven times that amount is 7 times 70, which is 490.  But the bakery has 40 *less* than that, so we gotta subtract 40 from 490.  That means the bakery has 450 loaves. 


450
"
"Okay, so Jasmine started with 15 stickers. Then she lost some, so we gotta take those away: 15 - 7 = 8.  But then her teacher gave her more, so we add those back in: 8 + 5 = 13.

She has 13 stickers left. 

"
"Okay, so Cayley gets 10 cents for every New York Times he sells and 8 cents for every Wall Street Journal.

He sells 6 New York Times, so that's 6 times 10 cents, which is 60 cents.

He sells 10 Wall Street Journals, so that's 10 times 8 cents, which is 80 cents.

If you add those together, 60 cents plus 80 cents is $1.40.


$1.40 

"
"Okay, so Deanna is 26. Marcus is 5 years younger than her, so he's 21.  Marcus is half Leo's age, so Leo must be twice as old as Marcus. That means Leo is 21 times 2, which is 42.


42 

"
"Okay, so Bahati scored the most points, and we know the team scored 45 points total.  Let's see... Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, and 10 more than Dinar.  Hmm, that means Azibo scored less than Bahati.  

If we think of it like this:

* Bahati:  Azibo's score + 20
* Dinar: Azibo's score + 10

So, all together it's like: Azibo's score + (Azibo's score + 20) + (Azibo's score + 10) = 45

That's 3 times Azibo's score plus 30 equals 45.  

Let me subtract 30 from both sides: 3 times Azibo's score = 15

Then divide both sides by 3: Azibo's score = 5



 Azibo scored 5 points. 

"
"Okay, so the book is 1.5 inches thick and each inch has 100 pages.  That means there are 1.5 x 100 = 150 pages in the book. 


150 

"
"Okay, so Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.  He works a long time, from 8 in the morning until 11 at night. That's like, 15 hours!

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he works for 15 times 60, which is 900 minutes.

If he staples for 15 minutes at a time, he does that 900 divided by 15, which is 60 times.

So, he staples 30 reports each time, and he does that 60 times, so he staples 30 times 60, which is 1800 reports! 


1800 

"
"Okay, so Kim usually sleeps for 8 hours, right? That's 480 minutes.  She sleepwalked for a bit, like 23 minutes, so we take that away: 480 - 23 = 457.  But she also woke up early, 5 minutes early, so we take that away too: 457 - 5 = 452.

So she slept for 452 minutes that day. 



"
"Okay, so Jonathan has two dozen cups, which is 24 cups. He has 2/3 that many spoons, so he has 16 spoons (24 / 3 * 2 = 16).  Then he gives 6 spoons away, leaving him with 10 spoons.  

So, he has 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils left.


34 

"
"Okay, so the hospital starts with 1000 beds and only 1/5 are full, which is 200 beds. That means 800 beds are empty.

Then, they get 50 new patients every day for two weeks. That's like 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 new patients!

So now there are 200 + 700 = 900 patients in the hospital.

That leaves 1000 - 900 = 100 empty beds.


100 

"
"Okay, so Robyn sends 16 emails a day.  Seven are for work, so that leaves 9 emails for family and her boyfriend.  Two-thirds of those 9 emails go to family, which is 6 emails. That means 3 emails are left for her boyfriend. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Aliya is 3. Shawna is three times older than Aliya, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old. Shawna's dad is five times older than Shawna, so he's 5 * 9 = 45 years old. 

45 

"
"Okay, so Courtney said there were 48 people, but she was off by 20%.  That means she counted too many. To find out the real number, we gotta figure out what 20% of 48 is.

20% is like 20 out of every 100, so we can do (20/100) * 48. That equals 9.6.  

So Courtney counted 9.6 too many people.  If we take that away from her number, we get 48 - 9.6 = 38.4.

Since you can't have part of a person, there were probably about 38 people at the concert. 


38 

"
"Okay, so Jason carried 2 balls.  Jeffrey carried half as many as Jason, so he carried 1 ball. Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so he carried 4 balls.  That means they carried a total of 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls.


7 

"
"Okay, so they dug a bunch of holes, right?  

* Day one: 10 holes
* Day two: 13 holes
* Day three: 8 holes, but they filled in 2, so that's 6 new holes.

That's 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes total.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of day four as it did at the end of day one. So, there were 29 holes / 4 = about 7 holes at the end of day one.

That means they dug 29 - 7 = 22 holes on day four! 


22 

"
"Okay, so Amora and Lainey each got 70 chips, and Collins got 15 more than them, so he got 70 + 15 = 85 chips.  To find the total, we add up what everyone got: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 chips.


225 

"
"Okay, so Jen's supplies cost $400.  His tickets cost 50% more than that, which is like half of the supply cost. Half of $400 is $200. So his tickets cost $400 + $200 = $600.


$600 

"
"Okay, so this Pokemon problem is kinda tricky! Let's see...

Adelwolfe caught some Pokemon, let's say it's ""A"". Stan caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe caught, so that's like 4 times A minus 13. Alex caught 5 more than Stan, so that's Stan's number plus 5.

All together they caught 339 Pokemon, so if we add up what each person caught, it should equal 339.

Hmm, let me try to figure out what Adelwolfe caught first...  

If Stan caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe caught, and Alex caught 5 more than Stan, then Stan must have caught a good amount of Pokemon!

Let me think...  I'm gonna try some numbers...

Aha! If Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon, then Stan caught 160 (4 times 40 minus 13) and Alex caught 165 (160 plus 5).

And guess what? 40 + 160 + 165 = 365!  

Wait, that's too much! Let me try a smaller number for Adelwolfe...

Okay, if Adelwolfe caught 30 Pokemon, then Stan caught 117 (4 times 30 minus 13) and Alex caught 122 (117 plus 5).

And... 30 + 117 + 122 = 269. Still too low!

Let me try one more time...

If Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon, then Stan caught 147 (4 times 40 minus 13) and Alex caught 152 (147 plus 5).

And... 40 + 147 + 152 = 339! That's it!



Stan caught 147 Pokemon. 

"
"Okay, so each episode is 20 minutes long.  And there are only half as many episodes as minutes in each episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

That means he'll watch 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes of the show.


200 

"
"Okay, so the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so that's 10 times 30 which is 300 miles. Then it flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so that's 2 times 18 which is 36 miles.  Then it flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so that's 5 times 22 which is 110 miles.

So, it flew 300 miles south, then 36 miles north, then another 110 miles south.  To find the total distance between its homes, we do 300 minus 36 plus 110.  That equals 374 miles.


374 

"
"Okay, so Greta got a bunch of brownies! She made 12, then got 6 more from work. Her friends brought 48, so that's a lot of brownies!  They ate 18, so let's see... 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies total. Then 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.

48 

"
"Okay, so Nani is 8. His brother is twice that, so he's 8 times 2 which is 16. Nani's sister is younger than him by 25%, which is like a quarter of his age. A quarter of 8 is 2, so she's 8 minus 2, which is 6 years old.  

To find their total age, we add them all up: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30. 


30
"
"Okay, so Andy has a bunch of tennis racquets to restring. Let's see...

* He's got 3 with synthetic gut, and those take 15 minutes each, so that's 3 times 15, which is 45 minutes.
* Then there are 5 with polyester, and those take 22 minutes each, so that's 5 times 22, which is 110 minutes.
* And lastly, 4 racquets are hybrid, taking 18 minutes each, so that's 4 times 18, which is 72 minutes.

Now, to find the total time, we add all those up: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.


227 

"
"Okay, so John buys two phones at full price, which is $600 each, so that's $600 x 2 = $1200.

Then the other two phones are half price, so they're $600 / 2 = $300 each.

That means those two cost $300 x 2 = $600.

Adding it all up, he spent $1200 + $600 = $1800 on phones.


$1800 

"
"Okay, so Carlton's team has 13 players, and Zeke's team has 7 more than that.  So Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

To find the total, we add the number of players on both teams: 20 + 13 = 33 players.


33 

"
"Okay, so Robert's fence is like a big rectangle. To find out how much wood he needs, we gotta figure out how long all the sides are together. That's called the perimeter.

The fence is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide.  So, 15 plus 10 is 25.  Then we multiply that by 2 because a rectangle has two long sides and two short sides.  That's 25 times 2, which is 50 feet of fence.

He needs 2 slats for every foot of fence, so we multiply 50 by 2. That means he needs 100 slats! 


100
"
"Okay, so Mrs. Harrington started with 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 to her mom and 2 to her sister, so that's 4 boxes gone. That leaves her with 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

She kept a quarter of those, which is 8 / 4 = 2 boxes.  

That means she sold 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.

Since each box has 20 oranges, she sold 6 * 20 = 120 oranges.


120 

"
"Okay, so the USA has 50 states.  India has 4 more than half that number.  Half of 50 is 25, and 25 plus 4 is 29. So India has 29 states.  

If you add those together, 50 + 29 = 79. There are a total of 79 states in both countries. 



"
"Okay, so Tyler needs to figure out how much all the books cost together. That's $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

He already has $14, so he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more.

If he makes $5 every hour, he needs to work $25 / $5 = 5 hours. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Robert has 30 cherries. Richard has 10 less than Robert, so Richard has 20 cherries. That means Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together.  

If they have 60 cherries total, then Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. 


20
"
"Okay, so Sunny sold stuff for a fundraiser. Let's see...

On Saturday, he sold 10 gingerbread. Apple pie was 4 less than that, so he sold 6 apple pies.

Gingerbread earned him 10 times $6, which is $60. Apple pies earned him 6 times $15, which is $90.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more gingerbread than Saturday, so that's 15 gingerbread.  That's 15 times $6, or $90. He sold 15 apple pies, which is 15 times $15, or $225.

Saturday's total was $60 + $90 = $150.

Sunday's total was $90 + $225 = $315.

So for both days, he made $150 + $315 = $465. 



"
"Okay, so Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. She's gonna be out for 4 hours a day, so that's 1 ounce/hour * 4 hours = 4 ounces a day.

She's on vacation for 8 days, so she'll need 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Each bottle has 8 ounces, so she'll need 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.


4 

"
"Okay, so the blue car costs $100. The red car is 40% cheaper, so it costs $60 (because 40% of $100 is $40, and $100 - $40 = $60).

If you add the price of both cars, it's $100 + $60 = $160.


$160 

"
"Okay, so Emil is 19 now.  In five years, he'll be 24.  When he's 24, his dad will be twice as old, so his dad will be 48.  And his brother will be half Emil's age then, so his brother will be 12.

But we want to know how old they are *now*.  Emil's dad is 48 now, but since Emil is 19, his dad is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.  And Emil's brother is 12 now, but since Emil is 19, his brother is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

So, 43 + 7 = 50.


50
"
"Okay, so Adrianne got 20 beads from her mom. Her sister gave her 10 more than that, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her double what her mom gave her, which is 20 x 2 = 40 beads.  To find the total, we add them all up: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.


90 

"
"Okay, so Joe caught 3 pounds on Thursday. Then on Friday, he caught 4 times that, which is 3 times 4, or 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half of what he caught on Friday, so that's 12 divided by 2, which is 6 pounds.  

To find out how many servings he has, we add up all the pounds: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds. Since each serving is 3 pounds, he has 21 divided by 3, which is 7 servings.


7 

"
"Okay, so there are 30 kids in the class.  20% of them play football, so that's 30 times 0.20 which is 6 kids. That leaves 24 kids. Then 25% of those kids are cheerleaders or in band, so that's 24 times 0.25 which is 6 kids.  So 6 football players plus 6 cheerleaders/band kids means 12 kids are leaving early.


12 

"
"Okay, so Charlie's boots are five times bigger than Sophie's size 5 boots. That means Charlie wears a size 25!  To find the average, you add their sizes together (5 + 25 = 30) and then divide by 2 because there are two people (30 / 2 = 15).

So the average shoe size is 15. 

"
"Okay, so Pat's flower bed is super long, 111 feet!  Each flower needs a foot and a half of space around it, so that's like 18 inches.  And the flowers themselves are 12 inches wide.  So each flower takes up 30 inches total (12 + 18).

Her flower bed is 1332 inches long (111 feet times 12 inches in a foot).  If each flower needs 30 inches, she can fit 44 flowers in there (1332 divided by 30).

But she already has 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 27 more (44 minus 17).

Each flower costs $6, so she'll spend $162 in total (27 times 6). 



"
"Okay, so Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, who eats 18. That means his brother eats 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.  

In a week, he'd eat 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels.


63 

"
"Okay, so Katherine needs 3 petunias for each basket and they cost $3 each, so that's 3 times 3 which is $9.  Then she needs 2 sweet potato vines that cost $2.50 each, so that's 2 times $2.50 which is $5.  

So each basket costs $9 + $5 = $14.  Since she has 5 baskets, she'll spend $14 times 5 which is $70.


$70.00 

"
"Okay, so they have 30 pounds of soil. Sunflowers take up a lot of soil, 3 pounds each, and they're planting 4, so that's 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.  Carnations use 1.5 pounds each, and they're doing 10 of those, so that's 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.  

That means they've used 12 + 15 = 27 pounds already.  They started with 30, so they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left for roses. Since each rose needs 1 pound, they can plant 3 roses. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Jessica makes $2000 a month. She saves a quarter of that for shoes, which is like cutting her money into four equal parts and taking one.  So she saves $500 each month for shoes.

In a year, that's $500 times 12 months, which is $6000.

Each pair of shoes costs $1000, so she can buy $6000 divided by $1000, which is 6 pairs of shoes. 


6
"
"Okay, so Emily peels shrimp pretty fast!  She can do 6 shrimp every minute.  That means to peel 90 shrimp, it would take her 90 divided by 6, which is 15 minutes.

Now, she cooks 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.  So to cook 90 shrimp, it would take her three times as long, which is 30 minutes.

To get the total time, we add the peeling time and the cooking time: 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.


45 

"
"Okay, so the AC cools the room down a bit each hour.  Let's see...

* On low, it cools 2 degrees each hour for 3 hours, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 degrees cooler.
* Then it's on high, cooling 3 degrees each hour for 4 hours, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 degrees cooler.
* That's a total of 6 + 12 = 18 degrees cooler.
* But then it's off for 2 hours, and the room warms up 2 degrees each hour, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 degrees warmer.
* So, overall, the room is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees cooler than it started.


14
"
"Okay, so Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30. Bill saw it again when he was three times his dad's age, which is 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

The comet comes around every 75 years, and Bill was 90 when he saw it the second time. That means one whole comet cycle happened, so Bill must have been 75 when he saw it the first time.


75 

"
"Okay, so Buford pays his electric and gas bills every month, so that's 1 check each for 12 months, which is 24 checks total. He gives money to the church twice a month, so that's 2 times 12, which is 24 checks. And he pays for pest control four times a year.  

Let's add it all up: 24 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks.


52 

"
"Okay, so the first plane goes to Greece a lot, like three out of every four times.  That means it goes to other places the other time.  The other plane only goes to Poland, and it flies way less, only 44 times a day. That's half the number of times the first plane flies, so the first plane flies 44 times 2, which is 88 times!

So, the first plane goes to Greece 66 times (88 times 3 divided by 4). That leaves 22 times for France and Germany. Since it's split evenly, the first plane goes to France 11 times a day.


11 

"
"Okay, so Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice that, so that's 20 times 2 which is 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two together, so that's 20 plus 40, which is 60 seconds.  

To find the total time, we add up all their howl times: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.  But the question asks for the answer in minutes, and there are 60 seconds in a minute. So 120 seconds is equal to 120 divided by 60, which is 2 minutes.


2 

"
"Okay, so Adam's mom gave him $6, and his dad gave him double that, which is $6 x 2 = $12.  That means his parents gave him a total of $6 + $12 = $18.

The trousers cost $30, and his parents paid $18, so Adam had to pay $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.


$12 

"
"Okay, so we know Helene is twice as old as the average age of all four kids.  And all the kids' ages add up to 20.  If we divide 20 by 4, we get 5, so the average age is 5. That means Helene is 5 times 2, which is 10 years old.

Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4, so together they are 3 + 4 = 7 years old.  If we add Helene's age, that's 7 + 10 = 17 years.

That means Wilfred must be 20 - 17 = 3 years old. 


3
"
"Okay, so Walter gets $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from online, that's $2000 total. His lawyer is gonna give three times that much, so that's $2000 times 3 which is $6000!  

6000 

"
"Okay, so there were 100 guests and they each brought 15 cookies, so that's 100 times 15 which is 1500 cookies!  The bride gave half of those to the church, so that's 1500 divided by 2, which is 750 cookies. If each person at the church got 15 cookies, then there were 750 divided by 15 people, which equals 50 people.


50 

"
"Okay, so there are 2 adults and 4 kids, right?  And the adults get twice as much watermelon as each kid.  

Think of it like this: if each kid got one slice, the adults would get two slices each. That means the adults get 2 slices + 2 slices = 4 slices total.

There are 4 kid slices + 4 adult slices = 8 slices of watermelon in all.

So each adult gets 4 slices out of 8, which is half. Half of 100% is 50%.


Answer: 50% 

"
"Okay, so Dr. Jones works for 9 hours.  He spends 20 minutes on each of his 9 patients, so that's 9 times 20 which is 180 minutes.  That's 3 hours right there! Then he has 10 appointments at 30 minutes each, so that's 10 times 30, which is 300 minutes. That's 5 more hours.  So he's already spent 3 plus 5, which is 8 hours. That leaves him with 1 hour for his records. 


1 

"
"Okay, so Jordan needs 20 minutes to mix the batter, 30 minutes to bake it, and then it has to cool for 2 whole hours! That's 120 minutes right there. Plus, she needs another 10 minutes to frost it.  

Let's add it all up: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

That's 3 hours total! So if she wants the cake ready by 5:00 pm, she needs to start at 2:00 pm. 


2:00 pm
"
"Okay, so Lisa and Peter sold a bunch of chocolate bars. Lisa sold 3 and a half boxes, and Peter sold 4 and a half. Together they sold 64 bars.  To figure out how many bars are in each box, we gotta see how many boxes they sold total, which is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Then we divide the total bars by the number of boxes: 64 bars / 8 boxes = 8 bars per box.


8 

"
"Okay, so they charge $25 just to use the studio, and then $1.50 for each student.  They have 10 students, so that's $1.50 x 10 = $15 extra per session.

That means each session costs $25 + $15 = $40.

They have classes 3 times a week, so they make $40 x 3 = $120 each week.

In a month, they'd make $120 x 4 = $480. 


$480
"
"Okay, so Peter has 64 chocolate bars split into 4 boxes, so each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, meaning each box has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.

That means Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.


8 

"
"Okay, so there are 50 porcupines, and 3/5 of them are girls. That means there are 30 girl porcupines (50 x 3/5 = 30).  Each girl porcupine has 4 babies every month, so that's 120 babies each month (30 x 4 = 120).  In a year, that's 1440 babies (120 x 12 = 1440).  

So, you add the babies to the starting number: 1440 + 50 = 1490 porcupines.


1490 

"
"Okay, so they need to figure out how much water the pool holds.  It's like a big box, right?  

You find the space inside a box by multiplying the length times the width times the height. So, it's 14 feet times 25 feet times 4 feet, which is 1400. That's how many ""cubic feet"" of water it takes.

But the pool company said to multiply that by 5.9 to get gallons. So, 1400 times 5.9 is 8260 gallons.

Finally, they charge 10 cents for each gallon.  So, 8260 times $0.10 is $826.00. 


$826.00
"
"Okay, so they have 9 red sticks.  There are 5 more blue sticks than red ones, so that's 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.  There are 3 less yellow sticks than blue sticks, so there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

To find the total, we add them all up: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks. 



"
"Okay, so Matteo drove 55 miles every hour for 4 hours, so he went 55 * 4 = 220 miles. Shandy drove 45 miles every hour for 10 hours, so she went 45 * 10 = 450 miles.  To find out how much farther Shandy drove, we subtract: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.


230 

"
"Okay, so half of the 3000 students are older than 16, which is 1500 students.  A quarter of those older students are boys, so that's 1500 divided by 4, which is 375 boys. That means 1125 of the older students are girls.

The other half of the students are younger than 16, so that's another 1500 students. Half of them are boys, so that's 750 boys. That means 750 of the younger students are girls.

To find the total number of girls, we add the older girls and the younger girls: 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls.


1875 

"
"Okay, so Bethany runs 10 laps. Trey runs 4 more than that, so he runs 14 laps. Shaelyn runs half as many as Trey, which is 7 laps. Quinn runs 2 less than Shaelyn, so she runs 5 laps.  That means Bethany runs 5 more laps than Quinn. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Wanda and Ms. B are trying to fill a big tank that holds 18,000 gallons of water.

On the first day, Wanda fills a quarter of the tank, which is 18,000 / 4 = 4,500 gallons. Ms. B pumps in 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she pumps 4,500 * (3/4) = 3,375 gallons.

That means on the first day they put in 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she did on the first day, which is 4,500 * (2/3) = 3,000 gallons. Ms. B only pumps 1/3 of what she did on the first day, so she pumps 3,375 * (1/3) = 1,125 gallons.

So on the second day, they pump in 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons.

In total, they pumped in 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 gallons.

To find out how much is left, we subtract that from the tank's size: 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons.



There are **6,000** gallons left to fill the tank. 

"
"Okay, so Maria's power bank was losing power while she was charging her friends' phones.  

First, it lost 9% every hour for 5 hours, so that's 9 * 5 = 45% gone.

Then it lost 7% every hour for 3 hours, so that's 7 * 3 = 21% more gone.

That means it lost a total of 45 + 21 = 66% of its charge.

If it had 28% left at the end, and that's after losing 66%, it means it must have started with 28 + 66 = 94% charge.

But wait, that doesn't make sense! Power banks can't be more than 100% charged.  

Hmm, maybe I messed up somewhere. Let me try again...

Okay, so it lost 66% of its charge, and it had 28% left. That means 28% is what was left *after* losing 66%.

So, if 28% is what's left after losing 66%, then before it lost any charge, it must have had 28 + 66 = 94% charge.

That still doesn't make sense!  

Ugh, this is hard! Maybe I need to ask my older brother for help.




"
"Okay, so Janet makes $10 an hour at her job plus $15 an hour in tips. That's $25 an hour total! If she works 40 hours a week, she makes $25 times 40, which is $1000 a week.

She needs 20% of $10,000 for a down payment, so that's $10,000 times 0.20, which is $2000.

To figure out how many weeks she needs to work, we divide the down payment by her weekly earnings: $2000 divided by $1000 is 2.


So she needs to work for **2** weeks. 

"
"Okay, so Jamaar has $10 and he's already bought some fruit. Let's see how much he spent:

* Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 = $1.50
* Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 = $2.00
* Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 = $2.00
* Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 = $3.75

That's a total of $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25 spent.

He has $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Plums cost $0.25 each, so he can buy $0.75 / $0.25 = 3 plums.


3 

"
"Okay, so Anne has 15 packs of candy with 60 pieces each, that's a lot of candy!  She keeps 2 packs for herself, so that leaves 13 packs to share.  If she splits those 13 packs evenly between her 10 friends, each friend gets 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs.  Since you can't have part of a pack, let's see how many pieces are in 1.3 packs: 1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.


78 

"
"Okay, so the carrots start at $120, and they go up by 5% each year.  

* After one year, they'd be $120 + (120 * 0.05) = $126.
* After two years, they'd be $126 + (126 * 0.05) = $132.30
* After three years, they'd be $132.30 + (132.30 * 0.05) = $138.92

Rounding that to the nearest dollar, the carrots would cost about $139 after three years. 



"
"Okay, so Olivia put 72 pictures into 8 albums, so each album has 72 / 8 = 9 pictures.  She has 3 albums of selfies, so that's 3 * 9 = 27 selfies.  She has 2 albums of portraits, so that's 2 * 9 = 18 portraits.  

That means she has a total of 27 + 18 = 45 selfies and portraits.


45 

"
"Okay, so James reads 3 pages every 10 minutes.  If he reads 18 pages, that's like reading 3 pages six times (18 / 3 = 6).  

So, he spends 6 times the amount of time reading, which is 6 * 10 minutes = 60 minutes.


60 

"
"Okay, so there were 100 people at the hotel at first. Then 24 left early, so there were 100 - 24 = 76 people left.

Then 15 people wanted to stay later, and twice that many, or 15 * 2 = 30 people, checked in later that day.

So now there are 76 + 30 = 106 people.

But wait! 7 more people came after dinner, so there are 106 + 7 = 113 people at the hotel now.


113 

"
"Okay, so John gets 4 bananas on Wednesday, then 6 more on Thursday.  That's 4 + 6 = 10 bananas.

On Friday, he picks three times the amount from Wednesday, so that's 4 * 3 = 12 bananas.

Adding them all up, he has 10 + 12 = 22 bananas.


22 

"
"Okay, so there are 60 questions total.  40% of them are easy, which is 24 questions.  That means the other 36 questions are split between average and hard, so there are 18 of each.

Aries gets 75% of the easy ones right, so that's 18 easy questions. She gets half of the average and hard ones right, so that's 9 of each.

In total, she gets 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right.


36 

"
"Okay, so Teresa sells the big stuffed animals for $12 each because they're three times the price of the small ones, which are $4.  She sold twice as many small ones as big ones, and made $120 total.  

Let's see... if we say she sold 6 big ones, that'd be 6 times $12, which is $72.  That means she made $120 - $72 = $48 from the small ones.

If each small one is $4, she sold $48 / $4 = 12 small ones.


12 

"
"Okay, so they eat 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches each day.  

In a week, that's 11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches! 


77 

"
"Okay, so Suzanne made $80 from the cookies because 80 times $1 is $80.  She made $240 from the cupcakes because 60 times $4 is $240.  That means she made a total of $320.  She gave her sisters $20 total.  If you subtract $20 from $320, she has $300 left.


$300 

"
"Okay, so the twins found 30 eggs each, which is 30 x 2 = 60 eggs.  They also found 10 more eggs, so that's 60 + 10 = 70 eggs total.  That means their friends found 100 - 70 = 30 eggs.


30 

"
"Okay, so one dwarf can dig up 12 pounds of ore a day with just his hands.  If he uses an iron pickaxe, he can dig up twice that much, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 pounds.

A steel pickaxe is even better! It lets him dig up 50% more than the iron pickaxe.  That means he digs up 24 * 0.50 = 12 more pounds. So with a steel pickaxe, he digs up 24 + 12 = 36 pounds a day.

If one dwarf digs up 36 pounds a day, in a month (which is 30 days) he digs up 36 * 30 = 1080 pounds.

If we have 40 dwarves, and each one digs up 1080 pounds, then all together they dig up 1080 * 40 = 43200 pounds! 



"
"Okay, so they sell 2 sandwiches for $3, and 4 sandwiches for $6. That means each sandwich costs $1.50.  If you want 8 sandwiches, you'd need to pay 8 times $1.50, which is $12.00.


$12.00 

"
"Okay, so Tom buys a new bedroom set for $3000 bucks.  He's smart and sells his old one for $1000 to help pay for it. That means he still owes $2000.  

The store says he has to pay 10% of what he owes each month.  So, 10% of $2000 is $200.


$200 

"
"Okay, so Sally starts with a bunch of balloons: 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow.  Then some blow away! 40% of the red ones pop, which is like 10 balloons (I did 25 times 0.40 on my calculator).  That leaves her with 15 red ones.

Then she drops half her yellow balloons, so that's 6 less yellow ones. She has 6 left.

Then she finds some blue balloons stuck in a tree! She takes 75% of them, which is 6 blue balloons (8 times 0.75).

Finally, she adds those blue ones to the red and yellow ones she has left. That's 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 balloons!


27 

"
"Okay, so there's a 50/50 chance the teacher won't even be there tomorrow. If she is there, there's a good chance she'll give everyone more time. And even if she doesn't, Marcus could try to say his dog ate it!  So, I think there's a pretty good chance he won't have to turn it in.  

I'd say there's a 30% chance he has to do it. 



"
"Okay, so they have 6000 seats but 950 are for the kids graduating and 300 are for teachers.  That means 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats are left for everyone else.

If there are 950 kids graduating, each one gets 4750 / 950 = 5 tickets. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Grandpa can eat a lot of jelly beans!  He eats 75 big ones.  If the medium ones are smaller, he can eat twice as many of those, so that's 75 x 2 = 150 medium jelly beans.

Now, the small ones are even smaller - 3 small ones are the same as 1 medium one. So he can eat 150 x 3 = 450 small jelly beans!


450 

"
"Okay, so Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days, that's 6 times 3 which is 18 hours total. She makes $15 each day, so for 3 days she makes 15 times 3 which is $45. But she has to pay $3 for parking each day, so that's 3 times 3 which is $9 for parking.  If you take her earnings and subtract the parking, she made $45 - $9 = $36.  So she makes $36 for 18 hours of work. That means she makes $2 each hour.


$2 

"
"Okay, so Ted starts with $200.  He spends $16 on each of the 3 books, so that's 16 times 3 which is $48. Then he buys 3 pencils at $6 each, so that's 3 times 6 which is $18.  To find out how much he spent total, we add the cost of the books and pencils: $48 + $18 = $66.



"
"Okay, so Richard has a driveway that's 24 feet wide and he puts a soda bottle every 3 feet. That means he can fit 8 bottles across (24 / 3 = 8).

He takes 5 seconds to walk to each bottle and drop the candy in. Since there are 7 spaces between the 8 bottles, it'll take him 35 seconds to do them all (7 x 5 = 35).


35 

"
"Okay, so Uncle Franky has two boxes with 40 apples each, so that's 2 * 40 = 80 apples total.  He puts 8 apples in each pack, so he can make 80 / 8 = 10 packs.


10 

"
"Okay, so Amor buys Parmesan for $11 a pound and she gets 2 pounds, so that's 2 times 11, which is $22.  Then she gets mozzarella for $6 a pound and she gets 3 pounds, so that's 3 times 6, which is $18.  

So the cheese costs $22 plus $18, which is $40. If she started with $50, she has $50 minus $40 left, which is $10.


$10 

"
"Okay, so Jim borrowed a lot of money for college, right?  He borrowed 50 thousand dollars each year for four years, so that's 50 times 4 which is 200 thousand dollars.  

He also didn't make any money while he was in school 'cause he was busy studying. He used to make 25 thousand a year, and he did that for four years, so that's 25 times 4 which is 100 thousand dollars he missed out on.

Now, his fancy new degree means he makes three times as much as before, so he makes 25 times 3 which is 75 thousand dollars a year.

To pay back all that money, he needs to earn 200 thousand plus 100 thousand, which is 300 thousand dollars.

If he makes 75 thousand a year, it will take him 300 thousand divided by 75 thousand, which is 4 years to earn it all back. 



4 

"
"Okay, so Jim's bed is 6 feet by 8 feet.  He needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and wider on each side, so that means it needs to be 10 feet long (6 + 2 + 2) and 12 feet wide (8 + 2 + 2).

To find out how much fabric he needs, we multiply the length and width: 10 feet * 12 feet = 120 square feet.


120 

"
"Okay, so they delivered 425 letters on Monday.  Then on Tuesday they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's amount.  One-fifth of Monday's letters is 425 divided by 5, which is 85.  So Tuesday they delivered 85 plus 17, which is 102 letters.

On Wednesday they delivered 5 more than twice the amount from Tuesday. Twice Tuesday's amount is 102 times 2, which is 204.  Then add 5, so Wednesday they delivered 209 letters.

To find the total, we add up all three days: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.


736 

"
"Okay, so Molly has 16 people coming to the party.  Ten want chicken salad, which costs $6.50 each. That's 10 times 6.50, which is $65.00. Six people want pasta salad at $6.00 each, so that's 6 times 6, which is $36.00.  To find the total, we add those together: $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

$101.00 

"
"Okay, so Johnny's dad lost $5 on the first race. Then he won $11 on the second race.  But then he lost $16.50 on the third race.  

To find the average, you add up all the money he lost and divide by the number of races. So, $5 + $16.50 = $21.50 lost total. Then $21.50 divided by 3 races is $7.17.


$7.17 

"
"Okay, so there are 26 countries in South America, and each one has 5 cities with 1000 people in each city.  

To find the total, we gotta multiply: 26 countries * 5 cities/country * 1000 people/city = 130,000 people


130,000 

"
"Okay, so Xavier started at 4 feet tall, which is 48 inches. He grew 3 inches, so now he's 51 inches tall. Cole started at 50 inches and grew 2 inches, making him 52 inches tall.  

That means Cole is 1 inch taller than Xavier. 


1 

"
"Okay, so they split $1920 between three people. The second person got $80 more than the first, and the third person got double what the second person got.  

To figure out how much the first person got, let's think about it like this:

* Let's say the first person got 'x' dollars.
* The second person got 'x + $80'.
* The third person got '2 * (x + $80)' which is the same as '2x + $160'.

If we add up what everyone got, it should equal $1920:

x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Let's combine the 'x's and the dollar amounts:

4x + $240 = $1920

Now, let's subtract $240 from both sides:

4x = $1680

Finally, divide both sides by 4 to find out what 'x' is:

x = $420


So the first person got $420. 

"
"Okay, so they worked for 3/8 of a day each day, and that's like 9 hours (cause 3 times 12 is 36 and 36 divided by 8 is 4.5, and then times 2 is 9).  They did that for 3 weeks, which is 21 days. So each painter worked 9 hours a day for 21 days... that's 189 hours!


189 

"
"Okay, so Rory picked up some tennis balls.  Let's see...

* The second set is the middle one, right?  
* The first set had 4 more balls than the second set.
* The third set had half the balls of the second set.
* All together, he got 19 balls.

Hmm... I think I can figure this out.

If the second set was 'x' balls, the first set was 'x + 4'. The third set was 'x / 2'.

So, x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Let me try to solve that...

2.5x + 4 = 19

2.5x = 15

x = 6

So the second set was 6 balls. That means the first set was 6 + 4 = 10 balls!



**Answer:** 10 

"
"Okay, so the car starts at $20,000.  It loses 21% of its value each year.  

* In 2008, it loses 21% of $20,000, which is $4,200. So it's worth $15,800.
* In 2009, it loses 21% of $15,800, which is $3,318. So it's worth $12,482.
* In 2010, it loses 21% of $12,482, which is $2,621. So it's worth $9,861.


The car is worth $9,861 in 2010. 

"
"Okay, so half the books are in English, which is 50 / 2 = 25 books.  Then 10% are in German, so that's 50 * 0.10 = 5 books.  That means there are 25 + 5 = 30 books that aren't in Spanish. So there must be 50 - 30 = 20 Spanish books.


20 

"
"Okay, so Bernice has to drive 1955 kilometers. She already drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days, so that's 325 times 4 which is 1300 kilometers.  

To find out how much more she has to drive, we subtract: 1955 - 1300 = 655 kilometers.


655 

"
"Okay, so Ingrid drinks 8 cups a day, and there are 16 cups in a gallon.  That means she drinks half a gallon each day (8 / 16 = 0.5).

If she drinks half a gallon a day, over 30 days she drinks 15 gallons (0.5 x 30 = 15).


15 

"
"Okay, so there were 120 people on the train at first. Then 20 more got on, so that's 140.  Then 50 got off, but 100 got on (because twice 50 is 100), so now there are 190 people. Finally, 80 people got off, leaving 110 people on the train.


110 

"
"Okay, so Alison bought a tank top for $10. Her shorts cost $5 more than that, so they were $15. Her shoes were on sale for half price, so they were $24. And her socks were $8 but she got $2 off, so they were $6.  

Let's add it all up: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55


$55
"
"Okay, so you got a 200 square foot kitchen, right? And each tile is one foot by one foot, so that's one square foot per tile.  You'll need 200 tiles to cover the whole floor.

If each tile costs $12, then 200 tiles will cost 200 times $12, which is $2400. 


$2400
"
"Okay, so James' insurance went up because of the accident. It's 60% more than the normal $120.  That means it went up by 60/100 * $120 = $72.

So now his insurance costs $120 + $72 = $192 each month.

For a whole year, that's $192 * 12 = $2304. 



"
"Okay, so Greg washes sheets for 4 twin beds and 1 king bed every week. His washing machine can only do 2 twin sets at once and 1 king set at a time.  

Let's see... he needs to do 4 twin beds divided by 2 per load, which is 2 loads for the twin sheets. Plus, he needs 1 load for the king sheets. So that's 2 + 1 = 3 loads every week.

If he does 3 loads a week, in a year (which has 52 weeks) he does 3 times 52 which is 156 loads.


156 

"
"Okay, so they watch 4 movies on Saturday and half that on Sunday, which is 2 movies. That means they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies every weekend.  Over 4 weeks, they'd watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weeks = 24 movies! 


24 

"
"Okay, so Leo started with 100 stickers. Then he got 50 more last year. This year he got double the amount from last year, so that's 50 x 2 = 100 stickers.

In total, he got 50 + 100 = 150 new stickers.

Adding those to his starting amount, he has 100 + 150 = 250 stickers now! 


250
"
"Okay, so Imma has 3 cats and feeds them 60 grams of food each, twice a day. That means she uses 3 * 60 * 2 = 360 grams of food every day.  If she has 720 grams, it will last 720 / 360 = 2 days. 


2 

"
"Okay, so they had 4 pizzas with 8 slices each, that's 4 * 8 = 32 slices total. Becky ate 10, and Jake ate 3 less than that, so he ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices. Silvia ate double Jake, so she ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.  

To find the total, we add up what everyone ate: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.


31 

"
"Okay, so Donovan's part took some time, let's call it 'x' minutes. Betsy took longer, so she took x + 18 minutes.  

Together they took 98 minutes, so x + (x + 18) = 98.

That means 2x + 18 = 98.  

If we take away 18 from both sides, we get 2x = 80.

Then, dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 40. So Donovan took 40 minutes.

Betsy took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.


58 

"
"Okay, so let's see...

The cast costs $200. The doctor charges $300 an hour, but she was only there for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So that's $300 divided by 2, which is $150.  The pills are $4 each and she got 30, so that's $4 times 30, which is $120. And parking is $6 an hour for two hours, so that's $6 times 2, which is $12.

If you add all that up, it's $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482. 



"
"Okay, so James gets a ton of emails, 80 every day! But 20% of them he can just ignore, which is like 16 emails. That means he has to answer 64 emails each day.  If he works 5 days a week, that's 64 times 5, which is 320 emails! 


320 

"
"Okay, so they had a bunch of classes visit the Science Center last week. Let's see...

Monday had 32 classes. Tuesday was double that, so that's 32 times 2, which is 64. Wednesday was triple Monday, so 32 times 3 is 96. Then Thursday had 30 and Friday had 25.

To find the total, we add them all up: 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

So, 247 classes visited the Science Center last week. 



"
"Okay, so he got 100 three times and then an 80.  To find the average, you add them all up and then divide by how many tests there were.

So, 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Then 380 divided by 4 is 95.


95 

"
"Okay, so the glee club ate a lot of pizza! They had 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them, which is like 14 pizzas. That leaves them with 6 pizzas.

The football team got twice as many pizzas, so they had 40! They ate 80% of those, which is 32 pizzas.  That means they have 8 pizzas left.

If you add the leftover pizzas from both teams, you get 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas.


14 

"
"Okay, so Anthony wants to send out a lot of coupons! He's sending 700 small ones, and then double that amount in big ones, so that's 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The small ones cost 5 cents each to mail, so that's 700 * $0.05 = $35.00.

The big ones cost 15 cents each, so that's 1400 * $0.15 = $210.00.

To find the total cost, we add those together: $35.00 + $210.00 = $245.00


$245.00
"
"Okay, so Sidney starts with 7 meatball subs because 10 - 3 = 7.  That's 28 meatballs because 7 times 4 is 28. Then Mark eats 4 of the subs, leaving Sidney with 3. That's 12 meatballs (3 times 4). Sidney gets 3 more subs, so now she has 6 subs total. That means she has 36 meatballs because 6 times 4 is 24, and 24 plus 12 is 36.


36 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Hezekiah sent out 20 trucks, and each one had 20 tons of fertilizer. That's a lot of fertilizer! But then, some of the trucks broke down. A quarter of them, which is 5 trucks, couldn't make it.  

So, 20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks made it to the farmers.

Each of those trucks had 20 tons, so 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons of fertilizer reached the farmers.


300 

"
"Okay, so Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen. That means he needs 6 pounds of butter total.

The butter is on sale, buy one get one half off.  So, for every 2 pounds he buys, he only pays full price for one.  

He's buying 6 pounds, so that's 3 full-price pounds and 3 half-price pounds.

Each full-price pound costs $4.00, so those 3 pounds cost $12.00.

The half-price pounds are $4.00 / 2 = $2.00 each, and he's getting 3 of them, so that's $2.00 x 3 = $6.00.

In total, the butter will cost him $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00. 


$18.00
"
"Okay, so Kayla invited a bunch of people! Let's see... 25 classmates plus 7 dance friends plus 13 family members is 45 people. But 4 can't make it, so that leaves 41 guests.

The theater costs $125 for the first 20 people, and then it's $6 extra for each person after that.  So, 41 minus 20 is 21 extra people.  That's 21 times $6, which is $126.

Finally, we add the $125 starting price and the $126 for the extra people: $125 + $126 = $251.

The party will cost $251. 



"
"Okay, so Maggie and Riza both started with $60. Maggie spent a quarter of hers, which is like $60 divided by 4, that's $15.  Riza spent a third of hers, so that's $60 divided by 3, which is $20.

So Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left. And Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

If you add that up, they have $45 + $40 = $85 left together.


85 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Robles has three monkeys.  The first monkey eats 10 bananas a day. The second monkey eats 4 more than that, so that's 14 bananas. Together, that's 24 bananas.

If he has 315 bananas for the whole week, that means he has 45 bananas each day (315 / 7 = 45).

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas a day (45 - 24 = 21).


21 

"
"Okay, so Teddy did half of the first puzzle, which is 500 divided by 2, that's 250 pieces. Then he did a whole other puzzle, so that's another 500 pieces.  In total, he put together 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.


750 

"
"Okay, so Jenny buys 15 roses, which is one group of 12 and then 3 more.  The dozen costs $15, and the other 3 roses cost $6 (because 3 times $2 is $6). So all together the roses cost $21.

She has $25 because she has five $5 bills.  That means she gets $4 back.

Since quarters are worth 25 cents, she gets $4 / $0.25 = 16 quarters back.


16 

"
"Okay, so Terry sells a bunch of stuff. Let's see... 6 milkshakes times $5.50 each is $33.  Then 9 burger platters times $11 each is $99. And lastly, 20 sodas times $1.50 each is $30.  

If you add all that up, he makes $162.00! 



"
"Okay, so Paul's train is the fourth one.  Let's see...

* The first train comes in 10 minutes and hangs around for 20 minutes.
* The second train gets there 30 minutes after the first one leaves, so that's 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 minutes.  And it only stays for 5 minutes.
* The third train shows up an hour after the second one leaves, so that's 60 + 60 = 120 minutes. It leaves right away.
* Paul's train comes 20 minutes after the third one, so that's 120 + 20 = 140 minutes.

Wow, that's over two hours! Paul has to wait 140 minutes. 



"
"Okay, so Melanie needs 200 toothpicks, and she already has 10 toothpicks for every week she saved them. She saved them for 12 weeks, so that's 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.

She needs 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks.

Since she gets 10 toothpicks each week, it will take her 80 / 10 = 8 more weeks. 


8 

"
"Okay, so the watch originally cost $2000, but Mr. Rogers got it for 75% off.  That means he paid 2000 * 0.75 = $1500.

Then he sold it to his friend for 120% of what he paid, so that's 1500 * 1.20 = $1800.

The friend saved $2000 - $1800 = $200 compared to the original price.

To find the percentage discount, we do (200 / 2000) * 100% = 10%.


So the answer is 10%. 

"
"Okay, so if one spring makes a jellyfish every second, that's 60 jellyfish every minute, and 3600 every hour!  If you have 5 springs, that's 5 times as many jellyfish, so 18,000 jellyfish in an hour.  

But we need to know how many they make in 4 hours.  So we multiply 18,000 by 4, which is 72,000 jellyfish! 


72,000 

"
"Okay, so Binkie scored 90. Frankie scored twice that amount plus 15 more points.  Twice Binkie's score is 90 x 2 = 180.  Then you add 15 to that, so Frankie scored 180 + 15 = 195.


195 

"
"Okay, so James walks 4 miles to the store, but he has to walk back home halfway there. That means he walked 2 miles to the halfway point. Then he walks 2 miles back home, and then another 2 miles to the store.  

So, he walked a total of 6 miles. If he walks 4 miles every hour, it took him 1.5 hours to get to the store. 


1.5 

"
"Okay, so Jenny bought a lot of bananas!  Let's see... if she got 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, that's 10 times 4, which is 40 bananas.

If she bought them one by one, it would cost 40 times 80 cents, which is $32.00. But since she got them in bunches, it only cost her 10 times $3.00, which is $30.00.

That means she saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00!


$2.00 

"
"Okay, so Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence to split. Harry gets way more than Sam, like 60 feet more!  To figure out how much Sam gets, we gotta think about it like this:

If Harry gets 60 more feet than Sam, let's say Sam gets  'x' amount of feet. That means Harry gets 'x + 60' feet.

Together, they have 'x' + 'x + 60' which equals 100 feet.

So, 2x + 60 = 100

We gotta get 'x' by itself.  Let's subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 2: x = 20

Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 



"
"Okay, so the crocodile grows 8 inches every 4 years.  That means it grows 2 inches each year (8 divided by 4 is 2).  If it grows 2 inches a year, in 13 years it'll grow 26 inches (2 times 13 is 26).


26 

"
"Okay, so Marcel sells three kinds of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking.  

* MTBs cost $500 each.
* BMX bikes are half the price of MTBs, so they cost $250.
* Trekking bikes cost $450.

He sold 300 bikes total. Half were Trekking, so that's 150 Trekking bikes. Then 15% were BMX, which is 45 BMX bikes (300 x 0.15 = 45).

That means he sold 105 MTB bikes (300 - 150 - 45 = 105).

Now let's see how much he made:

* Trekking: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
* BMX: 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
* MTB: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

Adding those up, he made $131,250 selling bikes that month! 



"
"Okay, so the farmer makes 5 bales every hour for 6 hours, so that's 5 times 6 which is 30 bales. The truck picks up 3 bales every hour for 6 hours, so that's 3 times 6 which is 18 bales.  If they start with 30 bales and the truck takes 18, there are 30 minus 18 bales left. That means there are 12 bales left in the field.


12 

"
"Okay, so John has 8 classes a day because he has 2 extra. That's 8 times 40 minutes, which is 320 minutes of class each day.  

He goes to class 5 days a week, so that's 320 times 5, which is 1600 minutes.

On the weekend, he studies for 100 minutes each day, so that's another 200 minutes.

In total, he studies 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes a week.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he studies for 1800 / 60 = 30 hours a week.


30 

"
"Okay, so the ball starts on the third floor, which is 3 times 24 feet high, so that's 72 feet.  Then it bounces up to 2/3 of that, which is like cutting 72 in half and then in half again. Half of 72 is 36, and half of that is 18.  But wait, it bounces to 2/3, not half, so it goes a little higher than 18.  

Let's see... 2/3 of 72 is like saying 72 divided by 3, which is 24, and then times 2, which is 48.

Now, for the second bounce, it goes 2/3 of 48.  That's like 48 divided by 3, which is 16, and then times 2, which is 32!


**Answer:** 32 

"
"Okay, so the first kid is 6 feet tall, which is 72 inches. The second kid is 2 inches taller, so they're 74 inches. The third kid is 5 inches shorter than the second, making them 69 inches.  The fourth kid is 3 inches taller than the third, so they are 72 inches tall. 


72 

"
"Okay, so they sold 2000 apples and each bag has 10 apples.  That means they sold 2000 / 10 = 200 bags.

If each bag costs $5, then they made 200 * $5 = $1000.


$1000 

"
"Okay, so the Allosaurus ate 270 kg, and that was only half of what was left after the velociraptors were done.  So before the velociraptors ate, there was 270 kg * 2 = 540 kg.

But that 540 kg was only half of what the T-Rex left behind!  So the triceratops must have had 540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg of meat to start.


1080 

"
"Okay, so Tony needs to paint four walls. Two of them are big, like 10 feet by 8 feet, so that's 80 square feet each.  That's 160 square feet total for those two walls. The other two walls are smaller, 5 feet by 8 feet, so they're 40 square feet each. That's 80 square feet for those two.

So all together, it's 160 + 80 = 240 square feet to paint.

Each can of paint covers 20 square feet, so he needs 240 / 20 = 12 cans of paint.

If each can costs $12, then 12 cans will cost 12 * $12 = $144. 


$144
"
"Okay, so Ellen left 3 sodas that were shaken up. Her brother took one of those, so there are 2 left.  There are 8 sodas in total left. So, there's a 2 out of 8 chance her friend gets a shaken one.  That's like 25%! 


25%
"
"Okay, so one train is going 60 miles an hour, and the other is going half that, which is 30 miles an hour.  

If they go for 3 hours, the fast train goes 60 x 3 = 180 miles.

The slower train goes 30 x 3 = 90 miles.

To find out how far apart they are, we add those distances together: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.


270 

"
"Okay, so Billy helps 2 people every hour, and he works for 3 hours each day. That means he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people every day.

There are 31 days in March and 19 in April, so that's 31 + 19 = 50 days.

But he takes 20% of those days off.  20% of 50 is (20/100) * 50 = 10 days off.

So he works for 50 - 10 = 40 days.

In total, he helps 40 * 6 = 240 people.


240 

"
"Okay, so there were 12 buses and each one had 35 people, so that's 12 times 35 which is 420 people. Then there were 20 cars with 3 people in each, so that's 20 times 3 which is 60 people.  

To find the total, we add those together: 420 plus 60 equals 480.


480 

"
"Okay, so Mike is 24. Martha is 4 years younger than him, so she's 20.  Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so he's 30!

"
"Okay, so the big slide is 300 feet long and you go 60 feet every minute.  That means it takes 300 / 60 = 5 minutes to go down.

The smaller slide is 240 feet and you go 80 feet per minute, so that's 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.

The big slide takes 2 minutes longer than the smaller one. 



"
"Okay, so Bobby takes a half hour lunch every day, and two 15 minute breaks. That's 30 minutes for lunch plus 30 minutes for breaks, so that's a whole hour of breaks each day.

Over five days, that's 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours of breaks.


5 

"
"Okay, so Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times that, so he ran 8 times 3.5 which is 28 miles.  That means Amber and Micah ran a total of 8 + 28 = 36 miles.  

If they all ran 52 miles together, then Ahito must have run 52 - 36 = 16 miles.


16 

"
"Okay, so Sheila started with $85.00 on her card. Then she returned something for $15.00, so she had $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00 left.

The frying pan was on sale for 20% off of $20.00, so the discount was $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. That means the pan cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

The towels were 10% off of $30.00, so the discount was $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00.  The towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

So, the frying pan and towels together cost $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

Adding that to her balance, Sheila's new credit card total is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00. 


$113.00
"
"Okay, so some jellyfish are big and some are small. The big ones can change color, and 6 of them turned blue under the light.  If a third of the big jellyfish change color, that means there were 6 * 3 = 18 big jellyfish in total.

Since the big jellyfish are only a fifth of all the jellyfish, there must be 18 * 5 = 90 jellyfish in the whole tank!


90 

"
"Okay, so Chris is 4. Ben is twice as old as Chris, so Ben is 8.  Caroline is three times older than Ben, so she's 24! 


24
"
"Okay, so Lauren wants to retire and live on 40% of her salary, which is $100,000. That means she needs $40,000 each year to live.

She wants to retire for 20 years, so she needs $40,000 x 20 = $800,000 total.

She saves 20% of her salary each year, which is $100,000 x 0.20 = $20,000.

To get to $800,000, she'll need to save for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.


40 

"
"Okay, so Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He cuts it into fourths, so each piece is 25 centimeters long (100 / 4 = 25). Then he cuts each of those pieces into fifths.  So each tiny piece is 5 centimeters long (25 / 5 = 5).


5 

"
"Okay, so if 40% of the school is 240 boys, that means the whole school is way bigger!  

If 40% is 240 kids, then 10% is 240 divided by 4, which is 60 kids.

That means the whole school is 100%, so we need ten groups of 60 kids.  

Ten groups of 60 is 600 kids in total.

If there are 240 boys, then there must be 600 - 240 = 360 girls.


360 

"
"Okay, so she spent $19 on pots and $26 on soil, which is $19 + $26 = $45. But then she had a coupon for $7 off, so it was $45 - $7 = $38. 


$38
"
"Okay, so there are six women in total. Three have 4-inch heels, and three have 2-inch heels.  To find the average, you add up all the heel heights and then divide by the number of women.

So, it's (4 + 4 + 4) + (2 + 2 + 2) = 12 + 6 = 18.

Then, 18 divided by 6 is 3.


3 

"
"Okay, so Soledad wants to hike a ton of miles in June! She wants to hike 9300 miles, but she's only hiking 250 miles each day (125 miles twice a day).

June has 30 days, so she'll hike 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7500 miles.

That means she's short 9300 miles - 7500 miles = 1800 miles.

To make up those miles, she needs to hike an extra 1800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles each day.


60 

"
"Okay, so let's see...

* They have 3 red balls and each one costs $9, so that's 3 times 9, which is $27.
* Then there are 11 blue balls at $5 each.  That's 11 times 5, which equals $55.
* Finally, they have 25 green balls worth $3 each. So that's 25 times 3, making $75.

Now, to find the total, we add up all the money: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157


157 

"
"Okay, so they have 12 kg of apples. Peter wants a quarter, which is like 12 divided by 4, that's 3 kg. Paul wants a third, so that's 12 divided by 3, which is 4 kg.  Together they take 3 + 4 = 7 kg. That means James gets the rest, so 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

5 

"
"Okay, so it started at 2 degrees. Then it got 8 degrees colder, so that's 2 minus 8, which is -6.  But then it warmed up 3 degrees, so -6 plus 3 is -3. 

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees. 



"
"Okay, so Raymond starts with $21. Then he gets $11 more, so now he has $32.  He spends $5 on a comic, so he has $27 left. Then he spends $19 on a puzzle, which leaves him with $8.


$8 

"
"Okay, so Anna started with $16 and spent $4, leaving her with $12.  Then she had $2 left, so she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on books. Since she bought two books, each book cost $10 / 2 = $5. 


$5
"
"Okay, so last year there were 50 students. This year there were 20% more students.  To find out how many more students there are, you do 50 times 0.20, which is 10.  So there are 10 more students this year.  That means there are 50 + 10 = 60 students this year.


60 

"
"Okay, so the lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. That means it blinks 51 times every minute (255 divided by 5).  To find out how long it takes to blink 459 times, we divide 459 by 51, which equals 9. 


9 

"
"Okay, so Tate starts with 4 boy guppies and 3 boy goldfish, that's 7 boy fish. He also has 7 girl guppies and 5 girl goldfish, so that's 12 girl fish.

Then he buys more fish! 2 more boy guppies and 2 more boy goldfish make 4 more boy fish. He also gets 1 girl guppy and 3 girl goldfish, that's 4 more girl fish.

So now he has 11 boy fish (7 + 4) and 16 girl fish (12 + 4).

That means he has 5 more girl fish than boy fish (16 - 11).


5 

"
"Okay, so Amalia mowed the lawn for 4 hours. Megan took 2 hours longer than that to walk the dog, so she was busy for 4 + 2 = 6 hours. Dior took way longer than Amalia, like 4 more hours, so she spent 4 + 4 = 8 hours doing laundry.  

To find the total time, we add up all their times: 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.


18 

"
"Okay, so John drives 70 miles per hour and it takes him 2 hours to get to his parents. That means it's 70 times 2, which is 140 miles one way.  Since he has to drive back home, it's 140 times 2, which is 280 miles for one trip. He does this twice a month, so it's 280 times 2, which equals 560 miles. 

560 

"
"Okay, so Sofie walks 10 miles each day for 7 days, that's 10 * 7 = 70 miles.  Brian walks half as much as Sofie, so he walks 70 / 2 = 35 miles.


35 

"
"Okay, so they need to make 400 toys, right?  And 4 of the workers make 6 toys an hour and 4 toys an hour, so that's like 10 toys an hour from those guys.  They work for 10 hours, so that's 100 toys each.  So those 4 workers make 200 toys total.

That means they still need 200 more toys, but they're short 20, so they really need to make 220 more.

If they need 220 more toys and they work for 10 hours, that means the last worker needs to make 22 toys each hour. 


22
"
"Okay, so Kory's dog is 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth that size, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.  His other dog is half the size of Kory's, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.  

That means Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds together.  

Adding that to Kory's dog, all the dogs weigh 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.


105 

"
"Okay, so Kris got 7 stickers from someone and had 9 more, meaning he had 16 stickers total.  That means Luis gave him 16 stickers.  Since Luis only gave half his stickers to Kris, Luis must have had 16 x 2 = 32 stickers.  Luis got those from Seth, who gave him half, so Seth had 32 x 2 = 64 stickers at the start.


64 

"
"Okay, so John has 3 big bags of M&Ms, and each one weighs 10 ounces. That's 3 times 10, which is 30 ounces total.  

Each ounce has 30 M&Ms, so he has 30 times 30, which is 900 M&Ms!

If he puts 10 M&Ms in each small bag, he can make 900 divided by 10, which is 90 small bags.


90 

"
"Okay, so Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day.  Halfway around the Earth is like 40,000 kilometers divided by 2, which is 20,000 kilometers.  To figure out how many days it takes Alfie, we divide the total distance by how far he flies each day: 20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers/day = 50 days.


50 

"
"Okay, so the fastest car is way faster than a normal car. The second fastest car is already super fast, like 5 times faster than a normal car that goes 120 miles per hour. So that's 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour!

But the fastest car is even crazier! It's 1.25 times faster than the second fastest, so it goes 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour!

750 

"
"Okay, so Liam is 16 now, but two years ago he was 14.  That means Vince was 7 two years ago because Liam was twice his age.  So now Vince is 9! 


9
"
"Okay, so Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  That means Sarah painted 30 - 12 = 18 eggs.  Camden painted 18 + 12 = 30 eggs.

Arnold and Madeline painted the rest of the eggs, which is 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. They each painted the same amount, so they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Camden painted 30 - 13 = 17 more eggs than Arnold.


17 

"
"Okay, so Nik has a lot of crayons!  

He's got 200 of them, and he wants to put them in boxes that hold 8 crayons each. That means he'll need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so all the boxes together weigh 25 * 8 = 200 ounces. The crayons themselves weigh 200 ounces too.

That's a total of 200 + 200 = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 400 / 16 = 25 pounds. 


25 

"
"Okay, so the tree is 80 feet tall, but he can only use 80% of it, which is like 80 times 0.8, so that's 64 feet.  He makes logs that are 4 feet long, so he gets 64 divided by 4, which is 16 logs.  Each log gives him 5 planks, so he has 16 times 5, which is 80 planks.  If each plank sells for $1.20, he makes 80 times $1.20, which is $96. 


$96
"
"Okay, so Valerie makes $5000 a month. Her brother makes double that, which is $10000.  Together they make $15000. Their mom makes twice that, so she makes $30000.  If you add all their money together, it's $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000.


45000 

"
"Okay, so Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and it takes her 40 minutes. That means she walks at 3 miles per hour on the beach (because 2 miles divided by 40 minutes, then times 60 minutes in an hour, equals 3).

On the sidewalk, she walks twice as fast, so she goes 6 miles per hour.  Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, that only takes her 10 minutes (because 1 mile divided by 6 miles per hour equals 1/6 of an hour, and 1/6 of an hour times 60 minutes is 10 minutes).

So, her whole walk takes 40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes.


50 

"
"Okay, so Jane saves $4 every week. She's been doing that for 8 weeks, so she has $32 saved up already.  She wants to have $60, so she needs $28 more.  If she saves $4 each week, it will take her 7 more weeks to get to $60. 


7 

"
"Okay, so there are three trees with 7 blue birds each, that's 3 times 7 which is 21 birds. Then there are two trees with 4 birds each, so that's 2 times 4 which is 8 birds. And lastly, one tree has 3 birds.  

If we add all those up, 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 birds!


32 

"
"Okay, so Bob gets 24 more marbles (because 2 dozen is 2 times 12). That means he had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles at first.  If he loses 10, he'll have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles left.


26 

"
"Okay, so Donny needs his water to be at least 40 degrees.  He's got one mug that's only 33 degrees, which is too cold.  The other mug is a mystery!

He puts some of the cold water in his bottle, and then just a little from the mystery mug.  Since he can drink it now, that means the mystery mug must have been pretty warm to make the whole thing warm enough.

Hmm... I think the mystery mug has to be at least 68 degrees.  That way, even with some of the cold water mixed in, it'll be hot enough for Donny to drink. 



"
"Okay, so he starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.  Then he gets 20 more cows every day for three weeks, that's like 20 cows/day * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = 420 more cows! And he gets 10 more chickens every day for three weeks, so that's 10 chickens/day * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = 210 more chickens.

So now he has 50 + 420 = 470 cows and 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

That means he has a total of 470 + 230 = 700 animals! 


700 

"
"Okay, so Russell buys 4 packs of bagels, and each pack has 9 bagels. That's 4 times 9, which is 36 bagels in total.  Each pack costs $10, so 4 packs cost $40. But wait, there's a 10% discount! That means he saves $4.00 (10% of $40). So, he pays $36.00 for all the bagels.

To find out how much each bagel costs, we divide the total price by the number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.


$1.00 

"
"Okay, so Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, which is 18 scoops.  

It takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.  So, for 18 scoops, you'd need 18 scoops / 2 scoops per 3 potatoes = 9 sets of 3 potatoes.

That means Gomer ate 9 sets * 3 potatoes per set = 27 potatoes.


27 

"
"Okay, so Chester eats a lot of eggs!  

First, he eats 3 eggs a day for a whole month, that's 30 days. So that's 3 times 30 which is 90 eggs.

Then he eats even more, 5 eggs a day for another month. That's 5 times 30, which is 150 eggs.

In total, he eats 90 plus 150, so 240 eggs in those two months.

Now, a dozen has 12 eggs, right? So we gotta see how many dozens are in 240.  That's 240 divided by 12, which is 20.

So Chester needs 20 dozen eggs! 



"
"Okay, so there are 17 green jelly beans and double that amount of red ones, which is 17 x 2 = 34 red jelly beans.  That means there are 17 + 34 = 51 green and red jelly beans together.

If there are 60 jelly beans total, then there must be 60 - 51 = 9 blue jelly beans. 


9 

"
"Okay, so Tim has 5 trees and each one gives him 6 lemons every year. That means he gets 5 times 6 lemons, which is 30 lemons every year.  

A decade is 10 years, so over 10 years he'd get 30 times 10 lemons, which is 300 lemons! 


300 

"
"Okay, so there are 5 men for every 9 women on the bus. That means there are 5 + 9 = 14 parts in total.

If there are 84 people on the bus, then each part is 84 / 14 = 6 people.

That means there were 9 parts * 6 people/part = 54 women on the bus at first.

Since 20 women got off, there are 54 - 20 = 34 women left.


34 

"
"Okay, so Faraday sells sunflowers for $2 each and bouquets for $8. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.

He makes $26 from single sunflowers and $56 from bouquets every day. That means he makes $26 + $56 = $82 from sunflowers every day.

If each sunflower costs $2 and he makes $6.67 from each sunflower (because he also sells them in bouquets), then he sold $82 / $6.67 = about 12 sunflowers over 3 days. 

So the answer is 12. 



"
"Okay, so Adam starts with $100. He buys rocks for $5 each, so he can buy 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

He sells 60% of them, which is 20 * 0.60 = 12 rocks.

If he sells each rock for $7, he makes 12 * $7 = $84.

Since he spent $100 and only made $84, he loses $100 - $84 = $16. 


$16
"
"Okay, so Lauren's got a lot of drawing to do! 

Let's see... for the big pictures, she needs 9 days (45 scenes / 5 scenes a day = 9 days).  The medium ones will take her 6 days (36 scenes / 6 scenes a day = 6 days). And the small ones will take 7 days (49 scenes / 7 scenes a day = 7 days).

If we add all those days up, it'll take her 22 days to finish everything. 


22
"
"Okay, so Chatty has 3 dozen eggs, and a dozen has 12, so that's 3 times 12, which is 36 eggs.  She has 4 kids, so if she splits them evenly, each kid gets 36 divided by 4, which is 9 eggs. 


9 

"
"Okay, so Jen has 3 fish and each one needs a dollar of food every day.  That means she spends 3 dollars a day on fish food.  May has 31 days, so she spends 3 times 31 dollars, which is 93 dollars.


$93 

"
"Okay, so Patricia starts with 30 roses, but then gives 24 to her mom. That leaves her with 30 - 24 = 6 roses.  Then she buys 15 more, so she has 6 + 15 = 21 roses.


21 

"
"Okay, so Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, and then another 140 miles in 3 hours.  That means he traveled a total of 110 + 140 = 250 miles.

He was driving for a total of 2 + 3 = 5 hours.

To find his average speed, we do 250 miles divided by 5 hours, which equals 50 miles per hour.


50 

"
"Okay, so the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. The second one is three times more likely to win, so that's 20 times 3 which is 60%.  To get both winning, we gotta multiply those chances together: 20 times 60 is 1200.  But wait, that's not a percentage! We gotta divide by 100, so it's 12%.


12% 

"
"Okay, so Jim has 27 seashells. Carlos has 5 less than Jim, so he has 27 - 5 = 22 seashells. Carrey has half as many as Carlos, so he has 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

To find out how many each person gets, we add up all the seashells: 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells. Then we divide that by 3 because there are three people: 60 / 3 = 20 seashells each.


20 

"
"Okay, so Mason eats carrots every day. He eats 4 carrots Monday through Friday, so that's 4 times 5 which is 20 carrots. Then on Saturday and Sunday he eats 5 carrots each day, so that's 5 times 2 which is 10 carrots.  If you add those together, 20 plus 10 is 30.

30 

"
"Okay, so the first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than that, so it's 5 minutes plus another 3 minutes (because 60% of 5 is 3).  That means the second song is 8 minutes long.  

So, 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes total.


13 

"
"Okay, so Linus buys each phone for $20 and sells them for $40, which means he makes $20 profit on each one.

He bought 2 phones on Monday, so that's $20/phone * 2 phones = $40 profit.

Then he bought 4 phones on Tuesday, so that's $20/phone * 4 phones = $80 profit.

In total, he made $40 + $80 = $120 profit.


120 

"
"Okay, so Isabel is 7 feet tall. Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 5 feet tall. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, making Carl 6 feet tall.  Carl's cane is half his height, so it's 3 feet long. 


3
"
"Okay, so Hortex makes 4200 bottles a day, and each bottle gives you 20% of the energy you need for the whole day.  That means they're giving 4200 times 20% which is 840% of the energy everyone needs.

We need to figure out how much more energy we need for 2300 people. That's 2300 times 100% which is 230,000%.

So, we need 230,000% - 840% = 229,160% more energy.

Since each bottle gives 20%, we need 229,160% divided by 20% which is 11,458 bottles.


 11,458 

"
"Okay, so Carla has eight babies, and three-quarters of them wear purple. That's like 6 babies. The other quarter wear blue, so that's 2 babies.

Then, some of them wear bows. All the blue babies wear bows, and one-third of the purple babies wear bows too. So that's 2 purple babies with bows.

In total, there are 4 babies wearing bows (2 blue + 2 purple).  

So, if you see a baby with a bow, there's a 50% chance it's wearing purple. 


50
"
"Okay, so they got a bunch of reports last week, right?  They got 1907 on Monday and Tuesday, and then 2136 on Thursday and Friday. That's a total of 1907 + 2136 = 4043 reports for those four days.

If they got 5168 reports all week, then they must have gotten 5168 - 4043 = 1125 reports on Wednesday.


1125 

"
"Okay, so Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land. He sells half of it first, which is like 80 divided by 2, so that's 40 square meters. He gets $50 for that.

Then he sells another chunk, which is a quarter of what he had left. A quarter of 40 is 10, so he sells 10 more square meters for $30.

That leaves him with 30 square meters. He sells those for $3 each, so that's 30 times 3, which is $90.

To find out how much he made in total, we add up all the money: $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.



"
"Okay, so Haley is 26. Half of Haley's age is 13.  If Geb is 10 years younger than half of Haley's age, then Geb is 3 years old. 


3
"
"Okay, so Tyrion uses 2 masks each time he goes out, and he goes out 3 times a day. That means he uses 2 x 3 = 6 masks every day.

Over two days, he'd use 6 x 2 = 12 masks. 


12 

"
"Okay, so Cole hid a bunch of eggs, right?  3 dozen is like 3 times 12, so that's 36 eggs.  Lamar found 5, and Stacy found double that, so she got 10. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he got 8.  Mei found half as many as Charlie, which is 4.

Let's add up how many they found: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

If they found 27, then there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs left hiding! 


9
"
"Okay, so John has a lot of garbage to pick up!  

Let's see... the first two places have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last place is bigger, 60% bigger than those two put together.  So, 60% of 400 is (60/100) * 400 = 240 more apartments.

That means the last place has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

In total, he picks up garbage from 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

He goes to each place three times a week, so that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 times he picks up garbage each week.

He gets 40 cents for each pickup, so he makes 4320 * $0.40 = $1728.00 every week. 


$1728.00
"
"Okay, so the tree starts with 50 fruits. Then it goes up to 150, then 350.  

Hmm, the 8-year-old tree has less than the 10-year-old, which has 20 times the starting amount. So the 10-year-old has 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits!

The 8-year-old has 200 less than that, so it has 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Adding all those up: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = 2350 fruits! 

 2350 



"
"Okay, so Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $20.  If Jack started with $100 and gets $20 more, he'll have $120.


$120 

"
"Okay, so the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  And all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long.  

Hmm, let's see... If we think of the blue rope as ""one part"", the red rope is ""four parts"".  That means the yellow rope is 7 centimeters longer than ""one part"".

Since they all add up to 37 centimeters, we need to figure out how long ""one part"" is.  Then we can find out how long the red rope is! 


Let me think...  I'm gonna try adding up the parts and see if I can make 37. 

"
"Okay, so Ronnie has $5. Rissa has three times that, which is $15.  If Rissa gave some money to her little sister and has 4/5 of her money left, that means she gave away 1/5 of her money.  That's $15 / 5 = $3. Ronnie also gave $3 to his sister. So, Ronnie has $5 - $3 = $2 left.


Answer: 2 

"
"Okay, so the mural is half yellow, which means it used 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint.  That leaves 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints for the red, white, and purple. Since they're all used the same amount, each color got 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.


2 

"
"Okay, so Tom's got four bedrooms, and each one is 20 feet by 12 feet. That means each bedroom is 20 times 12, which is 240 square feet.  

All four bedrooms together are 240 times 4, so that's 960 square feet.

The living room is five times bigger than one bedroom, so it's 240 times 5, which is 1200 square feet.

So the bedrooms and living room together are 960 plus 1200, which is 2160 square feet.

Don't forget the rest of the house is 1000 square feet, so the whole house is 2160 plus 1000, which is 3160 square feet.

"Okay, so Alice starts with 3 clouds on Monday. Then each day she sees double the clouds from the day before.  

That means Tuesday she sees 3 x 2 = 6 clouds.

Wednesday is 6 x 2 = 12 clouds.

Thursday is 12 x 2 = 24 clouds.

And Friday is 24 x 2 = 48 clouds.

To find the total, we add up all the clouds: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds


93 

"
"Okay, so the big box has 20% more pods, which is like an extra 20 pods.  That means it has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the big box still costs $12, you get 120 pods for $12.  That means you get 120 / 12 = 10 cycles for every dollar!

"
"Okay, so Thomas starts with a bunch of twenties, right?  He gets $1000, which is 50 twenty dollar bills. Then he loses 10, so he has 40 left. He uses half of those to pay a bill, so that's 20 bills gone. Now he only has 20 left.

But wait! He triples his money, so now he has 60 twenties! That's $1200!

Finally, he changes all those twenties into fives.  Since each five is worth less, he'll have way more bills.  $1200 divided by $5 is 240.


So the answer is 240. 

"
"Okay, so team A scored 4 goals in the first half. Team B scored 2 less than that, so they got 2 goals.  Then in the second half, team B scored 4 times the amount from the first half, which is 2 times 4 equals 8 goals. Team A scored 1/4 of that, so they got 2 goals.

Let's add it all up: Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals total. Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals total.  

That means there were 6 + 10 = 16 goals in the whole game!

"
"Okay, so the teacher starts with 5 inches of chalk. He uses a lot on Monday, like 45% of it, which is a little more than half. That means he has a little more than half left, right?  

He only uses 20% each day after that.  So, if he has a little more than half left, and he uses a fifth of it each day, he can probably use it for a couple more days before it's too small.

I'd say he has **2** more days. 



"
"Okay, so there are 12 girls and 12 boys, that's 24 kids total.  A third of the girls are on varsity, so that's 12 divided by 3 which is 4 girls. Then a fourth of the boys are on varsity, so that's 12 divided by 4 which is 3 boys.  That means 4 + 3 = 7 kids are on varsity.  So, 24 - 7 = 17 kids aren't on varsity.


17 

"
"Okay, so Mike has 5 masks. Johnny has three times that amount plus 2 more, so that's 5 times 3 which is 15, then plus 2 more...  That makes 17!

17 

"
"Okay, so James has 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 of them, and then caps 7 more than that, so that's 4 + 7 = 11 teeth capped.  

That means the dentist fixed a total of 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage, we do (15 teeth fixed / 30 total teeth) * 100% = 50%


50 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Marcellus bought a bunch of milk, right?  But some of it went bad.  

He bought 4000 gallons and 2 out of every 5 gallons went bad. That means 1600 gallons went bad.

Each gallon cost $3.50, so the bad milk cost 1600 * $3.50 = $5600.

That's how much he got back! 


$5600
"
"Okay, so this is kinda tricky, but let's break it down.

Wendy's age is connected to Colin's age in two different ways.  

First, it says Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years. That means we gotta add 7 to Colin's age and then multiply that by 5 to get Wendy's age.

Then, it says in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is *now*. So, we add 25 to Colin's age and that should be equal to Wendy's age divided by 3.

Hmm, let me think... if we call Colin's age ""c"" and Wendy's age ""w"", we can write it like this:

* w = 5(c + 7) 
* c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we gotta solve for ""c"", which is Colin's age.  

Let's see... if we solve the first one for ""w"", we get w = 5c + 35.

Then we can plug that into the second equation: c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Let me do some math...

Okay, I got it! Colin is 20 years old.

"
"Okay, so Bob has $27,000 to spend on books for 3 schools. That means each school gets $9,000 ($27,000 / 3 = $9,000).

He can buy 100 books for $500, so each book costs $5 ($500 / 100 = $5).

With $9,000 per school, he can buy 1800 books for each school ($9,000 / $5 = 1800).


1800 

"
"Okay, so there were two apples at first. Then one more fell when he threw one up. That's three! Then he threw another one and five more fell. So now there are eight apples. He picks up seven and throws one, making nine apples fall. That's a lot of apples!  He picks them all up, so he has 16 apples.

16 



"
"Okay, so Ali needs 850 kilos of coal. Each bag has 50 kilos, so he needs 850 / 50 = 17 bags.

Each bag costs $18, so 17 bags will cost 17 * $18 = $306. 


$306
"
"Okay, so Kate's friends are gonna eat a lot of pizza!  Let's see... they're eating 6 slices of cheese each, and there are 12 slices per cheese pizza, so she needs 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices of cheese pizza. That means she needs 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

For pepperoni, they're eating 4 slices each, and each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. So she needs 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices of pepperoni. That's 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

In total, she needs 3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas.

"
"Okay, so Sam ran 3 miles three times, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 miles. Then he ran 5 miles two times, which is 5 x 2 = 10 miles.  If you add those together, he ran a total of 9 + 10 = 19 miles this week. 


19 

"
"Okay, so Jay makes 20 snowballs every hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. That's like, 8 snowballs melting every hour.  So he's really only making 12 snowballs each hour (20 - 8 = 12).

To get to 60 snowballs, he needs to make 40 more (60 - 20 = 40).

If he makes 12 snowballs every hour, it'll take him 3 hours and 20 minutes to make 40 more (40 / 12 = 3 with a remainder).


**Answer:** 5 hours 

"
"Okay, so Digimon is 20 years old, and John is 28 now. That means John was 8 when Digimon came out (28 - 20 = 8).

If John was twice as old as Jim back then, Jim was 4 years old (8 / 2 = 4).

So, Jim is 24 now (4 + 20 = 24)!


24 

"
"Okay, so Doxa ate one slice. Her sister ate one more than that, so she ate 2 slices. Then her brother ate one more than his sister, so he ate 3 slices.  

To find the total, we add up how many slices each person ate: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices.


6 

"
"Okay, so they used 38 bandages the first day and then 10 less the second day, so that's 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the third day, they used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

That means they used a total of 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages.

They got 50 bandages the first day and then two packs, so that's 50 + (2 * 50) = 150 bandages.

If they had 78 left at the end, they must have started with 78 + 91 = 169 bandages. 


169 

"
"Okay, so her haircut cost $30 for every inch she cut off. She cut off 2 inches, so that's 2 times 30, which is 60 bucks. Then you add the 40 dollars for the color, and that makes it 100 dollars total. 


100 

"
"Okay, so Jen works a lot! Let's see... she works 7 and a half hours each day, and she gets paid $1.50 for every hour.  That means she makes 7.5 times 1.5 which is $11.25 each day.

She works 6 days a week, so that's $11.25 times 6, which is $67.50 every week.

April has 4 weeks, so she makes $67.50 times 4, which is $270.00 for the whole month.

Oh, and she gets an extra $10 for coming to work every day! So, in total, she makes $270.00 plus $10, which is $280.00!


$280.00 

"
"Okay, so Jason did a bunch of chores. Let's see... he got $3 for laundry, $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 each time he took out the trash, and $0.50 each time he emptied the dishwasher.

He emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so that's 6 times $0.50 which is $3.00. He did laundry once, so that's $3.00. He took out the trash twice, so that's 2 times $0.75 which is $1.50. And he cleaned his room once for $1.50.

Adding it all up: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00

Jason earned $9.00! 



"
"Okay, so a whale has 40 gallons of blood, and a shark has three times that much.  That means a shark has 40 * 3 = 120 gallons of blood.

If there are ten sharks, they'd have 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons of blood all together.


1200 

"
"Okay, so first, 50 people came in the morning. Then 40 more came around 10:00.  That's 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Then twice the number who came at 10:00 came later, so that's 40 * 2 = 80 more people. Now we have 90 + 80 = 170 people.

Finally, three times the first group came in the evening, so that's 50 * 3 = 150 more people.

Adding everyone up, we get 170 + 150 = 320 people! 


320
"
"Okay, so Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and that's the same as 5 times 5 pens, which is 25 red pens.

She bought twice as many black pens, so that's 5 packs of red pens times 2, which is 10 packs of black pens.

That's 10 packs times 5 pens per pack, which is 50 black pens.

In total, Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens! 



"
"Okay, so John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600, which means each bottle costs $60.  He buys twice as much cognac, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac. Cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, so each bottle is $60 + ($60 * 0.50) = $90.  That means the cognac costs 20 * $90 = $1800.  

In total, he spends $600 + $1800 = $2400.


$2400 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day. He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.  

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Let's add up all the trees: 20 + 40 + 30 + 50 = 140 trees.


140 

"
"Okay, so Fred started with 24 gallons of root beer. His kids drank 4 gallons, so there were 20 left. Then his wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 13.  His friend drank 5 gallons, so there were only 8 gallons left for the party.  Since there were 4 people at the party, they each got 8 divided by 4, which is 2 gallons.


2 

"
"Okay, so it says ""eight more than four times"" the number of mugs is 40.  That means we gotta do some multiplying and adding.  

Let's say there are 'x' mugs. Four times the mugs is 4x. Then we add 8 to that: 4x + 8. And that whole thing equals 40.

So, 4x + 8 = 40

To figure out 'x', we gotta subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 32

Then divide both sides by 4: x = 8

There are **8** coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge. 

"
"Okay, so there are 66 fish total.  One-third of them have red stripes, so that's 66 divided by 3, which is 22 fish.  That leaves 66 minus 22, or 44 fish without red stripes.

Then, 5 out of every 11 of those fish have blue stripes. So, it's like 5 divided by 11 of 44, which is 20 fish.

Finally, we add the red stripe fish and the blue stripe fish: 22 plus 20 equals 42.


42 

"
"Okay, so Amy starts with two eyeshadow palettes, and each has four colors, so that's 2 times 4 equals 8 colors. Then she has three makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's 3 times 6 which is 18 colors.  That means she has 8 plus 18, which is 26 colors total.

But then her sister takes one of the palettes, which has 4 colors. So now Amy has 26 minus 4, which is 22 colors.

She uses up half the colors from one makeup set, and that's 6 divided by 2, which is 3 colors.

So, she has 22 minus 3, which is 19 colors left.


19 

"
"Okay, so Mattison is 60 inches tall, and his house is 7 times taller than him, so that's 60 x 7 = 420 inches.

The first floor is three times his height, so that's 60 x 3 = 180 inches.

If the whole house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches, then the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches tall.

But the question asks about the roof from the second floor, so we need to take away the height of the second floor's floor.  That means the roof is 240 - 60 = 180 inches from the second floor.


180 

"
"Okay, so the Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells, which is 280 shells (700 x 0.4 = 280).  That leaves 420 shells left (700 - 280 = 420).

The Finders got 60% of those leftover shells, so they found 252 shells (420 x 0.6 = 252).

That means the Gogetters found the rest, which is 168 shells (420 - 252 = 168).


168 

"
"Okay, so Bernie has four dogs, and they need to walk a total of 12 miles.  The first three dogs need to walk 1, 4, and 3 miles, so that's 8 miles total.  That means the last dog needs to walk 4 miles. 


4 

"
"Okay, so John's house is worth a lot, $250,000! He borrows 40% of that, which is like 40 out of every 100 dollars.  So he gets $100,000. Then he uses 60% of that to pay off stuff he owes. That's like 60 out of every 100 dollars again. So he uses $60,000 to pay off debt.  That means he has $40,000 left over.


$40,000
"
"Okay, so Deandre caught three tunas.  They weighed 56, 46, and 26 kilograms. That's a lot of tuna!  

To find out how much he'll make, we gotta add up the weights: 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

Each kilogram of tuna sells for 50 cents, so we multiply: 128 x $0.50 = $64.00

He'll earn $64.00 selling all the tuna. 



"
"Okay, so Trinity buys magazines for $72. Then she sells them for 11/8 of that price.  That means she sells them for $72 times 11/8, which is $99.  To find her profit, we subtract what she paid from what she earned: $99 - $72 = $27.

So her profit is $27. 



"
"Okay, so Brian's dehumidifier takes out 1 liter of water each day on low.  If he runs it on low for 3 days, that's 1 x 3 = 3 liters.

On medium, it takes out twice as much, so that's 1 x 2 = 2 liters per day.  Over 3 days, that's 2 x 3 = 6 liters.

On high, it takes out twice as much as medium, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 liters per day. Over 5 days, that's 4 x 5 = 20 liters.

To find the total, we add up all the water: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters. 


29
"
"Okay, so they had 10 packs of balloons with 30 in each pack, so that's 10 times 30 which is 300 balloons.  Then they had 12 left over, so they must have thrown 300 minus 12, which is 288 balloons.


288 

"
"Okay, so Saanvi needs 14 mL of the first medicine.  Then she needs three times that amount of the second medicine, which is 14 times 3, or 42 mL.

That means each dose has 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL total.

If she needs 8 doses, she'll use 56 mL/dose * 8 doses = 448 mL.


448 

"
"Okay, so Ali's class can hold 120 students. John's classes are each 1/8 the size of Ali's, so each of John's classes can hold 120 / 8 = 15 students. Since John has two classes, they can hold 15 * 2 = 30 students total.  

That means both schools can hold 120 + 30 = 150 students.


150 

"
"Okay, so Stephen owes his sister $300 plus 2%, which is like an extra $6.  So he owes a total of $306.

He pays $25 each month for 11 months, so that's $25 x 11 = $275.

To find out how much he pays in the last month, we subtract what he already paid from the total: $306 - $275 = $31.


$31 

"
"Okay, so Jordan has two kids who need diaper changes. Each kid needs a new diaper 5 times a day. That's 2 kids times 5 diapers each, so that's 10 diapers total. But Jordan's wife helps out and changes half of them.  So Jordan changes 5 diapers. 


5 

"
"Okay, so the jar is like a box, right?  It's 6 inches by 6 inches at the bottom and 15 inches tall.  That means it can hold a lot of jelly beans!

Each jelly bean is pretty small, only 0.15 cubic inches.  But they don't fit perfectly, so we gotta figure out how much space they actually take up.  It says they only use about 80% of the space, so we gotta do some math.

First, we find the total space in the jar: 6 times 6 times 15 is 540 cubic inches. Then we multiply that by 80% which is 0.80, so that's 432 cubic inches for the jelly beans.

Now we divide the space the jelly beans take up by how big each jelly bean is: 432 divided by 0.15 is 2880 jelly beans!

But Tim thinks only 30% of them are red, so we multiply that: 2880 times 0.30 is 864 red jelly beans.

The real answer is 900, so Tim was off by 36. 



"
"Okay, so the bus starts with 20 people. Then 40 more get on, so that's 20 + 40 = 60 people.

Then at the next stop, 3/4 of those 40 people get on, which is 30 people (because 3/4 times 40 is 30). So now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people on the bus.

At the third stop, the number of people doubles, so there are 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus can hold 200 people, so there's room for 200 - 180 = 20 more people.


20 

"
"Okay, so Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year and it costs $2 each time. That's 3 * $2 = $6 per year.

After 5 years, she's spent 5 * $6 = $30.

Then the price goes up by 150%, which is like adding another $2 + ($2 * 1.5) = $5 to the price.

So now each visit costs $5. For the next 3 years, she spends 3 * $5 * 3 = $45.

In total, she spent $30 + $45 = $75. 



"
"Okay, so there are 10 kids from each grade that get to try the escape room, and there are 4 grades. That's 10 times 4, which is 40 kids. But the escape room can only fit 8 kids at a time. So, 40 kids divided by 8 kids per group is 5 groups.  Each group gets 45 minutes, so 5 groups times 45 minutes is 225 minutes.

225 

"
"Okay, so John made 4 tables and each one costs $20. That's 4 times 20, which is $80. He also made 2 roof frames for $10 each, so that's 2 times 10, which is $20.  To find the total, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames: $80 + $20 = $100.

Ali has to pay John $100. 

"
"Okay, so Ian's board is 40 feet long.  He wants to cut it into two pieces, and the longer piece has to be four times bigger than the shorter one.  

To figure this out, I'd think about it like this: if we split the board into five equal parts, the longer piece would take up four of those parts, and the shorter piece would take up one.

So, each ""part"" of the board is 40 feet / 5 parts = 8 feet long.

That means the longer piece is 4 parts * 8 feet/part = 32 feet long!


32 

"
"Okay, so Aiden wants 80 meatballs and he gets 16 from every pound of meat. That means he needs 80 / 16 = 5 pounds of meat.

He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, so he'll need 5 * 2 = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.


10 

"
"Okay, so Luke has five windows, and each one is 35 inches wide.  That means all the windows together are 5 times 35 inches, which is 175 inches.  But he needs twice that much fabric, so he needs 175 times 2, which is 350 inches of fabric. 


350 

"
"Okay, so the first 16 minutes cost 16 times 25 cents, which is $4.00.  Then you get a discount, so the rest of the call costs 20 minutes times 20 cents, which is another $4.00.  So the whole call costs $4.00 plus $4.00, which is $8.00.


$8.00 

"
"Okay, so it rained 2 inches on Monday.  Tuesday is supposed to get twice that amount plus one more inch.  So that's 2 times 2 which is 4, and then plus 1 more... that's 5 inches!

"
"Okay, so Carly needs enough cupcakes and brownies for everyone in her class to have two treats. That's 5 people times 2 treats each, which is 10 treats total.

She makes way more brownies than cupcakes, like three times as many, but then takes away two.  

Let's see... if we try starting with 3 cupcakes, she'd make 3 times 3 which is 9 brownies, then take away 2, so that's 7 brownies. That's 3 cupcakes plus 7 brownies, which is 10 treats!

So Carly made **3** cupcakes. 



"
"Okay, so a manicure is $35 and a pedicure is $40, so together that's $35 + $40 = $75.

But wait, there's a discount! If you get both, it's 20% off.  That means 20% of $75 is $15 off.

So now it's $75 - $15 = $60.

Oh, and she wants nail art on each finger, and that's $3 per nail. Since she has 10 fingers, that's $3 x 10 = $30 more.

Adding that to the manicure and pedicure price, it's $60 + $30 = $90.


$90 

"
"Okay, so Susan gets 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year. That's 3 times 12, which is 36 issues. Then she has one that sends 6 issues.  And the last one sends 4 times the 6 issue one, so that's 6 times 4, which is 24 issues.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 issues.


66 

"
"Okay, so Samantha has 27 paintings. Shelley has 12 more than Samantha, so Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.  Kim has 8 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.


31 

"
"Okay, so the toy started at $40. Then in December, it got 80% more expensive.  That's like adding 80% of $40, which is $32. So in December it cost $40 + $32 = $72.

But then in January, it went on sale and was 50% off.  That means it was $72 / 2 = $36 off. So the final price was $72 - $36 = $36.


$36 

"
"Okay, so Charlie makes $80 for each regular lesson.  He has four of those, so that's 4 times $80, which is $320.

For veterans, he takes $20 off his normal price, so he charges $60 an hour. He has two veteran lessons, so that's 2 times $60, which is $120.

To find out how much he makes in total, we add the money from the regular lessons and the veteran lessons: $320 + $120 = $440.


$440 

"
"Okay, so to find Sally's average score, we gotta add up all her quiz scores and then divide by how many quizzes she took.

So, 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Then, 630 divided by 9 quizzes is 70.

Her mean score is 70. 

"
"Okay, so Eve started with 20 pomelos. If she has 1/4 left, that means she has 5 pomelos now (20 / 4 = 5).  That means she gave away 15 pomelos (20 - 5 = 15).

"Okay, so Walter starts with 60 apples. He eats a bunch, 24 to be exact. That leaves him with 36. Then he gives his sister some, 9 apples.  So now he has 27 left. He sells those for $3 each, so he makes 27 times 3 dollars, which is $81. 



"
"Okay, so Regina wrote 9 books last year, and that's only three-quarters of how many she wrote this year.  To find out how many she wrote this year, we need to figure out what number 9 is three-quarters of.

If we think of it like cutting a pizza into four slices, 9 books is three of those slices.  That means one slice is 9 divided by 3, which is 3 books.

Since the whole pizza has four slices, Regina wrote 3 books per slice times 4 slices, which is 12 books this year!


12 

"
"Okay, so Michael drives 50 km every hour, and he drives for 3 whole days. That's like driving for 24 hours times 3, which is 72 hours!

So he drives 50 km each hour for 72 hours, which means he goes 50 times 72 kilometers, that's 3600 kilometers!

Now, the trip from Alaska to Texas is 6000 kilometers long.  To figure out what percentage of the trip he finished, we gotta do some dividing.

3600 kilometers (what he drove) divided by 6000 kilometers (the whole trip) is 0.6.

To turn that into a percentage, we multiply by 100, so 0.6 times 100 is 60%!

So Michael covered 60% of the distance. 



"
"Okay, so Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times that amount, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.  That means they used 6 + 30 = 36 grapes already.

Then their mom used 48 grapes for pies because she needed 12 grapes per pie and made 4 pies.

So, at the beginning, they had 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.


84 

"
"Okay, so there were 82 teachers but 13 were sick. That means 82 - 13 = 69 teachers were there.  Then they got 9 substitute teachers, so 69 + 9 = 78 teachers were at school.


78 

"
"Okay, so Bud makes mac and cheese every week.  The noodles are a dollar, the cheddar cheese is three dollars, and the gruyere cheese is double the cheddar, so that's six dollars.  That means each week he spends ten dollars total (1 + 3 + 6 = 10).

There are 52 weeks in a year, so he spends 10 times 52 dollars, which is 520 dollars.


520.00 

"
"Okay, so they gotta clean 80 classrooms, and it takes 15 minutes for each one. That's 80 times 15, which is 1200 minutes of cleaning.

They work 8 hours a day, which is 8 times 60, or 480 minutes.  Over 5 days, that's 480 times 5, which is 2400 minutes.

So, cleaning takes up 1200 out of 2400 minutes. That's half, which is 50%! 


50
"
"Okay, so Elly's got a bunch of books and new shelves.  Let's see... the middle shelves hold 10 books each, and there are two of those. So that's 10 + 10 = 20 books. The bottom shelf is like the middle ones but holds twice as many, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 books. The top shelf holds 5 less than the bottom, so that's 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Altogether, each bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.  Elly has 110 books, so she needs 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.


2 

"
"Okay, so Rose buys a bunch of eggs, right? Five dozens, which is like 60 eggs total. She pays $2.40 for each dozen, so that's 5 times $2.40, which is $12.00.

Then she sells them in groups of three for a dollar each. So she can make 60 divided by 3, which is 20 groups.  That means she makes 20 bucks!

If she made $20 and spent $12, her profit is $20 - $12, which is $8.00.


$8.00 

"
"Okay, so Skyler has a bunch of hats. Half are red, so that's 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.  That leaves 100 - 50 = 50 hats left.  Then, 3/5 of those are blue, which is (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.  That means there are 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.


20 

"
"Okay, so the jerky is normally $18, but it's on sale for $3 less.  That means it costs $15.  There are 30 sticks in a bag, so each stick costs 15 divided by 30, which is 50 cents. 


50
"
"Okay, so Audrey needs to get 70% of the questions right on both tests. That's a total of 110 questions.  She needs to get 77 questions right in total (110 x 0.70 = 77).

She already got 42 right on the first test (70 x 0.60 = 42).

So, she needs to get 35 right on the second test (77 - 42 = 35).


35 

"
"Okay, so Mary makes some strawberry cubes, and then she makes a bunch of blueberry cubes.  The blueberry cubes are 5 times the number of strawberry cubes, but she takes away 4.  If she has 116 cubes total, we gotta figure out how many are blueberry.

Let's say she makes 's' strawberry cubes. That means she makes 5s - 4 blueberry cubes.

All together, that's s + (5s - 4) = 116 cubes.

If we combine the 's' cubes, we get 6s - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides, and we get 6s = 120.

Divide both sides by 6, and we find out she made 20 strawberry cubes (s = 20).

Now, to find the blueberry cubes, we do 5 * 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 blueberry cubes.


96 

"
"Okay, so Ara plays 40 games each year and scores 21 points in each game.  She's been playing for four years, so that's 40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games total.

If she scores 21 points per game and played 160 games, she scored 21 points/game * 160 games = 3360 points!


3360 

"
"Okay, so Brendan started with 10 marbles. He dropped half, which is 5. Then he found 3 of them.  That means he lost 5 - 3 = 2 marbles. So he had 3 marbles left. But then he found out one wasn't even a marble, it was a bead! So he got rid of that one. That leaves him with 3 - 1 = 4 marbles.


4 

"
"Okay, so Jason wants to sell 15 cars.  He knows that for every 25 calls he makes, one person comes to the dealership.  Then, for every two people who come in, one buys a car.

So, he needs 15 people to buy cars, which means he needs 30 people to come to the dealership (since 15 x 2 = 30).

To get 30 people to come in, he needs to make 750 calls (because 30 x 25 = 750).


750 

"
"Okay, so they have 4 people and each person gets a flashlight, so that's 4 flashlights.  

Then there are 8 rooms, and each room gets 2 flashlights, so that's 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights.

But wait, it says they already have 4 flashlights for the people, so it's 16 + 4 = 20 flashlights total.

Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms.  Then 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles.

The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's another 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles.

So they have 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Finally, they have 36 candles + 20 flashlights = 56 candles and flashlights. 


56 

"
"Okay, so Mitchell has two bags of chips with 55 chips in each bag. That's 2 times 55, which is 110 chips total.  He's sharing with 4 other people, so there are 5 people eating. If they split the chips evenly, each person gets 110 divided by 5, which is 22 chips.


22 

"
"Okay, so John takes 5 minutes for the first side.  Then the next two sides take twice as long, so that's 10 minutes each. That's 20 minutes already. The last two sides are half the time of the first, so they each take 2.5 minutes.  So, 2.5 plus 2.5 is 5 minutes.  

Adding it all up: 5 + 20 + 5 = 30 minutes. 



"
"Okay, so there are 20 helmets.  He saw half as many robots, so that's 20 / 2 = 10 robots.  There were twice as many footballs as helmets, so there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 10 robots + 20 helmets + 40 footballs = 70 items.


70 

"
"Okay, so Tim works for 6 hours a day, and each call takes 15 minutes.  That means he can do 6 times 60 minutes, which is 360 minutes of calls each day.  Then we divide that by 15 minutes per call, and he does 24 calls a day.  Since he works 5 days a week, he does 24 times 5, which is 120 calls a week.


120 

"
"Okay, so the old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, and she's doing 6 paintings, so that's 7 times 6 which is 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes per painting, and she's still doing 6 paintings, so that's 12 times 6 which is 72 minutes.

To find out how much longer the new varnish takes, we subtract the old time from the new time: 72 minus 42 equals 30.


30 

"
"Okay, so Crista has a lot of plants! Let's see... 

Four of them need half a cup each, so that's 4 times 0.5 which is 2 cups. Then 8 plants need a whole cup each, so that's 8 cups.  The rest of her plants, which is 8 of them, need a quarter cup each. So that's 8 times 0.25, which is 2 cups.

If we add all that up, 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups!

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day. 



"
"Okay, so Phineas has to go 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.  He hops fast, 20 yards every minute, so that'll take him 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.  Swimming is slower, 10 yards a minute, so that's 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.  

To get the total time, we add those together: 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.


15 

"
"Okay, so Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box has 8.  That means he needs 56 divided by 8 which is 7 boxes.  If each box costs $2.00, then 7 boxes will cost 7 times $2.00 which is $14.00. 


$14.00
"
"Okay, so the main phone is $20.  The other phones are half that price, which is $10 each. Since there are four extra phones, that's $10 x 4 = $40.  

So the whole plan costs $20 + $40 = $60.


$60 

"
"Okay, so Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts a day, and that's 10 times 12, which is 120 doughnuts.  He sells each one for $2, so he makes 120 times 2, which is $240 every day.

June has 30 days, so he makes $240 times 30, which is $7200 for the whole month.


$7200 

"
"Okay, so Jade takes a bunch of pics, right? 210 of them!  She puts 7 in each group and uploads 6 groups every day.  

Let's see... 7 times 6 is 42 pics a day.  So she uploads 42 pics each day.

If she has 210 pics and uploads 42 each day, it'll take her 5 days. 



"
"Okay, so Alicia takes 5 blouses, 2 pants, and 1 skirt to the dry cleaners every week.

Blouses cost $5 each, so that's 5 * $5 = $25.

Pants are $8 each, so 2 pants cost 2 * $8 = $16.

The skirt is $6.

So, each week she spends $25 + $16 + $6 = $47 on dry cleaning.

Over 5 weeks, that's $47 * 5 = $235. 


$235.00
"
"Okay, so John talks super fast now!  He can say 375 words every minute.  If he has to say 4500 words, that's like saying 4500 divided by 375, which is 12 minutes. 


12 

"
"Okay, so Conor saw 50 people on the first day. Then 20 more people came the next day, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, there were twice as many people as the day before, so that's 70 * 2 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week, he saw 60 people each day, and there are 4 more days, so that's 60 * 4 = 240 people.

To find the total, we add up all the people Conor saw: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 people. 


500
"
"Okay, so Garrett's popcorn is popping like crazy!

First, he gets 20 kernels popping. Then, it goes triple that, so that's 20 times 3, which is 60 more.  

Next, it's four times the first amount, so 20 times 4 is 80.

Then it slows down to half of the last amount, so 80 divided by 2 is 40.

Finally, even after he takes it off the heat, 40 divided by 4, or 10 more pop.

Let's add it all up: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 pieces of popcorn! 


210
"
"Okay, so Tim needs enough lemons for 4 gallons of regular lemonade, and each gallon needs 1 cup of lemon juice.  He gets 1 cup of juice from 6 lemons, so that's 4 gallons * 6 lemons/gallon = 24 lemons.

Then his friend wants an extra gallon that's extra tart, so that's like needing twice the lemon juice, or 2 cups. That means he needs 2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons for that one.

In total, he needs 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons. 


36
"
"Okay, so there are 3 German Shepherds that eat 5 kilograms of food each, so that's 3 times 5 which is 15 kilograms. Then there are 2 Bulldogs that eat 3 kilograms each, so that's 2 times 3 which is 6 kilograms.  

That means they eat a total of 15 plus 6, which is 21 kilograms every day.  

In a week, that's 21 times 7, which equals 147 kilograms.


147 

"
"Okay, so there are 10 animals with 2 legs each, that's 10 times 2 which equals 20 legs. Then there are 15 animals with 4 legs each, so that's 15 times 4 which is 60 legs.  If we add those together, 20 plus 60, we get 80 legs in total.


80 

"
"Okay, so there are 4 blue blocks and twice that many yellow blocks, which is 4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks.  That means there are 4 + 8 = 12 blue and yellow blocks altogether.

If there are 32 blocks total, then there must be 32 - 12 = 20 red blocks.


20 

"
"Okay, so Elvis drives west for 5 hours at 18 miles per hour, that's 5 times 18 which is 90 miles. Then he drives east for 8 hours at 18 miles per hour, so that's 8 times 18 which is 144 miles.  Since he's driving east now, he's going back towards his house.  To find out how far he is from home, we subtract the distance he drove west from the distance he drove east: 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

So Elvis is 54 miles from his house. 



"
"Okay, so the boat starts at $9000.  The first year it loses 30%, which is like 30 out of every 100 dollars.  So, it loses $2700 that year ($9000 x 0.30 = $2700). That means it's worth $6300 after the first year ($9000 - $2700 = $6300).

The second year it loses another 30%, so it loses $1890 ($6300 x 0.30 = $1890). Now it's worth $4410 ($6300 - $1890 = $4410).

The third year it loses 20%, which is $882 ($4410 x 0.20 = $882).  That leaves it worth $3528 ($4410 - $882 = $3528).


$3528
"
"Okay, so there are 232 candies in total.  There are 54 red ones, and twice that many orange, so that's 54 x 2 = 108 orange candies. There are half as many yellow as red, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

That means there are 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 red, orange, and yellow candies.

If we take that number away from the total, we get 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies! 


43
"
"Okay, so Helen stayed in the hotel for 3 nights and each night cost $80. That means the hotel cost 3 * $80 = $240.

Each bus ride cost 10% of the hotel price, so each ride was $80 * 0.10 = $8.

She took the bus 7 times, so that's 7 * $8 = $56.

To find the total cost, we add the hotel and bus costs: $240 + $56 = $296.


$296
"
"Okay, so Mazie starts with 52 marbles. Dallas ends up with 21, but he lost 4, so he must have had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles from Mazie.  That means Darla got the rest, which is 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.


27 

"
"Okay, so they need two adult tickets which cost $12 each, so that's 2 times 12, which is 24 bucks. Then there's one kid's ticket for $8.  And popcorn is $3 each, and they got two of those, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 bucks.  

Let's add it all up: 24 + 8 + 6 = 38 dollars.


38 

"
"Okay, so John's car is super heavy, right? It weighs 1200 pounds, and then there's all that extra stuff: 250 pounds of luggage and two kids who each weigh 75 pounds.  That's a lot!

So, all together, that's 1200 + 250 + 75 + 75 = 1600 pounds.

To move it, he needs to push with 1% of that weight.  So, 1600 times 0.01 (which is the same as dividing by 100) is 16 pounds.


16 

"
"Okay, so James needs enough streamer to go all the way around his fence.  That means we need to add up all the sides of the fence. It's like a rectangle, so it has two long sides and two short sides.

The long sides are 20 feet each, and there are two of them, so that's 20 + 20 = 40 feet.

The short sides are 15 feet each, and there are two of them, so that's 15 + 15 = 30 feet.

Now we add the long sides and the short sides together: 40 + 30 = 70 feet.


70 

"
"Okay, so Mia is 40 and her older sister Emma is 16 years older. That means Emma is 56.  To find the average, you add their ages together (40 + 56 = 96) and then divide by 2 because there are two of them. 96 divided by 2 is 48. 


48
"
"Okay, so they found a bunch of seashells: 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells total. But some were cracked, 67 of them.  So, to find out how many were good, we do 732 - 67 = 665.

They found 665 good seashells. 



"
"Okay, so Avery needs a plate setting for each person, and she's having 12 people over.  Each setting has a big plate, a small plate, and a bowl. The big plates are $6 each, the bowls are $5, and the small plates are $4.

So, one setting costs $6 + $5 + $4 = $15.

Since she needs 12 settings, it'll cost $15 x 12 = $180.00 


$180.00
"
"Okay, so Steve took 10 hours.  Half of that is 5 hours.  Anna took 2 more hours than that, so it took her 7 hours. 


7
"
"Okay, so Dexter has 5 pigs and they each eat 4 pounds of feed twice a day. That's 8 pounds a day per pig!  Since he has 5 pigs, that's 40 pounds of feed they eat every day.

In a week, that's 40 pounds a day times 7 days, so they eat 280 pounds of feed in a week.

If he started with 300 pounds, he'd have 20 pounds left over. 


20 

"
"Okay, so John needs enough hot dogs for 20 people, and they each want 2 hot dogs. That's 20 times 2, which is 40 hot dogs.  But he already has 4, so he needs to buy 36 more.

Hot dog packs have 6 hot dogs, so he needs to buy 36 divided by 6, which is 6 packs.

Each pack costs $2, so 6 packs will cost 6 times 2, which is $12.


$12 

"
"Okay, so Frances makes $40 from the cupcakes because 20 times 2 is 40.  She makes another $40 from the cookies because 40 times 1 is 40.  That means she made a total of $80.  The trays cost her $20 because 5 times 4 is 20.  If she made $80 and spent $20, she has $60 left.


$60 

"
"Okay, so there are 5 kids at first. Then on the next street, each kid brings a friend, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 kids.  Then on the third street, each kid brings TWO more friends, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 kids. But then the first 5 kids get tired and leave, so we take away 5. That means there are 15 kids left.


15 

"
"Okay, so Mamou started with 1360 meals.  She gave out 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals.  

That means she has 1360 - 142 = 1218 meals left.


1218 

"
"Okay, so he's got a quarter, which is 25 cents. Then he has two nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents, so that's 10 cents.  And finally, he has 7 dimes, and each dime is 10 cents, so that's 70 cents.

If you add it all up, 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents. 


105
"
"Okay, so there are two brothers. One is 12, and the other is twice that age, so he's 12 x 2 = 24 years old.  There are three sisters, and they're all 16. So that's 16 x 3 = 48 years for all the sisters.

To find the total age, we add up everyone: 12 + 24 + 48 = 84 years old. 


84
"
"Okay, so Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 30 minutes total.  She does that every day.  Then she does yoga for an hour, which is 60 minutes, five days a week.

So, in a week, she does 30 minutes a day times 7 days, which is 210 minutes of meditation. Then she does 60 minutes a day times 5 days, which is 300 minutes of yoga.

That means she does 210 + 300 = 510 minutes of practice each week.

Over 4 weeks, that's 510 times 4, which is 2040 minutes.


2040 

"
"Okay, so Octavia's quilt is made of different sized shirts.  Let's see...

* The small shirts are 3 feet by 3 feet, so each one is 3 times 3 which is 9 square feet.
* She's using 11 small shirts, so that's 11 times 9 which is 99 square feet.
* Medium shirts are 4 feet by 4 feet, so they're 16 square feet each.
* She has 8 medium shirts, so that's 8 times 16 which is 128 square feet.
* Large shirts are 6 feet by 6 feet, so they're 36 square feet each.
* She's using 6 large shirts, so that's 6 times 36 which is 216 square feet.

Now to add it all up: 99 + 128 + 216 = 443 square feet.

Wow, that's a big quilt! 



"
"Okay, so a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is 3 times 12, or 36 seeds. A big sunflower has 50% more than that, so that's like half of 36 more seeds, which is 18.  So the big sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.  

Together they have 36 + 54 = 90 seeds!


90 

"
"Okay, so George has 18 pens. Timothy has three times that amount, which is 18 x 3 = 54 pens. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so she has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.


27 

"
"Okay, so Anne is twice as tall as Albert, who is 36 inches. That means Anne is 36 x 2 = 72 inches tall.

Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so she's 72 - 2 = 70 inches tall now.

But she grew 3 inches over the summer, so before summer she was 70 - 3 = 67 inches tall.


67 

"
"Okay, so they make 5000 chocolate bars a day and sell each one for $2. That means they make 5000 * $2 = $10000 every day!

If they do that for a week, they make $10000 * 7 = $70000.

Over two weeks, they'd make $70000 * 2 = $140000.


$140000 

"
"Okay, so Jake gets a deal on the T-shirts, which is cool.  One shirt is $8, and the other is half off, so that's $8 / 2 = $4.  So the shirts cost $8 + $4 = $12 total.

The shoes are $40, but they're 40% off, so that's $40 * 0.40 = $16 off. That means the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Adding the shirts and shoes, Jake spends $12 + $24 = $36 at the store.


$36 

"
"Okay, so Ryan gets $6 every week for doing his chores, and he did them for 3 weeks, so he made $6 x 3 = $18. Then he spent $1.25 on each of his 3 friends plus himself, so that's $1.25 x 4 = $5.00 on ice cream.  That means he has $18 - $5 = $13 left.  Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.


2 

"
"Okay, so Ellen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a frame, so that's $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani spent $30 on sunglasses and $100 on each of two bathrobes, so that's $30 + ($100 x 2) = $30 + $200 = $230.

To find out how much they spent together, we add Ellen's total and Lani's total: $105 + $230 = $335.


$335

"Okay, so Tim uses 2 pounds of passion fruit that cost $6 each, so that's 2 * $6 = $12.

Then he uses 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 a pound, so that's 1.5 * $8 = $12.

He also needs 2 pounds of honey at $10 a pound, which is 2 * $10 = $20.

To make one jar, it costs him $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

He sells each jar for $50, so he makes $50 - $44 = $6 profit on each jar.

If he sells 10 jars, he makes $6 * 10 = $60 profit. 


$60
"
"Okay, so let's see...

* Quarters are worth 25 cents each, so 32 quarters is 32 times 25 cents, which is $8.00.
* Dimes are 10 cents, so 95 dimes is 95 times 10 cents, which is $9.50.
* Nickels are 5 cents, so 120 nickels is 120 times 5 cents, which is $6.00.
* Pennies are 1 cent each, so 750 pennies is 750 times 1 cent, which is $7.50.

Now we add all that up: $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00


$31.00
"
"Okay, so Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, and then $7.50 for each movie ticket, so that's $7.50 x 2 = $15.00 for the tickets.  Then she spent another $8.50 on a bracelet.  That means she spent a total of $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00.

If her parents gave her $40.00, she has $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00 left.


$13.00
"
"Okay, so Josh works 5 days a week.  He fixes 3 cars each day, so that's 5 times 3, which is 15 cars a week.

He makes $4 for each car, so he makes 15 times 4, which is $60 each week.

Over two weeks, he'd make $60 times 2, which is $120.


$120 

"
"Okay, let's see... Randy starts with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies, so that's 18 cookies total. He eats one of each kind for a snack, so that's 3 cookies gone. Then he eats 2 more oatmeal cookies, so now he's down to 14. He gives away 2 sugar cookies, leaving him with 12. Finally, he bakes 4 of each kind, which is 12 more cookies!  That means he has 12 + 12 = 24 cookies.


24 

"
"Okay, so Matthew has 12 toy soldiers.  Half of them is 6, right?  If he sells those for $5 each, that's 6 times 5, which is $30. The other 6 he sells for $7 each, so that's 6 times 7, which is $42.  If you add those together, he makes $30 + $42 = $72.


72 

"
"Okay, so the dog digs a ton of holes! 6 holes a day for 14 days is a lot of digging - that's 84 holes!  

Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 more each night, so he's really only filling 3 holes each day (9 - 6 = 3).

To fill all 84 holes, it'll take him 28 days (84 / 3 = 28).

That's 4 weeks! 



"
"Okay, so Norman High has 4000 kids. Butler High has 3/4 of that, which is like 3 out of 4 groups of 1000 kids.  So Butler has 3 groups of 1000, which is 3000 kids.  That means Norman has 1000 more kids than Butler.


1000 

"
"Okay, so they made a bunch of cookies! Let's see... they made 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies.  That's 2595 + 3075 = 5670 cookies.

If they made 7995 cookies total, then they made 7995 - 5670 = 2325 chocolate chip cookies.


2325 

"
"Okay, so Igor messed up a bit! Let's see...

Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, but Igor only got half, so that's 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

He was supposed to get 14 Petri dishes, but he got 2 extra, so that's 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

Igor got the right number of beakers, which was 7.

In total, Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 + 7 + 14 = 37 things.

But Igor only put 29 things on the bench.

That means he lost 37 - 29 = 8 things.

Since he got the right number of beakers, he must have lost some of the test tubes or Petri dishes.  

Hmm... 8 lost items and he only got 8 test tubes... he must have lost all of the test tubes!

So Igor lost 0 beakers.

"
"Okay, so James has 4 tables and each table needs 4 legs. That's 4 times 4, which is 16 legs total.  Each leg needs 2 screws, so he needs 16 times 2, which is 32 screws. He starts with 40 screws, so he'll have 40 minus 32 screws left over. That's 8 screws! 


8
"
"Okay, so there are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice that amount, so it has 10 * 2 = 20 eggs.  To find the total, we add the eggs from both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.


30 

"
"Okay, so Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than that, so she raised $430 + $320 = $750.  Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total, we add up what everyone raised: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.



"
"Okay, so Vanessa ran 4 miles. Aaron ran half that, which is 2 miles.  Aaron finished in 16 minutes, so he ran each mile in 8 minutes (16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile). Vanessa is slower, though. She takes twice as long as Aaron to run a mile, so she takes 16 minutes per mile. Since she ran 4 miles, it took her 64 minutes (16 minutes per mile * 4 miles = 64 minutes).


64 

"
"Okay, so he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there's 200 feet of dock. That means he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line total.  But he already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 more feet of line.


594 

"
"Okay, so they get 6 groups of people each night, right? And each group spends $15 on food and drinks.  That means they make 6 times $15, which is $90 each night.

Since they're open two nights a week, they make $90 times 2, which is $180 a week.


$180 

"
"Okay, so the guy bought 50 watermelons for $80. He made a 25% profit, which means he earned an extra $20 (cause 25% of 80 is 20).

So, he sold all the watermelons for $100 in total.  To find out how much each one cost, we divide the total money he made by the number of watermelons: $100 / 50 = $2.

Each watermelon was sold for $2. 



"
"Okay, so Dora is gonna be 12 in three years, so right now she's 9.  James is twice her age, so he's 18.  That means John had James when he was 19, so he's 37 now.  His youngest son was born when John was 32, so he's 5 now. In three years, he'll be 8. 


8
"
"Okay, so Ana peels oranges faster than Jane.  If they both peel for a whole hour, Ana will peel more oranges.

Let's see... there are 60 minutes in an hour. Ana peels one orange every 3 minutes, so she'll peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels one orange every 4 minutes, so she'll peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

That means Ana will peel 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"
"Okay, so the radiator normally costs $400, but he got a sweet deal at the junk shop for 80% off.  That means he saved $400 x 0.80 = $320!

So the radiator only cost him $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic charged $50 an hour and it took 3 hours, so that's $50 x 3 = $150.

To find the total, we add the radiator price and the mechanic cost: $80 + $150 = $230.


$230 

"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they're either chickens or cows.  Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4.  All together, the animals have 70 legs.  

To figure out how many chickens there are, we gotta think about it like this:

* If all 20 animals were chickens, they'd have 40 legs (20 x 2 = 40).
* That means some of them gotta be cows to make up the extra 30 legs (70 - 40 = 30).

Since each cow has 2 extra legs compared to a chicken, we need 15 cows to get those extra 30 legs (30 / 2 = 15).

If there are 15 cows, there must be 5 chickens (20 - 15 = 5).


So the answer is 5. 

"
"Okay, so they have 7 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices. That's 7 times 8, which is 56 slices in total.  There are 4 people sharing, so they each get 56 divided by 4, which is 14 slices.
