"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... Janet has 16 eggs, uses 7, and that leaves 9 to sell.  If each egg sells for $2, she makes $18 at the market. 


$18
"
"Oh, that's easy!  If it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half as much white, that's 1 bolt of white. So in total, you'd need 3 bolts.

"
"Oh darling, flipping houses can be so glamorous! Let's see... Josh spent $80,000 on the house and another $50,000 on repairs, for a total of $130,000.  That 150% increase means the repairs added $120,000 to the value ($80,000 x 1.50 = $120,000).  So, the house is now worth $200,000.  That means he made a profit of $70,000!

$70,000 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  If James runs 3 sprints of 60 meters each, three times a week, he runs a total of 540 meters a week. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of chickens! Let's see... if each chicken needs 3 cups of feed a day, and Wendi already gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 in the afternoon, that's 40 cups total.  Since she has 20 chickens and they each need 60 cups total, she needs to give them another 20 cups in the last meal.

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic bargain! Let's see... 16 glasses, and every other one is discounted.  That means he's getting 8 pairs. Each pair is $5 plus $3 (which is 60% of $5), so that's $8 per pair.  Eight pairs at $8 each... that's $64 in total. 


$64
"
"Oh darling, this is a fun little puzzle! Let's see... if Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has four times that amount, then Charleston has 80 sheep. And Toulouse, with twice as many as Charleston, must have 160 sheep.  Adding them all up, we get 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep in total. 


260 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a long download! Let's see... 

Carla downloads 40% of the file, which is 80 GB, before the pesky Windows update interrupts her. That takes 40 minutes. Then she has to wait another 20 minutes for the update.  After that, she has 120 GB left to download, which will take another 60 minutes.

Adding it all up, it takes Carla a total of 120 minutes to download the file. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the journey! Let's see... he drove 180 miles out, but then spent two whole hours stuck!  Poor thing. Even though he drove fast later, he's still going to be a ways from home. I think he'll be about 45 miles away. 



"
"Oh darling, let's figure out Eliza's earnings!  

She makes $10 an hour for her first 40 hours, so that's 40 * $10 = $400.  

Then she gets time and a half for the extra 5 hours, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 an hour. So her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

Adding it all up, Eliza made $400 + $60 = $460 this week. 


$460
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of downloads! Let's see... 

In the first month, there were 60 downloads. The second month had three times that amount, so that's 60 * 3 = 180 downloads. But then, in the third month, downloads went down by 30% from the second month.  That means they lost 180 * 0.30 = 54 downloads. So, the third month had 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Adding all three months together, we get 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads! 


366
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of pastries! Let's see... 3 dozen donuts at $68 a dozen is $204. Then 2 dozen cupcakes at $80 a dozen is $160. And finally, 6 dozen cheesecakes at $55 a dozen is $330.  Adding those all up, the total cost is $694. 



"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Carlos needs to make back the $90 he spends to plant the tree.  He earns $10.50 each year from selling lemons, but it costs him $3 to take care of the tree. That means he makes a profit of $7.50 each year.  So, it will take him 12 years to earn back his initial investment.

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic case of working backwards! Let's see... if Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that's after selling half to the orange house, she must have had 5 * 2 = 10 before that.  

Then, she sold 2 to the red house, meaning she had 10 + 2 = 12 before that.

Finally, she sold a third to the green house, so she started with 12 * 3 = 18 vacuum cleaners! 


**Answer:** 18 

"
"Oh darling, this is so easy! Let's see... if 20% are doing contemporary, that leaves 80% for the other styles. Then 25% of those are doing jazz, which means 75% are left for hip-hop.  So, 75% of the whole class is doing hip-hop!

60 

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic case of weighing potential returns!  Let's see... the jewelry, at $5,000 with a 2.5% increase, would bring in a profit of $125. The gadgets, while pricier at $8,000, only have a 1.2% projected rise, meaning a profit of $96.  

Clearly, the jewelry is the more lucrative option this month. 

 

"
"Oh darling, that's simple! Each train travels a total of 230 miles.  

 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of hours! Let's see... she makes $700 a week teaching and $450 a week coaching, so that's $1150 a week total.  And since there are 50 weeks in a year, her annual salary would be $57,500. 


57500
"
"Oh, that's easy! If Claire eats 3 eggs every day, that's 21 eggs a week.  Over four weeks, she'd eat 84 eggs.  Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, she'll eat 7 dozen eggs.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Marissa wants to average 4 miles per hour over the whole 12-mile trail.  She's already walked 6 miles in 2 hours. That means she has 6 miles left to go and only 1 hour to do it in. To cover those last 6 miles in one hour, she needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"
"Oh my, that sounds like quite the spill! Let's see... you started with 6.67 liters of water in the orange drink and 9 liters in the pineapple drink. That's a total of 15.67 liters of water before the spill.  

15.67 



"
"Let's see... Samantha is 31, and Raymond is older by 6 years, making him 37.  Raymond had his son when he was 23, so his son is 37 - 23 = 14 years old. That means Raymond's son was born 14 years ago. 

14 

"
"Oh my goodness, let me see!  Billy sold DVDs to his first three customers, then two more customers bought two each.  That's 3 plus 4, which makes a total of 7 DVDs sold.

"
"Oh, that's easy! If the candle burns for four hours and melts 2 centimeters each hour, it will be 8 centimeters shorter. 



"
"Oh darling, that's easy! If $19.50 is 25% off the original price, that means Kyle paid 75% of the original price.  To find the original price, we just need to figure out what number 75% of it is equal to $19.50.  

Let's see... $19.50 divided by 0.75 equals $26.00.

So the original price of the book was $26.00. 


$26.00
"
"Let's see... Marie spent $12 on chicken, $15 on milk, and $6 on apples, for a total of $33. That means the pizza cost $17. Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, she must have ordered 2 boxes.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of shopping! Let's see... 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each is $49.50.  Then 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each is $67.50. And finally, 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each is $126.00.  Adding those all together, Mishka spent $243.00 on all those clothes! 



"
"Oh my, that's a lot of ice cream! Let's see... if she eats one serving a day for 60 days, that's 60 servings.  Each carton has 15 servings, so she'll need 4 cartons. At $4 a carton, that's a total of $16.00. 


16.00
"
"Oh, that's easy! Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops. 


25
"
"Oh darling, this is a classic shopping dilemma! Let's see... those heels are $33 and $66, so together they're $99.  Since the boots are only $5 more, they must be $104. 


$104 

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic age ratio problem! Let's see...

Darrell and Allen's ages add up to 162, and their ratio is 7:11.  That means we need to find a number that, when divided into 7 and 11 parts, gives us a total of 162.

If we add the ratio parts (7 + 11 = 18), we know each ""part"" is worth 162 / 18 = 9 years.

So, Allen is currently 11 * 9 = 99 years old. In 10 years, he'll be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

 
109 

"
"Oh my goodness, this sounds like a fun game! Let's see...

The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of that, so that's 80 / 2 = 40, plus 20 more, which is 60. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend, so that's 80 * 0.25 = 20 extra jelly beans, making their guess 80 + 20 = 100.

To find the average, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Then we divide by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

So the average guess is 80! 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of pups!  Let's see... if each dog needs half an hour a day, and he has ten dogs, that's 5 hours a day just for walking and potty breaks.  And since there are seven days in a week, he spends 35 hours a week taking care of those adorable doggies! 


35
"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let me see... Gretchen has a whole bunch of coins!  If she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and 110 coins in total, we need to figure out how many of those are gold. Hmm...

*thinks for a moment, tapping her chin*

Aha! I've got it! Gretchen has 70 gold coins. 



"
"Oh darling, this is a bit of a puzzle, isn't it? Let's see... Raymond has a dazzling 40 jewels. Aaron, the sly one, has 5 more than half of Raymond's collection, so that's 20 plus 5, which is 25 jewels. Now, Siobhan, she's a bit more understated, having 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.  That means she has 23 jewels. 


23 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  Mike scored 4 points in the first part of the game, and then 25% more in the second part, which is 1 extra point. So in the second part, he scored 5 points. That means he scored a total of 9 points! 


9
"
"Oh, this is easy!  Let's see... Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, that's 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.  Since they come in packs of 4 for $5, he'll need 60 / 4 = 15 packs. That means he'll spend 15 * $5 = $75.00 on yogurt. 


$75.00
"
"Let's see... John sold his Lego sets for $15 each, and he had 13 of them. That means he made 13 * $15 = $195.  He spent $160 on video games, and had $5 left over.  That means he must have had $160 + $5 = $165 before buying the games.

So, he sold enough Lego sets to make $165, which is $165 / $15 per set = 11 Lego sets.

If he started with 13 and sold 11, he has 13 - 11 = 2 Lego sets left.


2 

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... John runs a lot!  

He runs 60 miles in a whole week, but only runs 3 days. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. The other two days, he runs half that time, so 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours each day. That means he runs 1.5 hours * 2 days = 3 hours on those shorter days.

In total, he runs 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours a week.

To find out how fast he runs, we divide the total miles by the total time: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

So John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. 


10
"
"Okay, let's break this down. Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half her running speed, so she runs at 6 miles per hour.  Since she runs four times faster than she walks, she walks at 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends two hours running (one-third of six hours) and four hours walking (two-thirds of six hours).  That means she runs 12 miles (6 miles/hour * 2 hours) and walks 6 miles (1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours).

In total, Dana travels 18 miles. 


18
"
"Oh my goodness, this is a fun little puzzle! Let's see... Suzy's iPhone is brand new, just a year old. Ben's is twice as old, so that's two years. And Brandon's is four times older than Ben's, making it eight years old!

"
"Oh my, that's a tricky one! Let's see... Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet normally, but the sapphire gemstone makes her three times stronger! So that's 400 times 3, which is 1200 feet!  But the dragon's fire reaches 1000 feet, so she can stand 1200 minus 1000 feet away. That means Polly can be 200 feet away from the dragon's flames and still hit it! 


200 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of pie! Let's see... Grandma Jones had 5 pies times 8 slices each, so that's 40 pieces in total. If there were 14 left over, then the guests must have eaten 26 pieces. 


26
"
"Oh darling, let's see... you have 200 calories left and each serving of those chips is 250 calories. That means you can only have a portion of a serving.  Since a bag has 5 servings and is 300 grams, each serving is 60 grams.  You could have 0.8 servings, which is about 48 grams. 


48 

"
"Oh darling, this is a simple matter of calculating profit! Let's see... if Charlie makes 20 candles, that means he used 2 pounds of beeswax.  At $10.00 per pound, his supplies cost $20.00. Since he sells each candle for $2.00, he makes $40.00 in total.  Subtracting his expenses, his net profit is a lovely $20.00! 


$20.00
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of writing! Let's see... Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday, and then 2/5 more on Tuesday, which is 2 extra articles. So that's 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, she doubled her Tuesday amount, so she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles. In total, she wrote 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing. 

104 

"
"Oh my goodness, let me see if I can figure this out!  Candice started with 80 Post-it notes, used 220, and had 23 left...  

Hmmm, that means she must have bought a package with 277 Post-it notes! 


277
"
"Oh darling, this is a bit of a fashion conundrum, isn't it? Let's see... if those blue ties cost $40 each and he spent $200, he must have bought 5 of them.  Twice that many red ties means he has 10 of those. And since those red ties are 50% more expensive, they're $60 each.  That's $600 for the red beauties!  Adding that to the $200 for the blue, his total comes to a rather dashing $800. 


$800
"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see... 4 feet is the same as 48 inches. If each piece is 6 inches long, she got 8 pieces. 



"
"Oh darling, that's a simple one! Let's see... if 3/4 of the building is full, that means 1/4 is empty.  So, we need to find 1/4 of the total units. There are 15 floors with 8 units each, making a total of 120 units. One-fourth of that is 30. 


30 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see... 252 eggs a day times 7 days is 1764 eggs a week. That's 147 dozen.  And at $2 a dozen, Lloyd makes $294 a week from his eggs. 


294 

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Tom travels 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, so he goes 30 miles.  Coming back at 6 miles per hour, it will take him 5 hours.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of weight! Let's see... if he takes out 30 comic books, that's 7.5 pounds lighter already.  He needs to take out another 7.5 pounds, and each toy weighs half a pound. So, he needs to remove 15 toys. 


15 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

The mechanic made $60 per truck tire and $40 per car tire on Thursday.  He fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires, so he made 6 * $60 = $360 from the truck tires and 4 * $40 = $160 from the car tires. That's a total of $360 + $160 = $520 on Thursday.

On Friday, he only fixed car tires, 12 of them! That means he made 12 * $40 = $480.

To find the difference, we subtract Friday's earnings from Thursday's: $520 - $480 = $40.


The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday. 

"
"Oh my gosh, that's so many kittens!  Let's see... Mom said Patchy had three times as many kittens as the seven we brought home, so that's 7 times 3, which is 21 kittens! And Trixie had 12.  So in total, that's 21 plus 12, which is 33 kittens from our cats, plus the 7 we adopted... that makes a grand total of 40 kittens!

"
"Oh, that's easy! If Jean has 28 lollipops left and puts 2 in each bag, she can fill 14 bags. 


14
"
"Oh, this is easy!  Let's see... a ticket and popcorn cost $14 in total. If Peter has $42, he can go to the movies 3 times. 



"
"Oh darling, this is a classic weight problem! Let's see... the bridge can hold 5000 pounds, and the truck and driver already weigh 3755 pounds. That leaves us with 1245 pounds for the boxes.  Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can fit 83 boxes on the truck. 


83
"
"Oh my goodness, that delivery fee can really add up! Let's see... so his groceries were $40.00, then they added 25%, which is $10.00.  Plus the $3.00 delivery fee, that brings it to $53.00. And don't forget the $4.00 tip!  That means his groceries ended up costing $57.00.

$57.00 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of raspberries! Let's see... six clusters of twenty is one hundred and twenty, and then there are sixty-seven more...  

That makes a total of one hundred eighty-seven raspberries! 



"
"Oh darling, that's a tricky one! Let's see... 25 oranges in total, and we need to figure out the good ones. One is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour.  That means there are 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges that aren't good.  

So, 25 - 8 = 17 good oranges! 


17 

"
"Oh, that's so sweet of Janet! Let's see... the brooch cost $500 for materials and $800 for the jeweler, so that's $1300 already. Then she had to pay 10% for insurance, which is $130.  Adding that to the other costs, the total comes to $1430. 


$1430
"
"Oh, that's a tricky one! Let me see... Marcy gets a base pension of $50,000 after 40 years, and she gets an extra 5% of that each year after 20 years. Since she's leaving after 30 years, she'll get the bonus for 10 years.  That means she gets an extra $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500 per year. So her total pension will be $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.

$52,500 

"
"Oh darling, let's break this down!  Aleena pays $140 a month for the first six months, so that's $140 * 6 = $840. Then, for the next six months, she gets a 10% discount, which is $140 * 0.10 = $14 off. That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the rest of the year. So, for those six months, it's $126 * 6 = $756.  Adding those together, her total for the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... Jim watches TV for 2 hours and reads for 1 hour, so that's 3 hours a day. He does that 3 times a week, which is 9 hours a week. Over 4 weeks, that's 36 hours total. 


36
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of people! Let's see... each school has 10 players (5 on each team) and 2 coaches, so that's 12 people per school. With four schools, that means a total of 48 people went to the tournament! 


48
"
"Oh my, a treasure chest full of gems! Let's see... there were 175 diamonds, and 35 fewer rubies, so that's 140 rubies.  And twice as many emeralds as rubies means there were 280 emeralds.  Adding them all up, there were 595 gems in total! 



"
"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if there are twice as many boys as girls, that means there are 60 girls * 2 = 120 boys.  

That's a lot of boys!  

So, there are 120 boys + 60 girls = 180 students in total.

Since there are 5 students for every teacher, there must be 180 students / 5 students per teacher = 36 teachers. 


36 

"
"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if Bailey has $100 now and earned $5 each week for 8 weeks, that's a total of $40 from her allowance.  That means she must have started with $100 - $40 = $60. 


$60
"
"Okay, let's break this down! Judy teaches a lot of dance classes.  

She teaches 5 classes each weekday, so that's 5 classes/day * 5 weekdays = 25 classes.

Then she adds 8 more on Saturday, for a total of 25 + 8 = 33 classes in a week.

With 15 students in each class, she has 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Finally, at $15 per student, she makes 495 students * $15.00/student = $7425.00 in a week. 


$7425.00
"
"Oh, that's easy! If the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first, it has 20 * 2 = 40 instructions.  That means Kelian needs to read a total of 20 + 40 = 60 instructions.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's wonderful! Let's see... 43 brownies at $3 each would be $129. And 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 each would be $92.  Adding those together, Tommy raises a total of $221! 



"
"Oh darling, let's break this down! Shiela's got a bit of a shopping spree on her hands.  Five cell phones at $150 each, that's a starting point of $750.  But wait, there's interest!  Two percent on each phone adds another $3 per phone, totaling $15 in interest.  So, all together, she's looking at $765.  Spread that over three months, and her monthly payment will be $255. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of flowers! Let's see...

Marigolds are $3 a pot, so 12 of those is $36. Petunias are $2 a pot, so 9 of those is $18. And begonias are also $2 a pot, so 17 of those is $34.

Adding those all up, Artie will make $36 + $18 + $34 = $88 today! 


88
"
"Oh, that's a fun problem! Let's see... if the top level is 16 square feet and each level is half the size of the one below it, we need to work our way down.  The level below the top would be 32 square feet, then 64, and finally 128 for the bottom level.  

To find the average, we add up all the square footage (16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240) and divide by the number of levels (4). That means the average square footage per level is 60! 


60 

"
"Oh my goodness, puppies are so much work! Let's see... 1 cup a day for 180 days is 180 cups. Then for the rest of the year, that's 2 cups a day for another 185 days, which is 370 cups.  Adding those together, she needs 550 cups total.  Since each bag has 110 cups, she'll need 5 bags.

"
"Oh darling, this is a simple matter of proportions! If Sarah, our laundry queen, does 400 pounds, and Raymond, the sweet but less enthusiastic launderer, does half, that's 200 pounds for him. Now, David, bless his heart, only does a quarter of what Sarah does, so that's 100 pounds.  The difference between Raymond and David's laundry loads is a tidy 100 pounds.

"Oh, this is easy!  Vincent should buy the flowers in packages of 2. That way, he'll only spend $9.00 for 18 flowers. If he buys the packages of 3, it'll cost him $15.00.  He saves $6.00 by going with the smaller packages!

$6.00 

"
"Oh, that's so sweet! A new puppy! Let's see... a 30% discount on $100 is $30. That means the grooming will cost $70. 


$70
"
"Let's see... two girls each got 1/6 of the water, so that's 24 liters / 6 = 4 liters each.  That's 4 liters * 2 = 8 liters total for the girls. Then the boy got 6 liters.  So altogether, they used 8 liters + 6 liters = 14 liters.  That means there were 24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters left.


10 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of stickers! Let's see... Charlie starts with 10, then gets 21 more, and then 23 for his birthday! That's 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers!  But then he gives 9 to his sister and uses 28, so 54 - 9 - 28 = 17 stickers left.

"Oh darling, this is simple! Let's see... Alex weighs 4 times Grace's weight minus 2 pounds, so that's 4 * 125 - 2 = 498 pounds.  Together they weigh 125 + 498 = 623 pounds. 


623 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of thorns! Let's see... 3 bushes times 25 roses each is 75 roses. And if each rose has 8 thorns, that means there are 600 thorns in total! 


600
"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let me see... they played 22 games total, and won 8 more than they lost.  Hmm...  I think they must have won 15 games! 



"
"Oh, that's easy! Gene has been on vacation for 34 - 23 = 11 years. Since he goes on four vacations a year, that's 11 * 4 = 44 quilt blocks! 


44
"
"Oh my, that's a lot of ringing! Let's see... the first time it rang 4 times. The second time it was three times longer, so that's 4 times * 3 = 12 times.  And the third time it was half as long as the second time, so that's 12 times / 2 = 6 times.  In total, it rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times!

"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... Sylvie gets a 10% raise every year after five years. So after one year, her salary would be $660. Then $726 the next year, and finally $798.60 the year after that. 


$798.60
"
"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if Marilyn sold ten times more than Harald, that means Harald's sales were like one piece of a pie, and Marilyn's were ten pieces! Together, they make eleven pieces, which equals 88,000 copies.  So, to find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to figure out what one piece is worth.  

If eleven pieces are 88,000, then one piece is 88,000 divided by 11. That's 8,000 copies!

8000 

"
"Oh my goodness, planning a party can be so tricky! Let's see... if Christina invited 16 friends but knows some won't come, she's being smart to plan for only 0.75 gift bags per guest.  That means she'll need 12 gift bags (16 friends x 0.75).  Since each bag costs $2, she'll spend $24 in total (12 bags x $2/bag).

$24 

"
"Oh my stars, that's a lot of hungry dinosaurs! Let's see... adults eat 10 pounds each, and there are 20 of them, so that's 20 times 10, which is 200 pounds.  Little dinos eat half as much, so they'll eat 5 pounds each. With 5 little ones, that's 5 times 5, or 25 pounds.  

Add those together, and Ted needs a whopping 225 pounds of potato salad! 



"
"Oh my goodness, this is a fun one! Let's see... Cindy has four pets, and Marcia has two more than that, so Marcia has six. Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, which means she has eighteen!  Adding them all up, Cindy's four plus Marcia's six plus Jan's eighteen gives us a grand total of twenty-eight pets!

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Corey must be 11 since James is one year younger. That means Amy is 9, and Jackson is 4.

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Lee is speedy, finishing in 38 seconds. Gerald was 2 seconds slower, so he took 40 seconds. But with his new diet, he's 10% faster! That's a 4-second improvement (40 x 0.10 = 4).  So, Gerald's new time is 36 seconds! 


36
"
"Oh my, that sounds like a busy neighborhood! Let's see... if there are 60 doggies and twice as many kitties, that's 60 * 2 = 120 kitties.  That makes a total of 60 + 120 = 180 doggies and kitties.  And if there are 12 fewer bunnies, there must be 180 - 12 = 168 bunnies.  Adding them all up, there are 168 + 180 = 348 pets in the neighborhood! 


348 

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, that means there are 80 boys. That leaves 120 girls.  If 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, then 80 girls are in the Girl Scouts. That means 40 girls are not in the Girl Scouts.


40 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's easy! James slept for 6 hours, which is way less than Harry's 9 hours.  That means Harry slept 3 more hours than his friend.

"
"Oh, this is easy!  If Freda made 32 ounces of sauce and each can of tomatoes makes 8 ounces of sauce, she must have used 4 cans. Since each can has 3 tomatoes, she used a total of 12 tomatoes.

"
"Oh my, that sounds like a terrible traffic jam! Let's see... if 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes and 5 took an exit, that means 25 cars were left to drive through the first part of the jam.  

5 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of plants! Let's see... Mary starts with 2 plants on each of her 40 window ledges, so that's 2 * 40 = 80 plants.  Then she gets 18 more, bringing her total to 80 + 18 = 98 plants. But she's giving one plant from each ledge away, so she'll be giving away 40 plants. That leaves her with 98 - 40 = 58 plants. 


58 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of doorbell ringing! Let's see... the fourth friend rang it 60 times. The third friend rang it 10 more times than that, so that's 70 times. The second friend rang it 5 more times than the first friend, who rang it 20 times, so the second friend rang it 25 times.  Adding all those up: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 rings! 


175 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Solo has a lot of reading to do.  

He needs to read 39 pages in total, and he already finished 15. That means he has 24 pages left. Since he has 4 days to finish, he needs to read 6 pages each day.

"
"Oh, that's easy! John drinks a lot of water. Let's see... he has four glasses a day during the week, so that's 20 glasses. Then on the weekend, he has three glasses a day, which is 6 glasses.  Adding those together, he drinks 26 glasses of water in a week.

"
"Oh my, a fog bank rolling in! Let's see... if it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles, and the city is 42 miles across, we need to figure out how many sets of 3 miles are in 42.  That's 14 sets!  And since each set takes 10 minutes, the whole city will be covered in 140 minutes. 


140 

"
"Ooh, jigsaw puzzles are so much fun! Let's see... Poppy put down a quarter of the pieces, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces. That leaves 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces. Then her mom put down a third of those, which is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.  So, in total, they put down 250 + 250 = 500 pieces. That means there are 1000 - 500 = 500 pieces left to put in!

500 

"
"Oh, that's easy! If Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5, then Cody eats 15 cookies (3 * 5 = 15).  Together they eat 20 cookies (15 + 5 = 20).

20 

"
"Oh darling, this is a fun one! Let's see... each box has walls that are 1 inch thick, so we need to figure out the space inside.  If the outside is 5 by 6 by 4, the inside is 3 by 4 by 2. That means each box has a volume of 24 cubic inches. With three boxes, the total inner volume is 72 cubic inches.

"
"Oh my goodness, let me see! Frankie watched a lot of TV this week!  

Okay, so he watched 2 hours on Monday and Tuesday, then another 1.5 hours on Thursday. And on Friday, he watched 2 more hours. That's 5.5 hours total.  

That means he watched 1.5 hours on Wednesday. Since each of those little episodes is 30 minutes, he must have watched 3 of them! 


3 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of cookies! Let's see... if he has 110 cookies now and dropped 5, that means he had 115 before that.  And since he baked 15 extra, he must have meant to bake 100.  But that's double what he made last year, so he baked 50 cookies last year.

"
"Oh honey, that's easy!  If the gas is $3.00 a gallon and they get $0.20 back for each gallon, that's a total savings of $2.00! So their gas will only cost $28.00. 


$28.00
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of fruit roll-ups! Let's see... Beatrice ate 2 times 24, which is 48. Marcell ate 3 times 14, which is 42. Together, that's 48 plus 42, or 90 roll-ups!  Since there are two of them, they ate an average of 90 divided by 2, which is 45 roll-ups each.

45 

"
"Oh my, that sounds like a scary situation for poor Julia! Let's see... she rows 20 feet every 16 seconds, and it takes her 64 seconds to get to shore. That means the shore is 80 feet away (64 seconds / 16 seconds per 20 feet * 20 feet = 80 feet).  

Now, her boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. So, over 80 feet, it would take on 16 liters of water (80 feet / 10 feet per 2 liters * 2 liters = 16 liters).

16 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  If each teacher uses the whiteboard twice a day and cleans it three times per lesson, that's 2 lessons * 3 cleanings = 6 cleanings per teacher. Since there are four teachers, the whiteboard gets cleaned a total of 6 cleanings/teacher * 4 teachers = 24 times a day. 


24 

"
"Oh, that's easy! Ryan planted 2 flowers a day for 15 days, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 flowers. But 5 didn't grow, so he has 30 - 5 = 25 flowers blooming in his garden. 


25 

"
"Oh darling, this is a bit of a puzzle, isn't it? Let's see... Jamal's phone holds a whopping 1800 photographs, and that's six times more than Brittany's. So, Brittany's phone can only hold 300.  Now, Brittany's phone capacity is 50 times bigger than the number of ducks in Jamal's photo.  That means there must be 300 divided by 50, which is 6 ducks in Jamal's photo.

"
"Okay, let me see... so lumber prices went up 50%, huh?  That's good news for me!

I have those ten 2x4s that cost me $10 each, so that's $100. And the five 4x4s were $16 each, so that's another $80. That's a total of $180 I spent.

Now, with the price increase, those 2x4s are worth $15 each, so I can sell them for $150. The 4x4s are now worth $24 each, so those will bring in $120. That's a total of $270!

So, if I subtract what I spent from what I'll make, I'm looking at a profit of $90. Not bad for some leftover lumber!


$90 

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic ratio problem!  Let's see... Katy uses sugar and water in a ratio of 7:13, meaning for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water. If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined, we need to figure out how much of that 120 is sugar.

Think of it like this: the ratio 7:13 represents 20 parts in total (7 + 13 = 20).  Each of those parts is worth 120 / 20 = 6. Since sugar represents 7 parts, she used 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"
"Oh, this is a fun little puzzle! Let's see... If there were 30 vehicles in total and 10 were already there from the first day, that means 20 vehicles arrived on the second day. Since each container holds 5 vehicles, they must have brought in 4 containers. 


4 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

Adrien earned 30% more than Lylah, meaning if Lylah made $100, Adrien made $130. We know Adrien was making $40,000 four years ago.  That means Lylah was making $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately) four years ago.

Fast forward four years, and Adrien's salary increased by 40%, bringing his total to $40,000 + ($40,000 * 0.40) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased, so four years later she's making $30,769.23 + ($30,769.23 * 0.30) = $40,000.

Finally, to find their combined salary, we add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries: $56,000 + $40,000 = $96,000.


$96,000 

"
"Oh, that's easy! If Miguel uses 2 pads a week and each pad has 30 sheets, that's 60 sheets a week.  Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he uses 240 sheets every month.

"
"Let's see... Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice as many apples, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 apples. He brought half as many oranges, so that's 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.  

In total, they have 5 + 10 = 15 apples and 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. That means they have 15 + 12 = 27 fruits altogether! 


27
"
"Let's see... Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. Then she slept 2 hours less each of the next two days, so that's 8 - 2 = 6 hours each night. That's a total of 6 + 6 = 12 hours. For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, meaning 6 + 1 = 7 hours each night.  Since there are 4 more days, that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.  Adding it all up, she slept 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.


48 

"
"Oh, this is easy! Rosie runs 30 miles in the first 3 hours, and then another 20 miles in the next 4 hours. That means she can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

"
"Oh my, that sounds like quite the party! Let's see... if Dylan had 38 chicken sausages and 6 more fish sausages, that means he had 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.  In total, he bought 38 + 44 = 82 sausages.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of fruit! Let's see... if each pepper costs $15, then a watermelon costs $45 because it's three times as much. An orange is $40 because it's $5 less than a watermelon.  

So, 4 watermelons cost $180, 20 peppers cost $300, and 10 oranges cost $400.  Adding those all together, Dillon will spend $880 at the store. 



"
"Oh darling, this is simple! Let's see... 500 patients a day at 24 minutes each means the doctors are working a total of 200 hours.  If they charge the hospital $150 an hour and the hospital charges patients $200 an hour, that's a tidy $10,000 profit!

"Oh my goodness, that sounds like so much fun! Let's see... Pam rode the roller coaster twice and Fred rode it four times. That's six rides in total, and each ride costs six tickets, so that's 36 tickets already! Then they both rode the luge twice, which is another four rides and 24 more tickets.  Adding those together, they used 60 tickets in all.

"
"Oh my, that sounds like quite the workout! Let's see... if Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and six times that on Tuesday, that's 4 * 6 = 24 miles.  That means he walked a total of 4 + 24 = 28 miles on Monday and Tuesday.  

Since his total for all three days was 41 miles, he must have walked 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday.

"Okay, let's see... two subs at $7.50 each is $15.00.  Then the chips are $3.00 and the cookies are $2.00. So that's $20.00 total for the food.  

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00.  Adding that to the food cost makes it $24.00.  And don't forget the $5.00 tip!

That brings the grand total to $29.00.

"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens, we can think of it like this:

Imagine the queen bees are like the smallest group. Then the baby bees are twice that size, and the worker bees are twice the size of the babies.  

Since there are 700 bees in total, we need to figure out how to split them into these groups. Hmm... I think there must be 100 queen bees, 200 baby bees, and 400 worker bees!

"Oh, that's easy! If Jordan worked his video game time, he'd make $140 a week.  


"
"Okay, let's see... John spent $2 on milk and $3 on eggs, so that's $5 for food.  Then he bought light bulbs and cups for $3 each, and roach traps for $4, making his non-food total $10.  But wait, there's a 10% tax on those! That's another dollar. So the non-food stuff costs $11.  Adding that to the food, everything cost John $16.

"Okay, let's figure out Kim's profit! 

He'll have 8 clients total.  Each client needs $4 worth of bleach and $5 worth of cloths, so that's $9 per client.  His total expenses will be 8 clients * $9/client = $72. Since he makes $92 each week, his profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of Legos! Let's see... the first set has 500 pieces. The second one has three times that, so that's 500 times 3, which is 1500 pieces.  And the last one has a quarter of the pieces in the first set, so that's 500 divided by 4, which is 125 pieces.  

Adding them all up, Johnny picks up 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 pieces. 

2125 



"
"Oh, this sounds like a busy beehive! Let's see... 

If 30 bees left first, and then half that number came back, that's 30 / 2 = 15 bees returning. Then twice the original number left, so that's 30 * 2 = 60 more bees flying out.  

In total, 30 + 60 = 90 bees left the hive. And since they all came back eventually,  90 bees must have returned in the last 6 hours.


90 

"
"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if they got $8 back, that means they paid $8 more than the tickets cost.  The tickets cost $12 + $10 = $22.  So, they must have given the cashier $22 + $8 = $30!


$30 

"
"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Charlie has 12 friends, and that's three times more than Dorothy. So Dorothy has 12 / 3 = 4 friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, meaning he has 4 * 4 = 16 friends.

"Oh my goodness, this is a fun one! Let's see... Steve has a bit of a head start with that bike, but Tim's got some serious skateboarding skills.  

Okay, so Steve goes 3 miles, which is 15,840 feet, and he's zooming along at 440 feet per minute. That means it'll take him 36 minutes to get home.

Tim's only going 2 miles, or 10,560 feet, and he's going 264 feet per minute.  That's a 40-minute trip for him.

So, Steve will be waiting for Tim for a whole 4 minutes! 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's so clever of Shawnda! Let's see... 

She inflated 10 tires from bicycles, 9 tires from tricycles, and 1 tire from the unicycle. That's a total of 20 tires!

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, she made 20 * $0.25 = $5.00!

"Oh my goodness, that's quite the story! Let's see... Dave had some fries stolen, then a seagull ate some, then pigeons, then a raccoon, and finally ants got one!  

It sounds like there were 43 fries to begin with. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Kimo has a busy schedule.  

He has 3 classes a day on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, so that's 3 classes/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours of class.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes a day that are each 2 hours long, so that's 2 classes/day * 2 hours/class * 2 days/week = 8 hours of class.

In total, he has 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours of class each week.

Over a 16-week semester, that's 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours of class! 

272 



"
"Oh my, that's a lot of baking! Let's see... 300 rolls at 4 inches each is 1200 inches. Then there are 120 croissants at 6 inches each, so that's 720 inches. And the baguettes are tricky, 60 of them at 2 feet, which is 24 inches each, for a total of 1440 inches.  Adding it all up, that's 3360 inches of deliciousness!  

Now, to convert that to feet, we divide by 12, which gives us 280 feet. 


280 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of bananas! Let's see... the monkeys eat 200, the gorillas eat 400, and the baboons eat 100 each month. That's 700 bananas a month!  Since he needs enough for two months, he'll need 1400 bananas. 


1400

"Oh my goodness, this sounds like a fun competition! Let's see... Blake ran back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field, so he ran 1500 yards. Kelly ran back and forth once, which is 100 yards, and then ran to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. That's 34 times 80 yards, which is 2720 yards!  Adding her first run, Kelly ran a total of 2820 yards.  

Kelly ran 1320 yards farther than Blake!

"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a fun day at the beach! Let's see... Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. That's 19 sea creatures in total! Locsin caught 5 starfish, 3 seahorses, and 5 clownfish, for a total of 13.  

Together, they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish!

"Oh my, that's a tricky one! Let me see... if the price goes up by 20% every two months, that's like a little jump every time.  After 36 months, that's a lot of jumps!  

*counts on her fingers*

I think the bag of marbles would cost $92 after 36 months. 


$92
"
"Let's see... there are 5 red cars at $4 each, so those cost $20.  Each action figure is $5, and there are 3, making those $15. The doll costs the same as 3 action figures, so that's another $15.  Adding it all up, $20 + $15 + $15 = $50. 

All the toys are worth $50. 



"
"Ooh, this is a tricky one! Let's see... if Jackie does her own taxes, she loses out on $35 an hour for three hours of work. That's $105!  But the accountant costs $90. So, she'd actually have $15 *more* if she hires the accountant.

"
"Oh my goodness, Elvira is so lucky to have such a generous family! Let's see... the computer is €1090, and the extras add up to €157 + €74 + €102 = €333.  That means everything together costs €1090 + €333 = €1423.  

If she had €1500 to start, she'll have €1500 - €1423 = €77 left for a new outfit! 


€77 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of flan! Let's see... if each flan needs 3 eggs and she needs to make 15, that's 15 times 3, which is 45 eggs.  And since she gets 9 eggs for each babysitting session, she'll need to babysit 45 divided by 9, which is 5 times.

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic age problem! Let me see... Seth is twice Brooke's age, so if we think of their ages as parts, Seth has two parts and Brooke has one. In two years, those parts will add up to 28.  That means each ""part"" will be worth 28 divided by 3, which is a little less than 10. Since Seth has two parts, he'll be a little less than 20.  

Let's see... 28 minus 8 is 20, so Seth must be 16!

"
"Oh darling, that's easy! If Ethel has $8, and Jimmy has $2 more than twice that amount, then he must have $18.

"
"Oh, that's easy! Pancho walks a lot! Let's see... 20 miles a day for five days is 100 miles. Then he walks 10 miles each day on the weekend, so that's another 20 miles.  In total, he walks 120 miles in a week. 


120
"
"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... the jacket costs three times as much as the $25 hat, so that's $25 * 3 = $75.  The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket, so ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.  Adding it all up, each uniform costs $25 + $75 + $50 = $150. 


$150
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of legs! Let's see... 80 spiders with 8 legs each is 640 legs. Then there are 90 insects with 6 legs each, so that's 540 more legs. And those 3 rare mutants with 10 legs each add another 30.  Adding those all together, Jake sees a total of 1210 legs! 



"
"Okay, let's see... Sally Thirtytwo is 8, and Sally Four is the same age, so she's also 8. Granny Red is twice Sally Four's age, so she's 8 * 2 = 16.  Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, making her 16 + 3 = 19.  

To find the total age, we add them all up: 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51.

"
"Oh darling, let's get those finances sorted!  

So, Jessica's minimum payments are $300 for student loans, $200 for her credit card, and $500 for her mortgage, making a total of $1000. If she wants to pay 50% more, that's an extra $500 ($1000 x 0.50 = $500).

Adding that to her minimum payments, she'll be paying $1500 each month. Over a year, that comes to a grand total of $18,000 ($1500 x 12 = $18000).

 
$18000 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of potatoes! Let's see... 60 potatoes, a minute and a half each to peel... that's 90 minutes just for peeling! And then 5 seconds to cut each one, so another 5 minutes.  

Altogether, that's 95 minutes of potato prep. Poor Billy! 


95 

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... they make $5 profit per gallon, and they made $25 total, so they sold 5 gallons.  Since lemons cost $3 per gallon, they spent $15 on lemons.

"
"Oh darling, let's see... Zaid has quite a lot going on!  

First, we need to figure out how much he spends on rent and fuel. That's a quarter of his salary on rent, which is $1500, and a third on fuel, which is $2000. That's already $3500 gone!

Then he donates half of what's left, which is $1250.  

Adding up all his expenses - rent, fuel, donation, his daughter's allowance, and his wife's budget - we get $5650.

Subtracting that from his total salary leaves him with $350. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer than Bo, so she has 36 crabs. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, meaning she has 46 crabs.

Adding them all up, they have a total of 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs. 


122 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see, he made $10 times 5 hours the first week, which is $50. Then he made $10 times 8 hours the second week, which is $80.  So in total, he made $50 plus $80, which is $130.

$130 

"
"Hi!  Let's see... if 3/4 of the class voted for the winner, that means 1/4 voted for the loser.  So, (1/4) * 80 students = 20 votes for the loser.

"
"Oh honey, that Fred! Always messing things up. Let's see... Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, and she got 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of carnations.  That means there were 200 lilies / 5 = 40 carnations.  So, she must have ordered 4 * 40 carnations = 160 red roses.  Poor Sandra!

160 

"
"Oh darling, this is a fun little puzzle! Let's see... if Jan is 30, two years ago she was 28.  Half of that is 14, and Mark was 5 years older than that, making him 19.  That means Mark is currently 21, and since Jean is two years older, she must be 23! 


23
"
"Oh my goodness, this is a fun one! Let's see... the faster team will finish in 220 seconds because each runner is a speedy 55 seconds.  The other team takes a bit longer. Their first runner is 60 seconds, then they get faster by 3 seconds each time. So that's 57, then 54, and finally 51 seconds.  Adding those up, they finish in 222 seconds.  

That means the faster team wins by 2 seconds! 



"
"Okay, let's think about this.  There are three numbers on a die bigger than 3: 4, 5, and 6. That's half the numbers!  

To get two even numbers in a row, you need to get an even number on the first roll (like 2, 4, or 6), and then another even number on the second roll.  That's a 1 in 4 chance.

So, rolling a number bigger than 3 is twice as likely as rolling two even numbers in a row. That means it's 25% more likely.

"
"Oh my, that sounds like a lot of straw! Let's see... if there are 160 pieces of straw in total, and the hamsters and rabbits used 50 and 20 pieces respectively, that leaves 90 pieces for the rats.  Since each rat gets 6 pieces, there must be 15 rats.  And if they're split evenly into 3 cages, that means there are 5 rats in each cage.

"Oh darling, that's simple!  Let's see... 2% interest each month for three months... that's a total of 6% interest.  So, Mandy owes Benedict $106.12. 



"
"Oh darling, this is a classic business problem! Let's see... he makes $8 profit per bag ($30 selling price minus $22 cost).  To make a $400 profit, he must have sold 50 bags.

"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a fun day! Let's see... they spent $20.25 on tickets, $15.75 on food (which is $4.50 less than the tickets), and $66 on rides (two rides at $33 each).  That means the whole day cost $102.  

If they split it evenly, each friend would pay $34. 



"
"Oh my, that's a lot of peaches! Let's see... if John collects 2 peaches every minute and he works for 3 whole hours, that's 180 minutes!  So he collects 2 peaches per minute times 180 minutes... that's 360 peaches! 


360 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of hungry ducks!  Let's see... if each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects a week, and there are ten ducks, that's 35 pounds total.  Then we divide that by 7 days in a week...

"
"Oh my, that's a tricky one! Let's see... Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 more each year, so after 10 years he's planted 100 more trees. But he also chops down 2 trees each year, so he loses 20 trees in total. That means he has 130 trees after 10 years. But then 30% of them die, which is 39 trees.  

So, in the end, Tom has 91 trees left.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a silly prank! Let's see... they started with 18 pink flamingos, took away a third, which is 6, leaving 12 pink ones. Then they added 6 white ones.  On Sunday, they added another 18 pink flamingos, so there were 30 pink ones. That means there were 24 more pink flamingos than white ones.

"Oh my, that's a lot of carrots!  If each restaurant gets 2 pounds, and there are 40 restaurants, they'll only need 80 pounds in total. That means there will be 120 pounds of carrots left over. 



"
"Let's see... if there are 8417 men and 9092 women in Soda, that's a total of 17509 adults.  If there are 23786 people in total, then there must be 6277 children. 



"
"Okay, let's see... Elaine started with 20 cards.  Then she got three times that amount, so that's 20 * 3 = 60 more cards.  In the second month, she got 20 fewer than the first month, meaning she got 60 - 20 = 40 cards.  

So in the first two months, she got 60 + 40 = 100 cards. In the third month, she doubled that amount, getting 100 * 2 = 200 cards.

Finally, we add up all the cards: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards!


320 

"
"Oh darling, this is simple! Let's see... Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher. Publisher A pays him a measly 5 cents a sentence, so that's 500 * $0.05 = $25.00. Publisher B is much more generous, paying double, so that's 500 * $0.10 = $50.00.  Adding those together, Mark makes a lovely $75.00 a week, or 7500 cents!

"Oh darling, that's wonderful news about John's award! Let's see, a $5000 bonus is a fabulous start. And a 5% raise on his $2000 weekly salary... that's an extra $100 each week!  So, his new weekly earnings are $2100.  Over a whole year, that's $2100 times 52 weeks, which comes to $109,200.  Don't forget to add that initial bonus!  That brings his total to a stunning $114,200 for the year.

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of pens! Let's see... 

Janet starts with 22 green and 10 yellow, so that's 32 pens already. Then she gets 6 bags of blue pens with 9 in each, which is 54 more pens! And 2 bags of red pens with 6 in each, so that's 12 more.  

Adding it all up: 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens!

"Okay, let's figure this out!  Brinley wants a 93 average across six tests. That means she needs a total of 93 * 6 = 558 points.

She's already earned 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 points.

To reach her goal, she needs 558 - 438 = 120 points on her last test.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of candy! Let's see... if each chocolate bar is 40 grams and weighs twice as much as an apple, then each apple must be 20 grams.  There are 25 chocolate bars, so those weigh 1000 grams in total (25 times 40). The apples weigh 1600 grams (80 times 20).  Adding those together, the whole bag weighs 2600 grams!

"
"Oh darling, this is a bit of a tricky one! Let's see... half a dozen plates at $6000 each would be $3000, and twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than that, so they're $1800.  Now, twenty dozen is 240 cups, so each cup costs $1800 divided by 240, which is $7.50. 


$7.50 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Sara needs $30 for the jacket and $40 for the shoes, so that's $70 in total. She already has $30 from babysitting and her savings, which means she still needs $40.  Since she earns $4 for each lawn she mows, she'll need to mow the lawn 10 times.

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let me see...  If Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, and they lay different amounts of eggs, we need to figure out how many of each he has.  

Hmm, let's think...  If we say 'r' is the number of red chickens, then there are 'r + 2' white chickens.  

The red chickens lay 3 eggs each, so that's 3r eggs. The white chickens lay 5 eggs each, so that's 5(r + 2) eggs.

All together, Jerry gets 42 eggs. So, 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42.

Let's solve that! 3r + 5r + 10 = 42. That means 8r + 10 = 42.  

Subtract 10 from both sides, and we get 8r = 32.  Divide both sides by 8, and we find that r = 4.

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens!

"Oh my, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

If the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, and it had twice as much water just four minutes ago, that means the big pool lost a lot of water quickly!  

Since both pools are leaking at the same rate, the small pool must have lost some water too.  

Thinking about it carefully, I believe the small pool has **8** gallons of water now. 



"
"Okay, so Lori needs to save up $320 for the shoes and $32 for the belt, which means she needs a total of $352. If she makes $8 an hour, she'll need to work 44 hours to afford everything. 



"
"Oh honey, let me help you with that!  

So Janeth borrowed $2000 and has to pay back 10% interest, which is $200. That means she owes a total of $2200. If she pays $165 each month for 12 months, she'll have paid $1980.  

That leaves a balance of $220.

"
"Let's see... Naomi scored 68 points, and Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.  Together, they scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. That means Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"
"Ooh, let me see!  Carmen spent 30 minutes on crosswords (3 puzzles times 10 minutes each) and 40 minutes on sudokus (8 puzzles times 5 minutes each). That means she spent a total of 70 minutes playing games.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

James starts with 40 water-type cards, but loses 8, leaving him with 32. He also gains 14 grass-type cards, bringing his total to 34.  

That means he has 30 fire, 34 grass, and 32 water cards, for a total of 96 cards.

To find the percentage chance of picking a water card, we divide the number of water cards (32) by the total number of cards (96) and multiply by 100%.

That gives us (32/96) * 100% = 33.33%. Rounding to the nearest integer, the chance is 33%.

"Oh my goodness, that burrito sounds delicious! Let's see...

The burrito itself is $6.50, and then he adds $2.00 for meat, $1.00 for cheese, $1.00 for avocado, and $0.50 for the sauces. That's a total of $11.00 so far.

Then he upgrades for $3.00 more, bringing it to $14.00. But wait, he has a $5.00 gift card!

So, he only owes $9.00.

"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a busy school hall! Let's see... 

If 30% went out through exit A, that's 300 students. Then 420 students left through exit B.  That means 280 students must have used exit C. 



"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... John has 54 candies, and that's twice the amount Robert has. So Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies. James has 6 more candies than Robert, meaning he has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.  That means John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James.

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of letters! Let's see... if Mike has 3 pen pals left and they each send 2 letters a week, that's 6 letters coming in. He writes 6 back, so that's 12 letters total.  Each letter is 5 pages, so that's 60 pages! If he writes a page every 6 minutes, that's 360 minutes of writing.  

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 6 hours writing every week.

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of fries! Let's see... Griffin started with 24, and Kyle took 5, leaving him with 19. Then Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so that's another 10 fries gone, leaving Griffin with 9.  Colby took 3 less than Kyle, which is 2 fries, so Griffin had 11 fries left.  Since he ended up with 27, Ginger must have given him 16 fries!

"Let's see... Isabelle spent $12 on cake stuff, $43 on presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invites, and $22 on goodie bags.  That's a total of $96.  If she splits that with her two parents, that means there are three people paying.  So $96 divided by 3 is $32. 


$32
"
"Oh darling, that's easy!  If the chef bought 4 bags of onions at 50 pounds each, that's a total of 200 pounds of onions. And since each pound costs $1.50, the chef spent a total of $300.00. 


$300.00
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of cookies! Let's see... Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday and 26 on Tuesday, for a total of 46 cookies. Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.  Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister ate 18 * 200 = 3600 calories. That means Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister.

5600 

"
"Okay, let me see...  There are 60 students in total, and half are boys, so there are 30 boys.  If the first two classes have 15 and 12 girls, that's 27 girls total.  That means the third class has 3 girls. Since each class has 20 students, the third class must have 17 boys.

"
"Oh, that's easy! If Travis starts with 61 apps, deletes 9, and then adds 18, he'll have 70 apps left.

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of hunting! Let's see... he killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars the first night. Then today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, which were three fewer than the night before.  

So, he killed 12 cougars today and 36 wolves. That makes a total of 46 wolves and 27 cougars.  

In total, Rick killed 73 animals. 



"
"Oh, that's easy! If Bill starts on the 3rd floor and goes up to a floor that's 4 times his starting floor plus 6, he'll be on the 18th floor. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like so much fun! Let's see... Mitchel went down 30 times, and Anne went down 30% less, which is 9 fewer times. So Anne went down 21 times. Robert went down 4 times as many as Anne, so he went down 21 * 4 = 84 times! 

84 

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see...  If there are 20 stalls with 20 cows each, that's 400 cows in total. Then Mr. Sylas adds 40 more cows, bringing the total to 440.  If he splits those cows evenly among the 20 stalls, each stall would have 22 cows.  So, in 8 stalls, there would be 8 stalls * 22 cows/stall = 176 cows.


176 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of coins! Let's see... 100 pennies is a dollar, 40 nickels is two dollars, 20 dimes is another two dollars, and 40 dollar bills is, well, forty dollars!  Add it all up and Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank. 



"
"Oh my, that's a big redwood! Let's see... if each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, and the tree is 200 feet tall, that's 20 sections. So the whole tree originally weighed 8000 pounds. But those pesky termites ate 30% of it, which is 2400 pounds.  That means the redwood now weighs 5600 pounds. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of overdue books! Let's see... eight books at fifty cents each is four dollars.  And then there's that extra two dollar fee.  So, in total, she owes six dollars. 


$6.00
"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a fruity puzzle! Let's see... Andrea has 52 apples, which is 8 more than Jamal. That means Jamal has 44 apples.  He also has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 48 bananas. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which is 24.  

Adding up all the fruit, Andrea has 76 and Jamal has 92, for a grand total of 168 fruits! 


168 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of cookies! Let's see... two cups of flour for every dozen cookies, and she's making 36 today and 30 tomorrow... that's 66 cookies total.  Hmm, 66 divided by 12 is 5 and a half dozen. So she'll need 5.5 times 2 cups of flour... that's 11 cups! 


11 

"
"Ooh, that's a lot of pennies! Let's see... two-thirds of 9,300 is 6,200 pennies.  And since there are 100 pennies in a dollar, that's $62.00. 


$62.00
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of marbles! Let's see... 5 boxes with 50 marbles each is 250 marbles.  And then she gets 20 more? That brings her total to 270 marbles! 


270
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Chris has 6 trees, and Ferdinand has half that amount, so Ferdinand has 3 trees.  Harry has 5 more than twice the number Ferdinand has, meaning he has 2 * 3 + 5 = 11 trees. That means Harry has 11 - 3 = 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 


8
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Carmen has $100, Samantha has $25 more than that, so she has $125. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, making her total $175.  If we add up all their money, Carmen's $100 plus Samantha's $125 plus Daisy's $175 equals $400.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky one! Let's see...

The house costs $350,000, but then there's that pesky 5% brokerage fee, which is $17,500. And don't forget the 12% transfer fee, which adds another $42,000!  

Adding it all up, the total cost is $409,500.  That's $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget. 


$9,500
"
"Oh darling, let's see... Mr. Tan sold his house for a pretty penny, $400,000! But those pesky fees always eat into the profits, don't they?  

The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, so that's $12,000. And the brokerage fee is 5%, which comes to $20,000.  Adding those together, his total fees are $32,000.

Don't forget, he also had to pay off the remaining loan of $250,000.  

So, to find his net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

Poor Mr. Tan, he's left with $118,000 after all that. 


$118,000
"
"Okay, let's see... it takes 20 minutes to get to 300 degrees, and then it takes 40% longer to reach 400 degrees.  That means it takes 20 * 0.40 = 8 more minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to get to 400 degrees.

Then, cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating, so that's 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

In total, from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, it takes 28 + 23 = 51 minutes. 


51 

"
"Oh darling, that's easy! Let's see... 50 newspaper ads at $5 each is $250. And 15 television ads at $75 each is $1125.  Add those together and the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on ads. 


$1375
"
"Ooh, that's a tricky one! Let me see... If the juggler has 16 balls and half are golf balls, that's 8 golf balls. And if half of *those* are blue, then there must be 4 blue golf balls!

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of M&Ms! Let's see... 300 plus 12 more is 312. And half of 300 is 150.  So that's 300 plus 312 plus 150... *counts on her fingers* ... that's 762 M&Ms! 


762
"
"Oh darling, that's easy! Let's see... two houses with three bedrooms each, and each bedroom has two windows... that's twelve windows already!  And then there are four extra windows in each house, so that's eight more.  Adding those together, we get twenty windows in total. 


20 

"
"Let's see... she spends $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35, which is $15.00.  If she pays with $20.00, her change is $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00.

$5.00 

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... the body needs 900 stitches, and the collar is a tenth of that, so that's 90 stitches. The rosette is double the collar, meaning it takes 180 stitches.  

That's 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches already.  Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, each sleeve must use (1800 - 1170) / 2 = 315 stitches. 


315 

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds.  She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 each, so that's 20 * $40 = $800.  Then she got 80 packets of celery seeds at $30 each, which is 80 * $30 = $2400.  Adding those together, she spent a total of $800 + $2400 = $3200 on seeds.


$3200 

"
"Oh my, memorizing lines can be quite a task! Let's see... his song has 54 lines.  The first scene is twice as long, but he only has a third of those lines, so that's 54 * 2 / 3 = 36 lines. The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, and he has four-fifths of those, so that's (54 + 6) * (4/5) = 48 lines.  Adding it all up, he has 36 + 48 + 54 = 138 lines to memorize! 

138 

"
"Let's see... Carly had 80 cards.  Two-fifths of them had an A, so that's 32 cards. That leaves 48 cards. Half of those had a B, which is 24 cards. That means 24 cards are left. Five-eighths of those have a C, so that's 15 cards.  That leaves 9 cards with a D! 


9 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of holes! Let's see... 30 small holes at 3 minutes each is 90 minutes. And 15 large holes at 10 minutes each is 150 minutes.  Adding those together, we get 240 minutes.  That's 4 hours of digging! 


4 

"
"Oh, that's easy! If their ages add up to 20 now, in 10 years they'll both be 10 years older. So, 20 + 20 = 40. 

40 

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let me see...

If Ruby is 6 times older than Sam now, and in 9 years she'll be 3 times as old as Sam, we can figure out Sam's age.  

Let's think about it... Sam must be pretty young!

Sam is 6 years old now. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a delicious treat! Let's see... 20 popsicles at 25 cents each would be $5.00. And 4 ice cream bars at 50 cents each would be $2.00.  Adding those together, Peter spent $7.00 in total. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of spots! Let's see... if a cobra has 70 spots and that's twice the number a mamba has, then a mamba must have 35 spots.  

With 40 cobras and 60 mambas, that's 2800 cobra spots (40 x 70) and 2100 mamba spots (60 x 35).  Adding those together gives us 4900 spots total. Half of that is 2450.

 2450 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

So, there are 12 players plus 3 coaches, that's 15 people. Then there are 12 players times 2 guests each, which is 24 guests.  That means there are 15 + 24 = 39 people in total.

Each pizza feeds 3 people, so Maddy needs 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

If each pizza costs $15, then 13 pizzas will cost 13 * $15 = $195.


$195 

"
"Let's see... each necklace has 8 topaz gemstones that are each 1 inch long, so that's 8 inches total for the topaz.  That leaves 17 inches for the silver beads (25 inches total - 8 inches topaz = 17 inches). Since each bead is 1/4 inch long, Katerina uses 68 silver beads per necklace (17 inches / 0.25 inches/bead = 68 beads).


68 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of stories! Let's see... Alani wrote 20, Braylen wrote 40, and Margot wrote 60 in the first week. That's 120 stories total. Then they doubled it in the second week, so that's another 240 stories.  

If we add those together, they wrote a whopping 360 stories! 


360
"
"Oh, that's easy! If Ann's brother is twice her age, he's 9 * 2 = 18 years old.  In three years, he'll be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

"
"Let's see... five quarters are worth 125 cents, and two dimes are worth 20 cents. That means Kelly has 145 cents in total.  If she spends 55 cents on a pop, she'll have 90 cents left.

"
"Let's see... 76 stars total... three rows of 8 stars is 24 stars, and two rows of 6 stars is 12 more. That's 36 stars already.  So that leaves 40 stars for the rows of 5.  40 divided by 5 is 8. There must be 8 rows of 5 stars!

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of flagstones! Let's see... each truck can carry 2000 pounds, and each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.  They need to move 80 flagstones, so that's 80 times 75... which is 6000 pounds total.  

They'll need 3 trucks to carry it all in one trip.

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic!  Let's see... the fast car is zooming along at 60 miles per hour, and the slowpoke is only doing half that, which is 30 miles per hour. If the speedy one covers 480 miles, the slower car will take twice as long to do the same distance.  

So, the answer is 16 hours. 



"
"Ooh, this is a tricky one! Let's see... Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less, so Izzy has 17. Together they have 39 medals.  If that's 10 times *less* than the total given out, then there must be 39 times 10 medals in total!

390 

"
"Oh my, that sounds like a lot of chocolate! Let's see... if the adults get 24 chocolate bars, that leaves 16 for the children.  With 8 children, each one would get 2 chocolate bars.

"
"Oh, this is easy! Susan works for three hours, but takes a 30 minute break, so she actually works for 2.5 hours. That's 150 minutes. Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, she makes $75 in total. 


$75 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Mike has 21 points, and Jim has 3 less, so Jim has 18 points. Tony has twice as many points as Mike, meaning he has 42 points.

After the fourth round, Mike and Tony each get an extra point because they have over 20 points.

So, let's add up all their points: 21 + 18 + 42 + 1 + 1 = 83

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky one! Let's see... Will has 15 oranges, and his sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. That means there are 15 - 12 = 3 oranges left unwashed.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of exercise! Let's see...

On the first day, Darren did 100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170 exercises.

On the second day, he did 120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = 200 exercises.

In total, over the two days, he did 170 + 200 = 370 exercises. 


370 

"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... they eat 0.2 kg of rice per meal, twice a day, so that's 0.4 kg per person. With 5 people, that's 2 kg of rice they eat every day.  A 42 kg bag will last them 21 days, which is 3 weeks.

"
"Oh my, that's a tricky one! Let's see... Sam had a big goal of selling 120 crates. He missed two days, but still managed to sell quite a few over the weekend and during the week.  

If you add up all the crates he sold, it comes to 65. That means he was 55 crates short of his target.

"
"Oh darling, that's easy!  If three other people bid after Carmen, and each bid raises the price by $50, that's a total increase of $150.  Add that to the starting bid of $200, and the desk cost Carmen a fabulous $350!

"
"Oh darling, let's figure this out!  John's got quite the commute! 

So, he travels 60 miles a day (30 there and 30 back), which means he clocks in 300 miles a week. Over a year, that's a whopping 15,000 miles! At $2 a mile, that's $30,000 just for the mileage. And don't forget that generous $150 monthly bonus for his driver, which adds another $1,800 a year.

Adding those together, John's yearly driving expenses come to a grand total of $31,800. 


$31,800
"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see, Sunday was 23 minutes and Monday was 16.  That's 39 minutes total.  He wants to double that, so he needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday.

"Oh, that's a clever way to make a tabloid!  Since you're folding a single piece of paper in half, you only need **one** piece of paper to make a 32-page tabloid. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like fun! Let's see... if Annika spent half her money on yummy treats, that's $50 / 2 = $25.  And then those rides cost another $10.  So in total, she spent $25 + $10 = $35.  That means she has $50 - $35 = $15 left.

$15 

"
"Okay, let's see... Elise sold 45 books this year, and she has 50 left. That means she sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in the first two years. Since she sold twice as many in the first year as this year, she sold 45 * 2 = 90 books in the first year.  That means she sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.  

Her earnings for the second year were 110 * $20 = $2200.


$2200 

"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... Watson works 50 hours a week (10 hours a day times 5 days) and makes $10 an hour, so that's $500 right there. Plus, he gets a $300 bonus every week because the company is doing so well. That means he makes $800 a week.  In April, with four weeks, he'd make a total of $3200! 


$3200
"
"Oh my, that's a tough one!  Let's see... if John wins 80% of the time, that means he lost 20% of the time.  So, he lost to 20 people * 0.20 = 4 people.

"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see... they sell two-thirds of the bread in the morning, which is 40 loaves. That leaves 20 loaves.  Half of those are sold in the afternoon, so that's 10 loaves.

"
"Oh darling, this is a simple matter of proportions! If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, that means he loses 2 pounds a week.  Since Sandy wants to lose the same amount, but takes 4 times as long, it will take her 4 weeks.

"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see... you save $2 on each tub of ice cream, so that's $4 total. And you save $0.50 on each packet of milk, so that's another $2 saved.  In total, you'd save $6! 



"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... extra arms every three days and extra legs every five days...  After fifteen days, they'd have grown five new arms and three new legs. That's a total of eight new limbs!

"Oh darling, let's figure this out! Theo's suits cost $600, his suitcases $150, and his flight ticket is a whopping $1200 (those business class seats, you know!). That's a total of $1950 spent already.  

He wants to save $2000, so after his expenses, he has $4050 left.  That means he has $2050 for gifts for his South African business partners. 


$2050
"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see... three people eat three eggs each, so that's 9 eggs. Then the other two people eat 2 eggs each, for a total of 4 eggs.  That means they eat 13 eggs every day. In a whole week, they'd eat 91 eggs! 


91 

"
"Oh darling, this is simple! If Quinn is 30 and Jane is 3 years younger, that makes Jane 27.  And since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, he must be 32!

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Cera is 46 now, so six years ago she was 40. Noah was half her age then, meaning he was 20.  The population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age back then, so it was 60,000. Since that was half the population now, Chile's current population is 120,000. 


120000 

"
"Oh my, this is a tricky one! Let me see... if there are twice as many players on offense as defense, and half as many on special teams as defense, we need to find a number that works for all of them.  

Thinking... thinking...  Aha! I've got it! There are **30** players on defense. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the party! Let's see... two families with six people each is twelve people, and three families with four people each is another twelve. That's twenty-four guests in total. But eight couldn't make it because they were sick, and two more had other plans.  So, twenty-four minus ten... that means fourteen people came to Martha's party!

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of marbles! Let's see... Solomon started with 50 marbles, then got 20 more from Johanna. That's 50 + 20 = 70 marbles. His father gave him 2/5 of the marbles he bought from Johanna, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.  So now he has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2 kgs, the total weight is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs. 


156 

"
"Oh, this is easy!  Let's see... 6 times 4 times 5 is 120.  And since it costs 10 cents per cubic foot, that's $12.00 to fill the pool. 


$12.00
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a fun math problem! Let's see... if there are 30 boys, and three times as many girls, that's 30 x 3 = 90 girls. And if there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, that's 30 x (1/10) = 3 nongendered children.  Adding them all up, there are 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 children in the classroom! 



"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if there are 3 electric wires for every 1 electric pole, and they need 45 wires, that means they need 15 poles.

"Oh, this is easy!  Let's see... the book costs $4, and the magazine is half that price, so the magazine is $2. The pen is $1 less than the magazine, making it $1. 


$1
"
"Let's see... Jam has 26 pencils total, and 2 are loose, so that means she has 24 pencils in boxes.  Together, Jam and Meg have 24 + 46 = 70 pencils. If each box holds, say, 8 pencils, they would need 70 / 8 = 8.75 boxes.  You can't have part of a box, so they'd need 9 boxes!

"
"Let's see... each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, and she needs 5 ice cubes to cool it down enough. That's 5 cubes * 12 ml/cube = 60 ml weaker just from the ice.  Then she adds 15 ml of cream, so in total, her iced coffee is 60 ml + 15 ml = 75 ml weaker. 


75 

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if they got 7 new records and each trade is 2 old for 1 new, that means they must have brought in 14 old records in total.

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

We know there are 100 employees total, and 2/5 of them are junior programmers. That means there are 40 junior programmers (100 * 2/5 = 40).

Since senior programmers make $400 more than junior programmers, they earn $2400 each ($2000 + $400 = $2400).

That leaves 60 senior programmers (100 - 40 = 60).

Now, let's calculate the total salary cost:

* Junior programmers: 40 programmers * $2000/programmer = $80,000
* Senior programmers: 60 programmers * $2400/programmer = $144,000

Adding those together, the company pays a total of $224,000 to all the programmers each month. 



"
"Let's see... 20 people were on the bus heading to the third stop.  Seven got off at the second stop, so there were 27 people before that. Then 8 got on at the second stop, meaning there were 19 people after the first stop. Since 5 more got on at the first stop, there must have been 14 people on the bus at the terminal.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of lollipops! Let's see... Oscar starts with 24, eats 2, and then gives 14 to his friends. That leaves him with 8.  He buys double what he gave away, so that's 28 more! Now he has 36. He eats 3, then 2 more...  

That means Oscar has 31 lollipops left. 



"
"Oh, that's easy! If the phone charges 1% every 3 minutes, and it needs to go from 60% to 100%, that's 40% more.  So, 40% times 3 minutes per percent is 120 minutes.  That's 2 hours!

"
"Ooh, that's easy! Erin starts with 7 lollipops, gets 10 more, so that's 17! Then she gives 3 away, leaving her with 14.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! They earned $4 in rewards from their last trip because they spent $80 and get $1 for every $20.  Then the coupon saved them double the rewards, so that's another $8 off.  That means they saved a total of $12. Since their shopping trip was $43, they paid $31. 


$31

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours, so that's $30,000 before taxes. With a 20% tax rate, Nick would pay $6,000 in taxes, leaving him with $24,000.

Job B pays a flat $42,000, but there's a $6,000 property tax and a 10% tax on what's left. After the property tax, he'd have $36,000, and 10% of that is $3,600 in taxes. That means his take-home pay would be $32,400.

So, Job B pays $8,400 more than Job A.

"Oh my, that's a tricky one! Let me see... if 40% of Scotland's 220 castles are ruins, that's 88 castles. And if half of those are unmanned, then there must be 44 unmanned ruined castles.

"
"Oh darling, let's see! Furniture United wants $1350 upfront and then $350 a month for six months. That's $2100 in installments, plus the initial $1350, for a total of $3450. Cozy Homes wants $1100 upfront and then $250 a month for nine months. That's $2250 in installments, plus the initial $1100, for a total of $3350.  

So, Furniture United is $100 more expensive.

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of paintball guns! Let's see... if they share them equally, each person would have 6 guns. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of sugar! Let's see... 30 ounces for each batch of suckers and he's making eight batches, so that's 30 times 8, which is 240 ounces. Then he needs another 70 ounces for the fudge.  Adding those together, he needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar.

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic case of market fluctuations! Let's see... Maria starts with 8 shares at $8 each, so that's $64 to begin with.  The first year, a 50% jump means each share is now worth $12. That's $96 for all her shares. But then, the second year brings a 25% dip, taking each share down to $9.  So, her final total is $72. 


$72 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky one! Let's see... Thomas ate three times more than Luke, so he had 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.  John ate half of what Thomas had, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs. That means John ate 3 - 2 = 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let me see... if two groups are the same size and the third is 10 less, we can think of it like this: imagine the two bigger groups combined have 'x' students. That means the smallest group has 'x - 10' students.  All together, that's 2x + (x - 10) = 200 students.

Let's solve for x!  3x - 10 = 200, so 3x = 210, and x = 70.

That means the smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students. 



"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and twice as many chickens as cows.  That means if we think of the cows as one group, the chickens are like two groups that size.  So, there are three groups of animals in total.

Since 60 animals divided by 3 groups is 20 animals per group, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 40 chickens.

Now, cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2. So the cows have 80 legs (20 x 4), and the chickens have 80 legs (40 x 2).

That means all together, the animals have 160 legs! 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's terrible! Poor Josh! Let's see... he starts with three balls and adds one each week for four weeks, so that's six balls total. Then he drops three, but two come back, so he's left with five.

"
"Oh my, this sounds like a tricky one! Let's see... if the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and the others are all related to its weight, we can figure it out. The blue beetle and green toad are the same as the frog, so they're also 50 pounds. The yellow snake is 10 pounds heavier, making it 60 pounds. And the red bird is 20 pounds lighter, so it's 30 pounds.

Adding them all up: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds. But don't forget the container itself weighs 20 pounds! So the total is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds. 


210 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's so many cute outfits! Let's see... 24 from her friend plus double that from the shower is 24 * 2 = 48.  Then add the 15 from her mom, and that's 48 + 24 + 15 = 87 outfits!  

87 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of running! Let's see... if Tyson runs 5000 meters a day and his coach wants him to run 1/5 more, that's an extra 1000 meters. So he'd be running 6000 meters a day.  In June, with 30 days, that's 6000 times 30, which equals 180000 meters! 

180000 

"
"Oh my goodness, this is a tricky one! Let me see... Juice Box C is $11 and Juice Box B is $9.  That means Juice Box C is $2 more expensive.

"
"Oh darling, that's easy! Let's see... 40 tables with 4 legs each is 160 legs. And 50 tables with 3 legs each is 150 legs.  Add those together and you get a grand total of 310 legs! 



"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... her son eats 20 cookies a week (4 a day for 5 days), and her husband eats 7. That's 27 cookies gone.  Since there are 36 in a bag, Jenny eats 9 cookies. 


9 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  If each shirt was $30 and he got 40% off, that means each shirt cost $18.  Since he bought two, he paid $36 in total. 


$36
"
"Oh darling, this is a simple matter of percentages! Let's see... they used to make $1000 a day selling tractors, and now they make $1100 a day selling silos. That's a difference of $100.  

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100. So, ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

They're making 10% more per day now! 


10
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot to keep track of! Let's see... food is $25 a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so that's $25 times 4, which is $100 a month. Then there are treats at $20 a month and medicine at $100 a month.  Adding those all up, it's $100 + $20 + $100, which equals $220 a month.  Now, to find the yearly cost, we multiply that by 12 months, so $220 times 12 is $2640.

$2640 

"
"Let's see... Peyton has a busy week!  

* Yoga on Monday takes 1 hour.
* Cooking class on Tuesday is three times longer than yoga, so that's 1 * 3 = 3 hours.
* Wednesday's cheese tasting is a quick 0.5 hours.
* The museum tour on Thursday is half the length of the cooking class, so that's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
* And finally, errands on Friday take 2 hours.

Adding it all up: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours. 

All those activities will take Peyton 8 hours in total. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's so thoughtful of April! Let's see... she needs 30 for the daisies and double that for the roses, so that's 30 * 2 = 60 pots for the roses.  In total, she needs 30 + 60 = 90 pots. Since she already has 100, she'll have 100 - 90 = 10 pots leftover.

"Oh, this is easy! If Andrea had $36 and spent $11 on a sweater and $4 on her brother, she must have saved $21. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like quite the vacation! Let's see... he boated for 6 hours and swam for half that, which is 3 hours.  Then he watched 3 shows at 2 hours each, totaling 6 hours. That's 15 hours already!

If that's 30% of his trip, his whole vacation was 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours long. And he spent 40% of that sightseeing, so that's 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours.

He must have seen some amazing sights!

"
"Okay, let's see... Annabelle wants a $400 phone and already has $80.  Her first job pays $10 an hour for 20 hours, so that's $200. Her second job pays $5 an hour for 15 hours, which is $75.  Adding those up, she's earned $275 total, plus her $80, for a total of $355.  That means she still needs $45 to buy the phone!

"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the backyard! Let's see... the shortest tree is 6 feet, and the next one is 5 feet taller, so that's 11 feet.  Together they are 17 feet tall.  The tallest tree is twice that, so it must be 34 feet tall!

"
"Hi there! Let's see... Dean started with $28. The cars cost $12 and the teddy bears cost $5, so he spent a total of $17. That leaves him with $11.  Then his mom gives him another $10, so he has $21 left!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  Morgan needs to pay for mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts for herself, plus all her friends. Mini-golf is $5, tokens are $5, and go-karts are $20 per person. That means each friend will cost $30 total.

Morgan has $90, and she'll spend $30 on herself. That leaves $60 for her friends.  Since each friend costs $30, she can invite 2 friends.

"
"Oh my goodness, this is a tricky one! Let's see... Billy had $10 and spent some on candy. Then he used half his change to buy 40 gumballs at $0.05 each. That means the gumballs cost $2.00.  

So, he had $8.00 left after buying the candy. Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, that means the candy cost $4.00.

If the candy costs $1.50 a pound, he must have bought 2.67 pounds. 


2.67
"
"Oh, this is easy! If Carver is 45 and that's 5 years less than twice his son's age, we can figure it out.  Twice his son's age would be 50 (45 + 5).  So his son is 25 years old. 


25
"
"Okay, let's see... the train travels 75 miles, then 100 miles, and then 50 miles less than the combined distance of those two trips. So that last leg is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

That means a full round trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

If it does that three times a day, that's 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles per day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so it can go 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days before needing service.


20 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of beds! Let's see... a collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing, which is right in between the big Rottweiler bed and the tiny chihuahua bed.  So, for the chihuahuas, he'll need 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds of stuffing. And for the collies, it's 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds.  In total, that's 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing!

23 

"
"Oh darling, this sounds like quite the journey! Let's see... 

He drove 210 miles to his friend's house, which took him 3 hours. Then, the drive back was 240 miles and took another 3 hours.  

Adding those together, his whole trip took 6 hours. 



"
"Let's see... there are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 are girls. That means there are 96 - 43 = 53 boys.  But 4 boys were absent, so there were 53 - 4 = 49 boys at school on Friday. 

49 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's easy! If there are twice as many boys as girls, there must be 12 boys.  That means there are 18 kids in the park altogether! 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky one! Let's see... Jane needs at least 42 points, and she already has 15 + 18 = 33 points.  That means she needs 42 - 33 = 9 more points on her last test. 

9 

"
"Oh my stars, that's terrible!  Let's see... 3 for masks, then 4 times that minus 5 for shoplifting, so that's 7 more.  Then 3 times the shoplifters for violence, so another 21. That's 31 in total!  If 50 were kicked out, then 19 must have been for other reasons. 


19 

"
"Oh, this is easy!  Erin had 10 points before. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

So, 44 seniors need picture frames at $20 each, which is $880.  Each frame also needs etching, which adds 20% of $20, or $4 per frame. That's another $176 for etching. Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so that's $10. And since a quarter of the seniors are officers, that's 11 officers who need cords at $12 each, totaling $132.

Adding it all up: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.


$1198

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a busy weekend for the shoe store! Let's see... they sold 14 pairs on Friday, then double that on Saturday, which is 28 pairs. On Sunday, they sold half of Saturday's amount, so that's 14 pairs. But then 6 people returned their shoes, leaving them with 8 pairs sold for Sunday.  Adding it all up, they sold 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs of shoes!

"Let's see... Tuesdays are 1 hour, Thursdays are 2 hours, and Saturdays are twice Tuesday's hour, so that's another 2 hours.  Adding those all up, she dances for a total of 5 hours a week! 



"
"Oh darling, that's a tricky one! Let's see... if 40% of the equipment was faulty, that means 60% was in tip-top shape.  So, they spent 60% of $400,000 on the good stuff.  

That would be $240,000. 



"
"Oh, that's easy! Mary gets 15 kg of milk from half her sheep and 30 kg from the other half, so she collects a total of 45 kg of milk each day. 


45 

"
"Let's see... she had 12 rolls and gave 6 to her children. That leaves 6 rolls for the chickens.  If she breaks each roll into 8 pieces, that's 6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces for the chickens! 


48 

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... half of the class likes blue, so that's 40 / 2 = 20 pupils.  That leaves 20 pupils who like other colors. If a fourth of them like green, that's 20 / 4 = 5 pupils.  So, the rest, 20 - 5 = 15 pupils must like yellow! 


15 

"
"Let's see... Lucy made $56 on Monday selling apples for $4 each, so she sold $56 / $4 = 14 apples. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples, and then on Wednesday, she picked double that amount, which is 12 * 2 = 24 apples.  In total, Lucy picked 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples.


50 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of socks! Let's see... if Lindsay washed 10 pairs, that's 20 socks right there. Plus the 15 loose ones, she washed a total of 35.  If she started with 50, she must have missed 15! 


15
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of cookies! Let's see... Rachel started with 23, and then got 42 more, so that's 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.  But then her brother ate some!  If he ate 44, then Rachel has 65 - 44 = 21 cookies left. 

21 

"
"Oh darling, let's figure this out!  Karan needs to pay back the loan plus the interest.  

The interest is calculated as (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100, so that's ($3650 * 10 * 5) / 100 = $1825.

Adding that to the original loan, she owes a total of $3650 + $1825 = $5475.

To find her monthly payment, we divide the total by the number of months: $5475 / 5 = $1095.

So, Karan needs to pay $1095 each month. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's easy! Cho hiked for so much longer! Let's see... Cho hiked 14 kilometers every hour for 8 hours, so that's 14 times 8, which is 112 kilometers. Chloe only hiked for 5 hours at 9 kilometers an hour, so she hiked 9 times 5, which is 45 kilometers.  That means Cho hiked 112 minus 45, or 67 kilometers farther than Chloe. 


67 

"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... Anna has 100 silver pesos and 120 gold pesos.  That's 220 pesos in total for her. Axel has 50 silver and 80 gold, which is 130 pesos. Together they have 220 + 130 = 350 pesos! 


350
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Millie makes 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups of lemonade.  She sells each cup for $1, so she'll make $36 total. But she spent $18 on supplies, so her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells 4 cups per hour, and has 36 cups, her stand will be open for 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

That means her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2/hour.


$2 

"
"Oh, this is a bit of a puzzle!  Let me see... If 12.8 hectares is what's left after selling 3/5, that means that amount is 2/5 of the original land.  To find the whole, we need to figure out what number, when multiplied by 2/5, equals 12.8.  

Hmm, if we divide 12.8 by 2/5, we get 32! So Mr. Ruther must have had 32 hectares at first. 


32 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky one! Let's see... half the choir are girls, so that's 52 / 2 = 26 girls.  But then half of them can't make it, so that's 26 / 2 = 13 girls.  And the teachers help out, so that's 13 + 3 = 16 people singing!

"
"Okay, let's see... Wilson needs an 80 or higher to get the car.  His test scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.  To find his average, we add them all up and divide by 5.  

65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

400 / 5 = 80

Looks like Wilson gets the car! His average is an 80.

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of messages! Let's see... if James delivers 66 to Ms. Thompson and only 1/3 of that to Mr. Yu, he must deliver 66 / 3 = 22 messages to Mr. Yu.  

That means in total, he delivers 66 + 22 = 88 messages.

"
"Oh my goodness, this is a tricky one! Let's see... David gets to ride all 9 rides for $30 with his bracelet. Dasha needs to buy 18 tickets, which would cost her $36. That means David saves a whole $6!

"
"Oh my goodness, this is a fun one! Let's see... if the ratio is 5:6, that means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  

If they have 165 popsicles total, we need to figure out how many are in each ""part"" of the ratio.  

165 popsicles divided by 11 parts (5 + 6) is 15 popsicles per part.

So Betty has 5 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 75 popsicles.

And Sam has 6 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 90 popsicles.

That means Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty!

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a great idea!  Let's see... Netflix is $10 a month.  Hulu and Disney Plus together are usually $20, but he gets a discount for bundling them, so that's $20 minus 20%, which is $4 off. So the streaming bundle is $16.  Adding Netflix, that's $26 total.  Since his cable was $60, he saves a whopping $34! 


$34
"
"Oh, that's a fun one! Let's see... she spent 4 hours writing, 2 hours recording, and 1.5 hours editing. That's a total of 7.5 hours.  

So, editing took up 1.5 hours out of 7.5 hours, which is 20%.

"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let's see... if there are 6 rows and 6 columns, that's 36 spaces for books.  Double that is 72, and then adding 20 more brings us to a grand total of 92 books. 


92 

"
"Ooh, Valentine's Day is so fun! Let's see... Erica started with 20 cards and her dad gave her 2 boxes of 15, so that's 20 + (2 * 15) = 50 cards! She gave 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family, meaning she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.  That leaves her with 50 - 29 = 21 cards. But wait! She got 17 more from friends and family, so now she has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

"
"Let's see... Bill gets 1/3 of the pizza, which is 4 slices. Mark gets 1/4, which is 3 slices.  That's 7 slices gone already.  Jenny eats 2 more, so there are 9 slices gone in total. That leaves 3 slices.

"
"Oh my, that sounds like quite the creepy crawly situation! Let's see... 90 spiders is a lot to start with.  Then there were 30 millipedes, which is a third of the spiders. And the stink bugs... twice the millipedes minus 12, so that's 48 stink bugs.  Adding them all up, she saw a total of 168 bugs! 



"
"Oh darling, this is a simple one!  If Erica is 30, and Beth is 5 years older, that makes Beth 35.  Now, Alice is 7 years older than Beth, putting her at 42.  So the difference between Alice and Erica is 12 years. 



"
"Oh my, that's a lot of milk! Let's see... two glasses are 16 ounces, and each ounce has 3 calories.  So, 16 times 3 is... 48 calories! 



"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... he works 4 weeks a month, and that's 4 times 6 days, so 24 days a month.  In a year, that's 24 times 12, which is 288 days.  If he makes $50 a day, then he earns 288 times 50, which is $14,400. 


$14,400
"
"Oh, this is easy!  Mark needs six bags of flour because he's making four times the recipe, and each recipe needs three cups of flour. That's 12 cups total, and each bag has two cups. He only needs two bottles of milk though, since each recipe only needs one cup. So, he needs four more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... if Mel saves 5 hours of AC use each day, that's 900 watts * 5 hours = 4500 watt-hours saved per day.  

Since there are 1000 watts in a kilowatt, that's 4500 watt-hours / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatt-hours saved each day.

Over 30 days, he'd save 4.5 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours.


135 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of stripes! Let's see... two zebras with 17 stripes each is 34 stripes. Then there's one with 36 stripes and another with half that, which is 18 stripes.  Adding them all up, we get 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.  

Since there are four zebras, the average is 88 stripes divided by 4 zebras, which equals 22 stripes per zebra! 


22 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  Tyson needs enough sandwiches for 20 people, and each sandwich feeds 4. That means he needs 5 sandwiches (20 / 4 = 5).

Each sandwich uses 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so he'll need 5 pounds of each.  Meat costs $7.00 per pound, so that's $35.00 (5 x $7.00 = $35.00). Cheese is $3.00 per pound, so that's $15.00 (5 x $3.00 = $15.00).

In total, Tyson will spend $50.00 on meat and cheese ($35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00).


$50.00
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of treats! Let's see... Allan starts with 40 cannolis, and he has twice as much corn, so that's 40 x 2 = 80 corns. Then he gets 60 more cannolis, bringing his total to 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. But he buys 40 fewer corns than that, so he has 100 - 40 = 60 corns.  In total, he has 80 + 60 = 140 corns and 100 cannolis, for a grand total of 140 + 100 = 240!

"Okay, let's break this down. In May, they paid 40 employees $15 an hour for a 40-hour week, so that's $15 * 40 = $600 per employee each week. Over a month, that's $600/week * 4 weeks = $2400 per employee.  So in May, they paid out $2400/employee * 40 employees = $96,000.

In June, a quarter of the employees left, meaning they had 40 * (1/4) = 10 employees leave. That leaves 40 - 10 = 30 employees.  They're still paying the same rate, so in June they paid $2400/employee * 30 employees = $72,000.

Adding those together, the company paid a total of $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000 over the two months.


$168,000 

"
"Ooh, this sounds like fun! Let's see... Sally starts with $10.00. The taffy is a good deal, so two pounds would cost $4.50. The seashells are $1.50, and the magnets are $1.00.  That means she spent a total of $7.00.  

If she started with $10.00 and spent $7.00, she has $3.00 left. 


$3.00
"
"Oh my goodness, fireworks are so much fun! Let's see... he spent $400 on one package and $800 on another, so that's $1200 total.  A 20% discount on that is $240 off, leaving him with $960.  And then he adds that big finale firework for $150, bringing his grand total to $1110.

$1110 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies.  She eats 2 a night, so that's 60 cookies for the whole month. Since a dozen has 12, she'll need 5 dozens to have enough. 



"
"Oh darling, this is a tricky one! Let's see... if 1% of her candles explode, that's 500 candles out of 50,000. And only 5% of *those* have that unfortunate wet dog smell.  So, 5% of 500 is... 25 candles.

"
"Ooh, let's see!  If each blouse is normally $20 and they're 30% off, that means each one costs $14.  Since Misha is buying four, the total cost would be $56. 


$56
"
"Let's see... Joanne got 30 apples from the tallest trees and half that from the shortest, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister got twice as many from the tallest trees, meaning she got 30 * 2 = 60 apples. And three times as many from the shortest, so that's 15 * 3 = 45 apples.  

Together, they got 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tallest and shortest trees. That means Joanne got 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.


350 

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let me see...  

If camels have two humps and dromedaries have one, we need to figure out how many of each are in the herd.  Hmm... 

I think there are **56** dromedaries. 



"
"Oh darling, that sounds like quite the adventure! Let's see... he traveled 200 kilometers a day for four days, so that's 800 kilometers. Then he did a bit less, only 30% of that, which is 240 kilometers.  He had a rest day, how lovely! And then 300 kilometers a day for a whole week, so another 2100 kilometers. Adding it all up, he traveled a grand total of 3140 kilometers! 



"
"Oh my goodness, this is a tricky one! Let's see... Peter's locker is like a tiny little thing, only 5 cubic inches. Zack's locker is four times bigger than that, so it must be 20 cubic inches. And Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's, making it a whopping 40 cubic inches!

"
"Oh my goodness, that's terrible about Stanley's comb!  Let's see... if Stanley was at 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet, that means the comb is at 6,000 feet.  Oliver is at 3,000 feet, so he needs to climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb. 

3000 

"
"Oh darling, that's easy! Let's see... the second bank gave him double the first, so that's $4000 times 2, which is $8000.  Adding that to the first loan and his starting money, he has a grand total of $5000 + $4000 + $8000, which equals $17000.

$17000 



"
"Oh my, that sounds like quite the commotion! Let's see... if 20 kitties sailed away and then 18 more dashed off after a mouse, that leaves... 12 cats still on the rock. 



"
"Oh darling, let's figure this out!  

So, Bill gets a sweet deal for the first six months at $8 a month. That's $8 x 6 = $48. Then it goes up to $12 a month for eight months, which is $12 x 8 = $96.  Finally, it jumps to $14 a month for another eight months, so that's $14 x 8 = $112.

Adding it all up, his total cost for two years is $48 + $96 + $112 = $256. 



"
"Oh my goodness, this is a tricky one! Let's see... Cole got a great deal on those jeans!  Since the jogger jeans were the same price as the tattered jeans originally, they cost $0 more.

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a fun trip! Let's see... if they have 4 big buses that hold 60 people each, that's 4 times 60, which is 240 people. Then there are 6 minibuses holding 30 each, so that's 6 times 30, or 180 people. And finally, 10 minivans with 15 people each, which is 10 times 15, or 150 people.  

Adding all those up, 240 plus 180 plus 150 equals 570 people!

570 

"
"Oh, that's a fun problem! Let's see... Lillian has 3 homemade feeders that attract 30 birds each (20 + 10 more because they're so charming!), so that's 3 * 30 = 90 birds.  Then her store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and she has 3 of those, so that's 3 * 20 = 60 birds. In total, she can expect to see 90 + 60 = 150 birds in her garden!

150 

"
"Let's see... the bagel was $4, and the soup was 25% more, so that's $4 plus a dollar, which is $5. The cake was half the price of the bagel, so that's $2.  Adding it all up, the whole meal cost $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

"
"Oh my goodness, this sounds like a fun problem! Let's see... Kenny wants to go to the amusement park, which costs $100, and he has some spending money too.  He sold some of his Pokemon cards for $1.50 each and ended up with $50 extra. That means he made $50 from selling his cards.

If he sold each card for $1.50, he must have sold 50 / 1.50 = 33.33 cards. Since he can't sell parts of cards, he sold 33 cards.

He kept 1/3 of his cards, which means he sold 2/3 of them. If 33 cards represent 2/3 of his collection, then he started with 33 / (2/3) = 49.5 cards.  He can't have half a card, so he must have started with 50 cards! 


50 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky one! Let me see... if the caterer thought half the guests would want two hot dogs, that's 18 people.  But then he made enough for those 18 to have two each, plus enough for the other 18 to have one.  That's 54 hot dogs total! But then more people showed up!  Hmm... 54 hot dogs divided by two is only enough for 27 people to have seconds. That means 13 people were out of luck!

"
"Let's see... Indras has 6 letters in her name. Her sister has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so that's 6 / 2 = 3 letters.  Then add 4 more: 3 + 4 = 7 letters.  

Together, that's 6 + 7 = 13 letters!

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the shopping trip! Let's see... the pots and pans are $120.00, the mixing bowls are $20.00, and the utensils are $5.00 each, so that's $25.00 for those.  That brings her total to $165.00 before the discount.  With a 20% discount, she saves $33.00, making her final total $132.00. 


$132.00
"
"Let's see... Dora needs $6 + $11 + $2 = $19 for all the toys. She has $2 + $16 = $18.  That means she still needs $19 - $18 = $1 more.

"
"Oh my, slaying dragons is such a messy business! Let's see... Thaddeus slayed a hundred, Arthur got three-quarters of that, which is seventy-five. Walter, bless his heart, doubled Arthur's count, so that's one hundred and fifty.  Poor Bruce, forgetting his sword! He only managed one-fifth of Walter's total, which would be... thirty dragons.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  If they split 15 gallons into 5 containers, that means each container has 3 gallons. Josey needs a quarter of that, which is 0.75 gallons.  Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, she needs 6 pints of gas.

"
"Oh my goodness, this is a tricky one! Let me see... George spent $5 and had 1% left, so he used $5 - (1/100)*$5 = $4.95.  He bought 3 bags of chips, which cost $1.20, leaving $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 for candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.75, he must have bought $3.75 / $0.75 = 5 candy bars.

"Oh my goodness, that's easy! Ray shared 20 lollipops with his friends, and since he has four friends, each friend got 5 lollipops.

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of oranges! Let's see... Sitti and Juris have 34 + 22 = 56 oranges in total.  And there are 8 people to share them with.  So, each person would get 56 / 8 = 7 oranges. 


7 

"
"Oh darling, this is so simple! Let's see... Antoine needs double the onions, so that's 2 pounds times 2, which is 4 pounds. Those onions will cost him $8.00.  The beef stock is $4.00.  That makes a total of $12.00 for the whole soup.  Since it serves 6 people, each serving costs $2.00.

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic case of timing!  Bernadette needs to be a total of 21 minutes early.

"
"Oh, this is easy!  Let's see... if the room is 3 yards long, that's 9 feet.  And since the area is 360 square feet, we can find the width by dividing: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet. Now, to find the perimeter, we add up all the sides: 9 feet + 40 feet + 9 feet + 40 feet = 98 feet.

98 

"
"Let's see... Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads, so that's 20 + 40 = 60 beads. Margareth has 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red, which is 60 + 80 = 140 beads.  That means Margareth has 140 - 60 = 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the morning for Marcus! Let's see... the oven heats things up by 5 degrees every hour, so after 3 hours, it's 15 degrees warmer. That brings the temperature to 55 degrees.  But then the window cools things down. For every 10 minutes it's open, the temperature drops 2 degrees, and it's open for 30 minutes, so that's a total of 6 degrees cooler.  

So, the final temperature is 49 degrees. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  Jon takes 40 minutes to swim, 80 minutes to bike, and 50 minutes to run, for a total of 170 minutes. James is 10% faster swimming, so he takes 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes. But James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so that's 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James took 170 - 10 = 160 minutes total.  

That means James's run time was 160 - 36 - 85 = 39 minutes. 



"
"Oh my, that sounds complicated! Let me see... Movie C was an hour and a quarter, which is 75 minutes. Movie B was 5 minutes longer than that, so 80 minutes. And Movie A was a quarter the length of Movie B, so that's 20 minutes.

"
"Oh my, that's a tricky one! Let's see... if the horsey runs a mile for every half a bail of hay, and he runs 16 miles, that's 8 bails of hay he'll need.  Each bail costs $3, so that's $24 in total. Michael has $30, so he'll have $6 left over. 


$6
"
"Let's see... 4 dozen eggs is 48 eggs, and then she has 2 more, so that's 50 eggs total.  Each glass needs 5 eggs, so she can make 10 glasses of eggnog. If each tray holds 5 glasses, she can put out 2 trays.

"
"Oh my stars, this is a tricky one! Let's see... Joey starts with 214 points and gets 26 more, so he has 240 points. Marcy has 225 and gets 10 more, making her score 235.  That means Joey is winning by 5 points! 


5 

"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a classic case of retail savvy! Let's see... he made $340 from the flash sale and $775 from the department store, which means he earned a total of $1115.  Since he spent $576 on the sneakers, his profit is a fabulous $539! 


$539
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of crayons! Let's see... six packets had eight crayons each, so that's 6 times 8, which is 48 crayons. Then there were four packets with sixteen crayons each, so that's 4 times 16, which is 64 crayons.  Adding those together, Beatrice has a total of 112 crayons! 


112
"
"Oh my goodness, this is a tricky one! Let me see... if you saved $2 by not getting the super ticket, that means the regular price for everything was $2 more.  So, the movie ticket plus popcorn and soda cost $21.  Subtract the $12 movie ticket and the $3 soda, and that leaves $6 for the popcorn.  

$6 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of balloons! Let's see... if each balloon cost $45 before and the price went up by $20, that means each balloon now costs $65.  To fill 170 balloons at that price, Bentley would have to pay $65 times 170, which is $11050. 


$11050
"
"Oh darling, that's a classic physics problem!  Let me see... 

The car traveled for a total of 3 hours, covering 120 miles at 60 mph and then another 30 miles at 30 mph.  That's a total of 150 miles.  

To find the average speed, we simply divide the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

So the car's average speed for the whole trip was 50 mph. 



"
"Let me see... I started with 8 sapphires and traded 3 for rubies, so I have 5 sapphires left.  Those are worth 5 times $800, which is $4000.  And the two rubies are worth 2 times $1200, so that's $2400.  All together, my jewels are worth $6400! 


$6400
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of apples! Let's see... if they each eat 4 apples a day, that's 8 apples together.  And over 30 days, that would be 8 times 30... which is 240 apples!

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of potting soil! Let's see... 10 beds times 32 cubic feet per bed... that's 320 cubic feet total.  Each bag has 2 cubic feet, so he'll need 160 bags. At $12 a bag, that comes to a grand total of $1920. 

$1920 

"
"Oh my, this sounds like a tricky card trick! Let's see... if there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards, that means there are 15 * 0.60 = 9 more green cards.  So there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Now, the yellow cards are the same number as the red and green cards combined, which is 15 + 24 = 39 cards.

In total, there are 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards. 

78 

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a magical sight! Let's see... Katelyn saw 50 fairies, and then 25 more came to join them. That makes 75 fairies in total! But then 30 flew away, so there are 45 fairies left.

"
"Let's see... Jennifer's dog had 3 spotty puppies out of 8, and Brandon's had 4 spotty puppies out of 12.  That's a total of 7 spotty puppies out of 20 puppies altogether.  

So, 35% of the puppies have spots! 



"
"Oh my, that's a lot of feed! Let's see...  two boxes of sugar cubes, four bags of carrots, forty-two bales of hay, and twenty sacks of oats.  Hmm, if his truck can only carry 2250 pounds at a time, I think he'll need to make two trips. 



"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... Grayson earns 6 cents from cans and 15 cents from bottles each week, for a total of 21 cents. Over four weeks, that's 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents. 

84 

"
"Let's figure this out! Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick's 10, which means Toni has 60/100 * 10 = 6 extra plants. So Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants.

Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni's 16, meaning Shondra has 16 - 7 = 9 plants.

"
"Oh, that's easy! Leila gave Ali $50, so now he has $71. 



"
"Oh darling, tipping is so important! A tip of 1/5th of the cost is very generous.  That would be $3 for a $15 pizza.  So, Ashley should give the delivery man $18 in total. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the race! Let me see... Finley started in first, then went back a few spots, then forward, then back again, and finally forward one last time.  

I think she finished in 6th place. 



"
"Let's figure this out! Miss Maria has a lot of cards!  

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 in each, so that's 6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards.

Then she has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 in each, which is 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards.

That's a total of 150 + 200 = 350 cards!

But she keeps 50 for herself, leaving 350 - 50 = 300 cards for her students.

If each student gets 10 cards, she has 300 / 10 = 30 students.


30 

"
"Oh my goodness, this is a tricky one! Let's see... Becky got a great deal on those apples!  Kelly's apples were a bit pricier, even with her discount.  

Hmm, after doing some calculations, it looks like Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky. 


$1.00
"
"Oh darling, that's easy! Let's see... each room has two sheets, a comforter, and then twice as many pillowcases as sheets, which is four. And twice the pillowcases in towels, so that's eight towels.  That's 15 pieces per room, and with 80 rooms, that's a grand total of 1200 pieces of laundry! 


1200 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of shoes! Let's see...

Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. He gets 5 pairs on Monday, which is 10 more shoes. Then on Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs, that's 30 more shoes! And on Friday, he gets a whopping 30 pairs, so that's 60 more shoes!

That's 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes!

But then on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.  

So, on Sunday he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.


120

"
"Let's see... the paper cost $5 because it was $1 less than three times the price of the pen.  That means everything cost $2 + $5 = $7.  If Theo gave the cashier $10, her change is $10 - $7 = $3. 


$3
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

So, there were 30 students with 10 pencils each, meaning they started with 300 pencils total. After two months, they used up 1/5 of them, which is 60 pencils. That leaves 240 pencils. Then, at the end of the year, only 1/3 of those were left.  So, 240 pencils times 1/3 equals 80 pencils.

"
"Oh, this is a tricky one! Let's see... if Matt wants five cookies and gets two extra for cleaning, that means he can only have three cookies from eating carrot sticks.  Since he gets half the number of carrot sticks as cookies, he must eat six carrot sticks!

"
"Oh my, that's a big shark!  Let's see... those two little remoras are 6 inches each, so together they're 12 inches long.  The shark is 10 feet, which is 120 inches.  

So, the remoras are 10% the length of the shark.

"Oh, this is easy! If three-fourths of the students have computers, then one-fourth don't. That means those 20 students without computers represent one-fourth of the whole class.  So, there must be 80 students in total! 



"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see... three weeks is 21 days, and he walks four days a week, so that's 21 times 4, which is 84 days. He needs to walk for 240 minutes total, so each day he should walk 240 divided by 84, which is about 2.86 minutes.

"Oh darling, that sounds so romantic! Let's see... those plane tickets are a pretty penny at $5000 each, so that's $10,000 right there. And the hotel!  It's a busy weekend, so it's 20% more than the usual $1500 a night. That means each night is $1800. For three nights, that's $5400.  Adding it all up, the whole trip comes to $15,400. 


$15400
"
"Oh my goodness, this is a fun one! Let's see... Ben has lots of paint!  Jasper has half as much blue paint as Ben, so that's 4 / 2 = 2 tubes. But Jasper has three times as much yellow paint, which is 3 * 3 = 9 tubes!  In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"Let's see... the 2010 penny is three-quarters the weight of the 1959 penny, which weighs 48 grains.  That means the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains (48 x 3/4 = 36).  

Adding the two weights together, we get 84 grains (36 + 48 = 84).

"Okay, let's figure this out! Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, who has 20. That means Luri has 20 * 3 = 60 songs.

Gabriel can fit 100 songs total and has 20, so he can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs.

Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs.

That means Gabriel can add 80 - 40 = 40 more songs than Luri.

"Okay, so there are nine tall cheerleaders, and they're each 64 inches tall. That's a lot of inches!  Then there's one cheerleader who's a little shorter, at 60 inches.  

Let's see... they make a pyramid, with four on the bottom, then three, then two, and the shortest one on top.  Hmm... to figure out how tall the whole pyramid is, we need to add up all their heights.

*Nine cheerleaders times 64 inches each is 576 inches.

*Add the shortest cheerleader's height: 576 inches + 60 inches = 636 inches.

*Now we need to convert that to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 636 inches divided by 12 is 53 feet.

The pyramid is 53 feet tall!

"
"Oh, that's easy! Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works 8 hours a day. So that's 5 minutes/hour * 8 hours/day = 40 minutes of walking each day. Over 5 days, she walks 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes. 

200 

"
"Oh, this is easy!  If Angela will be three times Brett's age in four years, that means she'll be 14 * 3 = 42 years old then. Since that's in four years, she's currently 42 - 4 = 38 years old. 


38 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  Paul spends $8 each day on his drives. Over 14 days, that's $8 x 14 = $112. 

112 

"
"Oh darling, this sounds delicious! Let's see... Ashley brought 50 oranges (5 boxes times 10 oranges each), and Brianne brought 70 (50 plus 20 more). That's a total of 120 oranges. Since each pie needs 3 oranges, they can make 40 pies!

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic case of comparing apples and oranges! Let's see... Venue one has that pesky flat fee, but then you have to add the cost of food. Venue two is simpler, everything's bundled in.  

To figure out when they're the same price, we need to think about how many guests would make the food cost at venue one equal to the per-person cost at venue two. Hmmm... I'd say you'd need 10 guests for the costs to be equal.

"
"Okay, let me see...  

Bodhi found the most, and David found half of what Bodhi found.  Lily found even more than David!  Hmm... if we add up what they all found, it has to equal 43.  

Let me think... Bodhi found 18, David found 9, and that means Lily found 16! 


16
"
"Let's see... Mariah used a quarter of the skein, and her grandma used half. That's a total of three-quarters of the skein!  Since a skein has 364 yards, they used 3/4 * 364 yards = 273 yards altogether.

273 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's so thoughtful of Cherrie! Let's see... two of her friends want five gifts each, so that's 2 times 5, which is 10 gifts. Then the other three friends want two gifts each, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 gifts.  And then she buys 10 more surprise gifts!  Adding it all up, that's 10 + 6 + 10 = 26 gifts! 


26
"
"Oh darling, this is a fun one! Let's see... the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than that, so the rug is 8 feet wide.  Now, the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the rug's width is 16 feet, and 2 feet longer than that is 18 feet. So the couch is 18 feet long! 


18
"
"Oh my goodness, this sounds like Suzie had a fun time at the store! Let's see... she bought two packs of strawberry gum, and those were the only ones she didn't know the price of.  She spent $2 on grape and $1 on green apple, so that's $3 total. That means the strawberry gum cost $4 altogether. Since she got two packs, each one must have cost $2! 


$2
"
"Okay, let's see... Frederick wants the most popsicle sticks for his money.  He can get more sticks per dollar if he buys the 2 x 8 pieces of wood. If he buys four of those, he'll have enough wood to make 1600 popsicle sticks! 


1600 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of snowshoes! Let's see... six dogs times four legs each is 24 snowshoes. And at $12.00 a pair, that's going to be $288.00.  

$288.00 

"
"Oh, that's easy! If Janet takes two bus trips a day at $2.20 each, that's $4.40 a day.  Over five days, that's $22.00.  Since the weekly pass is only $20.00, she'd save $2.00. 


$2.00
"
"Oh my, that's a lot of animals! Let's see... the farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so that's 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, making 80 animals.  Together, they have 120 animals! 



"
"Oh, this is easy! If Rose bought four times as many onions and potatoes as Sophia, we just need to divide the number of Rose's veggies by four.  

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. That's a total of 4 veggies for Sophia.

"
"Oh darling, losing weight is such a common New Year's resolution!  Let's see... Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by July 19th, and today is December 31st. That gives him about 200 days.  To lose a pound, he needs to burn 3500 calories, so for 30 pounds, that's 105,000 calories!  

To figure out his daily deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories per day.

He needs a calorie deficit of 525 calories each day.  Good luck to Andy!


525 

"
"Oh, that's easy! If Gerald makes $30 a day and works for a whole week, that's $30 times 7, which is $210. Then, if he spends $100, he has $110 left. 


$110
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  If Hannah runs 8 laps at 0.25 km each, she'll run a total of 2 kilometers (8 x 0.25 = 2). Since she needs 60 ml of water per kilometer, she'll need 120 ml in total (2 x 60 = 120).

120 

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the shopping spree! Let's see... if Julie started with $500 and spent 20% on clothes, that's $100.  That leaves her with $400. Then she spends 25% of that on CDs, which is another $100.  So, Julie has $300 left. 


$300
"
"Oh darling, this is a classic! Let's see... if the house is three times the price of the lot, and together they cost $120,000, we can figure this out.  

Think of it like this: the lot is one part, and the house is three parts. That makes a total of four parts, right?

So, each ""part"" is worth $120,000 / 4 = $30,000.

The house, being three parts, would cost 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.

$90,000 

"
"Ooh, let's see! Tara bought a lot of bags!  She spent 8 packs times 5 bags per pack, which is 40 bags total.  Those cost her 40 bags times $4 per bag, so $160 altogether.  But she's clever, she sold them for $8 each, making 40 bags times $8 per bag, which is $320!  

That means she made a profit of $320 minus $160, or $160!

$160 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of punches! Let's see... 25 punches a minute for 3 minutes a round, and there are 5 rounds...  That's 375 punches in total! 



"
"Oh my goodness, this sounds like a delicious problem! Let's see... Suzanne made 36 cookies, and Josh made a fourth of that, so he made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies. Kelsie made twice as many as Josh, so she made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies. 

18 

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Ali has four $10 bills, which is $40, and six $20 bills, which is $120. That means he has a total of $160.

He gives half of that to his sister, so he gives away $80. That leaves him with $80.

Then he spends 3/5 of that $80 on dinner, which is $48.  

So, after buying dinner, Ali has $32 left. 



"
"Oh darling, that's a tricky one! Let's see... if Rob takes 2 hours, that's 120 minutes. Double that is 240 minutes, and Royce takes 40 minutes longer, so he takes 280 minutes. 


280 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of knitting! Let's see... each grandchild needs 2 skeins for a hat, 4 for a scarf, 12 for a sweater, 1 for mittens, and 2 for socks. That's 21 skeins per grandchild! And since there are three of them, she'll need 21 times 3, which is 63 skeins of wool. 


63 

"
"Oh my goodness, poor Chris! Let's see... he did 12 problems on Monday, and then 3 times that on Tuesday, so that's 12 * 3 = 36 problems.  That's a total of 12 + 36 = 48 problems done.  

He had 100 to start, so he has 100 - 48 = 52 left.  On Wednesday, he finished another 52 / 4 = 13 problems. That leaves him with 52 - 13 = 39 problems for Thursday.

39 

"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... Tony picks 6 quarts, Bobby picks 5, Kathy picks 10, and Ricky picks 8.  If you add those all together, they pick a total of 29 quarts per hour. 


29
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of bread! Let's see... they started with 200 loaves, sold 93 in the morning and 39 in the afternoon, so that's 93 + 39 = 132 loaves sold.  Then, if 6 were returned, they have 200 - 132 - 6 = 62 loaves left. 


62 

"
"Oh, this is easy!  Jackson can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. That means he'll have a total of 9 rows of beautiful flowers! 


9 

"
"Ooh, this sounds yummy! Let's see... if Heather splits the raisins evenly, she'll have 27 cups / 3 = 9 cups for the cookies.  Since each batch needs 3/4 cup, she can make 9 cups / (3/4 cup/batch) = 12 batches of cookies. 


12 

"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... Ada's bill will go up by $3.00 each day.  Since there are seven days in a week, her weekly bill will increase by $21.00. 


$21.00
"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means they paint 1/10 of the house each day.  With five people, they'd paint 5 times faster, so that's 1/2 the house per day!  So, it would take them just 2 days to paint the whole house. That's 48 hours! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she must have 22 chairs. Jenna has three times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 66 chairs.  Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 64 sofas.

That means they have a total of 84 sofas (20 + 64) and 88 chairs (22 + 66).  Adding those together, they have 172 sofas and chairs in total. 


172 

"
"Oh, that's easy! If Tom didn't buy the headphones, he could have bought 11 more CDs. 



"
"Oh my goodness, let me see if I can help with that!  

So, Josh worked out for 4 hours a week for most of the 8 weeks, right? That's 6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours.

Then he had a couple of busy weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each for two weeks straight, so that's 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours.

And one week he really went all out and did 6 hours!

Adding it all up: 24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours.

Josh worked out for a total of 40 hours! 



"
"Oh my, that sounds like a busy bus! Let's see... 

They start with 48 people, then 8 get off and 40 get on. That's 80 people! Then 21 get off and only 2 get on.  That leaves 61 people on the bus. 



"
"Oh darling, this is a bit of a brain teaser! Let's see... Jame is turning 27 in five years, so he's currently 22. In eight years, he'll be 30. His cousin will be 55 then, which means the cousin is currently 47. That's a difference of 25 years! 


25
"
"Oh darling, this is a fun little puzzle! Let's see... if the computer cost $1100 and the printer was $400 less, that means the printer cost $700.  Together, the computer and printer cost $1800, leaving $600 for the two monitors.  So each monitor must have cost $300. 


$300 

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like so much fun!  Let's see... if the boys found 60 shells each, and there were 10 boys, they brought back a total of 60 * 10 = 600 shells. The girls found 600 + (4 * 60) = 600 + 240 = 840 shells.  Since there were 10 girls, each girl found 840 / 10 = 84 shells.


84 

"
"Oh, this is easy! If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, that means he started with 8 candies.  Since Nick had twice as many as George, Nick must have had 16 candies.

"
"Let's see... Chenny is 10, and Alyana is 4 years younger, making her 6. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so she must be 8!

"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... the third book is 45 mm thick, and the fourth book is 62 mm thick.  Adding all the thicknesses together, we get 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm. 


188 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's easy!  Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs. 



"
"Ugh, splitting the check is always a hassle! So, half the bill is $25, and then I have to add a $10 tip on top of that because my wife is *so* generous.  

$35 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

The eldest boy starts with $6. Then he gets $5 more, so he has $11. The next day he gets another $10, bringing his total to $21.  He spends $8, leaving him with $13.  If he triples that amount, he has $39!


$39 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Elvis wants to save $1125 this month, and he wants to save double in the second half of April compared to the first.  Since April has 30 days, that means he has 15 days in each half.  

He needs to save $1125 / 2 = $562.50 in the second half of the month. To reach that goal, he'd need to save $562.50 / 15 days = $37.50 each day.


$37.50 

"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... three apples at $1.50 each is $4.50. Five oranges at $0.80 each is $4.00. And six peaches at $0.75 each is $4.50.  That's a total of $13.00. If she paid with $20.00, her change would be $7.00. 


$7.00
"
"Oh, that's easy! Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny. 



"
"Oh darling, this is a simple one!  If Jeff gets four times what Brad gets, think of it like splitting it into five parts.  Each part is worth $20. Jeff gets four of those parts, so he gets a fabulous $80! 



"
"Oh, that's easy!  If Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home, that's 6 miles a day.  And if he works 5 days a week, he walks 6 times 5, which is 30 miles! 


30 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of letters! Let's see... she writes the whole alphabet twice, so that's 26 times 2, which is 52 letters. Then she writes half, which is 26 divided by 2, so 13 more letters.  That's 52 plus 13, which is 65 letters. But then she writes them all again! So that's another 65.  

In total, she writes 130 letters! 


130
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of calls! Let's see... Ali calls 3 families first. Then each of those families calls 3 more, and so on.  So in the fourth round, it would be 3 times 3 times 3 times 3... that's 81 families! 


81
"
"Oh darling, that's easy! If Mark lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, that's a total of 30 pounds.  So, if he weighs 70 pounds now, he must have started at 100 pounds. 


100 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of toys! Let's see... James has 80 toys, and Jonathan wants a playset five times bigger, so that's 80 * 5 = 400 toys.  But he needs two more than that, so Jonathan has 400 - 2 = 398 toys.

398 

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Daniel needs to spend. 

Five notebooks will cost him 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.

Two pens will cost him 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.

The calculator is $12.00, and the geometry set is $10.00.

Adding those all up, we get $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

But wait! There's a 10% discount.  That means he saves $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00.

So, Daniel's final cost is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.


$27.00
"
"Oh darling, let's see! Five hamburgers at four dollars each is twenty dollars. Ten packs of fries at thirty cents a pack is three dollars. And five drinks at two dollars each is ten dollars. That's a total of thirty-three dollars. If she pays with a fifty dollar bill, she'll get seventeen dollars in change. 


$17
"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... Antonella sold $1000 worth of goods, so she earns a 30% commission on that, which is $300.  Then, on the extra $1500, she gets another 10% commission, which is $150.  Adding those together, she made a total of $450! 



"
"Oh my goodness, this sounds like quite the party! Let's see... Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so that's 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.  But he needs 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, meaning he'll need 70 * 2 = 140 bottles total.  That means he needs to buy 140 - 48 = 92 more bottles. 

92 

"
"Oh my, that's a tricky one! Let's see... if Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when it's cold, and twice that time plus two minutes when it's warm, that means he takes 34 minutes per mile in warm water.  

So for three miles, in cold water, it would take him 48 minutes (16 x 3). In warm water, it would take him 102 minutes (34 x 3). That means he takes 54 minutes longer in warm water. 


54 

"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... he makes $10 a day and wants to save $80.  That means it will take him 2 weeks. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot for lunch!  A footlong fish sub for $40 is already pricey, and then three times that for a six-inch cold-cut combo? That would be $120!  So, in total, it would cost $160.  

$160 

"
"Oh, that's a fun one! Let's see... 

If 7 buttons have two holes, that's 7 times 2, which is 14 holes.  The rest of the buttons have four holes, so that's 21 minus 7, which is 14 buttons. Those have 14 times 4, which is 56 holes.  

Adding those together, we get 14 plus 56, which is 70 holes! 


70 

"
"Oh my goodness, this is a tricky one! Let's see... Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's, which is 24 cubic inches. So Zack's locker is 12 cubic inches.  Peter's locker is a quarter the size of Zack's, meaning it's 3 cubic inches.

"
"Let's break this down!

We know Juan needs to cut back to 4 cups of coffee a day.  He currently drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, and she has half the recommended amount.  That means to figure out how much he needs to cut back, we need to know the recommended amount first.

Let's say the recommended amount is 'x' cups. Octavia drinks x/2 cups, and Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

Juan needs to reduce his intake by 5x - 4 cups. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of furry friends! Let's see... 3 cages of hamsters with 10 in each is 30 hamsters. And 3 cages of guinea pigs with 5 in each is 15 guinea pigs.  So, in total, there are 45 adorable rodents! 



"
"Oh darling, this is a simple one! Let's see... Mark weighs 150 pounds, and Susan is 20 pounds lighter, so she weighs 130 pounds.  Now, Bob is twice Susan's weight, making him 260 pounds.  

To find the average, we add up their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.  Then divide by 3 because there are three of them: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

So the average weight is 180 pounds. 


180
"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let me see... the sun starts at 32 degrees and goes up another 50 degrees.  That means the sun will be 82 degrees from the ground! 



"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see, the younger son is 8, so James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.  Since each pack has 5 candles, he'll need 20 / 5 = 4 packs.  That means he'll spend 4 * $3 = $12 on candles.

$12 

"
"Let's see... Judy read for 15 minutes a night for 7 nights, so that's 105 minutes in the first week.  If she reads 2 pages every 1.5 minutes, she read 105 minutes / 1.5 minutes/page = 70 pages in the first week.  Adding that to the 100 pages she read in the second week, she read a total of 170 pages. 


170 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky one! Let's see... if they started with 12 sandwiches, and Cody ate a third, that's 4 sandwiches. Then Trevor ate a quarter, which is 3 sandwiches.  That means they ate a total of 7 sandwiches.  If they started with 12 and ate 7, there must be 5 left! 


5 

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Shiloh will be 51 in seven years.  That means his nephew will be 17 then, since 51 divided by 3 is 17.  If the nephew is 17 in seven years, he must be 10 now! 


10
"
"Ooh, that's easy! The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5 for her first tooth, then $1 for each of the next three, so that's $3 more.  Then for the last two teeth, she got $0.50 each, for a total of $1.  So Sharon got $5 + $3 + $1 = $9 from the tooth fairy! 


$9.00
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Richie scored 80 goals, which is 20 more than Mark. That means Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.  Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna, so Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

To find the total, we add up all their goals: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 goals.


175 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's easy! Mitchell made $21 more than Liam.  

$21 

"
"Oh my goodness, this sounds like a fun problem! Let's see... Peter has $70 and wants to spend it evenly over a week. That's $10 a day!

He buys those fancy wooden action figures for $5 each from Sunday to Wednesday. That's four days of spending $5, so he spends $20 on those.

That leaves him with $50 for the rest of the week. Since the plastic ones are only $2 each, he can buy 25 of those!

Plus, he already has 4 wooden ones, so in total, he'll have 29 action figures by the end of the week. 


29 

"
"Oh my goodness, kittens can be so mischievous!  Let's see... the spaying was $200, and those three vaccines were $20 each, so that's $60.  And those poor vases! Four of them at $12 each is $48.  Adding it all up, the kitten has cost $308 so far. 



"
"Oh my, that's a lot of roses! Let's see... Ford grows 40 roses a week, but the shops need 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses. That means he's short 65 - 40 = 25 roses each week.  Over a whole month, that adds up to 25 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 100 roses.

100 

"
"Oh, that's easy! If Katina takes out $100 every month for two years, that's $100 * 12 months * 2 years = $2400.  So, she'll have $3000 - $2400 = $600 left in her account. 


$600
"
"Okay, let's break this down!

They spend $3.00 on bread, which makes 10 sandwiches, so each sandwich costs $0.30 for bread.  They also spend $30.00 on cheese and stuff for 10 sandwiches, so that's $3.00 per sandwich for those things.

That means each sandwich costs them $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30 to make.

They sell each sandwich for $7.00, so they make a profit of $7.00 - $3.30 = $3.70 per sandwich.

If they sell 10 sandwiches, their total profit is $3.70/sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $37.00.



$37.00
"
"Ooh, this sounds like fun! Let's see... Kate has a lot of crayons!  She can make 24 crayon muffins. If she sells each one for $1.50, she'll make $36.00!

"
"Oh darling, replacing carpet can be so expensive! Let's see...  

His bedroom is 18 by 12 feet, so that's 216 square feet. The carpet itself is $12 a square foot, plus $2 for padding, so that's $14 per square foot already. Then there's $4 to rip out the old carpet and $34 to put the new one in.  

Adding it all up, 216 square feet times $14 is $3024. Then 216 times $4 is $864, and 216 times $34 is $7344.  

Goodness, that's a lot of zeros!  $3024 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

It's going to cost Michael $11232 to replace his carpet.

"Oh my, counting birds sounds like fun! Let's see... if Mack saw 50 birds on the first two days, none on the third, 120 on days four and five, 20 on day six, and 90 on day seven, that's a lot of birds!  To find the average, we add up all the birds and divide by the number of days.  

That means he saw an average of 40 birds each day. 



"
"Okay, let me see... Diane starts with 20, adds half of itself (which is 10), making it 30. Then she divides that by 5, giving her 6.  Finally, she takes the starting number, 20, subtracts 12, leaving 8, and multiplies that by the 6.  That's 48!

"Let's see... the boy has 5 cards, and his brother has 3 less, so that's 2 cards.  Together they have 5 + 2 = 7 cards!

"Oh honey, that's a tricky one! Let's see... if her oven is 18 degrees hotter than it should be at 450, that means it's off by about 4%.  So, if she needs 520 degrees, she should set it to 499.2 degrees to compensate. 



"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... the first movie is an hour and a half, so that's 90 minutes. And the second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes, which is 125 minutes.  Add those together, and it's 215 minutes of movie time for Max! 



"
"Oh darling, that's easy! If Herb's house is worth $76,000 and Juan's is 30% less, that means Juan's house is worth $53,200.  Adding those together, the two houses are worth a combined $129,200. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of dishes! Let's see... Judy brought 12 cups and twice that many dishes, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.  That means she brought 12 + 24 = 36 utensils in total. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so that's 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.  Her friend brought 40 + 44 = 84 utensils. Altogether, they brought 36 + 84 = 120 utensils!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

So, Pete gets 90 contacts per box, and that lasts him 45 days. That means each pair of contacts lasts him about 2 days (45 days / 90 pairs = 0.5 days per pair).

Each box is $100, but it's 10% off, so that's $10 off.  That makes each box $90.

If he buys two boxes, that's $180 total (2 boxes * $90/box = $180).

He gets 180 pairs of contacts in total (90 pairs/box * 2 boxes = 180 pairs).

So, each pair of contacts costs him $1.00 ($180 / 180 pairs = $1.00/pair).

"Oh my goodness, let me see if I can figure this out!  

Jill worked a total of 3 hours, and John worked 7 hours. Since they both earn $10 an hour, Jill made $30 and John made $70. That means John earned $40 more than Jill.

"Okay, let's figure this out! Hannah burns 500 calories per hour doing aerobics, so in two hours, she burns 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.  Running burns 600 calories an hour, so that's another 600 calories. In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories. Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 1600 / 2 = 800 ml of water.

"
"Oh my goodness, this sounds like a tricky one! Let me see...  

If there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue ones, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue ones, we need to figure out how many of each color there are.  Since there are 4500 jelly beans in total, we can work backwards from there.  

Hmm, after some careful calculations, I think there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans. 



"
"Oh, this is easy!  If Jared increases his speed by 5 more words, he'll be typing at 57 words per minute.  To find the average, we add up all three speeds (47, 52, and 57) and divide by 3. That gives us 52 words per minute!

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a big difference!  Let's see... if Martin eats Cheerios, he'll lose 6.25 pounds in five weeks. But if he eats donuts, he'll gain 8.75 pounds! That means the difference would be 2.5 pounds. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the party! Let's see... 100 people invited by email, and each brings two friends, so that's 100 times 2, which is 200 friends.  Plus the original 100, that's 300 people already! Then 10 more friends from her personal list, and 8 of them are bringing their spouses... so that's 300 plus 10 plus 8, which makes a grand total of 318 people. Alex better get a lot of chairs!

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of doggies! Let's see... the little Affenpinscher is just 10 pounds. The Dachshund is twice that, so 20 pounds. The Papillon is a quarter of the Dachshund's weight, so 5 pounds. And the big Mastiff is 44 times the Papillon's weight... that's 220 pounds!

"
"Okay, let's see... so the boots are $16 on Amazon with $4 shipping, making them $20 total. On eBay, they're $13 plus double the shipping, which is $8. That means they're $21 on eBay.  So, the boots are $5 more expensive on eBay.

"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky one! Let's see... the beanstalk doubles in size each day.  It starts at 4 feet and needs to reach 20 feet. Hmm... on the third day it would be 16 feet times 2, which is 32 feet! So it would take 3 days.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms a day and each 100 grams has 3 grams of protein, that means he gets 6 grams of protein per day (200 / 100 * 3 = 6).  Over a week, that adds up to 42 grams of protein (6 * 7 = 42).

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if Jerry is twice as old as he was five years ago, that means he's grown quite a bit!  To figure out how old he'll be in three years, we need to know his current age.  

Since he's twice as old as he was five years ago, he must be 10 years old now.  In three years, he'll be 13!

"Oh my goodness, poor George! Dental work can be so expensive. Let's see... two implants at $2000 each is $4000.  And then the porcelain crown adds another $500. That brings the total to $4500.  But he already paid $600, so he still owes $3900. If he makes $15 an hour, he'll need to work 260 hours to cover the rest.

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if one angle is twice the smallest and another is three times the smallest, that means the smallest angle is like the foundation for the others.  

If we add them all up, the smallest plus twice the smallest plus three times the smallest has to equal 180 degrees. That's like saying 6 times the smallest angle equals 180.  

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees!  And the biggest angle is three times that, which is 90 degrees.

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of furry and feathered friends! Let's see... 5 doggies with 4 legs each is 20 legs. Then there are 2 kitties, also with 4 legs each, so that's 8 more. And the birdies, 10 of them with 2 legs each, add another 20.  Adding those all up, 20 + 8 + 20 gives us a grand total of 48 legs!

He starts with 5, then gets 12 more in the first year, plus 5 for Christmas, so that's 22 games.

The second year he gets 24 more games, plus another 5 for Christmas, bringing his total to 51.

In the third year, he gets a whopping 48 more games, plus 5 for Christmas, for a grand total of 104 games!

"Oh darling, this is a piece of cake! Let's see... Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, which means he makes 60 pounds an hour. Marissa is a bit slower, making only three-quarters of what Ruiz does, so she makes 45 pounds an hour. Together, they make a whopping 105 pounds every hour!  In a 12-hour day, they'd whip up a delicious 1260 pounds of chocolate.

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of lemonade! Let's see... he sold 15 cups an hour for four hours, so that's 15 times 4, which is 60 cups.  At 50 cents each, that's 60 times 0.50, or $30.00. Then he sold 10 cups an hour for two hours, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 cups. At 60 cents each, that's 20 times 0.60, or $12.00.  Adding those together, he made $30.00 + $12.00, which is $42.00!

"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that's a lot of rotations!  

Each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing a change.  Hmm, let me calculate...  

It will take 6 years before Jeremy needs new tires. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  If Jackie uses only one pump per wash, and the bottle gives 120 washes with two pumps, that means she'll get 120 washes / 2 = 60 washes out of the bottle.

That means each wash costs $24.00 / 60 washes = $0.40. Since she uses one pump per wash, each pump costs 40 cents.

"
"Ooh, let's see! Joe's got $50, and everything's 30% off. That shirt is $25, so with the discount, it's $25 - ($25 x 0.30) = $17.50. The shorts are $35, so with the discount, they're $35 - ($35 x 0.30) = $24.50.  

That means his total is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00.  

Joe will have $50 - $42.00 = $8.00 left over.

"
"Ooh, this is a tricky one! Let's see...  It costs $194 per meter to repave a street, and Lewis' street is 490 meters long, while Monica's is only 150 meters.  

First, we need to figure out how much it costs to repave Monica's street: $194 times 150 meters equals $29,100.

Then, we need to find out how much it costs for Lewis' street: $194 times 490 meters equals $95,060.

Finally, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street: $95,060 minus $29,100 equals $65,960.

So the answer is $65,960. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a very ambitious project! Let's see... John's initial funding was enough for 5 months, which means he had $500,000 to start.  But his research took ten times longer, so that's 50 months in total.  For the remaining 45 months, his funding increased by 50%, meaning each month cost $150,000.  That's a whopping $6,750,000 for those extra months! Adding that to his initial funding, the total cost of his research comes to $7,250,000.

$7,250,000

"Oh darling, laundry can be so expensive! Let's see... Gary washes his clothes twice a week, and each load guzzles 20 gallons of water.  If water costs $0.15 per gallon, that's 2 loads * 20 gallons/load = 40 gallons per week.  Over a whole year, that's 40 gallons/week * 52 weeks/year = 2080 gallons!  Multiply that by the cost per gallon, and we get 2080 gallons * $0.15/gallon = $312.  Goodness, that's a lot for just laundry!

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the shopping trip! Let's see... the aquarium was $10.00. Then she got two bags of rocks for $2.50 each, so that's $5.00.  And three pieces of coral at $2.00 each is $6.00.  The fish were $0.50 each, and she bought 20, so that's $10.00. And don't forget the fish food for $2.00!  

Adding it all up, she spent $33.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

There are 4 rows with 18 seats each, so that's 4 * 18 = 72 seats total.

The administrators took up 1/4 of the seats, which is 72 / 4 = 18 seats.

That leaves 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

The parents took 1/3 of the remaining seats, which is 54 / 3 = 18 seats.

That means 54 - 18 = 36 seats were for the students.


So there were **36** students in the auditorium.

"Okay, let's see... Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. He chews 4 pieces at school because he chews one every two hours and school is 8 hours long. Then he chews one on the way home and one after dinner, so that's 6 pieces total. That leaves him with 14 pieces.  He gives half of those to his sister, which is 7 pieces.  So Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  Four apples cost $5.20, so one apple costs $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.  Three oranges cost $3.30, so one orange costs $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.  Five apples would cost $1.30 x 5 = $6.50, and five oranges would cost $1.10 x 5 = $5.50.  That means Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00 for five apples and five oranges.

"Okay, let's figure out the cost of Bill's fancy new truck!

The base price is $30,000.  

The king cab is an extra $7,500.

Leather seats are $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The light package is $1,500.

Adding all the extras: $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500

Finally, the total cost is $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500.

"Oh darling, let's see... James is quite the dapper dresser!  

He bought 10 suits at $750 each, so that's 10 * $750 = $7500.

His dress pants were a steal at $750 / 5 = $150 each, and he got 10 of those, for a total of 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, for the shirts! He got 3 shirts for every suit, so that's 10 suits * 3 shirts/suit = 30 shirts. At $60 a pop, those shirts cost 30 * $60 = $1800.

Adding it all up, his grand total is $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

"Let's break this down!

Ariadne made $400 from red hats, which was half the amount she made from green hats. That means she made $400 * 2 = $800 from green hats.

In total, she made $400 + $800 = $1200 in the first month.

The second month, she made 3/4 of that amount, so she made $1200 * (3/4) = $900.

Over the two months, she made a total of $1200 + $900 = $2100.

That's $15,000 a month to keep that beauty in the air! Over a whole year, that's $180,000. Add that to the initial cost, and we're looking at a grand total of $330,000 for James's first year of flying high! 


$330000
"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the meal! Let's see... Finley cooked the rice for 30 minutes, and the pork took 20 minutes longer than that, so 50 minutes.  The beans took half the time it took to cook the rice and pork together, which is 80 minutes total. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.  So, all together, it took 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes to cook everything.

"
"Oh darling, this is a simple matter of comparing prices! Let's see...

The first mixture has half a pound of almonds and a third of a pound of walnuts, costing $5 each, for a total of $10. The second mixture has a fifth of a pound of almonds and a third of a pound of walnuts, costing $2 and $5 respectively, for a total of $7.

That means the first mixture is $3 more expensive.

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if each sheep has four legs and each goose has two, and there are 70 legs in total, we need to figure out how many of each animal there are.  We also know there are 20 heads in total. Hmm...

I think there must be 15 sheep on Lee's farm. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the coffee conundrum! Let's see... if his usual coffee is $5 a pound and the new one is 20% more, that means it's $5 + ($5 x 0.20) = $6 a pound.  He needs a pound a day for a week, so that's 7 pounds total, which comes to 7 * $6 = $42.  And don't forget the donut!  So, in total, everything costs $42 + $2 = $44. 


$44
"
"Let's see... Gus spent $20.00 total. The chips were $4.00, the chicken was $8.00, and the soda was $1.00.  That's $13.00 altogether.  So the apple pie must have cost $7.00. 


$7.00
"
"Let's see... James delivers 600 newspapers total. He takes 198 to District A and 209 to District C. That means he delivers 600 - 198 - 209 = 193 newspapers to District B. 


193
"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... he's in class for 4 times a week times 2 hours each, so that's 8 hours a week. Over 6 weeks, that's 48 hours total. And since he learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, he'll learn 32 recipes! 



"
"Okay, let's break this down!  

If 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, that means there are 150 * 0.60 = 90 history teachers.  That leaves 150 - 90 = 60 math teachers.

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours, all the math teachers together sleep for 60 * 6 = 360 hours.


360 

"
"Oh darling, this is a fun one! Let's see... Aurelia has $120, and Kassidy has three-quarters of that, which is $90. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, making her total $150.  

If they pool their money, they'd have $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.  Splitting that evenly means each of them would have $120. 


$120 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky one! Let's see... four quarters times twelve minutes each is forty-eight minutes.  But then they had to play five more minutes because of the tie.  So, the whole game lasted fifty-three minutes!

"
"Oh darling, that's a simple one! Let's see... 20% of 50 employees is 10, and 30% of those 10 is 3.

"
"Okay, so Svetlana needs 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons of dry ingredients for each muffin.  To make 16 muffins, she'll need 8.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons. 

132 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of candy! Let's see... if they put all their candy together, they'd have 12 pounds.  And since there are three of them, they'd each get 4 pounds. 


4 

"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... 7 candies of type A cost 7 times $0.50, which is $3.50. And 10 candies of type B cost 10 times $0.75, which is $7.50.  So, all together the candies cost $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00. If Adam paid with $15.00, his change would be $15.00 - $11.00 = $4.00.

$4.00 

"
"Let's see... Christina had 12 good days in total. She already had 8 good days, then one more good day, and then another good day. That's 10 good days already.  So she has 2 good days left.

"
"Oh darling, this is a simple bit of arithmetic!  If Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, and Janey has 21 books, we can figure it out. Let's see... twice the number Sally has plus 3 equals 21.  Subtract 3 from both sides, and then divide by 2.  Sally must have 9 books. 


9 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a tall bamboo!  Let's see... it grows 30 inches every day, and it's already 20 feet tall, which is 240 inches.  So it needs to grow another 360 inches to reach 600 inches.  

That means it will take 12 days! 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of pups! Let's see... James starts with 4 toys for 4 doggies. Then 8 more furry friends arrive, so he needs 8 more toys.  But wait, there are twice as many dogs now! That's 16 more pups, meaning he needs 16 more toys.  

In total, that's 8 + 16 = 24 toys. But then 3 doggies find their forever homes, so he doesn't need those toys anymore. That leaves him needing 24 - 3 = 21 toys.

21 

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic investment puzzle! Let's see... Dylan put in a hefty chunk, 2/5 of the whole $1200, which is $480. That leaves $720. Frances, always generous, chips in 2/3 of that, another $480.  That means Skyler's investment is the rest, a tidy $240. 


$240
"
"Okay, let's see... they want 100 signatures total and already have 64.  That means they need 36 more! 


36
"
"Oh darling, that's easy! Karen earns double what Lorie does, so she makes $10 * 2 = $20 an hour.  If she works 3 hours a day, that's $20 * 3 = $60 per day. Over two days, she'd make $60 * 2 = $120.

120 

"
"Oh darling, that's simple! If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then 96 potatoes would make a whopping 576 hash browns!  

 576 

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a lot of people! Let's see... eight adults at 80 kg each is 640 kg.  Add Jack's 80 kg, and that's 720 kg total.  They're going over the limit by 20 kg! 

20 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of cookies! Let's see... Katarina has 68, and Max has 5 more than her, so that's 73. The Cookie Monster has 12 less than Max, which is 61. And Summer has a whopping 23 more than Max, making it 96!  

Adding them all up, 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies! 


298
"
"Oh darling, this is a fun little puzzle! Let's see... if the dress is 140cm long now and that includes an extra 20cm of lace, then the dress itself must be 140 - 20 = 120cm long after the extension.  

Since the extension was 50% of the original length, that means the original dress was 120cm / 1.50 = 80cm long. 


80 

"
"Oh, that's a fun little problem! Let's see... if Chris mows half the lawn in turtle mode, which takes him a whole hour, that's 60 minutes.  So that's 30 minutes for half the lawn. Then the rabbit mode is 40 minutes total, so half of that is 20 minutes.  Adding those together, it took him 50 minutes! 



"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a tight schedule! Let's see... they've already spent 6 minutes plus 13 minutes, so that's 19 minutes.  They have 30 minutes total, so they have 11 minutes left to get to school on time. 


11
"
"Let's see... she spends $4 on apples, $4 on bananas, and $6 on oranges.  That means she spends a total of $14. 


14
"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds delicious! Let's see... Celinda bakes double Greta's amount, so she makes 30 * 2 = 60 cookies.  Together they have 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. After they sneak a few, there are 90 - 10 = 80 cookies left for the box.

80 

"
"Okay, let me see...  

There's one twin who's older than one of the triplets by 7 years.  If all their ages add up to 44, we need to figure out how old the twin is. Hmm...

Let's think about it this way. If we take away the 7 years from the older twin, we're basically looking at ages that add up to 37 (44 - 7 = 37).  

That means the twin and the triplets together would be 37 years old. Since there are two twins and three triplets, that's five people in total.

So, each person would be 7.4 years old on average (37 / 5 = 7.4).

But remember, one twin is 7 years *older*! So that twin must be 14.4 years old (7.4 + 7 = 14.4).

 



"
"Oh my goodness, poor John!  Let's see... he has 3 hours until dinner, which is 180 minutes.  And his homework will take 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes. That means he has 180 - 80 = 100 minutes for a nap!

100 

"
"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... five lollipops cost $2.00, and the candies cost $1.20. That means each candy costs $0.30.  If he buys ten lollipops, that's $4.00, and ten candies would be $3.00.  So, ten lollipops and ten candies would cost him $7.00! 


$7.00
"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Neil saves 2/5 * 20 coins = 8 more coins than Rong each month. That means Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Over ten years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.


5760 

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a lot for poor doggy! Let's see... two vaccines at $20 each is $40.  And the heartworm check is 60% of the total, so that's tricky.  If the total was $100, the heartworm check would be $60, so it must be less than that. Hmmm...  

If John brought $125 and the total bill is $64, he'll have $61 left. 


$61
"
"Oh darling, calculating the price of that crate is a piece of cake! Let's see... those apples are $0.50 each, and the bananas are double that, so $1.00 a pop. Those juicy oranges are the priciest at $3.00 each.  

So, 5 bananas at $1.00 each is $5.00. Then 12 apples at $0.50 each is $6.00. And finally, 7 oranges at $3.00 each is $21.00.

Adding it all up, the crate comes to a delightful $32.00! 



"
"Okay, let's see... Brittany has a lot of squares on her comforter!  

She has 14 red ones, then 4 more blue, so that's 18 blue squares.  Then she has 6 more green than blue, making 24 green squares.  Finally, she has 12 fewer white squares than green, so that's 12 white squares.

Adding them all up: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, her comforter is 68 square feet. 


68 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of people! Let's see... Mia has 8 high chairs and 5 times that many regular chairs, so she has 8 * 5 = 40 regular chairs. That's a total of 40 + 8 = 48 chairs.  But she needs enough for 42 adults and 15 babies, which is 42 + 15 = 57 people.  She needs 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs. 


9 

"
"Oh my, that sounds like a tricky problem! Let me see...  If half the deer are bucks, that's 25 bucks. And if 20% of those are 8-pointers, then there must be 5 eight-point bucks. 


5
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam's 50, so she has 50 + (0.30 * 50) = 65 points.

Tom has 30 fewer points than Betty, meaning he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected three times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Adding up all their points, the class has 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 - 255 = 145 more points to go on their trip. 


145
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of babies! Let's see... Grandma has 3 kids, and each of them has 3 kids, so that's 9 grandkids. And each of those grandkids has 3 babies... so that means there are 27 great-grandbabies! 


27
"
"Oh honey, let's break this down! Greta's paycheck is $2400.00, and she's a smart cookie saving 50% for retirement, which is $1200.00. Then, her car payment takes another 20%, or $480.00.  That means she's spent a total of $1680.00.  

So, she has $720.00 left to spend.  



"
"Oh, that's easy! If there are 16 pencils left, that means there are 8 pairs.

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the firework show! Let's see... they're setting off 15 boxes with 20 fireworks each, so that's 15 times 20, which is 300 fireworks. Hannah can see 40% of those, so that's 300 times 0.40, which equals 120 fireworks. And she's setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, so that's 3 times 5, which is 15 more fireworks.  In total, she'll see 120 plus 15, which is 135 fireworks! 


135 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of snacks and drinks! Let's see... 20 people times 2 drinks each is 40 drinks. And 20 people times 3 snacks each is 60 snacks. That's a total of 100 drinks and snacks!  If each one costs $2, then they spent $200 in total. 


$200
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Gordy's truck can haul 800 more pounds than Gissela's 4000-pound truck, so Gordy can haul 4800 pounds. Together, Gissela and Gordy can haul 8800 pounds.  That means Gary's truck must be able to haul the rest: 11600 - 8800 = 2800 pounds.


2800 

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a lot of dumplings! Let's see... if each of the six lovely ladies ate three dumplings, that's 18 dumplings in total for them.  And the eight gentlemen, including Larry, each had one more than the ladies, so they ate four dumplings each. That means they ate a total of 32 dumplings.  Adding those together, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings!

"
"Oh, this is easy! Gerald got $60, and then he spent $10, so he has $50 left.

"
"Oh, that's easy! If the cat is zooming along at 15 feet per second, and the turtle is five times slower, that means the turtle crawls at 3 feet per second.  So in 40 seconds, the turtle would crawl a total of 120 feet. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's so wonderful that the firefighters are raising money! Let's see... they need $4200 more and they raise $700 each hour.  If they keep up that pace, they'll need to fundraise for another 6 hours. 



"
"Oh, this is a tricky one! Let me see... Colorado City uses a lot of the river's water, but not all of it goes to factories and things.  If they use 40% of the whole river, and 80% of *that* is for industry, then the rest must be for other things, right?  

So, 40% times 20%... that's 8%!  Colorado City uses 8% of the river's water for non-industrial stuff.

"
"Oh, that's easy! If Alex makes $12 a day and there are 7 days in a week, she makes $12 * 7 = $84 per week.  For two weeks, she'd make $84 * 2 = $168. 


168 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of ice cream! Let's see... if they make 100 quarts of chocolate in 2 hours, that's 50 quarts per hour. And the vanilla, 50 quarts in 4 hours means they make 12.5 quarts per hour.  Together, that's 62.5 quarts every hour!  In 48 hours, they'd make a whopping 3000 quarts! 


3000
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of yummy treats! Let's see...

* Those croissants are $15.00.
* The cinnamon rolls add up to $10.00.
* The mini quiches are $12.00.
* And the blueberry muffins are $13.00.

That's a subtotal of $50.00. But wait, he has a loyalty card! 10% off means he saves $5.00.

So his total bill is $45.00. 



"
"Ooh, ice cream! Let's see... if each scoop is $1.50 and she gets one free for every two she buys, she should totally get three scoops! That way she gets the deal and has a little money left over.

"Oh, that's easy!  If he needs 24 tiles per square foot, and he's covering two-thirds of a 36 square foot bathroom, he'll need 576 tiles. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a fun problem! Let's see... James spent $20 to get in and then $1.50 for every pound of blueberries. Since he picked 30 pounds, that's $1.50 x 30 = $45 just for the blueberries.  Adding the entry fee, his total cost was $45 + $20 = $65.

If he bought them at the store, it would have cost $2.50 per pound, so that's $2.50 x 30 = $75.

He saved a whole $10 by picking his own blueberries! 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's quite a price jump! Let's see... if each computer is now $770, and they need 500, that means they'll be spending 770 times 500.

That comes out to $385,000! 


$385,000

"Oh darling, that omelet sounds delicious! Let's see... six eggs at 75 calories each is 450 calories. Then there's the cheese, 2 ounces at 120 calories per ounce, so that's 240 calories. And the ham, another 2 ounces at 40 calories per ounce, adds up to 80 calories.  Adding it all together, that omelet is a whopping 770 calories!

"Oh, this is a classic probability problem! Let's see... 

If 30% of the 100 applicants get interviews, that's 30 people. Then, only 20% of those 30 get job offers, so that's 6 people. Finally, only a third of those 6 actually accept the job, which means only 2 people end up taking the position.

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of rice! Let's see... Goldy gave away 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 to her brother, that's 7 sacks in total.  If each sack has 25 kilograms, then she gave away 7 * 25 = 175 kilograms of rice.

"Oh my, that Helga is quite the dancer! Let's see... she taps her feet so fast!  

When her arms are down, she taps 300 times with her right foot and 250 times with her left foot every minute. That's 550 taps a minute! She dances like that for 3 minutes, so that's 550 times 3, which is 1650 taps.

When she raises her arms, she slows down to 200 taps per minute with each foot. So that's 400 taps a minute total. She dances like that for 2 minutes, so that's 400 times 2, which is 800 taps.

In total, she taps 1650 + 800 times, which is 2450 taps!

"Oh honey, that's a tough situation! Let's see... Ron would save a whopping $255 by fixing the pothole himself.  Think of all the fabulous things he could do with that extra cash! 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of chairs! Let's see... if they started with 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs, and then 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs went to the carpenter, they would have 160 chairs left. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of pizza! Let's see... five pizzas with 12 slices each is 60 slices total.  Bryce and two friends ate two-thirds of their pizzas, so that's 24 slices. The other two friends ate three-quarters of theirs, which is another 18 slices.  That means they ate a total of 42 slices.  

So, there were 18 slices left! 



"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... the kitty takes 30 minutes to gobble down those sausages, and the doggy is a bit faster, taking only 2/3 of that time.  That means the doggy finishes in 20 minutes.  

To find the average, we add their times together (30 + 20 = 50 minutes) and then divide by two since we have two furry friends.  

So, the average time is 25 minutes! 



"
"Oh my stars, that's a big shoe! Let's see... Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches, which is 100 inches.  And it's 10 inches longer than 9 times the size of Bobby's shoe.  

If we subtract 10 inches from Topher's shoe size, we get 90 inches. That means Bobby's shoe is 90 inches divided by 9, which is 10 inches long.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's terrible!  Let's see... if there are 64 student cars with 4 windows each, that's 64 * 4 = 256 windows.  And 32 teacher cars with 2 windows each is 32 * 2 = 64 windows.  If Hannah smashes a quarter of the student windows, that's 256 / 4 = 64 windows. And three-quarters of the teacher windows is 64 * (3/4) = 48 windows.  In total, she smashes 64 + 48 = 112 windows. Poor Hannah, she must be really stressed!

"
"Let's see... Candy has a lot of thread!  

If she has 15 light blue and 45 dark blue spools, that's a total of 60 blue spools.  And she has 150 spools in all.  

That means 40% of her spools are blue! 



"
"Oh my, that sounds like a busy polling station! Let me see... if 2/5 voted by midday, that leaves 3/5 who haven't voted yet.  Then, 2/3 of *those* people voted by 4 pm.  Hmm, that means 1/3 of the people who were left after midday still hadn't voted.  

So, 1/3 of 3000 people... that's 1000 people! 


1000 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's easy!  Parker needs 4 pieces a day, so in 30 days, he'll chew 4 x 30 = 120 pieces. Since each pack has 15 pieces, he'll need 120 / 15 = 8 packs of gum.

"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Dora is 15, and her dad is eight more than twice her age, so he's (15 * 2) + 8 = 38 years old.  Her mom is four years younger than her dad, making her 38 - 4 = 34 years old.  

Adding them all up, Dora, her dad, and her mom are 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years old together.

"Okay, let's see... Cindy has a lot of books!  Her math and science books each weigh 2 pounds, so those are 2 + 2 = 4 pounds together. Her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. Her history book is double her English book, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 pounds.  Adding it all up: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds.

"
"Oh my goodness, this is a tricky one! Let's see... Candidate B got 50% more votes than Candidate A, who got 20%. That means Candidate B got 20 + (50/100)*20 = 30% of the votes.  

That leaves 100% - 30% = 70% of the votes for Candidate C. Since there were 100 voters, Candidate C received 70 votes.

"Oh my, this is a tricky one! Let's see... Boris starts with 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer, so Beck has 77. If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck will have 87, and Boris will have 90. That means Boris has 3 more apples than Beck now.

"
"Let's see... Clara has 20 books, and that's twice the number Steven has. So Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, meaning she has 10 + 6 = 16 books.  That means Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.

"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a lot of milk! Let's see... if a gallon jar is $5 and a half-gallon is $3 less, then 10 gallons would be $50. And 16 half-gallons would be $48.  Adding those together, Cecelia spent $98 on all that milk! 


98
"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... if 10 like to bake and 5 like basketball, and the rest like video games or music, we need to figure out how many like music first.  Twice the number of basketball players like music, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 music lovers.  

That means 50 - 10 - 5 - 10 = 25 students like video games. 


25
"
"Oh my, that's terrible! Poor birdies! Let's see... if 12 birds were there and a third flew away, that's 4 birds gone.  That leaves 8. Then 20 more came?  So there must be 28 birds now! 


28
"
"Oh, this is easy! If each class has the same number of students, that means there are 40 students in each class.  If 40% are girls, then there must be 24 boys in each class.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of cake! Let's see... she started with two slices, added three more, so that's five. Then she tripled it, so that's fifteen slices! But then she ate two, leaving thirteen. And then her friend took five? Oh dear, that leaves only eight slices.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of furry and feathered friends! Let's see... if Melissa grooms them evenly throughout the week, she'd groom 4 animals each day. 



"
"Oh darling, let's see if we can figure out Mark's profit!

He spent $5400 on those packs of cards.  Those fancy cards he got are worth $5000 all together, and the other cards add up to $1500. That means he made a total of $6500.

Subtract his expenses, and he made a profit of $1100! 


$1100
"
"Oh my goodness, this is easy! Let's see... two adults at $14 each is $28, and two children at $10 each is $20. That means the second amusement park would cost $48.  The first park would cost $52 for the adults and $24 for the children, totaling $76.  

They would save $28 by going to the second park! 


$28
"
"Oh, that's easy!  If he saves $0.10 per tomato and sells 500 a day, that's $50 a day!  Over a week, that's $350. 


$350
"
"Oh my, this sounds like a tricky marble situation! Let's see... Sean has 56 marbles, and Cal has twice that amount, so Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles. Now, Carl has four times as many as Sean, meaning he has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.  Adding Carl's and Cal's marbles together, we get 224 + 112 = 336 marbles.

336 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of students!  Let's see... if they need 12 groups and only have enough for 6 right now, they need 6 more groups.

"
"Oh darling, this is a simple matter of multiplication! Let's see... 60 chairs a day during the week, that's 300 chairs for the whole week. And 100 chairs a day on the weekend adds another 200, making it 500 chairs a week.  In a month, that's 2000 chairs! And for two months? Why, that's a fabulous 4000 chairs!

4000 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky one! Let's see... Gunther started with 48 bananas, and that sneaky Arnold took half, which is 24.  That leaves Gunther with 24 bananas. Then he adds 25 more, so he has 49! But then Arnold takes another 12, leaving Gunther with 37. Finally, Gunther adds 6 more, for a grand total of 43 bananas. 

So the answer is 43! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. If the bill is $100 and there are 4 roommates splitting it evenly, each roommate pays $25 a month.  Over a year, that's $25 x 12 months = $300.

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the party! Let's see... Jeff started with 8 dozen glasses, which is 96 glasses, and 4 dozen plates, which is 48 plates.  After the party, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. That means he has 86 glasses (96 - 10) and 42 plates (48 - 6) left.  

In total, Jeff has 128 glasses and plates now. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Lorraine starts with a lot of stickers.  She's smart to trade them for buttons, they seem more useful.  

First, she trades most of her small stickers for big buttons. Then she trades half her big stickers for more big buttons, and the rest for even more small buttons.  

Hmm, let me see... *counts on fingers*

She ends up with 107 buttons! 



"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see, he played 2 matches on Monday, 1 on Friday, and double the Monday amount on Saturday, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 matches.  In total, he played 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 matches.

"
"Oh, this is a fun little puzzle! Let's see... if there are twice as many ""yes"" votes as ""no"" votes, and there are 33 people in total, we can figure this out.  

If we think of the ""no"" votes as one group, the ""yes"" votes are two groups of the same size. That means there are three groups in total.

So, 33 people divided by 3 groups equals 11 people per group. Since the ""yes"" votes are two groups, there must be 11 * 2 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation. 


22
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

*  If 11 students need extra-small shirts, and twice that number need small, then 11 * 2 = 22 students need small shirts.
* Four less than the number needing small shirts need medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need medium shirts.
* Half as many students need large shirts as medium, meaning 18 / 2 = 9 students need large shirts.
* Finally, 6 more students need extra-large shirts than large shirts, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need extra-large shirts.

Adding all the sizes together: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts.

Krissa needs to order 75 shirts.

"Oh darling, that's easy! A 5% discount on a $140 bag means you'll only pay $133.  



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of music! Let's see... 300 songs per playlist times 20 playlists is 6000 songs. And if each song is 10 hours long, that's 60,000 hours of music! 

60000 

"
"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... 20% of 50 people is 10 people who like horse #2. That leaves 40 people.  If 60% of *those* people like horse #7, that's 24 people.  That means 16 people must think horse #12 will win!

"
"Ooh, puppy math! Let's see... if 6 Pomeranian girls are one-third of all the Pomeranians, then there must be 6 x 3 = 18 Pomeranians in total.  And since Pomeranians are two-thirds of all her puppies, Jana must have 18 x 3 / 2 = 27 puppies! 


27
"
"Oh my goodness, that's so sweet of Ava to help her brother! Let's see... Jayden has $70 and Ava gave him $45, so that's $70 + $45 = $115.  But the camera costs $200, so he still needs $200 - $115 = $85. 


$85 

"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a tricky one! Let's see... if the three houses need 250 cases in total, and the first house needs half of what the second house needs, and the third house needs double the first...  

Well, let me think... the third house will need 100 cases of shingles. 



"
"Oh my goodness, let's see! Leila spent $6 on cucumbers, Jack spent $5 on tomatoes, and Chase spent $3 on lettuce.  Adding those together, they spent a total of $14 on their delicious salad!

"
"Oh darling, this is a simple bit of arithmetic! If George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas, that means he has 200 + (200 * 0.45) = 290 pears.  Adding those to his bananas, he has a total of 290 + 200 = 490 fruits. 


490 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's so sweet of Marissa! Let's see... if she had $80 and spent $20 on a ball, she has $60 left for candy bars.  Since each candy bar costs $5, she could buy 12 candy bars for Jimmy! 


12
"
"Oh, that's easy!  If Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges for 1 liter of juice, then for 4 liters he'll need 20 kilograms (4 x 5 = 20). Since each kilogram costs $3, the total cost would be $60 (20 x 3 = 60). 


$60
"
"Oh, this is easy!  Let's see, Ezra read 300 books and then 150 more, so that's 300 + 150 = 450 books for Ezra. Ahmed read half as many as Ezra, so he read 300 / 2 = 150 books. Altogether they read 450 + 150 = 600 books!

600 

"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... Tanya earns $15 per hour, so on Monday she made $15/hour * 5 hours = $75.  Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5, bringing her Monday total to $80. On Wednesday, she made $15/hour * 2 hours = $30.  

Adding those together, Tanya made $80 + $30 = $110 for both days.


110 

"
"Oh darling, this is a simple matter of addition and subtraction! They sold 20 vanilla scents (4 scents x 5 sales each) and 16 fruity scents (8 scents x 2 sales each).  That means they sold 4 more vanilla scents than fruity scents.

"
"Oh my, that's a tricky one! Let's see... Bennet makes $60 from his eggplants, so he needs to make another $75 from the corn.  If he has 25 ears of corn, he should sell each one for $3 to reach his goal. 


$3 

"
"Let's see... Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 on Sunday, so that's 12 hours total.  She reads for 3 hours, leaving 9 hours. If she spends a third of that time on video games, that's 3 hours for games. That means she has 6 hours left for soccer.  

Out of 12 hours, 6 hours is half, so she spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer. 


50
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky one! Let's see... Anthony started with 50 pencils, and gave half to Brandon, so that's 25 pencils.  Then he gave Charlie 3/5 of the rest, which is 15 pencils. That means Anthony kept 10 pencils for himself. 


10
"
"Oh darling, that's easy!  Let's see... two hours to get there, two hours to come back, and six hours exploring all those fascinating exhibits. That's a total of ten hours away from home.

"
"Oh my, that sounds like a lot of toys! Let's see... Henry needs 4 wheels for each car and 2 for each motorcycle.  That means he'll need 228 wheels for the cars (57 cars * 4 wheels) and 146 wheels for the motorcycles (73 motorcycles * 2 wheels).  In total, he needs 374 wheels (228 + 146). If he has 650 wheels, he'll have 276 left over (650 - 374).

276 

"
"Oh darling, a 20% discount on a $1000 laptop means you'd save $200! That brings the price down to a fabulous $800. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of movies! Let's see...  

If a third of his 600 movies are in series and he gets a deal on those, that's 200 movies.  If each series movie is a third of the price of a regular movie, those will cost $666.67.

Then there are 400 movies left.  Forty percent of those are older and cost $5 each, so that's 160 older movies for $800.

That leaves 240 newer movies at the regular price of $10 each, which is $2400.

Adding it all up, replacing all those movies will cost Mike $3866.67. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of fruit! Let's see... 6 pounds of peaches at $2.00 a pound is $12.00. Then 8 pounds of plums at $1.00 a pound is $8.00. And finally, 6 pounds of apricots at $3.00 a pound is $18.00.  Adding those all together, Winston spent $38.00 on all that delicious fruit!



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  They drove for 4.5 hours (6 hours total - 1.5 hours hiking) at 50 miles per hour, so they covered 225 miles (4.5 hours * 50 miles/hour). Then they hiked 30 miles (20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours).  Adding those together, their vacation spot is 255 miles away! 


255
"
"Oh my stars, this sounds like a real nail-biter!  Let's see... Ava's got a bit of an advantage with those extra enemies and berries, but Emma's got more time on the clock.  

It's impossible to say for sure who wins without knowing exactly how many enemies they each jumped on, how many berries they collected, and how much time was left on the timer.  

It all comes down to those little details! 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's easy! If two pizzas cost $30, and they bought four pizzas for $64, then the other two pizzas must have cost $34 altogether.  Since they cost the same, each of those pizzas was $17.

"
"Oh my, that sounds like a lot of biking! Let's see... they ride three times a day for five days, so that's 15 times. Then they ride twice as much on two other days, which is six times each day, for a total of 12 times.  Adding those together, they ride their bikes a total of 27 times in a week.

"
"Oh my, this is a tricky one! Let's see... Bob started with more white fish than orange fish.  He bought a bunch more, and now he has twice as many orange ones. Hmm...  I think he must have bought 4 white fish.

"
"Oh darling, let's figure this out! Andy drives 10 miles a day to work and back, so that's 50 miles a week.  If his car guzzles a gallon every 10 miles, he'll use 5 gallons a week. At $3 a gallon, that's a whopping $15 a week just on gas! 


$15
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of money for lunch! Let's see... ten twenties are $200, and 3/5 of that is $120.  Then there are the quarters, 140 of them, which is $35.  Adding those together, Carrie spent $155 on lunch. 



"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see, 5 tomato plants with 22 tomatoes each make 110 tomatoes. And 8 eggplant plants with 4 eggplants each make 32 eggplants.  That's a total of 142 fruits! 


142 

"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... if Samwell sold 40 TVs in total, and a quarter were smart TVs and an eighth were analog, that's 10 smart TVs and 5 analog TVs.  That means he sold 25 OLED TVs! 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky one! Let's see... if the trip costs $300 and the school is paying half, that's $150 they're covering.  John has $50, so he still needs $100. 


$100 

"
"Oh my, that sounds chilly! Let's see... if it's 33 degrees colder at night, that means it'll be 12 degrees.  Brrr! To keep the pipes from freezing, Carson needs to warm the house up by 20 degrees. Since each log adds 5 degrees, he'll need to burn 4 logs. 


4 

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like so much fun! Let's see... 90 people divided into groups of 9 means there are 10 groups. If 3 out of every 5 groups brought back 2 seashells each person, and each group has 9 people, that's 6 groups bringing back seashells.  So, 6 groups times 9 people times 2 seashells is... 108 seashells! 


108 

"
"Oh my, that sounds like a busy train! Let's see... they start with 172 people, then 47 get off and 13 get on. That's 172 - 47 + 13 = 138 people.  Then another 38 get off, leaving 138 - 38 = 100 people on the train. 


100 

"
"Oh, that's clever!  Let's see... if Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day and each one is worth 25 cents, he makes $2.50 every day.  In a month with 30 days, that's $2.50 times 30, which equals $75.00. 


$75.00
"
"Oh darling, that's easy! Let's see... Jamie makes $20 an hour for her regular 8 hours, so that's $160.  Then she worked 3 extra hours at time and a half, which is $30 an hour. So that's another $90.  Add those together and she made a fabulous $250 for the day!


$250
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of lions! Let's see... 12 girl lions, and half as many boy lions, so that's 6. Plus 14 adorable cubs!  That makes a total of 32 lions. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a great deal!  Let's see... if the jeans are 25% off and originally cost $40, that means they're $10 cheaper! So they're $30 now.  That means Mike will have $20 left over from his $50 bill. 


$20.00
"
"Oh darling, that's a simple calculation! Let's see... they start with 200 employees and add 20 each month for three months, so that's 200 + 60 = 260 employees.  

Now, with each employee earning $4000 a month, the total cost would be 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000. 


1040000 

"
"Ooh, caroling! That sounds so festive! Let's see... if they sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, that's 150 seconds times two, which is 300 seconds.  Then add the 240 seconds for ""Jingle Bells,"" and that makes a total of 540 seconds of caroling. 


540
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Billy's raises add up to $1.50, so he makes $11.50 an hour now. Sally makes $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so she makes $10.50 an hour.

If they both work 20 hours, Billy earns $230 ($11.50 x 20) and Sally earns $210 ($10.50 x 20).

That means Billy earns $20 more than Sally. 


$20
"
"Oh, that's an easy one! Three loaves of bread would cost $6, and two bagels would cost $2.  That means three loaves cost $4 more than two bagels. 


$4 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. Nikita scored 11 more than that, so she scored 139 + 11 = 150 points.

Together they scored 278 + 150 = 428 points.


428 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of trees! Let's see... 40 classes with 25 students each means there are 1000 students planting trees. And with 3 teachers per class, that's 120 teachers planting 2 trees each. So, 1000 trees from the students plus 240 from the teachers makes a grand total of 1240 trees! 


1240
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of stuffed animals! Let's see... Bubbles has 14 stuffed animals in total.  If she wants goats to be 30% of her collection, she'll need 4.2 goats. Since you can't have part of a goat, she should buy 5! 


5 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of gaming! Let's see... half an hour a day for two weeks is 14 days times 0.5 hours, which is 7 hours. Then she plays 2 hours a day for a week, so that's 7 days times 2 hours, which is 14 hours.  Adding those together, she's played 21 hours.  She needs 30 hours total, so she still needs to play for 9 more hours.

"
"Oh, this is easy!  The second car is going 10 miles per hour faster, so after two hours it will be 20 miles ahead.

"
"Oh darling, that's so romantic! Let's see... the diamond was $600 and the gold was $300, making the materials $900 in total.  A 30% premium on that is $270.  Adding that to the original cost, the ring ended up being $1170. 


$1170
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

So, 340 third-graders passed out of 500, and 40 fourth-graders passed out of 100. The fifth grade had twice the pass rate of the fourth grade, so 80% of the fifth graders passed, which is 320 students.

That means a total of 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 students passed.

With 1000 students in total, the school's overall pass rate is 70%. 


70 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  Milo needs 12 chips for every square inch, and his mosaic will be 3 inches tall. That means he needs 12 chips/inch * 3 inches = 36 chips for every inch of length. He has 2 bags of chips with 72 chips each, so that's 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips total.  

Since he needs 36 chips per inch, he can make his mosaic 144 chips / 36 chips/inch = 4 inches long. 


4 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of tea! Let's see... if four students drank 1.5 quarts each, that's 6 quarts. And if 16 students drank 2 quarts each, that's another 32 quarts.  So altogether, they drank 38 quarts.  Since there are 10 quarts left, there must have been 48 quarts to begin with.  That's 12 gallons of tea! 


12 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of butterscotch! Let's see... Dale has 200 candies now, and he's already sold 150. That means he still needs to sell 50 more.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a fun one! Let's see... if the student body doubles every month, by the end of May, there would be a lot more students!  

They start with 10, then it's 20, then 40, then 80, then 160, and finally 320! That means 310 more students joined after the first of the year. 


310 

"
"Oh my stars, that's a tricky one! Let's see... if Felix made $105 and each branch costs $0.25 to climb, he must have climbed a whopping 420 branches!  If he worked for five days, that means he climbed an average of 84 branches each day.  

84 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of flowers! Let's see... she starts with 15 petals, then adds 24 more, then 20, and finally 42. That's 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals in total. But she drops one of each kind, so that's 5 petals lost.  That leaves 101 - 5 = 96 petals in the vase. 


96 

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a sticky situation! Let's see... they started with 35 marshmallows and used 18 for their s'mores.  Then they lost a few, so they only have 14 left.  That means they can each have 7 more s'mores!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His friends who aren't as good only get 10 minutes per quarter, and his really good friend gets 30 minutes per quarter.  They play for a whole 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

So, Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

His not-so-good friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, and since there are two of them, that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

His really good friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

In total, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

That means they spend 68 * $0.25 = $17.00 at the arcade. 


$17.00
"
"Ooh, this sounds like a fun recipe! Let me see... she uses the same amount of zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar.  And the oil is double the salt, which is double the zest.  Hmm... if we think of the zest as 1, then the salt and sugar are each 2, and the oil is 4.  That all adds up to 10 ounces!

So she uses **4** ounces of oil. 



"
"Oh my, that sounds like quite a trip to the market! Let's see... three goats at $500 each would be $1500. And two cows at $1500 each would be $3000.  Adding those together, John spent a total of $4500. 


$4500

"
"Oh darling, this is a bit of a tricky one! Let's see... Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice that amount, so Joe has 40 cars. He sells 20% of them, which is 8 cars. Then, he's feeling generous and gives his mother twice the number he sold, so that's another 16 cars.  In total, he gives away 24 cars.  That leaves him with 16 cars. 


16 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's so wonderful that they're raising money for charity! Let's see... if they raised $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, that means the students raised $125,000.  

Since there are 20 students, each one raised $6,250. 


$6,250
"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... Sandy walked for 8 hours the first day and half that time, which is 4 hours, on the second day. That's a total of 12 hours.  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she walked for 12 * 60 = 720 minutes. 

720 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of cars! Let's see... Hunter saw 50 at first, then 20 more, so that's 70 cars total. But then half of them left, so 70 divided by 2 is 35 cars.

"Oh darling, that's easy! Let's see... 30 cycles a day times 5 tasks per cycle is 150 tasks.  And at $1.20 a task, that's $180 a day.  Over a whole week, he'd make a fabulous $1260.00! 



"
"Let's see... Sasha scored 14 points in the first game, and Julie scored 4 less than that, so she got 10 points. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 less than Julie's first game score, meaning she scored 4 points.  Adding up both games, Sasha scored a total of 18 points.

"Oh my, that's a lot of pet food! Let's see... 8 packages of cat food with 11 tins each is 88 tins. And 6 packages of dog food with 6 tins each is 36 tins.  That means Kimberly has 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"
"Oh my stars, this sounds like a tricky one! Let me see...

If we think of it like this: PJ has some cards, let's say 47. Smendrick has three times that, so he has 141. And Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, making her total 153.

Does that sound right? 



"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like so much fun! Let's see... Cindy had 5 green eggs, and twice that many blue, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs. She had one less pink egg than blue, so 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. And then she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink, which is 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.  

Adding them all up, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs!

"
"Oh darling, that's a shame about the book! Let's see... shipping is $0.35 per pound, and the book is 4 pounds, so that's $1.40. Then there's the mileage, $0.08 per mile for 20 miles, which comes to $1.60.  Adding those together, shipping is $3.00.

Now, Amazon will only give her back 75% of the $32, which is $24.00.  

So, subtracting the refund and the shipping from the original price, Milly will lose $5.00. 


$5.00
"
"Ooh, let's see! Mulan starts with $40 and gets $100 from her father, so that's $140. Those jeans cost $30 each, so two pairs are $60.  Plus the $20 bag, that's $80 spent in total.  

If she started with $140 and spent $80, she has $60 left! 


$60
"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars every month. In the first week, he makes 8,000. Then, in the second week, he only makes half of that, which is 4,000.  The third week is busy, so he makes three times the amount from the first week, which is 24,000! That's a lot of chocolate!

To find out how many he makes in the fourth week, we need to add up the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000.  

Then, we subtract that from his monthly goal: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000.

So, Boris needs to make 14,000 chocolate bars in the fourth week. 


14000
"
"Okay, let's see... Britany makes a lot of TikToks!  

She spends 72 minutes filming (18 videos x 4 minutes each).  Then there's 120 minutes for songwriting (2 hours x 60 minutes per hour). And don't forget the 90 minutes she spends on makeup each week (15 minutes x 6 days).

That's a total of 282 minutes per week on TikTok. Over a month, that's 1128 minutes (282 x 4).  

And if we divide that by 60 minutes per hour, we get 18.8 hours. 


18.8 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

The base installation is $129.00.  Angela needs 2 extra mirrors, which will cost 2 * $15.00 = $30.00. She also needs one extra chandelier for $15.00. And for the extra pictures, that's 10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00.

Adding it all up: $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $324.00


$324.00
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Anthony has $10.00 more than Eva, who has $20.00, so Anthony has $30.00. Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, which is $12.00.  That means Roy has a total of $42.00.


$42.00
"
"Oh my, this sounds like a challenge worthy of a princess! Let's see... Pompei lifts a mountain 1 inch high. Saskay can lift one 12 times higher, so that's 12 inches. Kagiyami is even stronger, lifting 4 times what Saskay can, meaning 48 inches! And finally, Naruto, the strongest of them all, lifts 10 times what Kagiyami can, so that's a whopping 480 inches!

But we need to know how high that is in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high!

"
"Oh, that's easy! Mason travels 32 miles in the first part of his journey and then another 48 miles.  That means he traveled a total of 80 miles.

"
"Oh my stars, this is a tricky one! Let me see... if three kangaroos take 18 hours, that means one kangaroo would take three times as long, which is 54 hours.  Now, those turtles are much slower, only half as fast as a kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours, a turtle would take twice as long, which is 108 hours. But we have four turtles, so they'd be four times faster than one turtle. That means it would take them 108 hours divided by four, which is 27 hours! 


27 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of clay dishes! Let's see... Kora made 20, and Rory made 20 more than that, so Rory made 40.  Jada made twice as many as Rory, so she made 80.  Adding them all up, they made a total of 140 dishes! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

The laptop costs $400 after the trade-in.  Erika has $150 from her job and $80 from her mom, which is $230 total. Since she only needs $50 more, that means she must have $180 in her purse already. 


$180 

"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... 3 large apples make 15 slices, and 5 small apples make 15 slices too. That's a total of 30 slices. If Adam eats 15, there are 15 slices left.

"
"Oh, that's easy!  If he wants 25 liters and each cow gives 5 liters, he needs 5 more cows to reach his goal.

"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... if each glue stick starts at 12 millimeters, and we need to find the total unused length, we just need to figure out how much is left of each one and add it up.  

* The first one has 5/6 left, so that's (5/6) * 12 mm = 10 mm.
* The second one has 1/3 left, so that's (1/3) * 12 mm = 4 mm.
* The third one has 1/2 left, so that's (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm.

Adding those together, we get 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

So the answer is 20. 



"
"Oh honey, let's see! That car and phone sound lovely, but let's make sure Gabriel has enough.  

The car is $10,000 and the phone is $800, so that's $10,800 in total. He has $5,000 from his weekend job and his brother gave him a sweet $200, bringing his total to $5,200.

To figure out how much more he needs, we subtract: $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

Looks like Gabriel still needs $5,600. 


$5600
"
"Oh, that's easy! If Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, that's $80. Since the hat only cost $70, she got $10 in change. 


$10
"
"Okay, let's see... Craig starts with $40 from his twenty dollar bills.  The squirt guns cost $12 and the water balloons cost $9, so he spends a total of $21. That means he has $19 left. 


$19
"
"Oh my, this sounds like a bit of a puzzle! Let's see... Jack has 60 dishes, and that's twice the number of socks he has, so he must have 60 / 2 = 30 socks. Peter, being quite the collector himself, has twice as many socks as Jack, meaning he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.  And his dish collection is half the size of Jack's, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Adding it all up, they have 60 + 30 = 90 socks and 30 + 60 = 90 dishes. Together, that's a grand total of 90 + 90 = 180 socks and dishes! 


180
"
"Let's see... 20 students in total, 5 are math whizzes only, and 8 are English stars only. That means the rest must be good at both!  20 - 5 - 8 = 7 students are good at both.  So, 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12 students are good at math.

12 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  Each group needs 10 minutes total (2 to get on, 6 to perform, and 2 to get off).  The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes.  If we take out the 10-minute intermission, that leaves 110 minutes for performances.  So, 110 minutes divided by 10 minutes per group means 11 groups can perform! 


11
"
"Oh darling, that's easy!  Let's see... three-quarters of $300 is $225, and that's how much she earns each year. Over three years, that's $225 times 3, which is $675.  Add that to her original $300, and Brenda will have a lovely $975. 


$975
"
"Let's see... half of the white shirts have collars, so that means 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts don't have collars.  And there are 50 floral shirts, but 20 of them have buttons, leaving 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts without buttons.  

That means there are 30 - 20 = 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars.


10 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  If he has 900 eggs and each tray holds 30, that's 30 trays in total.  If he sells each tray for $2.50, he'll make $75! 



"
"Oh my, that's a lot of goats! Let's see... Mr. Smith starts with 55 goats on Farm X and 45 on Farm Y, that's 100 in total. He sells 10 from Farm X and 20 from Farm Y, so that's 30 goats gone.  

That means he has 70 goats left. 


70 

"
"Ooh, let's see! James buys a lot of shoes! If he spends $2640 a year on 2 pairs a month, that means he buys 24 pairs in a year.  To find out how much each pair costs, we divide the total amount by the number of pairs: $2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair. 

$110 

"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... three baskets of green food would be $75, and three baskets of red food would normally be $54, but with the discount, it's only $48.  So, in total, you'd pay $123. 


$123
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of rooms! Let's see... if it takes 20 minutes per room and they need to clean half of the 90 rooms, that's 45 rooms.  

So, 45 rooms times 20 minutes each is 900 minutes of cleaning.  

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 900 minutes is equal to 15 hours. 


15 

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a lot of new houses! Let's see... they build 12 in the first year, then three times that, which is 36, in the second year.  That's already 48 houses! Then they double that in the third year, so 48 times 2 is 96.  Adding those all together, they'll have built a total of 144 houses. 


144
"
"Let me see...  My brother is older than me by three years, and I'm two years older than my little sister. Mom's age is a bit trickier - it's one less than three times my brother's age.  All together, we add up to 87 years. Hmm, let me think... I'm 11 years old! 



"
"Okay, so Mr. Jackson has 27 students and each one needs 2 glue sticks. That means he needs 27 times 2, which is 54 glue sticks.  Each pack has 8 glue sticks, so he'll need to buy 54 divided by 8, which is 6.75 packs. Since he can't buy parts of packs, he'll have to buy 7 packs to make sure he has enough for everyone. 


7 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of water!  Let's see... if it doubles on the second day, that's 4000 times 2, which is 8000 gallons. Then, on the third day, it goes up by another 6000 gallons, so that's 8000 plus 6000, making a total of 14000 gallons.

14000 

"
"Oh my, that sounds terrible! Let's see... if each person infects six others every day, it spreads quickly. After three days, there would be a whopping 3430 people infected. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of tips! Let's see... Rafaela got $20 from each of the 40 customers, so she made $800. Julieta got 10% less than that, which is $80 less, so she made $720.  Together they made $800 + $720 = $1520!

$1520

"
"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Claire gets a badge every month, which is super cool. Amber takes twice as long, so she only gets one every two months. That means in a whole year, she'd have 6 badges. Wendy is a rockstar, getting three times as many as Claire, so she'd have 36 badges in a year!  That means Wendy has 30 more badges than Amber.

"Okay, let's see... Paige bakes for five hours, making 10 loaves total.  That's 80 slices! Since each slice sells for 50 cents, she raises $40.00. 


$40.00
"
"Oh, that's easy! If Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins and she has 70 gold coins, she must have 40 silver coins.  That means she has a total of 110 coins. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of burritos! Let's see... if each of the 50 students ate 10 burritos, that's 500 burritos right there.  And Mr. George had 20, so that's 520 burritos gone.  If they started with 600, that means there are 80 leftover burritos. 


80
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of bumper cars! Let's see... they have 12 red cars, and 2 fewer green cars, so that's 10 green cars.  Then they have 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, which is 30 blue cars!  That's 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars already.  If there are 75 cars in total, they must have 75 - 52 = 23 yellow cars. 


23 

"
"Oh darling, this is a bit of a puzzle, isn't it? Let me see... if we add up all their books, it's 85.  Sofie has quite a few more than Anne, 25 to be exact! And Anne has 12 fewer than Fawn. Hmm, let me think... Fawn must have 28 books! 



"
"Oh my, that sounds like a lot of vegetables! Let's see... the sweet potatoes weighed twice as much as the 5-pound bag of potatoes, so they were 10 pounds.  Then the carrots were 3 pounds lighter than the sweet potatoes, making them 7 pounds. 


7 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of jello! Let's see... 30 kids times 4 cups each is 120 cups.  And each box makes 10 cups, so he'll need 12 boxes. If each box is $1.25, then 12 boxes will cost $15.00. 


$15.00
"
"Oh, that's easy! If the phones cost $3500 and they paid with $4000, the seller would give back $500 in change. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! If Madeline pays 60% of the $400 grocery bill, that means Keenan pays the other 40%.  So Keenan pays 0.40 * $400 = $160 per month.  Since there are four weeks in a month, Keenan spends $160 / 4 = $40 per week on groceries.


$40 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of pizza! Let's see... he ate 24 pieces on the first day, then 10 more on the second. That's 34 pieces already.  Then on the third day, he ate some more... hmm, 14 pieces.  

So in total, he's eaten 34 + 14 = 48 pieces! 


48
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

If 7 sodas cost $21.00, then one soda costs $3.00. And if 4 waters cost $8.00, then one water costs $2.00.

So, 3 sodas would cost $9.00 (3 x $3.00) and 2 waters would cost $4.00 (2 x $2.00).

In total, that's $13.00.


$13.00 

"
"Oh, this is easy!  If David has $12.48 and each bolt costs $0.03, then 16 bolts will cost him $0.48 (16 x $0.03 = $0.48).  That means he'll have $12.00 left over ($12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00).

$12.00 

"
"Ooh, this is easy! If Ella makes $33 for 3 hours, that means she earns $11 per hour.  If she walks dogs for 12 hours, she'd make $11 x 12 = $132!

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of marbles! Let's see... Paul starts with 52, gets 28 more, so that's 52 + 28 = 80 marbles. But then he loses a quarter of them...  Hmm, 80 divided by 4 is 20.  So he loses 20 marbles. That leaves him with 80 - 20 = 60 marbles.

60 

"
"Oh, this sounds like a test I could ace! Let's see...

*  Amy gets 80% of the multiple-choice right, so that's 10 questions * 0.80 = 8 questions correct.  Those are worth 8 points!
* For true/false, she gets 90% right, so that's 20 questions * 0.90 = 18 questions correct. That's another 18 points!
*  On the long answer, she gets 60% right, so that's 5 questions * 0.60 = 3 questions correct. Those are worth 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Adding it all up, Amy scores 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

"
"Let's figure this out! Isaias wants to make a $2000 profit, and he's selling each chicken for $50.  He's selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is 180 chickens. That means he'll earn 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.  To find out how much he paid for the chickens, we subtract his profit from his total earnings: $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

$7000 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky one! Let me see... Julie sold 14 glasses, and the boys sold the rest, which is 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.  Since they sold the same amount, each boy sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses. That means Julie sold 14 - 9 = 5 more glasses than Micah.

"
"Oh honey, that sounds like a luxurious day! Let's see... if Iris spent $400 on her hair, and that's four times the cost of her manicure, then her manicure was $400 / 4 = $100.  Her pedicure was three-quarters the price of her manicure, so that was $100 * (3/4) = $75.  Adding it all up, she spent $400 + $100 + $75 = $575 at the spa. 



"
"Oh, that's easy! Sarah will make $40 from selling her rope.  The new rope will cost her $30. That means she'll have $10 left over.

"
"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, so she's 8 now.  That means when she's three times her current age, she'll be 24.  It will take her 16 years to get there! 


16
"
"Okay, let's see... Kelly's bacon cost $10 for 5 packs, so each pack is $2.  Her chicken costs twice that, so each pack is $4, and 6 packs cost $24. Her strawberries are $4 each, so 3 packs are $12. Her apples are half the price of strawberries, so they're $2 each, and 7 packs cost $14.  

Adding it all up, that's $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60. If her budget is $65, she has $5 left. 


$5
"
"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if her final concert is twice as long as usual plus a 15-minute encore, and the whole thing is 65 minutes, we can figure it out!  

If we take away the encore, the concert itself was 65 - 15 = 50 minutes long. Since that's twice the length of a normal concert, a regular concert must be 50 / 2 = 25 minutes. 


25
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of toys! Let's see... Argo started with 200, gave 40 to Alyssa, 80 to Bonnie, and 30 to Nicky.  That means he gave away a total of 150 toys.  If he started with 200 and gave away 150, he must have 50 left!

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of chimichangas! Let's see... Tuesday and Wednesday they make 125 each, so that's 125 + 125 = 250. And on Friday, they make double Tuesday's amount, which is 125 * 2 = 250.  Adding all three days together, they make a whopping 250 + 250 = 500 chimichangas! 


500 

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic case of stage fright!  Let's see... if 20% of the microphones are left out, that means 80% made it on stage.  

80% of 50 microphones is 40 microphones. Since each pair needs two microphones, he could arrange 20 pairs.

"
"Hi there! Let's see... the daisies have 10 petals each and there are 4 of them, so that's 40 petals. The orchids have 5 petals each and there are 5 of them, making 25 petals.  That means the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids!

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Mrs. Smith has 100 plants and a quarter are indoors, that's 25 indoor plants (100 / 4 = 25). That leaves 75 plants (100 - 25 = 75).

Two-thirds of those are outdoor plants, so that's 50 outdoor plants (75 x (2/3) = 50).

That means the rest, 25 plants, must be flowering plants (75 - 50 = 25).

So, 25% of her plants are flowering plants (25 / 100 = 0.25, which is 25%).

"
"Oh my, this is a tricky one! Let's see... if the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that's eleven times faster than a thingamabob, then the thingamabob must spin at 121 divided by 11, which is 11 meters per second.  And since the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob, it must spin at 11 times 5, which is 55 meters per second. 

55 

"
"Oh darling, this is a simple one! Let's see... Ellen's yogurt is half the price of her salad, so it costs $3. Together, the salad and yogurt cost $9. That leaves $2 for the carrots. Since she buys two, each carrot must cost $1.

"
"Oh, that's easy! Mark makes $12 an hour now, so he earns $96 each day.  Since he works 5 days a week, he makes $480 a week.

"
"This is a tricky one!  To figure out how much Tasha made from lemonade, we need to know how many times she mowed Joe's lawn.  

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times.  Then she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid her $6 each time, she made $6x from mowing his lawn. Kamala paid her $18x, and Alba paid her $30x.

That means she made a total of $54x from mowing.

To find out how much she made from lemonade, we'd subtract her mowing earnings from her total earnings: $80 - $54x.

But without knowing how many times she mowed Joe's lawn (that 'x' value), we can't get a final number for her lemonade earnings. 



"
"Let's figure this out! 

Martin weighs 55 kg, and Carl is 16 kg heavier, so Carl weighs 71 kg. Christian is 8 kg heavier than Carl, making him 79 kg. Finally, Harry is 5 kg lighter than Christian, so he weighs 74 kg.

"Oh darling, that's easy!  John makes $25 an hour for each rental, and he rents it out for 3 hours, 10 times a month. That's $750 in earnings! But, of course, he has that pesky $500 car payment.  So, his profit is $250. 


$250
"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Martha has 7 notebooks now, and she got 5 more, so she must have had 2 to start.  Joseph had 3 times that amount, meaning he had 6 notebooks. That means Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph!

"Let's see... Calvin has enough soup for four adults or eight children.  His family has two adults and two children, so that's four people total. They each have one bowl, using up all the soup meant for adults. That means there's enough leftover for the two children to each have two bowls!

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Jo needs 0.5 yards of material for each small mask, and she wants to make 20 of those. That's 10 yards right there (20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards).

For the large masks, she needs 0.75 yards per mask, and she's making 8. So that's 6 yards (8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards).

In total, she'll need 16 yards of material (10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards).

"
"Oh my gosh, that's a lot of Fast and Furious!  Let's see... if Deepa saw each of the 9 movies three times, that's 27 trips to the theater!  If she spent $216 total, that means each ticket cost $8.

"Oh, that's easy!  Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of shoeboxes! Let's see... Tim starts with 7 blue and 9 red, so that's 16 in total. He uses 3 blue ones for fishing, leaving him with 4 blue.  He also uses 1/3 of his red ones, which is 3 red shoeboxes. That leaves him with 6 red ones.  So, in total, he has 4 + 6 = 10 shoeboxes left.

"
"Oh, that's easy! Joseph has 16 books left. 



"
"Oh my, that's a tricky one! Let's see... Dean starts with 30 marbles, gives 6 to Jamie, and then another 10 to Donald.  That's a total of 16 marbles gone.  

If he started with 30 and gave away 16, he must have 14 left!

"
"Let's see... Duncan is 60 now, so eight years ago he was 52.  That means Adam was 26 four years ago.  So Adam is currently 30 years old, which means in eight years he'll be 38.

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of land! Let's see... Farmer Smith has twice Farmer Brown's 200 acres plus another 100 acres, so that's 400 + 100 = 500 acres.  Together they have 200 + 500 = 700 acres.

"
"Oh my stars, that's a tricky one! Let's see... Benny used a lot of bologna! If he threw 2 pieces at each red balloon and 20 were red, that's 2 * 20 = 40 pieces right there.  That leaves 58 - 40 = 18 pieces for the yellow balloons. Since each yellow balloon got 3 pieces, there must have been 18 / 3 = 6 yellow balloons.

"
"Oh, that's easy! If Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, that's 3000 miles in a month. Since he needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, he'll need 3 tune-ups.

"
"Oh darling, let's see... Bruce is quite the busy bee!  

He works 5 hours on Tuesday, then doubles that on Wednesday, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 hours. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, meaning he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Adding it all up, he works a total of 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours over the three days.

"
"Let's see... they spent $11 on a cake, $3 on balloons (since a dozen is 12 balloons and they cost $0.50 for 2), and $14 on ice cream.  That's a total of $28.  Since they split the cost, their mom gave each of them $14.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  There are 6 tennis players and double that number playing volleyball, so that's 6 * 2 = 12 volleyball players.  That means there are 6 + 12 = 18 tennis and volleyball players total.  Adding the soccer players, we get 18 + 16 + 22 = 56 students.


56 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of lollipops! Let's see... if each of the 30 students sold 10 lollipops at $0.80 each, they made 300 lollipops * $0.80/lollipop = $240.  But they spent 300 lollipops * $0.50/lollipop = $150 to buy them.  So their profit is $240 - $150 = $90.

$90 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of pets! Let's see... Larry has 3 cats, and 3 times that many dogs, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 dogs. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.  His fish tank has 3 times the number of rabbits, meaning he has 7 * 3 = 21 fish. And finally, his gerbils are 1/3 the number of fish, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Adding them all up, Larry has 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets! 



"
"Oh, that's easy! Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice that, so he eats 4. Together they eat 6 slices a day.  A loaf has 24 slices, so it will last them 4 days.

"Oh, that's easy! Martha will have collected 60 shells.  She gets one each month, and that's 12 a year. So in five years, she'll have a whole collection of 60! 



"
"Let's see... Lana has 27 cups and splits them into 3 rows, so that's 9 cups per row. Since she wants equal amounts of chamomile and mint in each row, that's 9 cups / 2 types of tea = 4.5 cups of each.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

The pool has 10,000 gallons, and they use half for the tank, so that's 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons in the tank.

They use 500 gallons each day, so in 6 days they'll use 500 * 6 = 3,000 gallons.

That means they'll have 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 gallons left.


2000 

"
"Oh my goodness, this sounds like a fun problem! Let's see... Colby has $150 for movies this month. He already spent some on tickets and snacks, so we need to figure out how much he has left.  

Hmm, Friday movies are $10, and he saw 5 of those. That's $50. Other day movies are $7 each, and he saw 8 of those, so that's $56. He also had popcorn and candy, which cost $16 and $8, respectively.

Adding all that up, he spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

That means he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.  

A Friday movie, popcorn, and candy cost $20 exactly! So he can see **1** more movie tonight.

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of pastries! Let's see... a mini cinnamon roll would have 200 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin would have 150.  So, all the cinnamon rolls together have 40,000 calories, and all the muffins have 45,000 calories.  Adding those together, we get a grand total of 85,000 calories!

85000 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of Junebugs! Let's see... she got 39 on Monday, then twice that on Tuesday and Wednesday, so that's 39 times 2, which is 78, and then 78 again, for a total of 156.  Then she got 48 on Thursday and 57 on Friday.  Adding it all up, that's 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs!  

Dividing that by the 5 days, she averages 60 Junebugs a day.

"
"Oh, this is a fun little puzzle! Let me see...

If we know that Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages, and Paul is 10 years older than John, we can figure this out.  

Let's think of it like this:

*  If John is ""J"" years old, then Paul is ""J + 10"" years old.
*  Peter is ""J + (J + 10)"" years old, which is the same as ""2J + 10"".

Since all their ages add up to 100, we have the equation:

2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

4J + 20 = 100

Subtracting 20 from both sides:

4J = 80

Dividing both sides by 4:

J = 20

So John is 20 years old.

Now, to find Peter's age, we plug John's age back into our equation for Peter:

Peter = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 50

There you have it! Peter is 50 years old. 



"
"Let's see... Maria gave 4 friends 2 balloons each, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 balloons.  She had 1 balloon too, so that's 8 + 1 = 9 balloons to start. Then her mom gave everyone 3 more, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 more balloons. In total, they had 9 + 15 = 24 balloons!

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of stuff! Let's see... they have 50 boxes from donations plus 10 they already had, so that's 60 boxes total. If each table holds 2 boxes, they'll need 30 tables. Since they already have 15, they'll need to find 15 more!

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like fun! Let's see... Zoey spits 40 seeds at 10 feet each, so that's 400 feet total. Sydney spits 35 seeds at 12 feet each, for a total of 420 feet.  Adding those together, they spit a total of 820 feet.  

Since there are two of them, the average distance is 820 feet divided by 2, which is 410 feet.

"
"Oh my goodness, this is a tricky one! Let's see... the Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45.  If they run for a whole month, 24 hours a day, that's a lot of widgets!  

The Widgeteer 3000 would make 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200 widgets. The WidgetMaster 9000 would make 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Since each widget sells for $6, the Widgeteer 3000 would earn 43,200 * $6 = $259,200. The WidgetMaster 9000 would earn 32,400 * $6 = $194,400.

That means Fern would make $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800 more with the Widgeteer 3000!

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic case of figuring out the best deal! Let's see... Cameron stays for 17 hours, and the hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 and then 70 pesos per hour after that.  

So, 5 extra hours at 70 pesos each is 350 pesos. Add that to the initial 1000 pesos, and his total is 1350 pesos.  

A 24-hour stay would have cost him 1600 pesos, so he saves a fabulous 250 pesos! 



"
"Oh my, that's a lot of hungry animals! Let's see... each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, and those sheep are a bit more demanding, needing twice the amount of a goat minus 3 pounds. So that's 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep.  With 15 goats, that's 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay for them. And for the 12 sheep, it's 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.  In total, Nate needs a whopping 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! John makes $50 an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = $300.  After buying gas for $50 and 5 pencils at $10 each (for a total of $50), he has 300 - 50 - 50 = $200 left.  If he puts $100 in the bank, he'll have 200 - 100 = $100 left for pens. Since each pen costs $25, he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens.

"
"Oh my, that's a tricky one! Let's see... Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, so that's 20 * 15 = 300 letters. His brother spelled words with 50 more letters, meaning he spelled 300 + 50 = 350 letters worth of words.  Together, that's 300 + 350 = 650 letters! 

650 

"
"Oh, that sounds like a fun event! Let's see... 8 children in a row, 7 rows for each school, and 5 schools...  

If each school has 8 times 7 children, that's 56 children per school. And with 5 schools, there would be 56 times 5 children in total.

That means there could be 280 children in the drill! 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of apple juice! Let's see... the teacher has 9 coupons for 100 bottles each, so that's 900 bottles in total.  If she gives each of her 29 students 2 bottles, that's 58 bottles.  That means she has 842 bottles left for herself! 



"
"Oh honey, let's break this down! Patty's got a $40 house call fee, then $35 an hour for work, and of course, the cost of parts.  Two and a quarter hours of work is $78.75, and those parts were $60.  Adding it all up, Patty's bill comes to $178.75. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's quite a shopping spree! Let's see... James spent $90 on the CDs after his discount. Then he made $200 selling some.  That means he ended up with $110.

"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... 6 yams at $1.50 each is $9.00.  10 sweet potatoes at $2.00 each is $20.00. And 4 carrots at $1.25 each is $5.00.  Add those all together and Jen will earn $34.00!


$34.00
"
"Oh my, that sounds like quite the swim! Let's see... James swims 60% of the 20 miles, which is 12 miles. At 2 miles per hour, that takes him 6 hours. Then he rests for 3 hours, which is half the swimming time.  He has 8 miles left to go, but he's swimming slower now, only 1 mile per hour. So that last part takes 8 hours.  Adding it all up, 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of bread! Let's see... seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.  But the bakery has 40 *fewer* than that, so they have 490 - 40 = 450 loaves. 


450
"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... she started with 15, lost 7, and then got 5 more.  So, 15 minus 7 is 8, and then 8 plus 5 is 13!

"Oh darling, this is simple! Let's see... Cayley gets 10% of $5 for each New York Times, which is 50 cents.  For 6 copies, that's $3.00.  And for the Wall Street Journal, he makes 8% of $15, which is $1.20 per copy.  Ten copies means he earns $12.00 from those.  Adding those together, his total commission is $15.00. 


$15.00
"
"Oh darling, this is a simple one!  If Deanna is 26 and Marcus is five years younger, that makes him 21. Since Marcus is half Leo's age, Leo must be twice Marcus's age, which is 42.

"
"Okay, let me see...  

Bahati scored the most, so let's think about it this way:

* If Azibo scored 'x' points, Bahati scored 'x + 20' points.
* Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati, so Dinar scored 'x + 10' points.

All together, they scored 45 points: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Let's solve for x:

* 3x + 30 = 45
* 3x = 15
* x = 5

So Azibo scored 5 points.

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of stapling! Let's see... if Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and he works for 15 hours, that's 900 minutes!  

So, he staples 30 reports per 15 minutes, and he has 900 minutes... that means he staples 1800 reports in total!

"
"Oh my goodness, that's quite a situation! Let's see... Kim usually sleeps for 8 hours, which is 480 minutes. She sleepwalked for 23 minutes, so we subtract that: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.  And since she woke up 5 minutes early, we subtract that too: 457 - 5 = 452 minutes.

So Kim slept for 452 minutes on her bed that day. 



"
"Oh my, that's a tricky one! Let's see... Jonathan has two dozen cups, which is 24. He has 2/3 that many spoons, so he has 16 spoons. After giving Pedro 6 spoons, he has 10 left.  Adding those to his cups, he has a total of 34 utensils.

"Oh, that's easy! Robyn sends 3 emails to her boyfriend each day. 



"
"Oh, this is an easy one!  Let's see... Aliya is 3, and Shawna is three times her age, so Shawna is 9.  Shawna's dad is five times older than her, which means he's 45! 


45 

"
"Oh darling, that Courtney! Always exaggerating! If she said there were 48 people, and Kelly says that's a 20% overstatement, then the real number must be smaller.  Let's see... 20% of 48 is 9.6, so subtract that from Courtney's number... that gives us 38.4.  Since we can't have part of a person, I'd say there were about 38 people at the concert. 


38 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  If Jason carried 2 balls, and Jeffrey carried half that amount, then Jeffrey carried 1 ball. Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so he carried 4 balls.  That means they carried a total of 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls.

"
"Ahoy there, matey! Let's see... they dug 10 holes the first day, then 13 more the second, and 8 on the third.  They filled in 2 of those, though, so that's 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes. The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first, so that means there were 29 / 4 = 7.25 holes at the end of the first day.  That doesn't make sense, does it?  Must be a wonky map!  Anyway, they dug 29 - 7 = 22 holes on the fourth day.

22 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky one! Let me see... if Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 15 more than them, that means Collins got 85.  To find the total, we add them all up: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

So there were 225 corn chips altogether! 



"
"Oh darling, that's easy! If Jen's supplies cost $400 and his travel is 50% more, that means his travel costs $200 more. So, his travel costs $400 + $200 = $600.

"Okay, let me see...  

This Pokemon problem sounds tricky! Let's see... Adelwolfe's Pokemon count is key here. If Stan has 13 less than four times Adelwolfe's amount, we need to figure out Adelwolfe's number first. Then we can find Stan's.  

Hmmm...  

Stan caught 147 Pokemon!

"
"Oh my, that little bird is quite the traveler! Let's see... 

She flew south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so that's 10 * 30 = 300 miles. Then she flew north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, which is 2 * 18 = 36 miles. Finally, she flew south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so that's 5 * 22 = 110 miles.

To find the total distance between her homes, we need to add up the southward distances and subtract the northward distance: 300 - 36 + 110 = 374 miles.


374 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of brownies! Let's see... Greta started with 12, then got 6 more, and her friends brought a whopping 48! That's 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies total.  But they ate 18 of them, so she has 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.

48 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a fun one! Let's see... Nani is 8, his brother is twice that, so he's 16. And his sister is 25% younger than Nani, so she's 2 years younger, making her 6.  Adding them all up, 8 + 16 + 6 equals 30!

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of racquets! Let's see... 

Three with synthetic gut will take 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

Five with polyester will take 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

And the four hybrid ones will take 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Adding those all up, it'll take Andy 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes to string all the racquets. 



"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... two phones at full price is $1200. The other two are half price, so they're $300 each, making them $600 total.  Adding those together, John spent $1800 on phones.

100 

"
"Okay, let's see... Mrs. Harrington started with 12 boxes and gave away 4. That leaves her with 8 boxes. She keeps 2 boxes for herself, so she sells 6 boxes.  Since each box has 20 oranges, she sold 6 * 20 = 120 oranges. 

120 

"
"Oh, that's a fun one! Let me see...  If India has four more than half the number of states in the USA, and the USA has 50 states, then half of that is 25.  Adding four more for India gives us 29 states.  So, together they have 29 + 50 = 79 states!

"Oh my goodness, that's quite a book haul Tyler has planned! Let's see... the books cost $39 in total, and he already has $14. That means he needs $25 more. If he earns $5 an hour, he'll need to work for 5 hours to buy all those wonderful books! 


5 

"
"Oh my, this sounds like a tricky cherry situation! Let's see... Robert has 30 cherries, and that's 10 more than poor Richard. So Richard has 20.  That means Richard and Robert have 50 cherries together, leaving 10 for Jerry.  Robert has a whole 20 more cherries than Jerry!

"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Sunny earned!

On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread at $6 each, so that's 10 * $6 = $60. He also sold 6 boxes of apple pie (10 gingerbread - 4) at $15 each, making $6 * $15 = $90.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread (10 + 5) at $6 each, earning 15 * $6 = $90. He sold 15 boxes of apple pie at $15 each, earning $225.

Adding up all his earnings: Saturday's $150 ( $60 + $90) plus Sunday's $315 ($90 + $225) equals a total of $465.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Emil's dad will be twice Emil's age when Emil is 24, meaning his dad will be 48. Since Emil is currently 19, his dad is 43 now.

Emil will be twice his brother's age when he's 24, so his brother will be 12.  Since Emil is 19 now, his brother is 7.

Adding their ages together, 43 + 7 = 50.

"
"Hi! Let's see... Mommy gave Adrianne 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more than that, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her double what Mommy did, so that's 20 x 2 = 40 beads.  

Altogether, Adrianne has 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads!

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of crawfish! Let's see... he caught 3 pounds on Thursday, then 4 times that on Friday, so that's 3 times 4 which is 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half of Friday's amount, which is 12 divided by 2, or 6 pounds.  Adding it all up, he has 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish. Since each serving is 3 pounds, he has 21 divided by 3, which equals 7 servings.

"Okay, so 20% of Mr. Roper's class of 30 are football players, which is 30 * 0.20 = 6 students. That leaves 30 - 6 = 24 students.  Then 25% of those remaining students are cheerleaders or in band, so that's 24 * 0.25 = 6 students.  In total, 6 + 6 = 12 students are leaving early.

"
"Oh, this is easy! If Charlie's boots are five times bigger than Sophie's size five, that means Charlie wears a size 25.  To find the average, we add their sizes together (5 + 25 = 30) and then divide by two because there are two people (30 / 2 = 15).

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

First, we need to know how many plants will fit in Pat's flower bed. It's 111 feet long, which is 1332 inches. Each plant needs 12 inches of space plus 18 inches between plants, so that's 30 inches per plant.  

1332 inches divided by 30 inches per plant means Pat can fit 44 plants. But she already has 17, so she needs to buy 27 more.

If each plant costs $6, then 27 plants will cost 27 times $6, which is $162. 



"
"Oh, that's easy! Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, so he eats 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.  In a week, that's 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels. 

63 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Katherine needs 3 petunias at $3.00 each, so that's 3 * $3.00 = $9.00 per basket for petunias.

She also wants 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so that's 2 * $2.50 = $5.00 per basket for vines.

In total, each basket will cost $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

Since she has 5 baskets, the total cost will be $14.00 * 5 = $70.00.


$70.00 

"
"Let's see... they use 12 pounds for the sunflowers and 15 pounds for the carnations, which is a total of 27 pounds. That leaves 3 pounds for roses. Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses!

"
"Ooh, shoes! Let's see... Jessica saves 25% of her $2,000 paycheck, which is $500 every month. That's $6,000 a year for fabulous footwear! Since each pair costs $1,000, she can buy 6 pairs.

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic time management puzzle! Let's see... Emily peels 6 shrimp a minute, so for 90 shrimp, that's 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.  Now, she cooks 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so for 90 shrimp, it would take her 30 minutes.  Adding those together, it'll take her a total of 45 minutes to peel and cook all those delicious shrimp!

"Oh my, that sounds like a tricky situation! Let's see... the air conditioner cooled the room quite a bit, but then it warmed up again.  

I think the final temperature was 14 degrees lower than when they started. 



"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Comet Halley comes around every 75 years. Bill's dad saw it when he was 30, and Bill saw it when he was three times his dad's age then.  That means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old. Since the comet comes every 75 years, Bill must have been 75 when he first saw it!

"
"Oh my, that Buford is a busy bee! Let's see... he writes one check a month for electric, one for gas, two for the church each month, and one for the pest and lawn folks every three months.  That's 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 checks a year.  

52 

"
"Oh darling, this is a bit of a puzzle, isn't it? Let's see... if one plane goes to Greece most of the time, and the other only goes to Poland, we need to figure out how many times that first plane zips off to France.  

Well, the Poland plane only does 44 trips, and that's only half of what the first plane does. So the first plane is a busy bee, making 44 * 2 = 88 trips!

Now, it goes to Greece for three-quarters of those, which is 88 * (3/4) = 66 trips. That leaves 88 - 66 = 22 trips for France and Germany.

Since those are split evenly, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France.

"
"Oh my, those little wolves are quite the singers! Let's see... Tobias howls for 20 seconds, Chikote howls for twice that, so that's 40 seconds. And Igneous howls for the combined time of the other two, which is 60 seconds.  Adding it all up, they howl for 120 seconds total.  That's 2 minutes of howling! 


2 

"
"Oh, this is easy!  Let's see, his dad gave him twice what his mom gave him, so that's $6 * 2 = $12. Together, they gave him $6 + $12 = $18.  That means Adam paid $30 - $18 = $12 from his own savings.

$12 

"
"Oh, this is a fun puzzle! Let's see... Helene is the oldest, and she's twice the average age of the group.  If all four of them add up to 20 years old, that means the average age is 5. So Helene must be 10 years old. Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4, which means they add up to 7. That leaves 13 years for Helene and Wilfred together. Since Helene is 10, Wilfred must be 3 years old.

"
"Oh darling, this is so sweet! Let's see... Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 online, making a total of $2000. His lawyer is such a dear, offering to triple that amount! So that's $2000 times 3, which is $6000.  And then his friend chips in another $200.  

The lawyer is going to contribute a fabulous $6000! 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's so thoughtful of the bride! Let's see... 100 guests brought 15 cookies each, so that's 1500 cookies in total.  Half of those went to the church, which is 750 cookies. If each person at the church got 15 cookies, then there must have been 50 people there. 


50
"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if each adult gets twice as much as each child, and there are two adults and four children, that means the watermelon is divided into six equal parts for the kids and six equal parts for the adults, making a total of twelve parts.  Each adult gets two of those twelve parts, which is the same as 1/6 of the whole watermelon.

That means each adult gets 16.67% of the watermelon. 



"
"Oh my, Doctor Jones has a busy day! Let's see... he spends 20 minutes per inpatient, and he has 9 of them, so that's 20 * 9 = 180 minutes, or 3 hours for rounds. His appointments take 30 minutes each, and he has 10, so that's 30 * 10 = 300 minutes, or 5 hours.  In total, that's 3 + 5 = 8 hours.  If he works a 9-hour day, he has 9 - 8 = 1 hour left for records.

"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... they have 10 students paying $1.50 each, so that's $15 per session. Add the $25 studio rental, and each session costs $40. With three sessions a week, that's $120 earned weekly.  Over a month, with four weeks, they'd make $480. 


$480 

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so that's 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars per box. Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, meaning she has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars per box.  Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of prickly babies! Let's see... if there are 50 porcupines and 3/5 are female, that's 30 mama porcupines.  And if each mama has 4 babies a month, that's 120 babies every month! In a whole year, that's 1440 new porcupines.  Adding those to the original 50, there would be 1490 porcupines in the park.

"
"Oh my goodness, filling a pool is such a big job! Let's see... they said to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the gallons.  

The pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep, so the volume is 14 times 25 times 4, which is 1400 cubic feet.  

Then 1400 times 5.9 is 8260 gallons.  

And at $0.10 per gallon, that's $826.00 to fill the whole thing!

$826.00 

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like fun! Let's see... they have 9 red sticks, and 5 more blue ones than that, so that's 14 blue sticks.  Then there are 3 fewer yellow sticks than blue, meaning there are 11 yellow sticks.  Adding them all up, they have 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks! 



"
"Oh darling, that's a simple one! Let's see... Matteo drove 220 miles, and Shandy drove 450 miles.  That means Shandy drove 230 miles farther.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Half of the 3000 students are over 16, so that's 1500 students. A quarter of those older students are boys, meaning 375 are boys over 16. That leaves 1125 girls over 16.

The other half of the school, 1500 students, are under 16. Half of them are boys, so that's 750 boys under 16, leaving 750 girls under 16.

Adding the girls from both age groups, we get 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls in total.


1875 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Bethany runs 10 laps. Trey runs 4 more than that, so he runs 14 laps. Shaelyn runs half as many as Trey, which is 7 laps. Quinn runs 2 fewer than Shaelyn, so she runs 5 laps.  That means Bethany runs 5 more laps than Quinn.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she pumped 4500 gallons * (3/4) = 3375 gallons.

Together on day one, they pumped 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons.

On day two, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her day one amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her day one amount, which is 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

On day two, they pumped a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons.

In total, they pumped 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

That means there are 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons left to fill the tank. 



"
"This is a tricky one! Let me see...  

Okay, so the power bank lost 9% of its charge every hour for 5 hours, that's a total of 45% gone. Then it lost another 21% over the next 3 hours. That means it lost a total of 66% of its charge before it got down to 28%.

Hmm, so if 28% is what was left after losing 66%, that means 34% was left *before* her friends started using it (100% - 66% = 34%).

And since her friends used 6% of the power bank's charge, the original charge must have been 40% (34% + 6% = 40%).



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Janet makes $25 an hour ($10 wages + $15 tips).  If she works 40 hours a week, she earns $1000 each week. She needs a $2000 down payment (20% of $10,000).

To save $2000 at $1000 per week, it will take her 2 weeks.

"
"Oh, that's a tricky one! Let me see... if the price goes up by 5% each year, we need to calculate that increase for three years.  

After the first year, the carrots would cost $126. Then, after the second year, they'd be $132.30. And finally, after the third year, they'd be about $138.92. Rounding that to the nearest dollar, the carrots would cost $139. 



"
"Ooh, let me see!  Olivia has a lot of pictures!  If she put 9 pictures in each album, and she has 3 selfie albums and 2 portrait albums, that means she has 27 selfies (3 x 9) and 18 portraits (2 x 9).  

So, she has a total of 45 selfies and portraits!

"Oh my, that sounds like a bustling hotel! Let's see... they started with 100 guests, then 24 left early. That leaves 76.  Then 15 wanted to stay later, and twice that number, or 30, checked in later that day.  So now there are 106 guests. But wait, there are even 7 more who came after dinner! That brings the total to 113 guests.

"Let's see... 40% of 60 questions is 24 easy questions. That leaves 36 questions for average and difficult, which means 18 of each.  If Aries gets 75% of the easy ones, that's 18 correct. Half of the average and difficult ones is 9 each, so she'll get 9 + 9 more.  That's a total of 36 correct answers!

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of balloons! Let's see... Sally started with so many!  

*  She had 25 red ones, and 40% of those popped, which is 10. So she had 15 red ones left.
* Then she lost half of her 12 yellow balloons, which is 6. That leaves her with 6 yellow ones.
*  She found 8 blue balloons and kept 75% of them, which is 6.

Adding those all up, she had 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 balloons when she got to school!

"Okay, let's figure this out.  There are a few ways this could go for Marcus.  

If he gets a substitute, he's off the hook! That's a 50% chance. If his regular teacher comes, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone more time. Even if she doesn't, Marcus is a smooth talker and has a 20% chance of convincing her his dog ate it.

So, let's see... 50% no homework, plus 20% extension, plus 6% dog ate it excuse... that means there's a 30% chance he actually has to turn it in.

"Oh my, jury duty can be such a bore! Let's see, Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so that's 18 hours total. She earns $15 a day, so that's $45 for the whole thing. But then she has to pay for parking, $3 a day, which is $9 total.  So, she makes $36 after parking.  That means she earns $2 an hour after expenses.

"Oh my goodness, let's see!  Ted spent $48 on books because 3 books times $16 each is $48. And he spent $18 on pencils because 3 pencils times $6 each is $18.  So in total, he spent $66. 


66
"
"Ooh, this sounds like fun! Let's see... 24 feet divided by 3 feet per bottle is 8 bottles.  Since he has to walk between each bottle, there are 7 spaces.  If each space takes 5 seconds, that's 7 times 5, which equals 35 seconds.

"Oh darling, this is a classic case of weighing the future against the present! Let's see... Jim takes on $200,000 in loans, and misses out on $100,000 in earnings while he's studying. That's a total of $300,000 he needs to make up. With his fancy new degree, he's earning $75,000 a year.  

It will take him 4 years to earn back all that money. 



"
"Oh, this is easy!  Jim needs to add 2 feet to both the length and width of his bed. So, the fabric needs to be 10 feet long and 12 feet wide. That means he needs 120 square feet of fabric.

"
"Oh my, that sounds like a busy week for the post office! Let's see...

Monday they delivered 425 letters. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's amount, so that's 425 / 5 + 17 = 102 letters.  

Then on Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice the amount from Tuesday, meaning 2 * 102 + 5 = 209 letters.

Adding all three days together: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.

"
"Oh my goodness, catering can get so expensive! Let's see... 10 people want the chicken salad at $6.50 each, so that's $65.00. Then 6 people want the pasta salad at $6.00 each, which is $36.00.  Adding those together, the total cost for Molly is $101.00.

"Oh my, that sounds like quite the day at the races! Let's see... he lost $5 on the first race. Then he won $11 on the second, which is good! But then he lost $16.50 on the third.  

To find the average, we add up all his losses: $5 + $16.50 = $21.50. Then we divide that by the number of races: $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.

So, on average, he lost $7.17 per race. 


$7.17

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic division problem! Let's see... if the second person got $80 more than the first, and the third got twice the second's share, we can figure this out.  

Let's say the first person got 'x' dollars. That means the second got 'x + $80', and the third got '2 * (x + $80)' which is '2x + $160'.

All together, that's x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Adding it all up, we get 4x + $240 = $1920

Subtracting $240 from both sides gives us 4x = $1680

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that x = $420.

So the first person received $420.

Thinking, thinking... ah, I've got it! Rory must have retrieved 10 balls in the first set. 



"
"Oh darling, depreciation is such a drag! Let's see... if the car loses 21% of its value each year, it's going to be worth quite a bit less by 2010.  

* In 2008, it would be worth $20000 * (1 - 0.21) = $15800.
* Then in 2009, it drops to $15800 * (1 - 0.21) = $12478.
* Finally, in 2010, it's down to $12478 * (1 - 0.21) = $9860.62.

Poor car!

"
"Oh, that's a fun one! Let me see... half the books are in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books. And 10% are in German, which is 50 * 0.10 = 5 books.  That means there are 25 + 5 = 30 books in English and German combined.  

So, there must be 50 - 30 = 20 Spanish books!

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a long drive! Let's see... if Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days, she covered 325 * 4 = 1300 kilometers.  That means she still has 1955 - 1300 = 655 kilometers to go.

"Oh darling, this sounds like a real train adventure! Let's see... 

They started with 120 people, then added 20 more. That's 140. Then some people got off, but even more got on!  After all that, 80 more left.  

I make it 110 people left on the train. 



"
"Oh my gosh, that's so exciting about Alison making the running team!  Let's see, she spent $10 on a tank top, and her shorts were $5 more than that, so $15. Her shoes were on sale for half price, so $48 divided by 2 is $24. And her socks were $8, but she had a $2 coupon, so those were $6.  Adding it all up, $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 equals $55.

"
"Oh darling, renovating a kitchen can be so exciting! Let's see, 200 square feet is a good-sized kitchen.  Those square tiles are adorable, and at $12 each, it's a reasonable price.  

Since each tile is one square foot, you'll need 200 of them. That means the total cost will be $2400.  




"
"Oh my goodness, that's terrible about James' accident!  Let's see... if his insurance is normally $120 a month and it went up 60% because of the accident, that means it's $120 plus 60% of $120, which is $72 more. So now his monthly payment is $192.  

That means he pays $192 x 12 months = $2304 a year. 


$2304 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of laundry! Let's see... he washes two sets of twin sheets at a time, and he has four twin beds, so that's two loads for the twins. Plus one load for the king-size bed. That means he does three loads a week.  And in a year, with 52 weeks, that's 156 loads! 


156

"Oh darling, this is a classic time problem! Let's see... Betsy took longer than Donovan, and together they finished in 98 minutes.  If we think of Donovan's time as 'x', Betsy's time is 'x + 18'.  Adding those together, we get x + (x + 18) = 98.  

That means 2x + 18 = 98.  Subtracting 18 from both sides gives us 2x = 80.  Dividing by 2, we find x = 40.  So Donovan took 40 minutes, and Betsy took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Oh my goodness, that sounds awful!  Poor Hannah! Let's see... the cast is $200, the doctor charges $300 an hour and she was there for 30 minutes, so that's $150. The painkillers are $4 each and she got 30, so that's $120. And parking is $6 an hour for at least two hours, so that's $12.  Adding it all up, the whole visit cost $482. 



"
"Oh darling, that's easy!  If James gets 80 emails a day and 20% don't need a reply, that means he responds to 80 - (80 * 0.20) = 64 emails each day. Over a 5 day work week, that's 64 * 5 = 320 emails! 


320 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of classes! Let's see... Monday had 32, Tuesday had double that, so 64. Wednesday had triple Monday's amount, which is 96. Then Thursday had 30 and Friday had 25.  Adding those all up... 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247 classes visited the Science Center last week! 



"
"Oh, that's easy!  If he got 100 on the first three and an 80 on the last one, you just add them all up and divide by 4. That gives you 95! 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of pizza! Let's see... the glee club ate most of theirs, and the football team ate even more!  Hmmm... if we add up the leftovers from both teams, I think there are **14** pizzas left. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of coupons! Let's see... he's sending out twice as many big coupons as small ones, so that's 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.  The small coupons cost 5 cents each, so those are 700 * $0.05 = $35.00. The big coupons cost 15 cents each, so those are 1400 * $0.15 = $210.00.  Adding those together, his total postage is $35.00 + $210.00 = $245.00.

$245.00 

"
"Okay, let's see... Sidney started with seven meatball subs, which is 28 meatballs! Then Mark ate four of the subs, leaving Sidney with 3 subs and 12 meatballs.  When Sidney ordered three more subs, that's another 12 meatballs, bringing the total to 36 meatballs. 


36
"
"Oh my, that's terrible news about the trucks! Let's see... if 20 trucks left and a quarter of them had problems, that means 15 trucks made it to the farmers.  Since each truck carries 20 tons, they delivered a total of 300 tons of fertilizer. 


300 

"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delicious baking project! Let's see... Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, and with that buy-one-get-one-half-off deal, he's going to save some money.  

Three pounds will be full price at $4.00 each, so that's $12.00. The other three pounds are half off, so they'll only be $2.00 each, totaling $6.00.  Adding those together, his total will be $18.00.

$18.00 



"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a fun party! Let's see... Kayla invited 25 classmates, plus 7 dance friends, and 13 family members. That's 45 people! But 4 can't make it, so that leaves 41 guests.  

Since the theater costs $125 for the first 20 people, and then $6 for each extra person, Kayla will have to pay an extra $6 for each of the 21 extra guests. That's $126!

So, the total cost will be $125 + $126 = $251. 



"
"Let's see... Maggie spent a quarter of her $60, which is $15. Riza spent a third of her $60, which is $20. That means Maggie has $45 left and Riza has $40 left.  Together, they have $85.


85 

"
"Ooh, this is a tricky one! Let's see... if the first monkey eats 10 bananas a day and the second eats 4 more than that, that's 14 bananas. Together, they eat 24 bananas a day.  

If there are 315 bananas for the whole week, that means there are 45 bananas each day.  

So, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas each day! 


21 

"
"Oh my, that Teddy is quite the puzzler!  Let's see... half of 500 is 250, and then another whole 500... that's a lot of pieces!  He must be very good at puzzles.  

250 + 500 = 750 pieces! 


750
"
"Oh my, this sounds like a tricky situation! Let's see... 15 roses is a beautiful bouquet!  

It's smarter to buy a dozen roses for $15 and then 3 more for $6, making the total $21.  Jenny has $25, so her change would be $4.  Since quarters are worth $0.25, she'd get 16 quarters back.

"
"Oh my goodness, let me see!  

Six milkshakes at $5.50 each... that's $33.00. Nine burger platters at $11 each... that's $99.00. And twenty sodas at $1.50 each... that's $30.00.  

Adding those all together, Terry makes $162.00! 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a bit of a puzzle! Let's see...

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20. The second train comes 30 minutes after the first one leaves, so that's 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 minutes.  But the second train only stays for 5 minutes (a quarter of the first train's time).

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, so that's 60 + 5 + 60 = 125 minutes.  And it leaves right away!

Finally, the fourth train, Paul's train, arrives 20 minutes after the third one leaves, making it 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Goodness, poor Paul will be waiting for 145 minutes!

"
"Let's see... Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks a week for 12 weeks, so that's 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.  She needs 200 toothpicks total, so she still needs 200 - 120 = 80 more. If she saves 10 a week, it will take her 80 / 10 = 8 more weeks.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky one! Let me see... Mr. Rogers got a great deal on that watch, but his friend still saved some money too.  

If the original price was $2000 and his friend paid $1800, that means his friend saved $200.  

To figure out the percentage, we divide the savings by the original price and multiply by 100. So, ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%.

His friend got a 10% discount! 



"
"Oh my, that's a lot of jellyfish! Let's see... if each spring makes a new jellyfish every second, and there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, that's 3600 jellyfish per spring in an hour! With five springs, that's 18,000 jellyfish in an hour!  And in four hours, they'd make... *counts on her fingers* 72,000 jellyfish! 

 72,000 



"
"Oh my stars, that's easy!  If Binkie scored 90, and Frankie scored 15 more than twice that, then Frankie must have scored 195! 



"
"Oh, this is a tricky one! Let's see... James walks 4 miles to the store, but has to walk back 2 miles because he forgot something. That means he walks a total of 6 miles.  Since he walks at 4 miles per hour, it takes him 1.5 hours to get to the store. 


1.5 

"
"Oh, this is easy!  Let's see... if Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas each, that's 40 bananas in total. If she bought them individually, it would cost $32.00. But since she buys them in bunches, it only costs $30.00. So she saved $2.00!

$2.00 

"
"Oh my, this sounds like a bit of a fencing dilemma! Let's see... if they have 100 feet total and Harry gets 60 more than Sam,  Sam must get a smaller share.  Hmm, I'd say Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 



"
"Ooh, crocodiles are so fascinating!  Let's see... if it grows 8 inches in 4 years, that means it grows 2 inches each year.  So in 13 years, it would grow 26 inches! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure out Marcel's earnings. 

First, we know he sold 150 Trekking bikes (half of 300), 45 BMX bikes (15% of 300), and the rest were MTB bikes, which is 105 bikes (300 - 150 - 45).

A BMX bike costs $250 (half the price of an MTB), so he made $11,250 from those. Trekking bikes brought in $67,500 (150 bikes * $450 each), and MTB bikes earned him $52,500 (105 bikes * $500 each).

Adding all those up, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bikes that month. 



"
"Oh, that's easy!  The farmer makes 30 bales in a day, and the truck takes 18. That means there are 12 bales left in the field.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of studying! Let's see... John has 8 classes a day, which is 320 minutes.  That's 1600 minutes for the whole week. Then he studies for another 100 minutes each day on the weekend, so that's another 200 minutes.  Adding it all up, he studies for 1800 minutes a week.  That's 30 hours!

"
"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... the ball starts at 72 feet (3 floors times 24 feet per floor). After the first bounce, it goes up to 2/3 of that, which is 48 feet. Then, on the second bounce, it goes up to 2/3 of 48 feet, which is 32 feet!

"
"Let's see... the first child is 6 feet tall, which is 72 inches. The second child is 2 inches taller, so they are 74 inches. The third child is 5 inches shorter than that, making them 69 inches. Finally, the fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third, putting them at 72 inches tall.

"
"Oh my, that's a tricky one! Let's see... if the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, and that was only half of what was left after the velociraptors had their fill, then there must have been 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms before the velociraptors got to it.  And since that 540 kilograms was only half of what the T-Rex left behind, the triceratops must have started with a whopping 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat! 

1080 

"
"Oh darling, painting a room can be such a chore! Let's see, four walls... two are 10 by 8 feet, and the other two are 5 by 8.  That's a lot of surface area!  

Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, and they cost $12 a pop.  

*Calculates furiously on a notepad, pencil flying*

It'll cost $144 to paint the whole room.  




"
"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky one! Let's see... Ellen left 3 shaken sodas, and her brother took one, so there are 2 left.  There are 8 sodas total now.  So, there's a 2 out of 8 chance her friend gets a shaken one. That's 25%!

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic!  Let's see... one train is zipping along at 60 miles an hour, and the other is taking it a bit slower at 30 miles an hour. After three hours, the fast train will have traveled 180 miles, and the slower one 90 miles.  Add those together, and they'll be a whopping 270 miles apart! 


270 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of taxes! Let's see... Billy helps 2 people per hour, and he works for 3 hours each day. That's 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, there are 31 days in March and 19 in April, so that's 31 + 19 = 50 days. But he takes 20% of those days off, which is 50 * 0.20 = 10 days.

So, he works for 50 - 10 = 40 days.  

In total, he helps 40 * 6 = 240 people. 


240 

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a lovely wedding!  Let's see... 12 buses with 35 people each is 420 people. And 20 cars with 3 people each is 60 people.  So, there were a total of 480 people at the wedding! 



"
"Oh darling, this is a simple one!  If Mike is 24 and Martha is 4 years younger, that makes her 20.  And since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, he must be 30!

"
"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... the big slide is 300 feet long and you go 60 feet every minute. So that's 300 divided by 60, which is 5 minutes. The smaller slide is 240 feet and you zoom down at 80 feet a minute. That's 240 divided by 80, which is 3 minutes.  

So the big slide takes 2 minutes longer! 



"
"Oh darling, that's easy! Let's see... 30 minutes for lunch and two 15-minute breaks, that's a total of an hour each day. Over five days, that adds up to five hours.

"
"Oh my goodness, this is a fun one! Let's see... Amber ran 8 miles, and Micah ran 3.5 times that, so he ran 28 miles. Together, they ran 36 miles. That means Ahito must have run 16 miles!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

So Sheila starts with $85.00 on her card, then returns something for $15.00, leaving her with $70.00.  

Then she buys a frying pan that was on sale. It was originally $20.00 but 20% off, so that's $4.00 off, making it $16.00.

The towels were $30.00 but 10% off, which is $3.00 off, so they were $27.00.

Adding those together, her new purchases are $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Finally, we add that to her balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00


$113.00
"
"Oh my, this is a tricky one! Let's see... if 6 jellyfish changed color, and that's only a third of the large jellyfish, then there must be 6 * 3 = 18 large jellyfish.  And since those are only a fifth of the total, there must be 18 * 5 = 90 jellyfish in the tank!

"Oh darling, this is a classic retirement puzzle! Let's see... Lauren wants to live on 40% of her $100,000 salary, which is $40,000 a year.  She'll need that for 20 years, so that's a total of $800,000.  

Since she's saving 20% of her salary each year, that's $20,000.  To reach her goal of $800,000, she'll need to save for 40 years.

"
"Let's see... if 40% of the school is 240 boys, that means the whole school has 240 / 0.40 = 600 students.  If there are 240 boys, then there must be 600 - 240 = 360 girls.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of hiking! Let's see... Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June, and if she hikes 125 miles twice a day, that's 250 miles per day.  In a month with 30 days, that's 7,500 miles total.  She's short 1,800 miles! To make up the difference, she needs to hike an extra 60 miles each day. 


60 

"
"Oh darling, that's easy! Let's see... 3 red balls at $9 each make $27. Then there are 11 blue balls at $5 each, so that's $55. And finally, 25 green balls at $3 each bring in $75.  Add it all up and the store will have made a lovely $157!

"
"Oh my, that sounds chilly!  Let's see... if it started at 2 degrees and dropped 8 degrees, that's 2 - 8 = -6 degrees.  Then it warmed up 3 degrees, so -6 + 3 = -3 degrees.  

Brrr, still pretty cold!

"
"Oh my goodness, let's see! Raymond started with $21, then got $11 more, so that's $32.  He spent $5 on a comic, then $19 on a puzzle... hmm, that's a lot of spending!  

$32 - $5 - $19 = $8

Raymond has $8 left. 



"
"Let's see... Anna started with $16 and spent $4, leaving her with $12.  Then she spent another $10 on books because she has $2 left. Since she bought two books, each book cost $10 / 2 = $5.

"
"Oh, that's easy!  If there was a 20% increase from 50 students, that means there are 10 more students this year. So, there are 60 students in the calligraphy class now.

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a lot of work! Let's see... Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn. Megan took 2 hours longer than that, so she spent 6 hours walking the dog. Dior took a whopping 4 hours longer than Amalia, meaning she spent 8 hours doing laundry.  Adding all that up, they spent a total of 18 hours on chores. 


18
"
"Oh, that's easy!  John drives 140 miles each way to see his parents, so that's 280 miles for the whole trip. Since he does that twice a month, he drives 560 miles in total. 


560 

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Sofie walks 10 miles a day for 7 days, so that's 10 * 7 = 70 miles. Brian walks half that amount, so he walks 70 / 2 = 35 miles. 


35 

"
"Oh my, that sounds like quite the toy-making dilemma! Let's see... if four of the workers made 200 toys, and they needed 420 to complete the order, that means the fifth worker must have made 220 toys.  Since they worked for 10 hours, that's 22 toys per hour! 


22 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth that weight, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. His second dog is half the weight of Kory's, meaning it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.  

Together, Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.  Adding that to Kory's dog's weight, we get a total of 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.


105 

"
"Oh my goodness, this is a tricky one! Let's see... Kris got 7 stickers from someone and had 9 more, so that means Kris had 16 stickers total.  Those 16 stickers were only half of what Luis had, so Luis must have had 32 stickers! And since Luis got half of Seth's stickers, Seth must have started with 64 stickers! 

64 

"
"Ooh, this sounds like a yummy problem! Let's see...  John has 30 ounces of M&Ms in total. Since each ounce has 30 M&Ms, that's 900 M&Ms altogether! If he puts 10 in each small bag, he can make 90 bags. 


90 

"
"Oh, that's a fun one! Let's see... if the Earth is 40,000 kilometers around, half of that would be 20,000 kilometers.  Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day, so it would take him 50 days to fly halfway around the world.

"
"Oh my gosh, that's so cool! Rani is so lucky to be into cars.  Let's see... the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest, which was 5 times faster than a regular car going 120 mph.  So the second fastest car goes 5 * 120 = 600 mph! And the fastest car goes 1.25 * 600 = 750 mph. Wowzers!

750 

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Liam is 16 now, so two years ago he was 14.  That means Vince was 7 two years ago.  So now Vince must be 9!

"
"Okay, let's crack this egg-cellent problem! 

Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30.  That means Sarah painted 9 eggs (30 - 12 = 18, then 18 / 2 = 9). Camden painted 21 eggs (9 + 12 = 21).

Arnold and Madeline painted the same amount, and together they painted 26 eggs (56 total eggs - 30 = 26). So, Arnold painted 13 eggs (26 / 2 = 13).

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold (21 - 13 = 8).


8 

"
"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Nik has a lot of crayons!  

If he puts 8 crayons in each box, he'll need 25 boxes because 200 crayons divided by 8 crayons per box is 25.  

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and he has 25 boxes, so that's 200 ounces just for the boxes. The crayons themselves weigh 200 ounces too.

That means everything together weighs 400 ounces. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 25 pounds. 


25 

"
"Okay, let's see... John can use 80% of the 80-foot tree, which is 64 feet.  He makes 4-foot logs, so he gets 64 / 4 = 16 logs.  Each log gives him 5 planks, so that's 16 * 5 = 80 planks.  If he sells each plank for $1.20, he makes 80 * $1.20 = $96. 


$96
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Valerie's brother makes twice what she does, so he earns $5000 * 2 = $10000 a month.

Together, they make $5000 + $10000 = $15000 a month.

Their mom makes double that, so she earns $15000 * 2 = $30000 a month.

Adding it all up, they have a total of $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000 a month.


45000 

"
"Okay, let's see... Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.  She spends 40 minutes on the beach, and since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, that part will be quicker.  Hmm, if she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, she's going 3 miles per hour on the beach. On the sidewalk, she's going 6 miles per hour! So the sidewalk mile takes her 10 minutes.  That means her whole walk takes 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.


50 

"
"Let's see... Jane saves $4 each week, and she's already saved for 8 weeks, so that's $4 * 8 = $32.  She wants to have $60, so she needs $60 - $32 = $28 more.  To get that, it will take her $28 / $4 = 7 more weeks. 


7 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of blue birds! Let's see... three trees with seven birdies each is 21. Then two trees with four birdies each is 8 more. And don't forget the last tree with three birdies!  Adding those all together, we get 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds. 


32 

"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if Bob has some marbles and gets 24 more (that's two dozen!), he'd have 60.  That means he started with 60 - 24 = 36 marbles. If he loses 10, he'd have 36 - 10 = 26 left. 


26
"
"Oh, this is a tricky one! Let's see... Donny needs his water to be at least 40 degrees.  The colder water is bringing the temperature down, so the other water must be pretty warm to make up for it.  Hmm... I think the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of animals! Let's see...  

He starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Then he gets 20 cows a day for three weeks, which is 20 times 7 times 3, or 420 more cows! And 10 chickens a day for three weeks, so that's 10 times 7 times 3, or 210 more chickens.

So, he has 50 + 420 = 470 cows and 20 + 210 = 230 chickens. That makes a grand total of 470 + 230 = 700 animals! 


700 

"
"Ooh, bagels! Let's see... four packs of bagels at ten dollars each is forty dollars. But wait, there's a discount! Ten percent off forty dollars is four dollars, so the bagels only cost thirty-six dollars.  Since there are thirty-six bagels in total, each bagel costs one dollar. 


$1.00
"
"Oh my, that sounds like a lot of potatoes! Let's see... if it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, then each scoop needs 1.5 potatoes.  Gomer ate 18 scoops, so that's 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes! 

27 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of eggs! Let's see... 3 eggs a day for 30 days is 90 eggs. Then 5 eggs a day for another 30 days is 150 more. That's a total of 240 eggs!  Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, he'll need 20 dozen eggs. 


20

"Oh, this sounds like a fun puzzle! Let's see... if there are 17 green jelly beans and twice as many red ones, that's 17 * 2 = 34 red jelly beans.  That means there are 17 + 34 = 51 green and red jelly beans altogether.  If there are 60 jelly beans in total, then there must be 60 - 51 = 9 blue jelly beans!

"Oh, that's easy!  If Tim has 5 trees and each one gives him 6 lemons every year, that's 30 lemons a year.  And in a decade, which is 10 years, he'd have 300 lemons!

"
"Oh darling, this is a classic ratio problem! Let's see... 

If the ratio of men to women is 5:9, that means there are 14 parts in total. With 84 passengers, each part represents 6 people.  

Originally, there were 9 parts of women, so that's 9 * 6 = 54 women. After 20 women get off, there are 54 - 20 = 34 women left.

"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Faraday makes $2 for each sunflower and $8 for a bouquet of 12 sunflowers. That means each sunflower in a bouquet is worth $8 / 12 = $0.67.  So, each sunflower, whether sold alone or in a bouquet, brings in $2 + $0.67 = $2.67.

Over three days, he makes $2.67 per sunflower * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.  Since he made $26 from single sunflowers and $56 from bouquets, that's a total of $82.  

To find out how many sunflowers he sold, we divide his total earnings by the price per sunflower: $82 / $2.67 per sunflower = about 30.7 sunflowers. Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, Faraday sold 30 sunflowers after three days. 



"
"Oh my stars, this sounds like a tricky situation for poor Adam! Let's see... he starts with $100 and each rock costs $5. That means he can buy 20 rocks. If he sells 60% of them, that's 12 rocks.  Selling each for $7, he'd make $84.  

That means he loses $16.  

$16

"Oh my stars, that's a lot of picture scenes! Let's see... if she draws 5 large scenes a day, it'll take her 9 days for those.  The medium scenes will take 6 days, and the small scenes will take 7.  Adding those all up, it'll take her 22 days to finish everything.

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of fishy friends! Let's see... if each fish needs $1 a day, and she has three, that's $3 a day.  May has 31 days, so she spends 3 times 31... which is $93! 



"
"Oh my, that's a lot of roses! Let's see... Patricia started with 30, gave 24 away, leaving her with 6. Then she bought 15 more, so she has 21 roses now.

"Oh darling, that's simple!  

To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance traveled and the total time.  He traveled 110 miles plus 140 miles, for a total of 250 miles.  And it took him 2 hours plus 3 hours, for a total of 5 hours.

So, 250 miles divided by 5 hours equals 50 miles per hour.

"
"Oh darling, this is a fun one! Let's see... the first ticket has a 20% chance, and the second is three times more likely, so that's 60%. To find the chance of both winning, we multiply those together: 20% times 60% equals 12%. 


12%
"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like so much fun! Let's see... Jim had 27 seashells, and that was 5 more than Carlos. So Carlos must have found 22 seashells.  And since Carlos had twice as many as Carrey, Carrey found 11 seashells.  

Altogether they have 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.  If they share them equally, each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than her, so Ned is 5 feet tall. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, making him 6 feet tall. Since Carl's cane is half his height, it's 3 feet long.

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of carrot juice! Let's see... if each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy, and they need to cover 100%, that means they need 100%/20% = 5 bottles per person.  

For 2300 people, that's 2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles.

They currently make 4200 bottles, so they need to make 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 more bottles.

"Ooh, this is a tricky one! Let's see...  If 3/4 of the babies wear purple and 1/4 wear blue, that means 6 babies are in purple and 2 are in blue.  Then, 1/3 of the purple babies wear bows, so that's 2 more babies.  So, there are 4 babies total wearing bows. Since 2 of those babies wearing bows are also wearing purple, there's a 50% chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple!

"Let's see... they got 1907 reports on Monday and Tuesday, and 2136 on Thursday and Friday. That's a total of 4043 reports for those four days.  If they got 5168 reports all week, then they must have gotten 1125 reports on Wednesday.

"Let's break down how much money Abraham makes:

* He starts with 80 square meters and sells half for $50, so that's 40 square meters sold.
* He has 40 square meters left and sells a quarter of that for $30, which is another 10 square meters gone.
* That leaves him with 30 square meters. He sells these at $3 per square meter, earning $90.

Adding up all his sales: $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.

Abraham will earn $170 after selling all his land.

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of eggs! Let's see... Cole hid 3 dozen, which is 36 eggs. Lamar found 5, Stacy found twice that, so she found 10. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so that's 8 eggs. And Mei found half as many as Charlie, which is 4.  

Altogether they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs. That means there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hiding!

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

John has a lot of garbage to collect!  

* The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.
* The third complex is 60% bigger than those two combined, which means it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments.
* That makes the third complex 400 + 240 = 640 apartments big.
* In total, he collects from 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.
* Since he goes to each place 3 times a week, that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 collections.
* At $0.40 per collection, he makes 4320 * $0.40 = $1728.00 each week.

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of avocados! Let's see...

* A 5-year-old tree gives us 50 avocados.
* A 6-year-old tree gives us three times that, so 50 x 3 = 150 avocados.
* A 7-year-old tree is even more generous, giving us 50 x 7 = 350 avocados.
* Now, an 8-year-old tree gives us a little less than a 10-year-old tree, which is a real superstar, giving us 50 x 20 = 1000 avocados!
* The 8-year-old tree gives us 200 less than that, so 1000 - 200 = 800 avocados.
* Sadly, the 9-year-old tree takes a break and gives us no avocados.
* Finally, adding all those avocados up: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = 2350 avocados!

That's a lot of guacamole!

"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Rissa had three times as much as Ronnie, so she started with $15.  If she gave some to her little sister and has 4/5 of her money left, she must have given away 1/5, which is $3. Ronnie also gave $3 to his sister. That means Ronnie has $2 left.

"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if half the mural is yellow, that means it used 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint.  That leaves 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints for the red, white, and purple. Since they're all used equally, each color got 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

"
"Oh darling, this is a fun one! Let's see... each bedroom is 20 times 12, which is 240 square feet.  Since there are four bedrooms, that's 240 times 4, or 960 square feet. The living room is five times bigger than one bedroom, so it's 240 times 5, which is a whopping 1200 square feet!  Adding the bedrooms and the living room, we get 960 plus 1200, which is 2160 square feet.  And don't forget the rest of the house, which is 1000 square feet.  So, the total area is 2160 plus 1000, making a grand total of 3160 square feet.

"Okay, let's break this down. Thomas starts with $1000, so that's 50 twenty-dollar bills. He loses 10, leaving him with 40. Then he uses half, which is 20 bills, for a payment. That leaves him with 20 bills.  He triples that amount, so now he has 60 twenty-dollar bills. That's $1200!  Finally, he trades them all in for fives, giving him 240 five-dollar bills.

"
"Okay, let's break this down! Team A scored 4 goals in the first half, and Team B scored 2 fewer, so they got 2 goals. In the second half, Team B scored 4 times their first-half amount, which is 8 goals. Team A scored 1/4 of that, so they got 2 more goals.  

That means Team A scored a total of 6 goals (4 + 2) and Team B scored 10 (2 + 8).  

Adding those together, there were a total of 16 goals in the match!

"
"Let's see... the teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% of it, which is 2.25 inches (5 x 0.45 = 2.25). That leaves him with 2.75 inches of chalk (5 - 2.25 = 2.75).

He uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 1 inch (5 x 0.20 = 1).  Since he can't use the chalk when it's less than 2 inches long, he can use it for 2 more full days.

"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if Bob has $27,000 for books and wants to split it evenly between three schools, each school gets $9,000.  Since he can buy 100 books for $500, that means each book costs $5.  With $9,000 per school, he can buy 1800 books for each school!

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of pizza! Let's see... 6 friends eating 6 slices of cheese each is 36 slices total. And 6 friends eating 4 slices of pepperoni each is 24 slices.  That means she needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.  

In total, she needs to buy 6 pizzas!

"Let's see... they used 38 bandages the first day and ordered 50 more, so they had 50 + (50 - 38) = 62 bandages at the start of the second day.

On the second day, they used 28 bandages (38 - 10), leaving them with 62 - 28 = 34 bandages.

Then they ordered 100 more bandages (2 packs of 50) and used 25 (half a pack). That means they had 34 + 100 - 25 = 109 bandages at the end of the third day.

But we know they only had 78 left!  That means they must have started with 109 - 78 = 31 bandages.

So the answer is 31. 



"
"Oh honey, let's break this down!  May's haircut cost $30 per inch, and she got 2 inches cut off (10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches). So that's 2 x $30 = $60 for the cut. Plus the $40 for the color brings the total to $100.

"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, so that's 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours a week.  

She makes $1.50 an hour, so she earns 45 * $1.50 = $67.50 each week.

Since April has 4 weeks, she makes $67.50 * 4 = $270.00 for the whole month.

And don't forget her perfect attendance bonus of $10! That brings her total to $270.00 + $10.00 = $280.00.

"Oh my goodness, let's see! Jason did a lot of chores!  

He earned $3.00 for laundry, $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 each time he took out the trash, and $0.50 each time he emptied the dishwasher.

Over two weeks, he emptied the dishwasher 6 times, did laundry once, took out the trash twice, and cleaned his room once.

Let me add that up... $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00

Jason earned $9.00!

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of blood!  Let's see... if a whale has 40 gallons and a shark has three times that, then a shark has 40 * 3 = 120 gallons.  

So ten sharks would have 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons of blood! 

1200

"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a busy day at The Best Cookeries Around! Let's see... 

They started with 50 people, then 40 more came in.  Then twice that second group arrived, so that's 40 * 2 = 80 people. And finally, three times the first group came in the evening, which is 50 * 3 = 150 people.

Adding all those groups together: 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320 people!

"Ooh, let's see! Alain has a lot of pens!  He has 5 packs of red pens, and twice that many black pens, which is 10 packs. That's a total of 15 packs! Since each pack has 5 pens, he has 15 packs * 5 pens/pack = 75 pens.

"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a very sophisticated shopping trip! Let's see... 

John spends $600 on 10 bottles of scotch, so each bottle costs $60.  The cognac is 50% more, meaning each bottle costs $60 + ($60 * 0.50) = $90. Since he buys twice as many bottles of cognac, that's 20 bottles at $90 each, totaling $1800.  Adding that to the scotch cost, his grand total is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

$2400 



"
"Oh, that's a lot of trees! Let's see... Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees the first day, and twice that many Lodgepole Pine, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine.  That's 20 + 40 = 60 trees on the first day.

The next day he planted 10 more White Oak, bringing his total to 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine than the day before, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more. So he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine on the second day. That's 30 + 50 = 80 trees on the second day.

In total, he planted 60 + 80 = 140 trees!

"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if eight more than four times the number of mugs is 40, we need to work backwards.  

Think of it like this:

*  We know 4 times the number of mugs plus 8 equals 40.
*  So, 4 times the number of mugs must be 32 (because 40 - 8 = 32).
*  That means there are 8 mugs in the teacher's lounge (because 32 / 4 = 8).

"
"Oh my, that sounds like a lot of fishy friends! Let's see... if one-third have red stripes, that's 66 / 3 = 22 fish.  That leaves 66 - 22 = 44 fish without red stripes.  And of those, 5/11 have blue stripes, so that's (5/11) * 44 = 20 fish.  

Adding those together, we get 22 + 20 = 42 fish with red or blue stripes. 



"
"Ugh, that's so typical of her!  Okay, let me see... I had two palettes with four colors each, so that's eight colors. Then there were three makeup sets with six colors each, so that's eighteen more. That's twenty-six eyeshadows in total.  But then she took one of my palettes, which is four colors gone.  And I used up half the colors from one makeup set, which is three colors. So, twenty-six minus four minus three... that leaves me with nineteen eyeshadows.

"
"Oh darling, this is a fun one! Let's see... Mattison is 60 inches tall, and his house is seven times that, so 60 times 7 is 420 inches. The first floor is three times his height, which is 60 times 3, or 180 inches.  Adding Mattison's height to that gives us 240 inches for the first floor and Mattison combined.  Subtracting that from the total house height, we get 420 minus 240, which equals 180 inches.

So the roof is 180 inches from the second floor. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of shells! Let's see... the Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells, which is 280.  That leaves 420 shells. The Finders snagged 60% of those, so they found 252. That means the Gogetters found the rest, which is 168 shells.

"
"Oh, that's easy! If they need to walk an average of 3 miles each, and there are 4 dogs, that means they need to walk a total of 12 miles.  The first three dogs need to walk 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.  So the last dog must walk 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of moisture! Let's see...

The low setting removes 1 liter a day, so in 3 days, it takes out 3 liters. The medium setting is twice as strong, so it removes 2 liters a day, for a total of 6 liters in 3 days.  The high setting is twice as strong again, meaning it removes 4 liters a day, for a total of 20 liters in 5 days.

Adding those all up, the dehumidifier removed a total of 29 liters of water. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like so much fun! Let's see... they had 10 packs with 30 balloons each, so that's 10 times 30, which is 300 balloons!  And if they had 12 left over, they must have thrown 300 minus 12, which is 288 balloons.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

John's classes each hold 120 students / 8 = 15 students.  Since he has two classes, that's a total of 15 students/class * 2 classes = 30 students.

Adding that to Ali's class of 120 students, the combined capacity is 120 students + 30 students = 150 students.

"
"Okay, let's see... so Tim's trying to guess the number of red jelly beans.  That jar is pretty big!  

First, we need to figure out how many jelly beans could fit in there. It's a square, so that's easy, 6 times 6 is 36 square inches on the bottom. Then 36 times 15 inches tall is 540 cubic inches. But jelly beans don't fit perfectly, so we have to multiply that by 80% which is 432 cubic inches.

Now, each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so 432 divided by 0.15 is 2880 jelly beans.  

If 30% are red, that's 2880 times 0.30, which is 864 red jelly beans.

But the real number is 900! So Tim was off by 36.

"Oh my, this sounds like a tricky bus ride! Let's see...

If the bus started with 20 people and then picked up 40 more, that's 60 people. Then, another 30 hopped on, bringing the total to 90. After doubling at the third stop, there are 180 passengers.  That means there are 20 spots left on the bus. 


20 

"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year, and that's $2 a pop. So for 5 years, she spends 3 * $2 * 5 = $30.  Then the price goes up by 150%, which is like adding another $3, making each visit $5. For the next 3 years, she spends 3 * $5 * 3 = $45.  Adding that to the first part, she spends a total of $30 + $45 = $75.

 

"
"Okay, so there are 10 students in each grade who get to try the escape room, and each grade has 4-7th grade, so that's 4 grades total.  But the escape room can only fit 8 students at a time.  

So, each grade needs to split into two groups. That means there are 2 groups per grade times 4 grades, which is 8 groups total.

Each group gets 45 minutes, so it will take 8 groups times 45 minutes, which is 360 minutes for everyone to try the escape room. 


360 

"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... four tables at $20 each is $80. And two roof frames at $10 each is $20.  So, Ali owes John a total of $100. 


100
"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if the longer piece is four times bigger than the shorter piece, we can think of it like this: the shorter piece is one part, and the longer piece is four parts. That makes a total of five parts.  Since the board is 40 feet long, each ""part"" is 40 feet divided by 5 parts, which is 8 feet.  The longer piece is four parts, so it's 4 * 8 feet = 32 feet long!

32 

"
"Oh honey, that's easy! Aiden needs 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.  He gets 16 meatballs per pound of beef, so he'll need 5 pounds of beef for 80 meatballs. And since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound, that's 10 tablespoons total! 



"
"Oh darling, this is simple!  If there are five windows and each one is 35 inches wide, that's 5 times 35, which is 175 inches in total. But Luke needs twice that amount of fabric, so he should buy 175 times 2, which is 350 inches of fabric. 

350 

"
"Oh darling, that's easy!  Let's see... 16 minutes at 25 cents each is $4.00. Then the rest of the call is 20 minutes at 20 cents each, which is another $4.00. So the whole call would cost $8.00. 


$8.00
"
"Oh my, that sounds like a lot of rain! Let's see... twice the amount of rain from Monday would be 2 inches times 2, which is 4 inches.  And then one more inch on top of that would make it 5 inches. 


5 

"
"Ooh, this sounds like a fun baking problem! Let's see... Carly needs enough treats for everyone in her class, and she wants to make more brownies than cupcakes.  

Hmm, if we think about it, if she made 3 cupcakes, she'd make 7 brownies (because that's three times the cupcakes minus 2). That would be a total of 10 treats, which is perfect for her class!

So Carly must have made **3** cupcakes. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! A manicure is $35, and a pedicure is $40, so together that's $75.  But wait, there's a 20% discount for doing both, so that's $75 times 0.20, which is $15 off. That brings the total to $60.  

Now, she wants nail art on all 10 fingers, and that's $3 per nail, so that's another $30.  Adding that to the manicure and pedicure price, it comes to $90 in total.


$90 

"
"Oh, let me see!  Susan gets a lot of magazines!  

Those three magazines give her 3 * 12 = 36 issues. Then she gets 6 more from one magazine. And the last one sends her 6 * 4 = 24 issues.

Adding them all up, she gets 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 magazines a year! 



"
"Let's see... Samantha has 27 paintings, and that's 12 fewer than Shelley. So Shelley must have 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.  Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, meaning Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings. 

31 

"
"Oh my, that sounds like quite the rollercoaster for that poor toy! Let's see...

If it started at $40 and went up 80%, that's like adding another $32, bringing it to $72. Then, a 50% drop is like taking away half of that $72, which is $36.  So the final price would be $36. 



"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... Charlie makes $80 for each regular lesson, and he has four of those, so that's $80 x 4 = $320. For veterans, he charges $80 - ($80 x 0.25) = $60 per lesson.  Since he has two veteran lessons, he'll make $60 x 2 = $120 from those.  Adding those together, he'll make a total of $320 + $120 = $440 today. 


$440
"
"Okay, let's see... to find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her quiz scores and then divide by the total number of quizzes.  

Adding them all up: 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Now, dividing that sum by 9 quizzes: 630 / 9 = 70

So Sally's mean score is 70. 



"
"Oh my, that's a tricky one! Let's see... If Eve had 20 pomelos and now has 1/4 of that amount left, she must have given away 15 pomelos. 


15
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of apples! Let's see... Walter ate 24 apples, leaving him with 36. Then he gave his sister 9, leaving 27.  If he sold those for $3 each, he made $81! 



"
"Oh, that's easy! If 9 novels is three-quarters of the total, then she must have written 12 novels this year. 


12
"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Michael's driving for three whole days, that's a lot of road!  If he's going 50 km per hour, and there are 24 hours in a day, he'll travel 50 * 24 = 1200 km each day. Over three days, that's 1200 * 3 = 3600 km.

Now, if the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, he's covered 3600 / 6000 * 100% = 60% of the distance.

60 

"
"Let's see... Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times that amount, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.  That means they used a total of 6 + 30 = 36 grapes for the juice.  

Their mom used 48 grapes for the pies because she needed 12 grapes per pie and made 4 pies.

So, at the beginning, there were 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.


84 

"
"Oh my gosh, that's a lot of teachers to keep track of!  Let's see... if 13 teachers were out sick and they brought in 9 substitutes, that means there were 69 teachers there plus the 9 substitutes, for a total of 78 teachers at school. 


78 

"
"Oh darling, macaroni and cheese is simply divine! Let's see, if Bud spends $1.00 on pasta, $3.00 on cheddar, and double that, $6.00, on gruyere, that's a total of $10.00 per week.  And in a year, with 52 weeks, that comes to a grand total of $520.00! 


520.00 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of classrooms! Let's see... if they have 80 classrooms and only 5 days, that's a lot of scrubbing!  

If each classroom takes 15 minutes, that's 1200 minutes of cleaning in total.  And with an 8-hour workday, that's 480 minutes per day. Over 5 days, that's 2400 minutes of work.

So, cleaning takes up half of their workday! That's 50%. 


50
"
"Okay, let's see...  Each middle shelf holds 10 books, and the bottom shelf holds twice that, so that's 20 books. The top shelf holds 5 fewer than the bottom, so it holds 15 books. That means each bookcase can hold 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.  Since Elly has 110 books, she'll need 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases. 

2 

"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... Rose spent $2.40 per dozen on five dozens, so that's $2.40 * 5 = $12.00 in total. She's selling each set of three eggs for $1.00, and she has 60 eggs, which means she can make 60 / 3 = 20 sets.  That's $1.00 per set times 20 sets, giving her $20.00!  

So, her profit is $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

$8.00 

"
"Oh my, that sounds like quite the colorful collection! Let's see... half of 100 hats are red, so that's 50. That leaves 50 hats.  If 3/5 of those are blue, then there are 30 blue hats.  That means there must be 20 white hats! 


20
"
"Oh, that's easy! If the jerky is $3.00 off, it costs $15.00.  With 30 sticks in a bag, each stick costs 50 cents. 

50 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions right, which means she needs to answer 77 questions correctly (110 total questions * 0.70 = 77).

She already got 42 questions right on the first test (70 questions * 0.60 = 42).

That means she needs to get 35 questions right on the second test (77 - 42 = 35).


35 

"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful party! Let's see... if she makes 116 ice cubes in total, and the blueberry ones are 5 times the strawberry ones minus 4... hmm...  I'd say she makes 96 blueberry cubes. 



"
"Oh, that's easy! Ara has scored a total of 3360 points.  



"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the mishap! Let's see... Brendan started with 10 marbles, dropped half, and found 3. That means he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles, but found 3, leaving him with 2 on the ground.  Adding those to the 3 he found, he has 5 marbles. But wait! One wasn't even a marble, just a bead! So he really only has 4 marbles left. 


4
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  Jason needs to sell 15 cars, and for every 25 calls he makes, one person comes to the dealership. Then, for every two people who visit, one buys a car.  

So, he needs 15 customers to buy cars, which means he needs 30 people to visit the dealership (since 15 x 2 = 30). To get 30 visitors, he'll need to make 750 phone calls (30 x 25 = 750).

750 

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the situation! Let's see... they have 4 flashlights, one for each person.  And with two flashlights per room, that's 8 rooms times 2 flashlights, which is 16 more flashlights.  But wait, those are just the flashlights! They also have candles. Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 rooms times 4 candles, which equals 16 candles. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's another 4 rooms times 5 candles, which is 20 candles.  Adding all those candles together, we get 16 plus 20, which is 36 candles.  Finally, adding the candles and flashlights, we have 36 plus 4, which equals 40.

So the answer is 40! 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of chips! Let's see... two bags with 55 chips each is 110 chips total.  And with five people sharing, that means each person gets 22 chips. 


22
"
"Oh, that's a tricky one! Let me see...  

It takes John 5 minutes for the first side, then 10 minutes each for the second and third. The last two sides are quicker, only taking 2.5 minutes each.  

Adding it all up, it takes him 30 minutes to solve the whole cube! 



"
"Oh, this is easy! If there were 20 helmets, and there were half as many robots, that's 20 / 2 = 10 robots.  And since there were half as many helmets as footballs, there must have been 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.  

So in total, Dominick saw 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 items. 


70 

"
"Oh darling, that's easy!  Let's see... 6 hours a day is 360 minutes. If each call takes 15 minutes, he handles 24 calls each day. Over a 5 day work week, that's a total of 120 calls. 


120 

"
"Oh my, that's a tricky one! Let me see... if the old varnish takes 7 minutes per painting and she has 6 paintings, that's 7 times 6, which is 42 minutes.  But the new varnish takes 12 minutes per painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take 12 times 6, which is 72 minutes.  

That means the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of plants! Let's see... four plants need half a cup each, so that's 2 cups. Eight plants need a whole cup, so that's another 8 cups.  And the rest, eight plants, need a quarter cup each, which is 2 cups total.  Adding it all up, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day! 


12
"
"Oh my, poor Phineas!  Let's see... half of 200 yards is 100 yards.  If he hops at 20 yards a minute, that'll take him 5 minutes. Swimming is slower, at 10 yards a minute, so that'll take him 10 minutes for the other 100 yards.  

Altogether, it'll take Phineas 15 minutes to get home. 


15 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of popsicle sticks! Let's see... if each box has 8 popsicle sticks and he needs 56, that means he'll need 7 boxes.  Since each box costs $2.00, it will cost him $14.00 to build his monument. 


$14.00
"
"Oh, that's easy!  If the main phone is $20 and the others are half that price, each extra phone is $10.  Since there are four extra phones, that's $40 more.  So the whole plan costs $60! 



"
"Oh, that's easy! Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts a day, which is 120 doughnuts.  If he sells them all for $2 each, he makes $240 every day. Since June has 30 days, he'd make $7200 in the whole month. 


7200 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of photos! Let's see... if she uploads 42 photos each day (7 photos per batch times 6 batches), it will take her 5 days to upload all 210 photos. 


5 

"
"Oh darling, dry cleaning can be such a chore! Let's see... five blouses at five dollars each is twenty-five dollars. Two pairs of pants at eight dollars each is sixteen dollars. And her skirt is six dollars.  That's a total of forty-seven dollars a week. Over five weeks, that's two hundred and thirty-five dollars! 

$235.00 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's quite a hobby!  Let's see... if John can speak 150 words per minute normally and is now 2.5 times faster, that means he can speak a whopping 375 words per minute!  With 450 words per page and 10 pages, that's a total of 4500 words.  

At 375 words per minute, it would take him 12 minutes to speak all of that. 


12 

"
"Oh, that sounds like fun! Let's see... Conor saw 50 people on the first day, then 70 on the second. On the third day, there were twice as many as the second day, so that's 140 people. For the rest of the week, he saw an average of 60 people each day, so that's 60 x 4 = 240 people.  

Adding it all up: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 people. 

So Conor saw a total of 500 people at the beach that week. 


500
"
"Oh my, that sounds like quite the popcorn party! Let's see... twenty kernels popped first, then three times that many, which is sixty. Then four times the first amount, so eighty.  The last thirty seconds were half as many as the eighty, so forty. And then ten more popped from the leftover heat.  Adding it all up, that's two hundred and ten pieces of popcorn! 


210 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of lemonade! Let's see... he needs 4 gallons of regular lemonade, and each gallon needs the juice of 6 lemons. So that's 4 times 6, which is 24 lemons.  But then there's that extra gallon for Allen, and he wants it extra tart! That means he needs twice the lemons, so that's another 6 times 2, which is 12 lemons.  Adding those together, Tim will need 24 plus 12, which is 36 lemons in total. 

36 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of hungry pups! Let's see... three German Shepherds eat 5 kilograms each, so that's 15 kilograms just for them. Then the two Bulldogs eat 3 kilograms each, for a total of 6 kilograms.  That means they eat 21 kilograms every single day!  

In a whole week, they'd need 147 kilograms of food. Goodness, that's a lot of kibble!

147 

"
"Oh my, that's a fun one! Let's see... 10 animals with two legs would have 20 legs altogether. And 15 animals with four legs would have 60 legs.  Adding those together, we get a grand total of 80 legs on the farm! 


80
"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow, that's 4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks.  That means there are 4 + 8 = 12 blue and yellow blocks altogether.  If the whole tower has 32 blocks, then there must be 32 - 12 = 20 red blocks! 


20
"
"Oh honey, this is easy! Elvis drove 90 miles west and then 144 miles east. That means he's 54 miles east of his house. 



"
"Oh darling, depreciation is such a drag! Let's see... that poor boat lost 30% of its value the first year, which is $2700.  That leaves it at $6300. Then another 30% the second year, so another $1890 gone. Now it's worth $4410. Finally, 20% depreciation in the third year, which is $882.  That leaves the boat worth a sad $3528. 


$3528
"
"Ooh, Starbursts! Let's see... there are 54 red ones, and twice that many orange, so that's 108 orange.  Then there are half as many yellow as red, which is 27.  That's 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies total.  

If there are 232 candies in the bag, then there must be 232 - 189 = 43 pink ones! 


43
"
"Oh darling, let's see... Helen's trip sounds lovely!  

So, the hotel was $80 a night, and she stayed for three nights, which is $80 x 3 = $240.  Each bus ride was 10% of the hotel price, so each ride was $80 x 0.10 = $8. She took seven bus rides, so that's $8 x 7 = $56.

In total, her trip cost $240 + $56 = $296. 


$296
"
"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Mazie started with 52 marbles, and Dallas has 21 now, but he lost 4.  That means Dallas had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles from Mazie.  So, Darla must have gotten 52 - 25 = 27 marbles!


27 

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a fun family outing! Let's see... two adult tickets at $12 each would be $24.  And the little one's ticket is $8. Plus, two popcorns at $3 each adds up to $6.  Adding it all together, they spend $38 in total. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of weight! Let's see... the car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage is 250 pounds, and his two little ones are 75 pounds each, so that's another 150 pounds.  That's a total of 1600 pounds!  If he needs to push with 1% of the weight, he'd need to push with 16 pounds. 


16 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  James needs to figure out how long all the sides of his fence are together.  Since it's a rectangle, he can do that by adding up the long side and the short side, then multiplying by two. That would be 20 feet + 15 feet = 35 feet. Then 35 feet x 2 = 70 feet!

70 

"
"Oh darling, that's a simple one! If Mia is 40 and they're 16 years apart, Emma must be 56.  To find their average age, we add their ages together (40 + 56 = 96) and then divide by two, which gives us 48. 


48 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of seashells! Let's see... they found 214 plus 432 plus 86, which is 732 seashells in total. But some were cracked, 67 to be exact.  So, they have 732 minus 67, which is 665 good seashells. 


665 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of people! Let's see... each place setting is a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl, right?  So that's $6.00 + $5.00 + $4.00, which is $15.00 per person.  And since she's having 12 people over, it'll be $15.00 times 12... that's $180.00! 


$180.00
"
"Oh, that's a tricky one! Let me see... Steve took 10 hours, and Anna took half that time plus 2 more hours.  So, half of Steve's time is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.  Then add the extra 2 hours, and that means Anna took 5 + 2 = 7 hours. 


7
"
"Oh my, that's a lot of hungry piggies! Let's see... if each pig eats 4 pounds twice a day, that's 8 pounds a day per pig. With five pigs, that's 40 pounds of feed they gobble up every day! Over a whole week, that's 280 pounds.  If Dexter started with 300 pounds, he'd have 20 pounds left. 


20 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! John needs enough hot dogs for 20 people, and they each want 2 hot dogs, so that's 20 times 2, which is 40 hot dogs.  But he already has 4, so he only needs to buy 36 more.  Each pack has 6 hot dogs, so he'll need 6 packs of hot dogs. If each pack costs $2, then he'll spend 6 times 2, which is $12. 


$12 

"
"Ooh, let's see! Frances makes $40 from the cupcakes and another $40 from the cookies, so that's $80 in total.  But she spent $20 on trays. That means she has $60 left! 


$60
"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the commotion! Let's see... five children at first, then each brings a friend, so that's ten! Then they each bring two more, making twenty! But the first five get tired and go home, leaving fifteen little ones chasing the truck. 


15 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's so sad to hear about the floods!  Mamou is so kind to help. Let's see, if she started with 1360 meals and gave out 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals, she has 1360 - 142 = 1218 meals left. 


1218
"
"Oh my, that's quite a lucky find! Let's see... a quarter is 25 cents, two nickels are 10 cents, and seven dimes are 70 cents.  Adding those all together, James has 105 cents! 



"
"Let's see... there are two brothers, one is 12 and the other is twice that age, so 12 x 2 = 24.  The three sisters are all 16. So that's 12 + 24 + (16 x 3) = 84! 

84 

"
"Let's see... Charisma meditates for 30 minutes each day, and that's 210 minutes a week. She also does yoga for 300 minutes a week.  So in total, that's 510 minutes of practice each week. Over four weeks, that adds up to 2040 minutes. 



"
"Let's see... 11 small shirts at 3 square feet each is 33 square feet.  Then 8 medium shirts at 4 square feet each is 32 square feet. And 6 large shirts at 6 square feet each is 36 square feet.  Adding those all together, the quilt will be 101 square feet! 


101
"
"Oh, that's an easy one! A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is 36 seeds. A large sunflower has 50% more, so that's another 18 seeds (half of 36).  That means a large sunflower has 54 seeds. Altogether, that's 36 + 54 = 90 seeds!


90 

"
"Oh, this is easy! If George has 18 pens, and Timothy has three times that amount, then Timothy has 18 * 3 = 54 pens.  Sarah has half as many as Timothy, so she has 54 / 2 = 27 pens. 

27 

"
"Let's see... Anne is twice Albert's size, so she's 36"" * 2 = 72"" tall. Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so she's 72"" - 2"" = 70"" now.  Since she grew 3"" over the summer, she must have been 70"" - 3"" = 67"" tall before.


67
"
"Oh, that's easy! If they make 5000 chocolate bars a day and sell each one for $2, that's $10,000 a day.  In a week, that's $70,000.  Over two weeks, they'd make $140,000. 


$140000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Jake gets a deal on the T-shirts, so he pays full price for one and half price for the other. That means each T-shirt costs $4.  So the two T-shirts cost $4 + $8 = $12.

The shoes are 40% off, so he saves $16 on them ($40 x 0.40 = $16). That means the shoes cost $24.

Adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes, Jake spends a total of $36. 


$36
"
"Okay, let's see... Ryan earned $6 a week for three weeks, so that's $6 x 3 = $18.  Then he spent $1.25 on each of his 3 friends plus himself, for a total of $1.25 x 4 = $5.00 on ice cream. That leaves him with $18 - $5 = $13.  Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets. 


2 

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a fun shopping trip! Let's see... Ellen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a frame, so that's $105. Lani got sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each, so that's $30 + $200, which is $230.  Adding those together, they spent a total of $105 + $230 = $335.

$335

"Ooh, let's see! Tim's honey and jam mix sounds delicious.  

Okay, so each jar costs $12 for passion fruit, $12 for jackfruit, and $20 for honey, for a total of $44. Since he sells each jar for $50, he makes a profit of $6 per jar.  If he sells 10 jars, his total profit would be $60.

"Oh my, that's a lot of coins! Let's see... 32 quarters are $8.00, 95 dimes are $9.50, 120 nickels are $6.00, and 750 pennies are $7.50.  Adding those all up, there's a total of $31.00 in the jar. 


$31.00

"Ooh, let me see!  Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 each for two movie tickets, so that's $15.00, and then $8.50 on a bracelet. That's a total of $27.00. If her parents gave her $40.00, she has $13.00 left. 


$13.00
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Josh works 5 days a week and services 3 cars each day, so that's 15 cars a week. He makes $4 for each car, meaning he earns $60 per week. Over two weeks, he'd make $120. 


$120

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of cookies! Let's see...

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies, for a total of 18. He eats one of each kind for a snack, leaving him with 16. Then he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, bringing his total down to 14. He gives away 2 sugar cookies, leaving him with 12. Finally, he bakes 4 of each kind, adding 12 more cookies! That means he has 12 + 12 = 24 cookies. 


24
"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see... half of 12 is 6, and if he sells those for $5 each, that's $30. The other 6 he sells for $7 each, so that's $42.  Add those together and he makes $72! 


72
"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of holes! Let's see... the doggy dug 84 holes while Nate was gone. If Nate fills 9 holes a day but the dog digs 6 more each night, that means he's really filling 3 holes a day.  So it will take him 28 days to fill them all up. That's 4 weeks!

"Oh my goodness, that's easy!  Norman High School has 1000 more students than Butler High School. 



"
"Let's see... they made 7995 cookies total, and 2595 were rainbow and 3075 were oatmeal.  That means they made 2325 chocolate chip cookies! 



"
"Oh my, Igor is so clumsy! Let's see... Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, but Igor only brought 8. And he brought 16 Petri dishes instead of 14.  He did get the 7 beakers right, though.  If he only put out 29 things in total, that means he must have lost some beakers on the way.  Hmm... 37 items were supposed to be on the bench, and he only put out 29, so he lost 8 things. Since he got the test tubes and Petri dishes wrong, those 8 lost items must be beakers!

"Ooh, this is a fun one! Let's see... 4 tables times 4 legs each is 16 legs.  And each leg needs 2 screws, so that's 16 times 2, which is 32 screws.  If he has 40 screws to start, he'll have 8 left over!

"
"Oh, that's easy! If one basket has 10 eggs and the other has twice that, that's 20 eggs.  So together, there are 30 eggs.

"
"Okay, let's see... Alexandra raised $430, and Kim raised $320 more than that, so Kim raised $750. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, meaning Maryam raised $700.  

Adding it all up: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

They raised a total of $2180! 



"
"Oh my goodness, this is a tricky one! Let me see... Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, but Aaron is twice as speedy.  If Aaron finished his 2 miles in 16 minutes, that means he runs a mile in 8 minutes. Vanessa takes twice as long, so she runs a mile in 16 minutes. Since she ran 4 miles, her total time must be 64 minutes! 


64 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of line! Let's see... 200 feet of dock needs 600 feet of line, and he only has 6 feet.  He needs to buy 594 more feet of line. 


594 

"
"Oh darling, let's see... six reservations a night, two meals at five dollars each, plus a five dollar bottle of wine... that's fifteen dollars per reservation.  With six reservations, that's ninety dollars a night. And if they're open two nights a week, that's a grand total of one hundred and eighty dollars! 


$180
"
"Oh darling, that's a simple one!  If he made a 25% profit on 50 watermelons that cost him $80, each watermelon must have sold for $2. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down!

Dora is turning 12 in three years, so she's currently 9 years old.  James is twice her age, making him 18.  That means John was 19 when James was born, and he's now 37.  His youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest is 5 now. In three years, he'll be 8.

"Well, I'm pretty quick at peeling oranges! I can peel one in just 3 minutes. Jane takes a bit longer, about 4 minutes per orange.  If we both start peeling at the same time for a whole hour, I bet I'll have peeled 5 more oranges than her. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's terrible about Mark's car!  Let's see, if the radiator was $400 but he got it for 80% off, that means he saved $320! So the radiator only cost him $80.  Then, with the mechanic charging $50 an hour for 3 hours, that's another $150.  Adding those together, Mark paid $230 in total. 



"
"Oh, this is a fun one! Let me see... if Farmer Brown has 20 animals and they have 70 legs altogether, we need to figure out how many are chickens.  

Hmm, chickens have two legs, and cows have four.  I think we can solve this like a puzzle!  

Let's see... 5 chickens would have 10 legs (5 x 2 = 10). That leaves 60 legs for the cows (70 - 10 = 60). And 60 legs divided by 4 legs per cow means there are 15 cows (60 / 4 = 15).

But wait! 15 cows and 5 chickens make 20 animals, just like Farmer Brown has!

So the answer is **5**. 



"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of pizza! Let's see... 7 pizzas times 8 slices each is 56 slices total.  And with Henry and his 3 friends, that's 4 people. So, each person gets 56 slices divided by 4 people, which is 14 slices each!
