"Okay, let's break this down.  Josh spent $80,000 on the house and another $50,000 on repairs, for a total of $130,000 invested.  

The repairs increased the value by 150%, meaning the house is now worth 2.5 times its original value ($80,000 x 2.5 = $200,000).

That means he made a profit of $70,000 ($200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000).


$70,000

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, he runs 3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters each day.  Then, over a whole week, he runs 180 meters/day * 3 days/week = 540 meters.

"
"Let's figure this out! Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 40 cups. Since each chicken needs 3 cups a day and she has 20 chickens, she needs a total of 60 cups.  That means she needs to give them 20 more cups in the final meal.

"
"Let's break this down! Kylar gets a deal on every other glass, which is super smart.  Since he's buying 16 glasses, that's 8 pairs. Each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8.  So, for all 8 pairs, he'll pay $8 * 8 = $64.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times that amount, then Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.  

To find the total, we add up the sheep from all three cities: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Carla downloads at 2 GB per minute, so to download the whole 200 GB file would normally take 100 minutes (200 / 2 = 100).

But, the restart throws a wrench in things!  She loses 80 GB of progress (40% of 200 GB) because of the 20-minute update. That means she has to download the whole 200 GB again.

So, the total time is the initial 80 GB download (40 minutes), plus the 20-minute restart, plus the time to download the full 200 GB again (100 minutes).

That adds up to 160 minutes. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

John drives 180 miles out (3 hours * 60 mph).  Then he spends 2 hours stuck, so he's still 180 miles away. He covers another 15 miles at 30 mph (0.5 hours * 30 mph). That leaves him 165 miles from home (180 - 15).

Finally, he drives 120 miles at 80 mph (1.5 hours * 80 mph).

So, he's 45 miles from home (165 - 120).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Eliza's earnings.  

She makes $10 an hour for her first 40 hours, so that's 40 * $10 = $400.

She worked 5 hours of overtime, and her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour. So her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

Adding her regular pay and overtime pay, Eliza earned a total of $400 + $60 = $460 this week.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, the program had 60 downloads the first month. The second month it got three times that amount, which is 60 * 3 = 180 downloads. But then in the third month, those downloads went down by 30% of the second month's total. That's 180 * 0.30 = 54 downloads less.  

So, the third month had 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Adding up all three months, we get 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads total.

"
"Okay, let's break down Toula's bakery haul!

* Donuts: 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204
* Mini Cupcakes: 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160
* Mini Cheesecakes: 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330

Adding those up, Toula spent a total of $204 + $160 + $330 = $694 at the bakery. 



"
"Let's figure this out!  

Carlos spends $90 to plant the tree. Every year, he makes $10.50 selling lemons (7 lemons x $1.50 each) but spends $3 on upkeep. That means he makes a profit of $7.50 each year ($10.50 - $3.00).

To find out when he starts making money, we divide the initial cost by his yearly profit: $90 / $7.50 = 12 years.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.  Before the orange house, she had double that, which is 10.  

Before the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.

That means she started with 12 x 3 = 36 vacuum cleaners. 


**Answer:** 36

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.  

If 20% of the 20 students are doing contemporary, that's 4 students. That leaves 16 students. Then, 25% of those 16 students are doing jazz, which is another 4 students.  That means 12 students are left for hip-hop.

So, 12 out of 20 students are doing hip-hop, which is 60%!

"Hi there!  Let's figure out which purchase will bring in the most profit.

The jewelry will likely increase in value by $5000 * 0.025 = $125.

The electronic gadgets are projected to increase by $8000 * 0.012 = $96.

Looks like the jewelry is the better bet for maximizing profit this month! 

The answer is $125.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Jill's salary.  

She makes $20 an hour teaching and works 35 hours a week doing that, so that's $20 * 35 = $700 a week.

As a cheer coach, she earns $30 an hour for 15 hours a week, which is $30 * 15 = $450 a week.

Adding those together, she makes $700 + $450 = $1150 each week.

Over a year, with 50 weeks of work, her total salary is $1150 * 50 = $57500.

"
"Okay, so I've hiked 6 miles already, and I have 6 miles left to go.  To average 4 miles per hour for the whole hike, I need to finish in 3 hours total. Since I've already been hiking for 2 hours, I only have 1 hour left. That means I need to hike those last 6 miles in 1 hour.  

So I need to walk at 6 miles per hour! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

The orange drink has 6.67 liters of water (10 liters * 2/3 = 6.67 liters). The pineapple drink has 9 liters of water (15 liters * 3/5 = 9 liters).  

After spilling some, there are 9 liters of orange drink left. That means there's a total of 15.67 liters of water in the combined drinks (6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters).

"
"Let's see... Samantha is 31, and Raymond is older by 6 years, making him 37.  Raymond had his son when he was 23, so his son is 37 - 23 = 14 years old. That means Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If $19.50 is 75% of the original price (because of that 25% discount), we can set up a simple equation.  

If 0.75x = $19.50, then to find the original price (x), we divide both sides by 0.75.

That means the original price was $26.00.

"
"Let's figure this out!  

Marie spent $12 on chicken, $15 on milk (5 packs x $3), and $6 on apples (4 apples x $1.50), for a total of $33. That means the pizza cost $17 ($50 - $33). Since each pizza box is $8.50, she must have bought 2 boxes ($17 / $8.50).

"
"Let's see... Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each, so that's 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.  The pants were $22.50 a pair, and she got 3 pairs, so those were 3 * $22.50 = $67.50. And the shoes were $42 each, and she got 3 pairs, for a total of 3 * $42 = $126.00.  

Adding it all up, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00 on clothes.

"
"Let's figure this out! Cynthia needs enough ice cream for 60 days, and each carton has 15 servings. That means she'll need 60 / 15 = 4 cartons of ice cream. Since each carton costs $4.00, her total spending will be 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.

"
"Let's break this down!  One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice that, so they cost $33 * 2 = $66. Together, the heels cost $33 + $66 = $99. Since the boots cost $5 more than the heels, they must be $99 + $5 = $104.

$104 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Since Darrell and Allen's ages are in a ratio of 7:11, we know their age difference is represented by those numbers.  

Their total age is 162, so we need to find out what each ""part"" of the ratio is worth.  

If we add the ratio parts (7 + 11 = 18), we can divide their total age by that sum: 162 / 18 = 9.

This means each ""part"" of the ratio is worth 9 years.

Allen's age is represented by 11 parts, so he's currently 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* The second friend said 20 more than half of the first friend's guess, so that's 80 / 2 + 20 = 60.
* The third friend said 25% more than the first friend's guess, which is 80 * 0.25 + 80 = 100.

Adding up all the guesses, we get 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.  

Dividing by 3 to find the average, we get 240 / 3 = 80.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If John spends half an hour per dog and has 10 dogs, that's 5 hours a day taking care of them (0.5 * 10 = 5).  Over a whole week, that adds up to 35 hours (5 * 7 = 35).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can think of it like this:

* **Silver coins:**  Let's say Gretchen has 'x' silver coins.
* **Gold coins:** She'd have 'x + 30' gold coins.

Since she has 110 coins total, we can write an equation: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2: x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  

To find the number of gold coins, we add 30: 40 + 30 = 70


Gretchen has 70 gold coins. 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more than half of that, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, meaning she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes. In the next 20 minutes, he scores 25% more than that, which is 1 extra point. So, he scores 5 points in the second half.  That means he scored a total of 9 points.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he'll eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.  Since the yogurts are sold in packs of 4 for $5.00, he'll need 60 / 4 = 15 packs. That means he'll spend 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt.


$75.00 

"
"Let's figure this out! John made 13 sets * $15/set = $195 from his Legos.  He spent $160 on video games, and had $5 leftover, meaning he had $165 before buying games. That means he sold $165 / $15/set = 11 Lego sets. Since he started with 13, he has 13 - 11 = 2 Lego sets left.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.  The other two days, he runs half that time, which is 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

That means he runs a total of 1.5 hours/day * 2 days = 3 hours on those shorter runs.

In total, he runs for 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours each week.

To find his speed, we divide his total miles by his total time: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour. 

So John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half her running speed, so she runs at 6 miles per hour.  Since she runs four times faster than she walks, she walks at 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends 2 hours running (one-third of 6 hours) and 4 hours walking (two-thirds of 6 hours).

In those 2 hours of running, she covers 12 miles (6 miles/hour * 2 hours).

During her 4 hours of walking, she covers 6 miles (1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours).

Adding those together, Dana travels a total of 18 miles.

"
"Let's see... Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet normally, but the sapphire gemstone triples that distance! So, she can throw it 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. Since the dragon's fire only reaches 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away and still hit it.

"
"Let's see... Grandma made 5 pies with 8 slices each, so that's 5 * 8 = 40 slices in total. If there were 14 slices left, then the guests ate 40 - 14 = 26 slices.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

You have 200 calories left for the day and each serving of chips has 250 calories. That means you can only have 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a bag has 5 servings and weighs 300 grams, one serving is 300g / 5 servings = 60 grams.

So, you can eat 0.8 servings * 60g/serving = 48 grams of chips. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Charlie's profit. 

He needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). That'll cost him $20.00 (2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00).

If he sells all 20 candles at $2.00 each, he'll make $40.00 (20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00).

So, his profit is $20.00 ($40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00).


$20.00 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. 

Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 more articles than Monday, for a total of 5 + 2 = 7 articles. On Wednesday, she doubled her Tuesday output, writing 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

That means she wrote a total of 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Candice started with 80 Post-it notes and used 220, leaving her with 23.  To find out how many were in the package, we need to see how many she had in total before using any.  

She had 80 + 220 = 300 Post-it notes total.

Then, we subtract the ones she had left over: 300 - 23 = 277

So, the package had 277 Post-it notes. 


277
"
"Okay, let's break this down. John bought 5 blue ties since he spent $200 and each blue tie costs $40. He bought twice as many red ties, meaning he got 10 red ties.  Red ties are 50% more expensive, so each one costs $60. That means he spent $600 on red ties (10 ties * $60/tie). In total, he spent $800 on ties ($200 + $600).


$800

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how many eggs Lloyd gets in a week: 252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs.

Then, we see how many dozens that is: 1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen.

Finally, we multiply that by the price per dozen: 147 dozen * $2/dozen = $294.

So Lloyd makes $294 per week from his eggs. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Tom travels for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, so he goes 30 miles (10 x 3 = 30).  On the way back, he's going slower at 6 miles per hour.  To find out how long that takes, we divide the distance by his speed: 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

"
"Let's see... Uriah needs to take out 15 pounds total. His comic books weigh a quarter pound each, and he's getting rid of 30 of them, so that's 7.5 pounds right there (30 x 0.25 = 7.5).  That means he needs to take out another 7.5 pounds of toys (15 - 7.5 = 7.5). Since each toy weighs half a pound, he needs to remove 15 toys (7.5 / 0.5 = 15).


15 

"
"Let's figure out how much more the mechanic made on the day with higher earnings.

On Thursday, they made $60 per truck tire and repaired 6, so that's 6 * $60 = $360. They also made $40 per car tire and fixed 4, for a total of 4 * $40 = $160.  That means they made $360 + $160 = $520 on Thursday.

On Friday, they only worked on car tires, earning $40 per tire and fixing 12, for a total of 12 * $40 = $480.

The mechanic made $520 - $480 = $40 more on Thursday.

So Stephen's groceries were $40.00, but then they added a 25% fee, which is $10.00.  Then there's a $3.00 delivery fee on top of that.  

Adding those together, it's $40.00 + $10.00 + $3.00 = $53.00.

Don't forget the $4.00 tip! That brings the final price to $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

* The brooch materials cost $500.
* The jeweler charged $800 to make it.
* Insurance was 10% of the total cost so far, which is $500 + $800 = $1300.
*  10% of $1300 is $130.

"
"Let's break this down. Marcy gets a base pension of $50,000 per year after 40 years. Since she's getting a bonus after 20 years, and she's quitting after 30, she'll get the bonus for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10).  The bonus is 5% of her base pension, which is $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500 per year.

So, her total annual pension will be $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Aleena pays $140 a month for the first six months, so that's $140 * 6 = $840.

For the next six months, she gets a 10% discount, which is $140 * 0.10 = $14 off her monthly bill.

That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the last six months, totaling $126 * 6 = $756.

Adding up both halves of the year, Aleena pays a total of $840 + $756 = $1596.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much money Tommy raises. He sells each brownie for $3 and each cheesecake slice for $4.  He sells 43 brownies, so that's 43 * $3 = $129. He also sells 23 slices of cheesecake, which brings in 23 * $4 = $92.  Adding those together, Tommy raises a total of $129 + $92 = $221.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So Shiela's buying five phones at $150 each, which means they cost $750 in total.  Since there's a 2% interest on each phone, that's an extra $3 per phone (150 x 0.02 = 3).  With five phones, the total interest is $15.

Adding the interest to the original price, Shiela needs to pay $765 overall.  Spread out over three months, her monthly payment would be $255 ($765 / 3 = 255).


Let me know if you have any other questions!

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Artie makes. 

Since he's rounding to the nearest dollar, his prices are $3 for marigolds, $2 for petunias, and $2 for begonias.

* He sells 12 marigolds at $3 each, so that's 12 * $3 = $36.
* He sells 9 petunias at $2 each, so that's 9 * $2 = $18.
* He sells 17 begonias at $2 each, so that's 17 * $2 = $34.

Adding those up, Artie makes $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If the top level is 16 square feet and each level is half the size of the one below it, we can work our way down:

* Level 3: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
* Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
* Level 1: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, add up all the levels: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet

Finally, divide the total by the number of levels to find the average: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.

"Let's figure this out!  

The puppy eats 1 cup a day for the first 180 days, so that's 180 cups. Then it eats 2 cups a day for the rest of the year, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. That's another 370 cups (2 x 185).

In total, that's 180 + 370 = 550 cups of food. Since each bag has 110 cups, Cecilia will need 550 / 110 = 5 bags.

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Raymond does half of what Sarah does, so he does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds. David does a quarter of what Sarah does, meaning he does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.

The difference between Raymond and David's laundry is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

"
"Let's figure out the best deal for Vincent!

Buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 would cost him 18 / 3 = 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.00.

Buying them in packages of 2 would cost 18 / 2 = 9 packages * $1.00 per package = $9.00.

He'd save $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00 by going with the packages of 2.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Alex weighs 4 times Grace's weight minus 2 pounds, so that's (4 * 125) - 2 = 498 pounds.

"
"Let's see... Gene's been on vacation four times a year since he was 23, and he's now 34. That means he's been on vacation for 11 years (34 - 23 = 11).  So he has 44 shirts total (11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44).

44 

"
"Let's see... the alarm rang 4 times the first time. The second time it rang three times longer, so that's 4 * 3 = 12 times.  The third time it rang half as long as the second time, which is 12 / 2 = 6 times.  In total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.

"
"Let's break this down! Sylvie gets a 10% raise every year after her fifth year.  

* After one year, her salary will be $600 + ($600 * 0.10) = $660
* After two years, it'll be $660 + ($660 * 0.10) = $726
* After three years, it'll be $726 + ($726 * 0.10) = $798.60


So her annual salary after three more years will be $798.60. 

"
"Let's think about this! If Marilyn sold 10 times more than Harald, that means Harald's sales were a tenth of the total.  So, we can find Harald's sales by dividing the total sales by 11: 88,000 copies / 11 = 8,000 copies.

"
"Okay, so Christina needs to account for some people not showing up.  She invited 16 friends, but only expects 3/4 of them to come, which is 12 people. Since she needs 0.75 gift bags per person who actually comes, she'll need 12 * 0.75 = 9 gift bags.  If each bag costs $2, she'll spend 9 * $2 = $18 on gift bags.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Adults eat 10 pounds of potato salad each, and kids eat half that, so 5 pounds.  There are 20 adults, so that's 20 * 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad for them. There are 5 kids, so they'll eat 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

In total, Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 pounds of potato salad.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

If there are two cats for every dog and there are 60 dogs, that means there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats.

That's a lot of cats!  

So, there are 120 cats + 60 dogs = 180 dogs and cats altogether.

The problem says there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Finally, to find the total number of pets, we add up all the animals: 168 rabbits + 180 dogs and cats = 348 pets.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, that means there are 80 boys (2/5 * 200 = 80).  That leaves 120 girls (200 - 80 = 120).

If 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, then 80 girls are Girl Scouts (2/3 * 120 = 80).

That means 40 girls are not in the Girl Scouts (120 - 80 = 40).

"Let's see... if the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, one can of tomatoes makes 8 ounces of sauce.  Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so she must have used 32 ounces / 8 ounces/can = 4 cans of tomatoes. Since each can has 3 tomatoes, she used a total of 4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Each box has walls that are 1 inch thick, so we need to find the space inside the box, not including the walls.  

* The inside length is 5 inches (outer) - 2 inches (walls) = 3 inches.
* The inside width is 6 inches (outer) - 2 inches (walls) = 4 inches.
* The inside height is 4 inches (outer) - 2 inches (walls) = 2 inches.

That means each box has an inner volume of 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume is 24 cubic inches/box * 3 boxes = 72 cubic inches.

"
"Let's see... Frankie watched 2 hours of TV on Monday and Tuesday, 1.5 hours on Thursday, and 2 hours on Friday. That's a total of 5.5 hours.  Since he watched 7 hours total, he must have watched 1.5 hours on Wednesday.  

Since each 30-minute episode is half an hour, he watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.

"Let's break this down!  

If Henry has 110 cookies left after dropping some, and he dropped 5, he must have baked 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

He baked 15 more than he planned, so he originally wanted to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Since he wanted to bake twice the amount he did last year, he baked 100 / 2 = 50 cookies last year.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

So, the gas costs $3.00 a gallon, and they get $0.20 back for each gallon. That means for 10 gallons, the cashback is $2.00 (10 x $0.20 = $2.00).

The gas would normally cost $30.00 (10 x $3.00 = $30.00), but with the cashback, it's only $28.00 ($30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00).

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Julia rows 20 feet every 16 seconds.  That means she rows at a speed of 1.25 feet per second (20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second).

It takes her 64 seconds to get to shore, so she rows a total of 80 feet (64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet).

The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. Since she rows 80 feet, it takes on 16 liters of water (80 feet / 10 feet/intake * 2 liters/intake = 16 liters).

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Each teacher uses the whiteboard twice a day and it gets cleaned 3 times each lesson, so that's 2 lessons * 3 cleanings/lesson = 6 cleanings per teacher.

"Let's break this problem down!

Jamal's phone holds 1800 photos, and that's 6 times more than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photos.

The problem tells us that Brittany's phone capacity is 50 times greater than the number of ducks in Jamal's photo. This means there are 300 / 50 = 6 ducks in Jamal's photo.

"
"Let's see... Sasha can sell her 2x4s for $15 each now, so that's 10 boards * $15/board = $150.  Her 4x4s are worth $24 each now, so that's 5 boards * $24/board = $120.  That's a total of $150 + $120 = $270.  She spent $100 on the 2x4s and $80 on the 4x4s, for a total of $180.  So her profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If Katy uses sugar and water in a 7:13 ratio, that means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.  

If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined, we need to see what part of that 120 represents the sugar.

Think of it like this: 7 parts sugar + 13 parts water = 20 total parts

Each ""part"" is worth 120 / 20 = 6

So, Katy used 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 kids, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 pairs of shoes in total.  Since each pair costs $60, he spends 6 * $60 = $360.


$360 

"
"Let's see... they started with 2 containers of 5 vehicles each, so that's 10 vehicles.  If there are 30 vehicles total now, that means 20 vehicles came in on the second day. Since each container holds 5 vehicles, they must have brought in 4 more containers.

"
"Okay, let me see if I can figure this out.  

So, Adrien made 30% more than me, which means if I made 'x' dollars, he made 1.30x. We know that four years ago, Adrien was making $40,000. That means 1.30x = $40,000.  

To find my salary back then, I divide both sides by 1.30: x = $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

Now, Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago, so now he makes $40,000 + (0.40 * $40,000) = $56,000.

My salary also increased, so four years later I'm making $30,769.23 + (0.30 * $30,769.23) = $40,000.

Finally, to find our combined salary, we add our individual salaries: $56,000 + $40,000 = $96,000.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Miguel uses 2 pads a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So that's 2 * 30 = 60 sheets per week.

"
"Let's see... Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice as many apples, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 apples. He brought half as many oranges, so that's 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

In total, they have 5 + 10 = 15 apples and 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.  That means they have 15 + 12 = 27 fruits altogether!

"
"Let's break it down! Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. Then she slept 2 hours less each of the next two days, so that's 8 - 2 = 6 hours each night. That's a total of 6 + 6 = 12 hours for those two days.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, meaning she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each night.  Since there are 4 more days in the week, that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Adding it all up, Sadie slept 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours for the whole week.

* A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, so each watermelon is $15 * 3 = $45.
* An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, making each orange $45 - $5 = $40.

* Dillon buys 4 watermelons for a total of 4 * $45 = $180.
* He buys 20 peppers for a total of 20 * $15 = $300.
* He buys 10 oranges for a total of 10 * $40 = $400.

Adding it all up, Dillon spends $180 + $300 + $400 = $880 at the store.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

The hospital sees 500 patients a day at 24 minutes each, so that's 12,000 minutes of doctor time total.  That's equal to 200 hours (12,000 minutes / 60 minutes per hour).

The doctors cost the hospital $150 per hour, so that's $30,000 for the day (200 hours * $150/hour).

They charge patients $200 per hour, bringing in $40,000 (200 hours * $200/hour).

Subtract the cost from the revenue and you get a profit of $10,000 ($40,000 - $30,000).

If there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens, we can think of it like this:

* Imagine the queens are 1 group.
* The babies are 2 groups (twice as many as the queens).
* The workers are 4 groups (twice as many as the babies).

That means there are 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 groups of bees in total.

Since there are 700 bees altogether, each group has 700 / 7 = 100 bees.

The worker bees are 4 groups, so there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.

Since he makes $92 each week, his profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  John has a lot of pineapples! 

Since he gets 100 pineapples per hectare and has 10 hectares, that's 1000 pineapples per harvest (100 x 10 = 1000).

He harvests every 3 months, so in a year (12 months) he'll harvest 4 times (12 / 3 = 4).

That means he'll get 4000 pineapples in a year (1000 x 4 = 4000).

"Okay, let's break this down.  

Debra saw 30 bees leave at first. Then 15 came back (half of the first group).  Then 60 more bees flew out. That means a total of 90 bees left the hive during the day. Since all the bees that left eventually came back, 90 bees returned in the last 6 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we need to know how long it takes each of them to get home.  Steve has to go 3 miles, which is 15,840 feet (3 x 5280). He bikes at 440 feet per minute, so it takes him 15,840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim goes 2 miles, or 10,560 feet (2 x 5280). He skateboards at 264 feet per minute, so it takes him 10,560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

That means Steve gets home 4 minutes before Tim. 



"
"Let's see... 5 bikes with 2 tires each is 10 tires. Then there are 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 9 more tires. And don't forget the unicycle! That's 1 more tire.  So in total, she inflated 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

At 25 cents per tire, she made 20 * $0.25 = $5.00.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Carl has 60 cookies in total (10 packs * 6 cookies/pack).  That means the cookies cost $6.00 (60 cookies * $0.10/cookie). If he pays with a $10 bill, his change is $4.00 ($10.00 - $6.00).

"Okay, let's break this down.  

The seagull ate half of Dave's 14 fries, so that's 7 fries.  That means there were 14 + 7 = 21 fries left. Then the pigeons ate 9 fries (3 each), leaving 12. The raccoon was a real jerk and took 8 fries (two-thirds of 12), leaving 4. Finally, the ants got the last one, so there must have been 5 fries before they showed up.

Working backwards, there were 5 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 14 = 43 fries in the pack to start! 



"
"Let's break this down!

Kimo has 9 hours of class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays (3 classes x 1 hour/class x 3 days = 9 hours).

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 8 hours of class (2 classes x 2 hours/class x 2 days = 8 hours).

That means he has a total of 17 hours of class each week (9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours).

Over a 16-week semester, he'll spend 272 hours in class (17 hours/week x 16 weeks = 272 hours).

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

First, we need to find the total length of each type of baked good in inches.  

* The rolls are 300 * 4 inches = 1200 inches long.
* The croissants are 120 * 6 inches = 720 inches long.
* The baguettes are 60 * 2 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches long.

Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

Finally, we convert that to feet: 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field, so he runs 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, which is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards.  In total, she runs 100 + 2720 = 2820 yards.

Kelly runs 2820 - 1500 = 1320 yards farther than Blake.

"Let's figure this out!

Anakin caught 10 starfish + 6 seahorses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish.

Locsin caught 10 starfish - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 6 seahorses - 3 = 3 seahorses.

Locsin caught 3 clownfish + 2 = 5 clownfish.

That means Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

Together they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish!

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

The price goes up by 20% every two months. That means every two months, the bag gets $4 more expensive ($20 x 0.20 = $4).

Over 36 months, there are 18 of these two-month periods (36 / 2 = 18).

So, the price increases by $4 a total of 18 times. That's an extra $72 ($4 x 18 = $72).

Adding that to the original price, the bag will cost $92 after 36 months ($20 + $72 = $92).

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much all the toys cost.  

An action figure costs $5, so 3 action figures cost $15. The doll costs the same as 3 action figures, so the doll is also $15.

"Hmm, let's see. If Jackie loses $35 for every hour of freelance work she misses, and she'd miss 3 hours doing her own taxes, that's $35 * 3 = $105 in lost income.  Since the accountant costs $90, she'd actually save $105 - $90 = $15 by hiring the accountant.

"Hmm, let's see... Sandra needs 45 eggs in total (15 flans * 3 eggs per flan).  Since she gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, she'll need to babysit 5 times (45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting session = 5 sessions).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can think of it like this:

* Brooke's age = 1 part
* Seth's age = 2 parts

In two years, they'll both be older, so we need to add 2 to each of their ages.  

Since their ages in two years will add up to 28, we have:

1 part + 2 + 2 parts + 2 = 28

Combining like terms:

3 parts + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

3 parts = 24

Dividing both sides by 3:

1 part = 8

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice her age, he's 16 years old.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. If Ethel has $8, and Jimmy has $2 more than twice that amount, we need to do a little math. Twice Ethel's money is $8 * 2 = $16.  Then, add the extra $2 Jimmy has: $16 + $2 = $18.

So Jimmy has $18.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age, so Sally Four is also 8. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, meaning she's 8 * 2 = 16 years old. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so she's 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Adding up their ages, we get 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

Jessica's minimum payments add up to $1000 ($300 + $200 + $500). She wants to pay 50% more than that, which is an extra $500 (because 50% of $1000 is $500).

So, her total monthly payment is $1500 ($1000 + $500). Over a year, that's $18000 ($1500 x 12).

"Okay, let's break this down. Billy's got 60 potatoes to peel, and each one takes him a minute and a half. So that's 60 times 1.5, which is 90 minutes just for peeling. Then he has to cut them, which takes 5 seconds each. That's 60 times 5, which is 300 seconds.  There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 300 seconds is equal to 5 minutes.  

So, 90 minutes of peeling plus 5 minutes of cutting means it'll take Billy 95 minutes to get all those potatoes ready.

"Okay, let's break this down!

If Jan is 30, two years ago she was 28.  Half of that is 14.  Two years ago, Mark was 19 (14 + 5). That means Mark is currently 21 years old. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, she's 23.

Team 2 is a bit more interesting. Their first runner takes 60 seconds, but then each runner after gets 3 seconds faster. So, it's 60, then 57, then 54, then 51 seconds.  Adding those up, they finish in 222 seconds.

That means Team 1 wins by 2 seconds! 



"
"Okay, let's break this down!

There are three numbers on a die bigger than 3 (4, 5, and 6), so there's a 50% chance of rolling one.  

To get two even numbers in a row, you need to roll an even number, then another even number. Each of those has a 50% chance, so the chance of both happening is 25%.

That means rolling a number bigger than 3 is 25% *more* likely.

First, we know the hamsters used 50 pieces of straw (10 hamsters * 5 pieces each). The rabbits used 20 pieces. That means the rats used 90 pieces (160 total - 50 - 20 = 90).

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, there are 15 rats in total (90 pieces / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats).

If they're split evenly into 3 cages, there must be 5 rats in each cage (15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage).

The rides cost $33 each, and they went on two, so that's $33 x 2 = $66.

Adding it all up, their total cost was $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

Tom starts with 50 trees. Each year he adds 10 and takes away 2, so that's a net gain of 8 trees per year. Over 10 years, that's 80 more trees (8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees).

So, he has 130 trees after 10 years (50 + 80 = 130). But then 30% of those die, which is 39 trees (130 * 0.30 = 39).

That leaves him with 91 trees (130 - 39 = 91).

The next month she got 20 fewer than the 60 she got before, so she got 60 - 20 = 40 cards. Now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the last month, she doubled the number of cards she got in the first two months combined, which is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. Doubling that is 100 * 2 = 200 cards.

Then he switched to biking 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time, meaning he biked 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers per week. For three weeks, that's 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

"Let's break this down!

Let's say Jerry has 'r' red chickens and 'w' white chickens. We know a few things:

* White chickens lay more eggs: Each white chicken lays 5 eggs a day, while each red chicken lays 3.
* Jerry has more white chickens: He has two more white chickens than red chickens, so w = r + 2.
* Total eggs: Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs in total.

We can use these clues to figure out how many red chickens Jerry has.  Since we know the total eggs and how many each type lays, we can set up an equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Now, let's substitute 'r + 2' for 'w' in the equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplifying that:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4


Jerry has **4** red chickens.

Since Gary walks at 3 miles per hour, it will take him 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours to walk around the whole park.

"Let's break it down:

* Day 2 had 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
* That means days 1 and 2 had a total of 100 + 150 = 250 customers.
*  To find the number of customers on day 3, we subtract: 500 - 250 = 250 customers.

"Okay, let's break this problem down.  

Think about it this way: the pools are losing water at the same rate, so the *difference* in how much water they have is changing because of the leak. Since the big pool had twice as much water 4 minutes ago, and now it has four times as much, that means it lost less water than the small pool in those 4 minutes.

Let's say the small pool has 'x' gallons of water now. The big pool has 4x gallons. Four minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons. This means the big pool lost 2x gallons in those 4 minutes. The small pool must have lost more than that to end up with only x gallons now.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons per minute, the small pool must have lost more than 2x gallons in 4 minutes.  

Hmm, this is tricky!  I need to think about this some more... 

Let me know if you want to try figuring it out together!

"Okay, so I need to figure out how many hours I have to work to buy those awesome shoes and belt.  The shoes are $320.00 and the belt is $32.00, so that's $320 + $32 = $352.00 in total.

If I make $8.00 an hour, I need to work $352.00 / $8.00 = 44 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Janeth owes $2000 plus 10% interest, which is $200. That means she needs to pay back a total of $2200.

If she pays $165 each month for 12 months, she'll have paid $165 * 12 = $1980.

Subtracting that from the total amount owed, she'll still have $2200 - $1980 = $220 left to pay.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Harriet is 21 now, and Adrian is three times her age, so he's 21 * 3 = 63 years old. Zack is twice Harriet's age, making him 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

In three years, Harriet will be 24, Adrian will be 66, and Zack will be 45.  That means their total age will be 24 + 66 + 45 = 135.  

To find the average, we divide the total age by 3: 135 / 3 = 45.

So the average age of the three in three years will be 45. 



"
"Let's figure this out!  

Naomi scored 68 points, and Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Together, Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.  That means Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

Adding their costs together, they'll pay a total of $90 + $90 = $180.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, James has 32 water type cards left (40 - 8 = 32). Then, he has a total of 34 grass type cards (20 + 14 = 34).  That means he has 96 cards in total (30 + 34 + 32 = 96).

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100%: (32 / 96) * 100% = 33.33%.

Rounding to the nearest integer, the chance is 33%.

His burrito starts at $6.50. Then he adds $2.00 for extra meat, $1.00 for cheese, $1.00 for avocado, and $0.50 for two sauces (at $0.25 each). That brings his total to $11.00.

He also gets the meal upgrade for $3.00, making it $14.00.

But wait! He has a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract that.

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready at first, so that's 30/100 * 120 = 36 watermelons.

That leaves 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Then, 3/4 of those were ready two weeks later, which is (3/4) * 84 = 63 watermelons.

So, there were 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons left that weren't ready.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Mark buys 12 cars at $20,000 each, so that's 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.  Then he has to pay 10% tax on that, which is $240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000.  So the cars and tax together cost $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000.  

But wait, there's more! He also has to pay $1000 to register each car, and that's 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

Adding it all up, Mark pays $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000 for everything.

Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but now he only has 3.  Each of those pen pals sends him 2 letters a week, and he writes 2 back. That means he's writing and receiving 6 letters a week from each pal, for a total of 18 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so that's 18 letters * 5 pages/letter = 90 pages a week.

If he writes a page every 6 minutes, then he spends 90 pages * 6 minutes/page = 540 minutes writing each week.

Her sister ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies total. That's 46 - 18 = 28 more cookies than her sister.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which is 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

In total, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

Adding those to the selling price, the total cost is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

* Total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

Now, let's add the remaining loan amount to his fees:

* Total expenses: $32,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

Finally, subtract the total expenses from the selling price to find his net proceeds:

* Net proceeds: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000


Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house are $118,000.

"Okay, let's break this down.  It takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees, and then it takes 40% longer to get to 400 degrees.  That means it takes 20 * 0.40 = 8 more minutes. So, to get to 400 degrees, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Now, cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

In total, from starting the oil to finishing cooking, it takes 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

Together, the body, collar, and rosette use 900 stitches + 90 stitches + 180 stitches = 1170 stitches.

So, there are 12 players and each brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.  

Don't forget the 3 coaches too! That means there are 12 + 24 + 3 = 39 people in total.

Each pizza feeds 3 people, so Maddy needs 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

If each pizza is $15, then Maddy will spend 13 * $15 = $195.

"Let's figure this out!  

Each necklace has 8 topaz gemstones that are each 1 inch long, so that's 8 inches total for the topaz.  That leaves 17 inches for the sterling silver beads (25 inches total - 8 inches topaz = 17 inches). Since each bead is 1/4 inch long, Katerina uses 68 beads per necklace (17 inches / 0.25 inches/bead = 68 beads).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40, and Margot wrote 60 in the first week. That's a total of 120 stories.

In the second week, they all doubled their stories. Alani wrote 40, Braylen wrote 80, and Margot wrote 120. That's another 240 stories!

Adding those together, they wrote a whopping 360 stories in total.

"Let's see... 76 stars total, and we know some are in rows of 8 and 6.  

Three rows of 8 stars is 24 stars (3 x 8 = 24).

Two rows of 6 stars is 12 stars (2 x 6 = 12).

That means the 8-star and 6-star rows use up 36 stars (24 + 12 = 36).

That leaves 40 stars for the rows of 5 (76 - 36 = 40).

So, there must be 8 rows of 5 stars (40 / 5 = 8).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so they eat 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat twice a day, so that's 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg of rice per person each day.

With 5 people, that's 0.4 kg/person * 5 people = 2 kg of rice gone every day.

A 42 kg bag will last 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days.

At $2 per mile, that's $30,000 just for mileage. Plus, he gives his driver a $1,800 bonus each year ($150/month * 12 months/year).

Since she started with 250 books and has 50 left, she sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in total.  That means she sold 200 - 135 = 85 books in the second year.  

Since each book sells for $20, she earned 85 * $20 = $1700 in the second year.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Theo has left for gifts. 

First, let's calculate the cost of his suits: 6 suits * $100/suit = $600.

His suitcases cost 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150.

Now, his flight ticket is a bit trickier: it's $700 more than 5 times the cost of a suit, so that's (5 * $100) + $700 = $1200.

Adding up all his expenses: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

He started with $6000 and spent $1950, leaving him with $6000 - $1950 = $4050.

Since he wants to save $2000, he has $4050 - $2000 = $2050 left for gifts.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

If we call the number of players on defense ""d"", we know the offense has twice that many, or 2*d* players. The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, which is *d*/2.

Since the total number of players is 105, we can write an equation: 2*d* + *d* + *d*/2 = 105

Combining the 'd' terms, we get 3.5*d* = 105.

Dividing both sides by 3.5 gives us *d* = 30.


So there are **30** players on the defense.

But then 8 people got sick and couldn't come, and 8 / 4 = 2 people had other plans. So, in total, 8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't make it.

Senior programmers make $400 more than juniors, so they earn $2400 each. With 60 senior programmers, the company pays them $144,000 (60 programmers * $2400/programmer).

Adding those together, the company pays a total of $224,000 to all its programmers each month.

For Job A, he'd make $15 an hour times 2000 hours, which is $30,000.  But then 20% in taxes comes out, leaving him with $24,000.

Job B pays a flat $42,000, but he has to pay $6,000 in property tax first. That leaves him with $36,000. Then, 10% tax on that is $3,600, so his take-home pay is $32,400.

Job B pays Nick $8,400 more than Job A.

The first year, the stock goes up 50%, which is like adding half its value: $8 * 0.50 = $4. So now each share is worth $8 + $4 = $12.

The second year, the stock drops 25%, which is like taking away a quarter of its value: $12 * 0.25 = $3.  That means each share is now worth $12 - $3 = $9.

Since she has 8 shares, they're worth a total of 8 * $9 = $72.

* The smallest group has 'x - 10' students.
* All together, that's x + x + (x - 10) = 200 students.

Let's solve for x!

* That means 3x - 10 = 200
* Add 10 to both sides: 3x = 210
* Divide both sides by 3: x = 70

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can think of it like this:

* **Cows:** Let's say there are 'x' cows.
* **Chickens:** That means there are '2x' chickens.

Since he has 60 animals total, we can make an equation: x + 2x = 60

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 3x = 60.

To find out how many cows ('x') there are, we divide both sides by 3: x = 20

So, there are 20 cows.

Now, to find the chickens, we multiply the number of cows by 2: 20 * 2 = 40 chickens.

Okay, time for the legs!

* **Cows:** 20 cows * 4 legs each = 80 legs
* **Chickens:** 40 chickens * 2 legs each = 80 legs

Adding those together, we get a grand total of 80 + 80 = 160 legs!

"Okay, let's break this down!

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so that's 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. He also watched 3 shows at 2 hours each, totaling 3 * 2 = 6 hours of shows.

That means he spent 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours on those activities.  We know that's 30% of his total vacation time.

To find his total vacation time, we can divide the time we know (15 hours) by the percentage it represents (30% or 0.30): 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money Dean has left. 

He spent $12 on toy cars (6 cars * $2/car) and $5 on teddy bears (5 bears * $1/bear). That's a total of $17 spent.

After buying the toys, he had $11 left ($28 - $17). Then his mom gave him another $10, so he has $21 now!


$21 

"
"Let's figure this out!

Morgan needs to pay $30 for her own fun (mini-golf, tokens, and go-karts). That leaves her with $60 for her friends. Since each friend costs $30 to entertain, she can invite 2 friends.

"
"Hi! Let's see... Marisa gets $5 a day and spends $1 on lollipops, so she saves $4 each day.  Over 5 days, that's $4 x 5 = $20.

$20.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Billy had $10 and spent some on candy. We know he spent half his change on gumballs, and those cost $2.00 total. That means he had $4.00 left after buying the candy. Since candy costs $1.50 a pound, he must have bought 2.67 pounds.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If Carver is 45 and that's 5 years less than twice his son's age, we can set up a little equation.  Twice his son's age would be 45 + 5 = 50.  So, his son is 50 / 2 = 25 years old.


25 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

The train travels 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles between the first and third city. Then it goes 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles back to the first city. That means each full trip is 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

Since it does three trips a day, that's 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles per day.

To find out how many days it can go between services, we divide the total service mileage by the daily mileage: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.


20 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

A collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing (because it's the average of 8 pounds for a Rottweiler and 2 pounds for a chihuahua).

Mark needs 8 pounds for the chihuahua beds (4 beds * 2 pounds/bed) and 15 pounds for the collie beds (3 beds * 5 pounds/bed).

That means he needs a total of 23 pounds of stuffing. 


23
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

John drives 210 miles to his friend's house (200 miles + a 10-mile detour) at 70 mph, so that takes him 3 hours (210 / 70 = 3).

Then, he drives 240 miles home at 80 mph, which takes him 3 hours as well (240 / 80 = 3).

In total, his trip takes 6 hours (3 + 3 = 6).

"
"Let's see... there are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 of them are girls. That means there are 96 - 43 = 53 boys.  But 4 boys were absent on Friday, so there were 53 - 4 = 49 boys at school.


49 

"
"Hi there!  Let's see... if there are twice as many boys as girls, that means there are 6 girls * 2 = 12 boys.  

So, in total there are 6 + 12 = 18 kids in the park. 


18
"
"Okay, so Jane needs at least 42 points to pass. She already has 15 + 18 = 33 points.  That means she needs 42 - 33 = 9 more points on her last test.

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

So, 3 people got kicked out for not wearing masks. Then, four times that many, minus 5, were kicked out for shoplifting. That's 3 * 4 - 5 = 7 shoplifters.

Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for fighting over sale items, so that's 7 * 3 = 21 people.

In total, that's 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people kicked out for those reasons.

Since 50 people were kicked out in total, that means 50 - 31 = 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.


19 

"
"Let's see... Erin has 14 points now, and that's three times more than Sara's 8 points.  That means Erin had 24 points before scoring more.  

So, Erin had 10 points before.

"
"Okay, let's figure out the total cost of these senior gifts!

*  First, the picture frames will cost 44 seniors * $20/frame = $880.
*  Etching adds 20% to each frame, so that's $20 * 0.20 = $4 extra per frame.  That means etching will cost 44 seniors * $4/frame = $176.
*  The pins are $5 each, and 2 seniors are getting them, so that's 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10.
*  There are 44 seniors / 4 = 11 officers who need cords. Those cords are $12 each, for a total of 11 officers * $12/cord = $132.

Adding it all up: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.



"
"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. If Ethan saves 20% by making the wallpaper himself, that means he'll pay 80% of the original price.  

80% of $400 is (80/100) * $400 = $320.


$320 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

They sold 14 pairs on Friday, then double that on Saturday, which is 28 pairs. On Sunday, they sold half of Saturday's amount, so that's 14 pairs. But then 6 people returned their shoes, leaving them with 8 pairs sold for Sunday.

Adding up all the days: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs

So the answer is 50. 



"
"Let's see... Tuesdays are 1 hour, Thursdays are 2 hours, and Saturdays are twice Tuesday's hour, so that's another 2 hours.  Adding those up, she dances for a total of 5 hours a week! 



"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If 40% of the equipment was faulty, that means 60% was working.  So, they spent 60% of $400,000 on good equipment.  

60% of $400,000 is $240,000.


$240,000 

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Mary has 15 sheep giving 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 kg. The other 15 sheep give 2 kg each, so that's another 30 kg.  In total, Mary gets 45 kg of milk every day.

"
"Let's see... Mrs. Sherman had 12 rolls and gave 6 to her kids. That leaves 6 rolls for the chickens.  If she breaks each of those into 8 pieces, she'll have 6 * 8 = 48 pieces for the chickens.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so half the class likes blue, which is 40 / 2 = 20 pupils. That leaves 20 pupils who like other colors.

One-fourth of those remaining like green, so that's 20 / 4 = 5 pupils.

That means 20 - 5 = 15 pupils like yellow! 


15 

"
"Let's see... Lucy made $56 on Monday selling apples for $4 each, so she sold 56 / 4 = 14 apples. On Tuesday she picked 12, and on Wednesday she picked double that, so 12 * 2 = 24 apples.  In total, she picked 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples.

"
"Hi there! Let's see... Rachel started with 23 cookies and got 42 more, so that's 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.  Then her brother ate 44, leaving her with 65 - 44 = 21 cookies.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Karan borrowed $3650 for five months at 10% interest, and she pays the same amount each month, here's how to find her monthly payment:

First, we need to figure out the total interest. That's calculated by multiplying the principal ($3650) by the interest rate (10%) and the time (5 months), then dividing by 100. That comes out to $1825.

Next, we add the interest to the original amount borrowed to find the total she needs to repay: $3650 + $1825 = $5475.

Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find her monthly payment: $5475 / 5 = $1095.


So, Karan has to pay $1095 each month. 

"
"Let's figure this out! Cho hiked for 8 hours at 14 kilometers per hour, so he covered 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers. Chloe hiked for 5 hours at 9 kilometers per hour, meaning she hiked 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers.  Cho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Anna has 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos and 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

That means together they have 50 + 100 = 150 silver pesos and 80 + 120 = 200 gold pesos.

Adding those together, they have a total of 150 + 200 = 350 pesos!


350 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Millie makes 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups of lemonade.  She sells each cup for $1, so she'll make $36 total. But she spent $18 on supplies, so her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells 4 cups per hour, and has 36 cups, her stand will be open for 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

That means her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2/hour.


$2 

"
"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. If Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, that means the 12.8 hectares represent 2/5 of his original land.  To find the total land he started with, we can set up a proportion:

(2/5) * Original Land = 12.8 hectares

To solve for the Original Land, we can divide both sides by (2/5):

Original Land = 12.8 hectares / (2/5) = 32 hectares

"
"Okay, so there are 52 people in the choir, and half are girls, so that's 26 girls.  If half of them can't make it, that's 13 girls who miss the show.  That leaves 13 girls who can still sing.  Plus, the 3 teachers are going to sing too, so in total there will be 16 people performing.

"Okay, let's see... Wilson needs an 80 or higher to get the car.  His test scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.  To find his average, we add them all up and divide by 5: (65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74) / 5 = 80.

His math grade is an 80!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Six erasers at $2 each would cost $12. Eight pencils at $3 each would cost $24.  Adding those together, 6 erasers and 8 pencils would cost $36. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson, and that's three times the number he delivers to Mr. Yu. So, he delivers 66 / 3 = 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Monica has a total of 12 gifts to wrap (6 + 4 + 2).  If she has 144 inches of ribbon, she can use 144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches of ribbon per bow. 


12 

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If their popsicle ratio is 5:6, that means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  

If they have 165 popsicles total, we need to figure out how many are in each ""part"" of the ratio.  

165 popsicles divided by 11 (5 + 6) parts equals 15 popsicles per part.

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 75 popsicles (5 x 15). Sam has 6 parts, so he has 90 popsicles (6 x 15).

That means Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty!

"
"Okay, let's see... Tim's cable is $60 a month. Netflix is $10. Hulu and Disney+ together are usually $20, but he gets a 20% discount for bundling them, so that's $4 off.  So the streaming bundle is $16, plus Netflix, that's $26 total. That means he saves $34 each month!

"
"Let's break it down!

Carol spends 4 hours writing, 2 hours recording (half the writing time), and 1.5 hours editing. That's a total of 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the editing time by the total time and multiply by 100%: (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100% = 20%

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If the shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, that's 6 * 6 = 36 spaces for books.

Wendy wants to double that amount, so that's 36 * 2 = 72 books.

But wait, she wants 20 *more* than double the spaces, so we add 20: 72 + 20 = 92 books.

Wendy needs 92 books. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Erica starts with 20 cards and gets 2 boxes of 15 cards from her dad, so that's 20 + (2 * 15) = 50 cards. She gives 24 to classmates and 5 to family, meaning she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.  That leaves her with 50 - 29 = 21 cards. Then she gets 17 more, bringing her total to 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

"Let's break this down!

* **Millipedes:** Nancy saw 90 spiders / 3 = 30 millipedes.
* **Stink Bugs:** She saw (30 millipedes * 2) - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.
* **Total:** Nancy saw 90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 168 bugs.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  He works 24 days a month (4 weeks x 6 days) and that's 288 days a year (24 days x 12 months).  So, he makes $14,400 a year (288 days x $50 a day).


$14,400 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  Mark needs four times the normal amount of ingredients. That means he needs 3 cups/batch * 4 batches = 12 cups of flour. Since flour comes in 2-cup bags, he'll need 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags of flour.

For milk, he needs 1 cup/batch * 4 batches = 4 cups.  Since milk comes in 2-cup bottles, he'll need 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

Mark needs 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Mel saves 5 hours of AC use each day, and his AC uses 900 watts per hour. That means he saves 900 watts * 5 hours = 4500 watt-hours every day.  

To convert that to kilowatts, we divide by 1000, so that's 4.5 kilowatt-hours saved daily.

Over 30 days, his total savings would be 4.5 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours.


135 

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. Then we have one zebra with 36 stripes and another with 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Adding them all up, we get 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

Since there are 4 zebras, the average is 88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra.


22 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Tyson needs enough sandwiches for 20 people, and each sandwich feeds 4, so he'll need 5 sandwiches (20 / 4 = 5).  

Each sandwich uses 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, meaning he'll need 5 pounds of each.  Meat costs $7.00 per pound, so that's $35.00 (5 * $7.00 = $35.00). Cheese is $3.00 per pound, totaling $15.00 (5 * $3.00 = $15.00).

In total, Tyson will spend $50.00 on meat and cheese ($35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00).


$50.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Allan starts with 40 cannolis and twice that amount in corn, so he has 40 * 2 = 80 corns.

He then buys 60 more cannolis, bringing his total to 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

But he buys 40 fewer corns than his new cannoli total, meaning he gets 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Adding up all his corn, he has 80 + 60 = 140 corns.

Finally, to find the total number of corns and cannolis, we add: 140 + 100 = 240.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Elliott wants to take 10,000 steps. He did half on his way to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. Then he walked 1,000 more with his friend, so that's 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps already done.  Since he only has 2,000 left to go, he must have taken 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.


2,000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Toby has a 45-page book with 200 words on each page, so that's 45 * 200 = 9000 words total.

He reads 300 words a minute, so the book will take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

He needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there, meaning he needs to leave in 60 - 10 = 50 minutes.

Since reading takes him 30 minutes, he'll be 50 - 30 = 20 minutes early.


20 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

In May, they paid each of the 40 employees $15/hour for a 40-hour week, which is $2400 per employee that month. So, in May alone, they paid out $96,000 (40 employees * $2400/employee).

In June, a quarter of the employees left, leaving 30 employees.  They still earned $2400 each, so the company paid $72,000 in June (30 employees * $2400/employee).

Adding those together, the company paid a total of $168,000 over the two months.


$168,000 

"
"Okay, let's see... Sally starts with $10.00. The taffy is a good deal! Two pounds will cost $4.50. The seashells are $1.50, and the magnets are $1.00.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Tim spent on fireworks. 

The second package cost twice as much as the first, so it was $400 * 2 = $800.

Together, the two packages cost $400 + $800 = $1200.

He got a 20% discount, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240 off.

That means the packages cost $1200 - $240 = $960 after the discount.

Finally, adding the finale firework, his total cost was $960 + $150 = $1110.


$1110 

"
"Okay, so Shannon wants to eat 2 cookies every night for 30 days. That's 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.  Since each batch makes a dozen, which is 12 cookies, she'll need to make 60 / 12 = 5 batches.

"
"Let's break this down!

Joanne got 30 apples from the tallest trees and half that from the shortest, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister got twice as many from the tallest trees (30 * 2 = 60 apples) and three times as many from the shortest (15 * 3 = 45 apples).  

Together, they got 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tallest and shortest trees. That means Joanne got 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how far Tom traveled. 

He traveled 200 kilometers each day for the first four days, so that's 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance from the first four days, which is 800 * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.

He took a break for one day, so no kilometers there.

In the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for seven days, totaling 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Adding it all up: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.


3140 

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, and that's 1/4 the size of Zack's. So Zack's locker is 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The second bank loaned Mr. Josue $4000 * 2 = $8000.

That means he got a total of $4000 + $8000 = $12000 from the banks.

Adding that to his starting money, he has $5000 + $12000 = $17000 now.


$17000

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Bill pays $8 a month for the first 6 months, so that's 6 * $8 = $48.

Then it goes up to $12 a month for 8 months, which is 8 * $12 = $96.

Finally, it increases to $14 a month for another 8 months, costing 8 * $14 = $112.

Adding all that up: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

So two years of the service cost Bill $256.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If they have 4 big buses that hold 60 people each, that's 4 * 60 = 240 employees. Then there are 6 minibuses holding 30 each, so that's 6 * 30 = 180 more. And finally, 10 minivans with 15 people each means another 10 * 15 = 150 employees.

Adding it all up, they can take 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees on the trip!


570 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see, she made 3 feeders and bought 3 more, so that's 6 total. The store-bought ones each get 20 birds, so that's 3 * 20 = 60 birds. Her homemade ones are super popular and get 10 more birds each, so they get 30 birds each! That's 3 * 30 = 90 birds.  All together, she sees 60 + 90 = 150 birds!

150 

"
"Let's break down the cost of Aleksandra's dinner:

* The bagel cost $4.
* The soup was 25% more than the bagel, so it cost $4 + ($4 * 0.25) = $5.
* The cake was half the price of the bagel, meaning it cost $4 / 2 = $2.

Adding up the cost of each item, Aleksandra's dinner cost $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

"
"Okay, let's break this down! Kenny wants to buy a $100 amusement park ticket and has $50 left over for snacks and stuff after selling his cards. That means he made $50 from selling his Pokemon cards.

Since he sells each card for $1.50, he sold $50 / $1.50 = 33.33 cards.  You can't sell parts of cards, so he sold 33 cards.

He kept 1/3 of his cards, which means he sold 2/3 of them. If 33 cards represent 2/3 of his collection, then 33 cards / (2/3) = 49.5 cards is his total collection.  He can't have half a card, so he must have started with 50 cards.

"Oh my goodness, that's a tricky situation! Let's see... he had enough for half the guests to have two, so that's 36 / 2 = 18 guests getting two hot dogs.  That's 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs, plus another 18 for the rest, for a total of 54 hot dogs. But 40 guests showed up, and only 54 / 2 = 27 could get two. That means 40 - 27 = 13 guests missed out on a second hot dog.

"Let's figure this out! Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of that is 3, and her sister's name has 4 more than that, so it has 7 letters.  Together, that's 6 + 7 = 13 letters.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Charlotte's total.  

First, the utensils cost 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

That means her total before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

A 20% discount on that is $165.00 * 0.20 = $33.00 off.

So her final cost is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.


$132.00

"Oh my, that's quite a tale of dragon-slaying princes! Let's see... Prince Thaddeus slayed 100 dragons, and Prince Arthur got three-quarters of that, which is 75. Prince Walter, bless his heart, doubled Arthur's count to 150.  Poor Prince Bruce, forgetting his sword! He only managed one-fifth of Walter's total, which is 30.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  If they split 15 gallons into 5 containers, each container has 3 gallons (15 / 5 = 3). Josey needs a quarter of that, which is 0.75 gallons (3 x 0.25 = 0.75).  Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, she needs 6 pints (0.75 x 8 = 6).

"
"Let's break this down!

George had $5 and has $0.05 left, so he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

He spent $1.20 on chips (3 bags * $0.40 per bag). That means he spent $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 on candy bars.

Since each candy bar costs $0.75, he bought $3.75 / $0.75 = 5 candy bars.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Antoine needs double the onions, so that's 2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. Those onions will cost him 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00. The beef stock will cost him 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00.  

In total, his soup ingredients will cost $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.  Since the soup serves 6 people, each serving will cost $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and Wayne's drive is only 4 minutes. Bernadette's drive is four times longer than Wayne's, meaning it takes her 4 * 4 minutes = 16 minutes.  

To get there 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 16 minutes + 5 minutes = 21 minutes before him.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

First, we know the room is 3 yards long, which is the same as 9 feet (since there are 3 feet in a yard).  We also know the area is 360 square feet. To find the width, we can divide the area by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now, to find the perimeter, we add up all the sides: 9 feet + 40 feet + 9 feet + 40 feet = 98 feet.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads (20 beads) + 2 packs of clear beads (40 beads) for a total of 60 beads.

Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads (60 beads) + 4 packs of red beads (80 beads) for a total of 140 beads.

Margareth has 140 - 60 = 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

The oven heats the house up by 5 degrees each hour for 3 hours, so that's a total of 15 degrees warmer. That brings the temperature to 55 degrees.

Then the window is open for 30 minutes, which is like half an hour. Since it cools down 2 degrees every 10 minutes, it cools down 6 degrees in total.

So, the final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down!

Jon takes 40 minutes to swim, 80 minutes to bike, and 50 minutes to run, for a total of 170 minutes. James swims 10% faster than Jon, so he takes 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes to swim.  James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.  

To find James's run time, we subtract his swim and bike times from his total time: 160 - 36 - 85 = 39 minutes.


James took 39 minutes to run. 

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

Movie C is 1.25 hours long, which is the same as 75 minutes. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than that, so it's 80 minutes long.  Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, meaning it's 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes long.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we need to see how far the horse runs. It goes 32 miles per hour for half an hour, so that's 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

For every mile, the horse eats half a bale of hay, so it eats 16 * 0.5 = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so the hay will cost 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is 6 * $5 = $30.

That means he has $30 - $24 = $6 left over.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we need to find out how much each balloon cost originally. Since 20 balloons cost $900, each balloon cost $900 / 20 = $45.

Then, the price went up by $20, so each balloon now costs $45 + $20 = $65.

Finally, to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons, we multiply the new price by 170: $65 * 170 = $11050.

"
"Hey there! To find the average speed, we need to think about the total distance traveled and the total time it took.  

The car went 60 mph for 2 hours, so that's 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then it went 30 mph for 1 hour, adding another 30 miles. That's a total of 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The whole trip took 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

So, the average speed is 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

"Let's see... Jenna starts with 8 sapphires worth $800 each, so those are worth 8 * $800 = $6400.  She trades 3 for rubies, leaving her with 5 sapphires worth 5 * $800 = $4000.  The rubies are worth $1200 each, so her 2 rubies are worth 2 * $1200 = $2400.  Adding it all up, her jewels are worth $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Each raised bed needs 2 feet x 8 feet x 2 feet = 32 cubic feet of soil.

Since he has 10 beds, that's 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet total.

Each bag holds 2 cubic feet, so he'll need 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

At $12 per bag, the total cost will be 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920. 


$1920
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

If there are 60% more green cards than red cards, that means there are 15 * 0.60 = 9 more green cards.

So there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

That means there are 15 + 24 = 39 red and green cards in total.

Since there are just as many yellow cards as red and green cards combined, there are also 39 yellow cards.

Adding them all up, there are 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.

So, 35% of all the puppies have spots!

In total, she has 150 + 200 = 350 cards.

She keeps 50 for herself, leaving 350 - 50 = 300 cards for her students.

If each student gets 10 cards, she has 300 / 10 = 30 students.

Over five days, he'll need 200 pounds of oats (40 pounds/day * 5 days).

Each bag has 50 pounds of oats, so he'll need 4 bags (200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag).

Heather's getting a great deal on those razors. Since they're buy one get one free, two packs really means she's getting four packs worth of razors. That's 16 razors in total!

With the coupon, she's paying $2.00 for all 16 razors.  That means each razor costs $2.00 / 16 razors = $0.125 each.

To get that in cents, we multiply by 100, so each razor costs 12.5 cents.

"Okay, so there are nine cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall, and one who is 60 inches.  That means the tallest layer of the pyramid will be 64 inches. Then, we have a layer of cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall, then another layer of cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall, and finally the shortest cheerleader on top who is 60 inches.

Let's add up the heights: 64 + 64 + 64 + 60 = 252 inches.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Let's say Bodhi found 'B' insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found B/2 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, meaning she found (B/2) + 7 insects.

Together they found 43 insects, so:

B + (B/2) + (B/2) + 7 = 43

Combining like terms:

B + B + 7 = 43

2B + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

2B = 36

Dividing both sides by 2:

B = 18

So Bodhi found 18 insects.

David found half of that, so he found 18 / 2 = 9 insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so she found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

A 2x4 gives him 200 sticks for $4, which is 50 sticks per dollar. A 2x8 gives him 400 sticks for $6, which is about 67 sticks per dollar.  

The 2x8 is the better deal! He can buy 4 of those with his $24. That means he can make 4 * 400 = 1600 popsicle sticks.


1600 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Mario has 6 dogs, and each dog needs 4 snowshoes. That means he needs a total of 6 * 4 = 24 snowshoes.

Since each pair costs $12.00, the total cost will be 24 * $12.00 = $288.00.


$288.00

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Janet spends $4.40 each day on bus fare (2 trips x $2.20 per trip). Over five days, that's $22.00. Since the weekly pass is $20.00, she'd save $2.00.


$2.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, which means the zoo has 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.

That means the farm has a total of 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.

The zoo has a total of 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Adding those together, the farm and zoo have 40 animals + 80 animals = 120 animals.

"
"Let's figure this out! Rose bought 12 onions and that's 4 times the amount Sophia bought. So Sophia bought 12 onions / 4 = 3 onions.  Rose also bought 4 potatoes, which is 4 times what Sophia bought, meaning Sophia bought 4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato. In total, Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and we know it takes burning 3500 calories to lose one pound. That means he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

He has about 200 days until his birthday. To reach his goal, he needs to create a daily calorie deficit of 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories per day.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Hannah runs 8 laps times 0.25 km per lap, so that's 8 * 0.25 = 2 kilometers total.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If the house cost three times as much as the lot, we can think of it like this: the lot is one part, and the house is three parts. That makes a total of four parts.

Since the whole thing costs $120,000, one part (the cost of the lot) is $120,000 / 4 = $30,000.

The house, being three parts, cost 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.


$90,000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Tara bought 8 packs of bags, and each pack had 5 bags, so that's 8 * 5 = 40 bags total.  She spent $4 on each pack, so the bags cost her 8 * $4 = $32. She sold each bag for $8, so she made 40 * $8 = $320.  

To find her profit, we subtract her costs from her earnings: $320 - $32 = $288.

"Okay, let's break this down.  Joe throws a lot of punches! 

He throws 25 punches every minute, and each round is 3 minutes long.  So in one round, he throws 25 * 3 = 75 punches.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Chris did 12 problems on Monday and then 3 times that on Tuesday, so that's 12 * 3 = 36 problems.  That's a total of 12 + 36 = 48 problems done.

He started with 100 problems, so he had 100 - 48 = 52 left.

On Wednesday, he finished 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

That leaves him with 52 - 13 = 39 problems for Thursday.

"Okay, let's figure this out! If one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means they paint 1/10 of the house each day.  With five people, they'd paint 5 times faster, so they'd paint 1/2 the house each day.  That means it would take them 2 days to paint the whole house.  Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take them 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she must have 22 chairs. Jenna has three times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 66 chairs.  Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 64 sofas.

That means they have a total of 84 sofas (20 + 64) and 88 chairs (22 + 66), for a grand total of 172 sofas and chairs.

* He had two weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each, adding another 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours.
* And there was one week with a 6-hour workout.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

So, we start with 48 people on the bus. At the first stop, 8 get off, and then 5 times that amount, which is 40, get on. That means there are 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 people on the bus.

Then, at the second stop, 21 people get off, and 3 times fewer than the first stop get on, so that's 8 / 3 = 2.67. We can't have parts of people, so we'll round down to 2 getting on.

That leaves us with 80 - 21 + 2 = 61 people on the bus.

"Okay, let's break this down!

The computer cost $1100, and the printer cost $400 less, so the printer cost $700.  Together, the computer and printer cost $1800. That means the two monitors cost $600.  Since there are two monitors, one monitor costs $300.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.  

Since there were two equal groups of boys and girls, there were 20 kids / 2 = 10 girls.

The boys found 60 shells each, so they brought back a total of 10 boys * 60 shells/boy = 600 shells.

The girls found 600 shells + (4 * 600 shells) = 600 + 2400 = 3000 shells.

That means each girl found 3000 shells / 10 girls = 300 shells.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  Elvis wants to save $1125 this month, and he wants to save double in the second half of April compared to the first.  

Since April has 30 days, that means there are 15 days in each half. He needs to save $1125 / 2 = $562.50 in the second half of the month.

To find out his daily savings goal for the second half, we divide: $562.50 / 15 days = $37.50 per day.

* Her apples cost 3 * $1.50 = $4.50
* Her oranges cost 5 * $0.80 = $4.00
* Her peaches cost 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

That means her total spending was $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Adding those all up, we get $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

But wait! There's a 10% discount.  That means he saves $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

When the water is warm, Ray takes twice as long as his cold water time plus 2 extra minutes. So, that's (16 minutes * 2) + 2 minutes = 34 minutes per mile in warm water.

For 3 miles, in cold water, it takes him 16 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes him 34 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 102 minutes.

They spend $3.00 on bread that makes 10 sandwiches, so each sandwich costs $0.30 for bread.  They also spend $30.00 on cheese and stuff for 10 sandwiches, which is $3.00 per sandwich.  That means each sandwich costs them $3.30 to make.

They sell each sandwich for $7.00, so they make a profit of $3.70 per sandwich.

If they sell 10 sandwiches, their total profit is $3.70 x 10 = $37.00.

"Let's see... Judy brought 12 cups and twice that many dishes, so she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes. That's a total of 12 + 24 = 36 utensils for Judy. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, meaning she brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.  In total, her friend brought 40 + 44 = 84 utensils.  

Adding both their utensils, we get 36 + 84 = 120 utensils.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

So, one box of contacts lasts Pete 45 days, and there are 90 pairs in a box. That means each pair costs $100 / 90 = $1.11 (rounded to the nearest cent).

But wait, there's a 10% discount! That means each box costs $100 - ($100 * 0.10) = $90.

If he buys two boxes, it'll cost him $90 * 2 = $180.

With 180 pairs of contacts in total, each pair will cost $180 / 180 = $1.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Jill worked a total of 3 hours (2 on Saturday + 1 on Sunday). John worked 4 hours on Saturday (twice Jill's time) and 3 hours on Sunday (three times Jill's time), for a total of 7 hours.

Jill earned $30 (3 hours * $10/hour). John earned $70 (7 hours * $10/hour).

That means John earned $40 more than Jill.

"Okay, let's figure this out! Hannah burns 500 calories per hour doing aerobics, so in two hours, she burns 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.  Running burns 600 calories an hour, so that's another 600 calories. In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories. Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 1600 / 2 = 800 ml of water.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

If there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue ones, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue ones, we can think of the blue jelly beans as our starting point.  

Let's say there are 'x' blue jelly beans. That means there are 0.99x red jelly beans and 1.01x green jelly beans.

If we add all those together, we get the total number of jelly beans: x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500

Combining like terms, we have 3x = 4500.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 1500. So there are 1500 blue jelly beans.

That means there are 0.99 * 1500 = 1485 red jelly beans and 1.01 * 1500 = 1515 green jelly beans.

Finally, to find the difference between green and red jelly beans, we subtract: 1515 - 1485 = 30


There are **30** more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

So Jared starts at 47 WPM, then goes up to 52 WPM. If he increases by another 5 WPM, he'll be at 57 WPM.  To find the average, we add all three speeds together (47 + 52 + 57 = 156) and then divide by 3 (156 / 3 = 52).

The average of his typing speeds is 52 WPM.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  Alex invited 100 people, and each of them is bringing two friends, so that's 100 * 2 = 200 friends.  That's a total of 300 people so far. Then she invited 10 more friends, and 8 of them are bringing their spouses, so that's another 8 people.  

In total, Alex needs 300 + 10 + 8 = 318 seats.

"
"Let's see... the Dachshund weighed twice the Affenpinscher, so that's 10 pounds * 2 = 20 pounds. The Papillon was one-fourth the weight of the Dachshund, meaning it weighed 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds. Finally, the Mastiff weighed 44 times the Papillon, so it weighed 5 pounds * 44 = 220 pounds.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

On Amazon, the boots are $16 plus $4 shipping, for a total of $20. On eBay, they're $13 plus $8 shipping (since that's double Amazon's shipping), for a total of $21. That means the boots are $5 more expensive on eBay.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms a day and each 100 grams has 3 grams of protein, that means he gets 6 grams of protein per day (200 / 100 * 3 = 6). Over a week, that adds up to 42 grams of protein (6 * 7 = 42).

"Let's see... if Jerry is twice as old as he was five years ago, that means he's gained five years and then some.  To figure out how old he'll be in three years, we need to know his current age.

In three years, he'll be 13!

"Okay, let's figure this out for George! 

Two implants at $2000 each is $4000.  The porcelain crown adds another $500, bringing the total to $4500. Since he already paid $600, he still owes $3900.  To earn that, he'll need to work $3900 / $15 per hour = 260 hours.

"Hey there!  Let's break this triangle problem down.

Think of the smallest angle as ""x"".  We know:

* One angle is twice the smallest: 2x
* Another angle is three times the smallest: 3x
* All angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees: x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 6x = 180.  

Dividing both sides by 6, we find x = 30.

The largest angle is 3x, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"Let's see... Colby has a lot of coins!  

First, we need to figure out how much money he has.

* His nickels are worth 14 * $0.05 = $0.70
* His pennies are worth 15 * $0.01 = $0.15

Adding it all up, Colby has $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, he can buy $3.45 / $0.05 = 69 gumballs!

Then for the next two hours, he made 10 cups * $0.60/cup = $6.00 each hour. That's $6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.00

Adding those together, he made $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that means his tires rotate 145,000 times each month (400 miles * 725 rotations/2 miles).

Each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement. So, they'll last for 72 months (10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month).

That's equal to 6 years (72 months / 12 months/year).

"Okay, so the big shampoo bottle costs $24.00, and it lasts for 120 washes if you use 2 pumps each time.  If Jackie only uses 1 pump, the bottle will last twice as long, right? So that's 120 washes * 2 = 240 washes.

That means each wash costs $24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10.  Since she uses one pump per wash, each pump costs 10 cents!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how much the discount is for each item. The shirt is 30% off, so the discount is $25 * 0.30 = $7.50. The shorts are also 30% off, so their discount is $35 * 0.30 = $10.50.

Now, let's find the sale prices. The shirt costs $25 - $7.50 = $17.50. The shorts cost $35 - $10.50 = $24.50.

Adding those together, the total cost is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00.

Then, we find the cost for Lewis' street: $194/meter * 490 meters = $95060

Finally, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from Lewis' street to see the difference: $95060 - $29100 = $65960

"Let's break this down! Gary does laundry twice a week, which means he does 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads of laundry each year.

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so that's 104 loads * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons of water used in a year.

Since water costs $0.15 per gallon, his yearly cost is 2080 gallons * $0.15/gallon = $312.

* The coral was $2.00 each, and she got three pieces, for a total of $2.00 x 3 = $6.00.
* The fish were $0.50 each, and she bought 20, so that's $0.50 x 20 = $10.00.
* The fish food cost $2.00.

Now, to get her speed in Mb per hour, we need to multiply by the number of seconds in an hour:

0.02 Mb/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 72 Mb/hour

Ashley's internet speed is 72 Mb per hour.

His bonus is half his old salary, so that's $20000 / 2 = $10000.

So each month he makes $21000 + $10000 = $31000.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Clara got a great deal on Tuesday!  She paid $398 for 20 pomegranates.

On Wednesday, even with the discount, Sheila ended up paying $540 for the same amount.

That means the difference in price is $540 - $398 = $142.

"Let's break this down!

Ariadne made $400 from red hats, which was half the amount she made from green hats. That means she made $400 * 2 = $800 from green hats.

In total, she made $400 + $800 = $1200 in the first month.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the first month's total, so she made $1200 * (3/4) = $900.

Over the two months, she made a total of $1200 + $900 = $2100.


2100 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! James gets a free hour, so he's really only paying for 3 hours. The first hour is $15, and each hour after that doubles in price. So the second hour is $30, and the third hour is also $30.  

Adding those up: $15 + $30 + $30 = $75

"Okay, let me see... I need one egg for every two deviled egg halves.  If each guest eats three halves, and I have 16 guests coming, that's 16 times 3, which is 48 halves.  So I need 48 halves divided by 2 halves per egg, which is 24 eggs.  That's 2 dozen eggs!

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If Mike reads 10 pages a day and the book is 200 pages long, it'll take him 20 days to finish (200 / 10 = 20).  Since he has 30 days to finish, he'll be done 10 days early!

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  The plane itself cost $150,000. Then, he spends $5000 a month on the hanger and double that, or $10,000, on fuel. That's $15,000 a month total. Over a year, that's $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.  

Adding the initial cost of the plane, the total cost for the first year is $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.


$330000 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Finley cooked rice for 30 minutes. Pork took 20 minutes longer than the rice, so that's 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.  Beans took half the time it took to cook both the rice and pork together. That's 30 + 50 = 80 minutes total, and half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

To find the total cooking time, we add up the time for each food: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"Let's break this down!

A pound of almonds costs $10, and a pound of walnuts costs $15.  

First, we figure out the cost of each mixture:

* **Mixture 1:** (1/2 pound almonds * $10/pound) + (1/3 pound walnuts * $15/pound) = $5 + $5 = $10
* **Mixture 2:** (1/5 pound almonds * $10/pound) + (1/3 pound walnuts * $15/pound) = $2 + $5 = $7

Finally, we find the difference in cost: $10 - $7 = $3

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If we think about it, each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2.  We know there are 70 legs total, and 20 heads.  

Hmmm... if we try to guess and check, it might take a while. Let's see... what if there were 15 sheep? That would be 60 legs (15 x 4). That leaves 10 legs for the geese, which means there would be 5 geese (10 / 2).  

And guess what? 15 sheep and 5 geese make a total of 20 heads!

So the answer is 15. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

His usual coffee is $5 a pound, but the new stuff is 20% more, so that's $5 + ($5 x 0.20) = $6 a pound. He needs a pound a day for a week, which is 7 pounds total, so that's 7 * $6 = $42 for the coffee.  

Don't forget the donut! That's another $2, bringing his grand total to $42 + $2 = $44.

"Let's see... Gus spent $20.00 total.  He bought chips for $4.00, chicken for $8.00, and soda for $1.00. That's $13.00 altogether.  So the apple pie must have cost $7.00.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. James delivers 600 newspapers total, and we know 198 go to District A and 209 go to District C.  That means he delivers 600 - 198 - 209 = 193 newspapers to District B.

"Let's see... he has class 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so that's 8 hours a week. Over 6 weeks, that's 48 hours total.  If he learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, he'll learn 48 / 1.5 = 32 recipes!

"
"Okay, let's break this down!  

First, we need to figure out how many math teachers there are. If 60% are history teachers, that means 40% are math teachers (100% - 60% = 40%).  So, there are 150 teachers * 0.40 = 60 math teachers.

Since each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours, they sleep a total of 60 teachers * 6 hours/teacher = 360 hours.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Kassidy has 3/4 the amount Aurelia has, so Kassidy has (3/4) * $120 = $90.

Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, meaning Rayna has $90 + $60 = $150.

If they combine their money, they'd have $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.

Splitting that evenly gives each person $360 / 3 = $120.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, and Janey has 21 books, we can set up an equation. Let's say Sally has 'x' books. Twice the number of Sally's books is 2x, and Janey has 3 more than that, so 2x + 3 = 21.  

To find out how many books Sally has, we can solve for x:

1. Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 18
2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 9

Sally has 9 books. 



"
"Hmm, let's see... Mrs. Jameson's bamboo is already 20 feet tall, which is 240 inches.  She wants it to be 600 inches tall. That means it needs to grow another 360 inches (600 - 240 = 360).

Since it grows 30 inches every day, it will take 12 days to reach 600 inches (360 / 30 = 12).

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 8 more toys for the 8 new dogs. Then, the number of dogs doubles, meaning he needs 16 more toys for those pups. That's a total of 24 toys. But wait, 3 dogs leave, so he doesn't need those 3 toys anymore.  

So, James needs 21 toys in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Katarina has 68 cookies, and that's 5 less than Max. So Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, meaning he has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, giving her 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total, we add up everyone's cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.


298 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If the dress is 140cm long after adding 20cm of lace and extending the original length by 50%, we need to work backwards.

First, subtract the lace: 140cm - 20cm = 120cm. This 120cm represents 150% of the original length (100% + 50%).

To find the original length, divide 120cm by 1.50: 120cm / 1.50 = 80cm.


So the original dress was 80cm long.

"Okay, let's break this down!  

We know there's one twin who's older than one of the triplets by 7 years.  If all their ages add up to 44, we can figure out how old the twin is.

Let's think about it like this:

* The older twin and the triplet are kind of like a pair, right?  
*  Let's say the triplet is 'x' years old. The older twin is 'x + 7' years old.
*  The other twin is also 'x' years old.
*  So, the total ages are: x + (x + 7) + x = 44

Now we can solve for 'x':

* 3x + 7 = 44
* 3x = 37
* x = 12.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, something's a little off in our thinking. Let me try a different approach...

Aha! I got it!

* Let's say the triplet is 'x' years old.
* The older twin is 'x + 7' years old.
* The other twin is also 'x' years old.
* So, the total ages are: x + (x + 7) + x = 44

Now we can solve for 'x':

* 3x + 7 = 44
* 3x = 37
* x = 12.33

Oops, we still have a problem!  We can't have a fraction of a year for someone's age. This problem doesn't seem to have a realistic solution. 



"
"Let's see... John has 3 hours until dinner, which is 180 minutes.  His homework will take 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes. That means he has 180 - 80 = 100 minutes for a nap!

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

If 5 lollipops cost $2.00, then one lollipop costs $0.40.  That means 10 lollipops would cost $4.00.

The candies cost $1.20 in total, so each candy costs $0.30. Ten candies would cost $3.00.

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies would cost $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Neil saves 2/5 * 20 coins = 8 more coins than Rong each month. That means Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Over ten years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

"Let's figure this out!  

The vaccines cost $20 each, so that's $20 * 2 = $40. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so before the check, it's $40.  The heartworm check costs $40 * 0.60 = $24.  That means the total bill is $40 + $24 = $64. If John brought $125, he'll leave with $125 - $64 = $61.

"Hi there! Let's figure out the price of that fruit crate. 

Okay, so we have 5 bananas, and each banana costs twice as much as an apple, which is $0.50. So each banana costs $1.00.  Then we have 12 apples at $0.50 each, and 7 oranges which are $3.00 each (those are pricey!).

Let's add it all up:

* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

Total cost: $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00


The crate costs $32.00. 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Brittany has 14 red squares, and 4 more blue squares than red, so that's 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

She has 6 more green squares than blue, meaning she has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

Brittany has 12 fewer white squares than green, so she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Adding all the squares together, she has 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, her comforter is 68 square feet.

Adding up all their points, the class has 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 points to go on the trip, so they still need 400 - 255 = 145 more points.

He also grabbed 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each, so that's 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.

Finally, he picked up 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each, which comes to 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

Adding all that up, his subtotal is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

But wait! He has a loyalty card for 10% off.  That means his discount is $50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00.

It cost him $20 to get into the blueberry patch and then $1.50 for every pound he picked. Since he got 30 pounds, that's $1.50 * 30 = $45 just for the blueberries.  

Adding the entry fee, his total cost was $45 + $20 = $65.

When her arms are down, she taps 300 times with her right foot and 250 times with her left foot every minute. That's a total of 550 taps per minute! She dances like that for 3 minutes, so that's 550 * 3 = 1650 taps.

When she raises her arms, she slows down to 200 taps per minute with each foot. So that's 400 taps per minute total. She does this for 2 minutes, meaning she taps 400 * 2 = 800 times.

In total, Helga taps 1650 + 800 = 2450 times.

"Ugh, that's a tough spot for Ron!  Let's see... fixing it himself will cost him $120 for the fine plus $75 for the asphalt, so that's $195 total.  But if he doesn't fix it, it'll cost him $450 in car repairs.  

He saves $255 by fixing it himself.

"Let's see... they started with 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs, so that's 193 in total.  They took away 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs, which is 33 chairs total.  That means they have 193 - 33 = 160 chairs left.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

They ate a lot of pizza!  Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, which is like 8 slices each (2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices). That's 24 slices total for them (8 slices/person * 3 people = 24 slices).

The other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices). That's 18 slices total for them (9 slices/person * 2 people = 18 slices).

So, they ate a total of 42 slices (24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices).

Since they started with 60 slices (12 slices/pizza * 5 pizzas = 60 slices), there were 18 slices left (60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices).

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

The dog eats the sausages faster, taking only 20 minutes (2/3 of the cat's 30 minutes).  

To find the average, we add the cat's time and the dog's time, then divide by 2: (30 + 20) / 2 = 25 minutes.

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. That's 96 inches + 4 inches, so it's 100 inches long.

We know that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  

Let's say Bobby's shoe is ""x"" inches long. That means:

100 = 9x + 10

Subtract 10 from both sides:

90 = 9x

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 10

So Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long.

"
"Oh my gosh, that's terrible!  Let's see... 

She smashed windows on a quarter of the students' cars, so that's 64 cars / 4 = 16 cars. Since each of those cars has 4 windows, she broke 16 cars * 4 windows/car = 64 windows.

Then she smashed windows on 3/4 of the teachers' cars, which is 32 cars * (3/4) = 24 cars. Those cars each have 2 windows, so she broke another 24 cars * 2 windows/car = 48 windows.

In total, Hannah smashed 64 windows + 48 windows = 112 windows.  

Yikes!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Dora's dad is twice her age plus eight years, so he's (15 * 2) + 8 = 38 years old. Her mom is four years younger than her dad, making her 38 - 4 = 34 years old.  

To find their total combined age, we add Dora's age, her dad's age, and her mom's age: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years old.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A, who got 20%. That means B got 20 + (50/100)*20 = 30% of the votes.  Together, A and B got 20% + 30% = 50% of the votes. That leaves 100% - 50% = 50% of the votes for candidate C. Since there were 100 voters, candidate C got 50% of 100, which is 50 votes.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Boris starts with 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck will have 77 + 10 = 87 apples. Boris will have 100 - 10 = 90 apples left.

That means Boris has 90 - 87 = 3 more apples than Beck.

"Let's see... Peter uses 12 ounces for the giant cubes, 14 ounces for the medium cubes, and 4 ounces for the small cubes. That's a total of 30 ounces.  Since he started with 32 ounces, he has 2 ounces left.

"Let's break this down!

Clara has 20 books, and that's twice the number Steven has. So Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books.

"Oh, that's a tricky one! Let's see... 

If Jeremy scared away a third of the birds, that's 12 / 3 = 4 birds.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Jake's family can save. 

At the first park, two adults would cost 2 * $26 = $52, and two kids would cost 2 * $12 = $24. That's a total of $52 + $24 = $76.

At the second park, two adults would cost 2 * $14 = $28, and two kids would cost 2 * $10 = $20.  That's a total of $28 + $20 = $48.

The family would save $76 - $48 = $28 by going to the second park.

"Let's break this down!

Candy rents out 60 chairs per day during the week, so that's 60 * 5 = 300 chairs per week. On weekends, she rents out 100 chairs per day, meaning she rents 100 * 2 = 200 chairs over the weekend.

In total, she rents out 300 + 200 = 500 chairs each week.

Over a month with 4 weeks, that's 500 * 4 = 2000 chairs.

For two months, she'd rent out 2000 * 2 = 4000 chairs.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Lorraine starts with a lot of stickers!  She's got 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.  

First, she trades most of her small stickers for big buttons. She trades 90% of them, which is 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers. Since each small sticker gets her one small button, that's 27 buttons! And she can trade those 27 small buttons for 9 big buttons (27 / 3 = 9).

Next, she trades half of her big stickers for more big buttons. That's 0.50 * 40 = 20 big stickers.  Each big sticker is worth one big button, so she gets another 20 big buttons.

She still has some big stickers left, 40 - 20 = 20. She trades those for small buttons, getting 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Let's add up all her buttons: 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons!

"Okay, let's figure this out!

*  If 11 students need extra-small shirts, and twice that number need small, then 11 * 2 = 22 students need small shirts.
* Four less than the number needing small shirts need medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need medium shirts.
* Half as many students need large shirts as medium, meaning 18 / 2 = 9 students need large shirts.
* Finally, 6 more students need extra-large shirts than large shirts, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need extra-large shirts.

Adding all the sizes together: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts.

Krissa needs to order 75 shirts.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

If the third house needs double the first house, and all three houses need 250 cases total, we can use some algebra. Let's say the second house needs 'x' cases. The first house needs half of that, or x/2 cases. The third house needs double the first, so it needs x cases.

That means x/2 + x + x = 250 cases total.

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 2.5x = 250.

Dividing both sides by 2.5, we find that x = 100.

So the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

That leaves 400 movies that aren't in a series. Of those, 160 are older movies (400 movies * 0.40), costing him $800 (160 movies * $5).

The rest, 240 movies, are newer and will cost $2400 (240 movies * $10).

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.  He bought 17 more fish, and now he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  

Let's say he bought 'w' white fish. That means he bought (17 - w) orange fish.

After the purchase, he'd have:

* Orange fish: 3 + (17 - w)
* White fish: 4 + w

We know the number of orange fish is double the white fish, so:

3 + (17 - w) = 2(4 + w)

Let's solve for 'w':

3 + 17 - w = 8 + 2w
20 - w = 8 + 2w
12 = 3w
w = 4

So Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

She makes $20 an hour for her regular 8 hours, so that's $20 * 8 = $160.

Since she worked 3 extra hours, her overtime pay is $20 * 1.50 = $30 per hour for those hours. That means she earned $30 * 3 = $90 in overtime.

Adding it all up, she made $160 + $90 = $250 for the day.

"Hi there! Let's break this down. 

After three months, the company will have 200 + (20 * 3) = 260 employees.

"Okay, let's break this down. Billy's starting pay was $10 an hour. After a couple of months, he got a raise to $10.50, and then another raise to $11.50 on his anniversary.  Sally starts at $10.50 an hour.

If they both work 20 hours, Billy makes $11.50 x 20 = $230. Sally makes $10.50 x 20 = $210.

That means Billy earns $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally.

Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. Nikita scored 11 more than that, so she got 139 + 11 = 150 points.

"Let's see... Kris plays for half an hour a day for two weeks, that's 0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours. Then she plays 2 hours a day for a week, so that's 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.  In total, she plays 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.  She needs to play 30 hours total, so she still needs to play 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 more hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

First, we need to find out how many fifth graders passed.  Since the fifth-grade pass rate was twice the fourth-grade rate, that means 40/100 * 2 = 80/100 or 80% of fifth graders passed. So, 400 fifth graders * 0.80 = 320 fifth graders passed.

Now, let's add up all the students who passed: 340 third graders + 40 fourth graders + 320 fifth graders = 700 students.

Finally, to get the overall pass rate, we divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students: 700 / (500 + 100 + 400) = 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

"Let's figure this out!  Milo needs 12 chips per square inch, and his mosaic will be 3 inches tall. That means he needs 12 chips/inch * 3 inches = 36 chips for every inch of length.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

So, four students drank 1.5 quarts each, which is a total of 6 quarts (4 * 1.5 = 6). Then, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, for a total of 32 quarts (16 * 2 = 32).  That means they drank a total of 38 quarts (6 + 32 = 38).

Since there are 10 quarts left, they must have started with 48 quarts (38 + 10 = 48). And since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, they started with 12 gallons (48 / 4 = 12).

"Let's see... Felix made $105 and charges $0.25 per branch. That means he climbed $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches. If he worked 5 days, he climbed an average of 420 branches / 5 days = 84 branches per day.

"Okay, let's see... Rose picked a lot of flowers!  

She started with 3 flowers that had 5 petals each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 petals. Then she got 4 flowers with 6 petals each, for a total of 4 * 6 = 24 petals.  

Next, she added 5 flowers with 4 petals each, which is 5 * 4 = 20 petals. Finally, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each, making 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

That's a grand total of 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals!

But oh no, she dropped one of each kind of flower!  That means she lost 5 petals.

So, the flowers in the vase have a total of 101 - 5 = 96 petals.

"Let's see... they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows for their s'mores.  Oops, they also dropped 3! That means they have 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.  Since each s'more needs one marshmallow, they can each have 14 / 2 = 7 more s'mores.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His friends who aren't as good only get 10 minutes per quarter, and his really good friend gets 30 minutes per quarter.  They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

So, Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

His not-so-good friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, and since there are two of them, that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

His awesome friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

In total, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

That means they spend 68 * $0.25 = $17.00 at the arcade.

"Okay, let's break this down.  Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar. She also uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.  

Since the jar is 10 ounces, we need to figure out how much of each ingredient she uses to make it all add up.  

Let's say she uses 1 ounce of zest (and fragrance). That means she uses 2 ounces of salt (twice the zest) and 2 ounces of sugar (same as salt). That's already 5 ounces.  

Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, she'd use 4 ounces of oil. That brings the total to 9 ounces.  

Hmm, we're close! To reach 10 ounces, she must be using 1 ounce of each zest and fragrance.

Kimberly has 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Let's say PJ has 'x' number of cards. Smendrick has three times that amount, so he has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

All together, they have 341 cards, so we can write the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.  

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329.

Finally, dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 47.

Since Becca has 3x + 12 cards, she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 153 cards.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many eggs Cindy has. 

She had 5 green eggs, and twice that many blue ones, so she had 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs. She had one less pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, meaning she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Adding them all up, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we need to find out how much the shipping will cost. It's $0.35 per pound, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so that's $0.35 * 4 = $1.40. Then, it's $0.08 per mile, and it's 20 miles away, so that's $0.08 * 20 = $1.60.  Adding those together, the shipping costs $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Amazon will only give Milly back 75% of the $32 she paid, which is $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.

Finally, to see how much Milly loses, we subtract the refund and the shipping from the original price: $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.00.

"Okay, let's break this down!

Pompei lifts a mountain 1 inch high. Saskay lifts 12 times that, so Saskay lifts 1 * 12 = 12 inches. Kagiyami lifts 4 times higher than Saskay, meaning Kagiyami lifts 12 * 4 = 48 inches. Finally, Naruto lifts 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto lifts 48 * 10 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.

If three kangaroos take 18 hours, that means one kangaroo would take three times as long, which is 54 hours.  

Now, turtles are much slower. They only go half the speed of a kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours, a turtle would take twice as long, which is 108 hours.

But we have four turtles! That means their speeds add up.  Since each turtle takes 108 hours, four turtles together would take 108 hours / 4 = 27 hours.

* Glue stick 2 has 1/3 left, so that's (1/3) * 12 mm = 4 mm unused.
* Glue stick 3 has 1/2 left, so that's (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm unused.

"Let's see... 50 students ate 10 burritos each, so that's 500 burritos.  Mr. George ate 20, bringing the total eaten to 520. Since he started with 600, there must be 80 burritos left over. 


80 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  They have 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars, so that's 10 green cars. They have 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, meaning they have 30 blue cars.  That's a total of 52 red, green, and blue cars. Since they have 75 cars total, they must have 23 yellow cars.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

If we call the number of books Fawn has ""F"", we know Anne has F - 12 books, and Sofie has F + 13 books.  

Since they have a total of 85 books, we can write the equation:

F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Combining like terms, we get:

3F + 1 = 85

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

3F = 84

Finally, dividing both sides by 3:

F = 28

So Fawn has 28 books.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Greg needs enough jello for 30 kids to have 4 cups each, so that's 30 * 4 = 120 jello cups.  Each box makes 10 cups, so he'll need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of jello. If each box costs $1.25, then he'll spend 12 * $1.25 = $15.00 on jello.

"
"Hi there!  Let's see... the phones cost $3500 in total. If the buyer gives the seller $4000, the seller will give back $500 in change. 



"
"Okay, so Madeline pays for 60% of the $400 grocery bill, which means Keenan pays for the other 40%.  That's $400 * 0.40 = $160 for Keenan each month.  Since there are four weeks in a month, Keenan spends $160 / 4 = $40 per week on groceries.


$40 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Tobias ate a lot of pizza!

* On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, which is 24 pieces.
* Then he ate 10 more pieces on the second day.
* That leaves 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.
* On the third day, he ate 7/13 of those remaining pieces, which is 14 pieces.

Adding it all up, Tobias ate 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces of pizza.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If 7 sodas cost $21, then one soda costs $3 ($21 / 7 = $3).  

And if 4 waters cost $8, then one water costs $2 ($8 / 4 = $2).

So, 3 sodas would cost $9 (3 x $3 = $9) and 2 waters would cost $4 (2 x $2 = $4).

In total, that's $13!

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  David starts with $12.48 and each bolt costs $0.03.  If he buys 16 bolts, that's 16 * $0.03 = $0.48 spent on bolts.  

That means he has $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00 left.

Amy's going to get:

* **Multiple Choice:** 10 questions * 80% = 8 questions right * 1 point each = 8 points
* **True/False:** 20 questions * 90% = 18 questions right * 1 point each = 18 points
* **Long Answer:** 5 questions * 60% = 3 questions right * 5 points each = 15 points

Adding those up, Amy scores a total of 41 points.

"Let's figure this out!

Isaias wants to make a $2000 profit, and he's selling each chicken for $50.  He's selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is 180 chickens. That means he'll earn 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.

To find out how much he paid for the chickens, we subtract his profit from his total earnings: $9000 - $2000 = $7000.


$7000 

"
"Let's see... Julie sold 14 glasses, and the boys sold the rest. Since they sold 32 glasses total, that means they sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.  

Because the boys sold the same amount, each boy sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses.

Julie sold 14 - 9 = 5 more glasses than Micah.

"
"Let's break it down!

Iris spent $100 on her manicure (since that's 1/4 of her hair cost). Her pedicure cost $75 (which is 3/4 the price of her manicure).  

Adding up all her treatments: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

So Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Sarah earns 20 meters * $2/meter = $40 from selling her rope.  The new rope costs 20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30. That means she'll have $40 - $30 = $10 left over.

"
"Let's see... Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, so she's currently 8 years old.  If her age will be three times her current age, that means she needs to be 8 * 3 = 24 years old.

"
"Let's figure out how much money Kelly has left!

* Her bacon costs $10.
* Each chicken packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each one costs $10 / 5 = $2, and then $2 * 2 = $4.
*  That means her chicken costs $4 * 6 = $24.
* Her strawberries cost $4 * 3 = $12.
* Her apples cost $4 / 2 = $2 each, so they cost $2 * 7 = $14 in total.

Adding it all up, her groceries cost $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

If Kelly had $65 to start, she has $65 - $60 = $5 left.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual ones plus a 15-minute encore, and the whole thing is 65 minutes, we can work backwards.  

First, take away the encore time: 65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes.

That 50 minutes is double the length of her usual concert. So, divide that in half: 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If 20% of the microphones don't fit, that means 80% do.  So, 50 microphones * 0.80 = 40 microphones fit. Since microphones are paired up, that's 40 microphones / 2 microphones/pair = 20 pairs.

"Hi there! Let's count those birds!

Jerry sees 6 birds in the bushes, and then 2/3 of that number flying, which is 4 birds. He also sees 3 groups of 8 birds eating, so that's 24 birds.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so Mrs. Smith has 100 plants. A quarter of them are indoors, which is 25 plants (100 / 4 = 25). That leaves 75 plants (100 - 25 = 75).

Two-thirds of those are outdoor plants, so that's 50 plants (75 x (2/3) = 50).  

That means the rest, 25 plants, must be flowering plants (75 - 50 = 25).

So, 25 out of 100 plants are flowering plants, which is 25%! 


25% 

"
"Okay, let's break this down!  

The whatchamacallit is super speedy at 121 meters per second. It's going eleven times faster than the thingamabob. That means the thingamabob is spinning at 121 meters per second divided by 11, which is 11 meters per second.

Now, the whirligig is a real speed demon, spinning five times faster than the thingamabob. So, the whirligig is going 11 meters per second times 5, which equals 55 meters per second.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. John makes $25 per hour renting his car, and he rents it for 3 hours, 10 times a month. That means he earns $25 * 3 * 10 = $750 each month.  Since his car payment is $500, his profit is $750 - $500 = $250.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Jo needs 0.5 yards of material for each small mask (2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards/mask) and 0.75 yards for each large mask (2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards/mask).

That means for 20 small masks, she'll need 10 yards (20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards) and for 8 large masks, she'll need 6 yards (8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards).

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

Duncan is 60 now, so eight years ago he was 52.  We know that eight years ago, Duncan was twice Adam's age four years ago. That means Adam was 26 four years ago (52 / 2 = 26).

So, Adam is currently 30 years old (26 + 4 = 30). In eight years, Adam will be 38 (30 + 8 = 38).

* Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.
* On Wednesday, he works twice that amount, so 5 hours * 2 = 10 hours.

"Oh my gosh, that's a lot of pets! Let's see... Larry has 3 cats, and 3 times that many dogs, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 dogs. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.  He has three times as many fish as rabbits, so that's 7 * 3 = 21 fish. And lastly, he has 1/3 the number of gerbils as fish, which is 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Adding them all up, Larry has 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets!

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

A mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

That means all the cinnamon rolls have 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.

And all the muffins have 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

In total, that's 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"Let's see... Rita removed a lot of Junebugs!  

On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice the amount she did on Monday, which is 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs each day. That's 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs for those two days.

Adding up all the Junebugs she removed, we get 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60 Junebugs per day.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages, and Paul is 10 years older than John, we can do some clever adding.  

Let's say John is ""J"" years old. That means Paul is ""J + 10"" years old.  Since Peter is the sum of their ages, Peter is ""J + (J + 10)"" which is ""2J + 10"" years old.

We know all three of their ages add up to 100, so:

J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100

Combining like terms: 4J + 20 = 100

Subtracting 20 from both sides: 4J = 80

Dividing both sides by 4: J = 20

Now that we know John is 20, we can find Peter's age:

Peter = 2J + 10 = (2 * 20) + 10 = 50



Peter is 50 years old. 

"
"Let's see... Maria gave 4 friends 2 balloons each, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 balloons.  She had 1 balloon too, so that's 8 + 1 = 9 balloons to start. Then her mom gave everyone 3 more, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 more balloons. In total, they had 9 + 15 = 24 balloons!

Together they spit 400 + 420 = 820 feet.  

To find the average, we divide the total distance by 2: 820 / 2 = 410 feet.

"Okay, let's break this down. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45.  If they run 24/7 for a month (30 days), that's a lot of widgets!

The Widgeteer 3000 would make 1440 widgets a day (60 x 24) and 43,200 a month (1440 x 30). The WidgetMaster 9000 would make 1080 a day (45 x 24) and 32,400 a month (1080 x 30).

Since each widget sells for $6, the Widgeteer 3000 would earn $259,200 a month (43,200 x 6) and the WidgetMaster 9000 would earn $194,400 (32,400 x 6).

That means Fern would make $64,800 more per month with the Widgeteer 3000!

Those pencils cost 5 * $10 = $50.  

After buying the pencils, he has 250 - 50 = $200 left.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If each row has 8 children and there are 7 rows for each school, that means each school has 8 * 7 = 56 children. Since there are 5 schools, the total number of children is 56 * 5 = 280. 


280 

"
"Let's see... the teacher has 9 coupons for 100 bottles each, so that's 9 * 100 = 900 bottles!  She gives each of her 29 students 2 bottles, which is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles. That means she has 900 - 58 = 842 bottles left for herself.

"Okay, let's break down Patty's charges:

* **Visit:** $40
* **Labor:** 2.25 hours * $35/hour = $78.75
* **Parts:** $60

Adding those up, Patty charged a total of $178.75. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down. James got a sweet deal on those CDs! 

First, the CDs cost $15 each, and he bought 10, so that's $150 before the discount.  Then he saved 40%, which is $60 off. So he paid $90 for all the CDs.

He sold 5 of them for $40 each, making him $200.

Since he spent $90 and made $200, he ended up with $110.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Jen will earn. 

She'll make $9.00 from the yams (6 yams * $1.50 each), $20.00 from the sweet potatoes (10 sweet potatoes * $2.00 each), and $5.00 from the carrots (4 carrots * $1.25 each).

Adding those all up, Jen will earn a total of $34.00.


$34.00 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 12 miles.  At 2 miles per hour, that takes him 6 hours. He then rests for 3 hours (half the swimming time). For the remaining 8 miles, he swims at 1 mile per hour (half his original speed), taking another 8 hours.  

Adding it all up, his total time is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Sam had 70 loaves and the bakery has 40 less than seven times that amount, we need to do a little math.

Seven times the loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Then we subtract 40: 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread. 



"
"Let's see... Jasmine started with 15 stickers, lost 7, and then got 5 more.  So, 15 minus 7 is 8, and then plus 5 more is 13!

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

Cayley earns 10% commission on each New York Times, which costs $5. So, he makes $5 * 0.10 = $0.50 per New York Times.  Since he sells 6, his total earnings from those are $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

For the Wall Street Journal, he earns 8% commission on each $15 paper. That's $15 * 0.08 = $1.20 per paper. With 10 sales, he makes $1.20 * 10 = $12.00.

Adding those together, his total commission is $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00.


$15.00
"
"Let's break this down! Deanna is 26, and Marcus is 5 years younger than her, so Marcus is 21.  Marcus is half Leo's age, meaning Leo is twice Marcus's age. That makes Leo 42 years old.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If we let Azibo's points be ""x"", we know Bahati scored x + 20 and Dinar scored x + 10.  

Since their total is 45, we can write the equation: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms, we get 3x + 30 = 45.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us 3x = 15.

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 5.


So Azibo scored 5 points.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he staples for 60 / 15 = 4 sets of 15 minutes in every hour.

That means he staples 30 reports/set * 4 sets/hour = 120 reports every hour.

He works for 15 hours total, so he staples 120 reports/hour * 15 hours = 1800 reports.

"
"Let's see... Kim usually sleeps for 8 hours, which is 480 minutes. She sleepwalked for 23 minutes and woke up 5 minutes early.  So, she slept for 480 - 23 - 5 = 452 minutes.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Jonathan has two dozen cups, which is 24 cups. He has 2/3 that many spoons, so he has 16 spoons (2/3 * 24 = 16). After giving Pedro 6 spoons, he has 10 spoons left (16 - 6 = 10).  In total, he has 34 utensils (24 cups + 10 spoons = 34).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how many beds are empty right now. If 1/5 of the 1000 beds are full, then 1000 / 5 = 200 beds are occupied. That means 1000 - 200 = 800 beds are empty.

Over two weeks, 50 patients come in each day, so that's 50 * 14 = 700 new patients.

Adding those to the already occupied beds, we get 200 + 700 = 900 occupied beds.

Finally, subtracting the occupied beds from the total gives us 1000 - 900 = 100 unoccupied beds.


100 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of those are for work. That leaves 9 emails for family and her boyfriend.  If two-thirds of those are to family, she sends 6 emails to family (9 x 2/3 = 6). That means she sends 3 emails to her boyfriend (9 - 6 = 3).

"Let's figure this out! If Courtney overstated the number by 20%, that means the real number is 20% less than what she said.  

20% of 48 is (20/100) * 48 = 9.6.

So, we subtract that from Courtney's count: 48 - 9.6 = 38.4. Since we can't have part of a person, we round down.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  If Jason carried 2 balls, and Jeffrey carried half that amount, then Jeffrey carried 1 ball. Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so he carried 4 balls.  That means they carried a total of 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls.

"Ahoy there, matey! Let's see... they dug 10 holes the first day, then 13 more the second, and 8 more the third. That's 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes. But they filled in 2 of 'em, so that leaves 31 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the time they found the treasure as it did at the end of the first day.  So, they must have dug 29 / 4 = 7.25 holes on the first day.  Since ye can't dig a quarter of a hole, let's say they dug 7 holes on the first day.

That means they dug 29 - 7 = 22 holes on the fourth day!

"
"Let's figure this out! If Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 15 more than them, that means Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.  To find the total, we add up what everyone got: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 corn chips.

$600 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'A' Pokemon.  Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's amount, so Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokemon. Alex caught 5 more than Stan, meaning he caught (4A - 13) + 5 Pokemon.

Together they caught 339, so A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

Simplifying that equation, we get 9A - 21 = 339.  Adding 21 to both sides gives us 9A = 360.  Dividing both sides by 9, we find that A = 40.

Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokemon, so he caught 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokemon.

"
"Hmm, let's see... each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as minutes in each episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.  That means he'll spend 10 * 20 = 200 minutes watching the whole show.

The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so that's 10 * 30 = 300 miles.

Then it flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, which is 2 * 18 = 36 miles.

Finally, it flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, covering 5 * 22 = 110 miles.

To find the total distance between the homes, we need to add the southward distances and subtract the northward distance: 300 - 36 + 110 = 374 miles.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Greta had 12 brownies from her own batch. Her office gave her 6 more (half a dozen). Then her friends surprised her with 48 brownies (that's four dozen!).

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

John buys two phones at full price, which is 2 * $600 = $1200. The other two phones are half price, so they cost $600 / 2 = $300 each. That means those two cost 2 * $300 = $600.

In total, John spends $1200 + $600 = $1800 on phones.

"
"Hi there! Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, which has 13 players. That means Zeke's team has 20 players (13 + 7 = 20).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how long the fence is all the way around. Since it's a rectangle, we add up all the sides: 15 feet + 10 feet + 15 feet + 10 feet = 50 feet.

Robert needs 2 slats for every foot of fence, so he'll need 50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Mrs. Harrington started with 12 boxes and gave away 4. That leaves her with 8 boxes. She keeps 2 boxes for herself, so she sells 6 boxes. Since each box has 20 oranges, she sold 6 * 20 = 120 oranges.

Finally, we divide the amount he needs by how much he earns per hour: $25 / $5 = 5 hours.

Tyler needs to work 5 hours. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Robert has 30 cherries, and Richard has 10 less than that, so Richard has 20 cherries. That means Richard and Robert have a total of 50 cherries.  Since they have 60 cherries altogether, Jerry must have 10. Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

If Emil is 24, his dad will be double his age, which is 48.  That means his dad is currently 43 (48 - 5). When Emil is 24, his brother will be half his age, meaning he'll be 12.  Right now, his brother is 7 (12 - 5).

Adding their current ages, we get 43 + 7 = 50.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Joe caught 3 pounds on Thursday, then 3 * 4 = 12 pounds on Friday. On Saturday, he caught 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

"
"Okay, so 20% of Mr. Roper's class of 30 are football players, which is 30 * 0.20 = 6 students. That leaves 30 - 6 = 24 students.  Then 25% of those remaining students are cheerleaders or in band, so that's 24 * 0.25 = 6 students.  In total, 6 + 6 = 12 students are leaving early.

"Okay, so Charlie's boots are five times bigger than Sophie's size 5 boots. That means Charlie wears a size 25!  To find the average, we add their sizes together (5 + 25 = 30) and then divide by 2 because there are two people. 30 divided by 2 is 15. 


15 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we need to know how many plants will fit in Pat's flower bed.  It's 111 feet long, and each plant needs 12 inches plus 1.5 feet (that's 18 inches) of space. So each plant takes up 30 inches.

Let's convert the flower bed length to inches: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Now divide the total inches by the space each plant needs: 1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants. Since Pat can't buy parts of plants, she can fit 44 plants.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more plants.

Finally, each plant costs $6, so she'll spend 27 plants * $6/plant = $162 at the store. 



"
"Let's see... Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, who eats 18 a day. So his brother eats 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.  In a week, that's 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Katherine needs 3 petunias at $3.00 each, so that's 3 * $3.00 = $9.00 per basket for petunias.

She also wants 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so that's 2 * $2.50 = $5.00 per basket for vines.

In total, each basket will cost $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

Since she has 5 baskets, the total cost will be $14.00/basket * 5 baskets = $70.00.


$70.00

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Emily peels 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, that's 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

She cooks 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so for 90 shrimp, it would take her (90 / 30) * 10 = 30 minutes.

Adding those times together, it'll take her 15 + 30 = 45 minutes to peel and cook all the shrimp.

"Let's break this down!

Comet Halley comes around every 75 years. Bill's dad saw it when he was 30. Bill saw it again when he was three times his dad's age at that time, meaning Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Since the comet appears every 75 years, and Bill was 90 when he saw it, that means 90 / 75 = 1.2 comet cycles have passed.  This means Bill was 75 years old when he first saw the comet.

"
"Let's see... Buford pays his electric and gas bills monthly, so that's 12 checks for each of those. He gives to the church twice a month, so that's 24 checks a year.

"
"Okay, let me see...  The first plane is busy! It flies to Greece most of the time, which is three-quarters of its flights. That means the rest of the time it's going to France or Germany.  The other plane only goes to Poland, and it flies way less, only 44 times a day. That's only half the number of times the first plane flies. So the first plane flies 44 * 2 = 88 times a day.  

Let's see, 88 flights and three-quarters to Greece... that's 88 * (3/4) = 66 flights to Greece. That leaves 88 - 66 = 22 flights for France and Germany. Since they split those flights evenly, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France each day.

"Let's figure this out! Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice that, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for the combined time of the other two, meaning he howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  

In total, they howl for 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, their combined howl time is 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If the total age of the four children is 20, and we know Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4, that's 3 + 4 = 7 years accounted for. Helene is twice the average age of the group, and since there are four kids, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5 years old. That means Helene is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

So far, that's 7 + 10 = 17 years.  

To find Wilfred's age, we subtract the ages we know from the total age: 20 - 17 = 3 years old.

Wilfred is 3 years old.

"Hey there! This is a fun one.  

Think of it like this: if each kid gets one ""share,"" each adult gets two ""shares."" That means the adults get a total of four ""shares"" (2 adults * 2 shares each).  Since there are six people total, the whole watermelon is divided into six ""shares.""

So, each adult gets 4 out of 6 shares, which is the same as 2/3.  That's 66.67% of the watermelon!

"Let's figure this out!

Doctor Jones spends 20 minutes per inpatient on rounds, and he has 9 inpatients, so that's 20 * 9 = 180 minutes for rounds.  That's equal to 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

His appointments take 30 minutes each, and he has 10, so that's 30 * 10 = 300 minutes, or 300 / 60 = 5 hours.

In total, he spends 3 + 5 = 8 hours on rounds and appointments.

Since he works a 9-hour day, he has 9 - 8 = 1 hour left for records.

Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how many female porcupines there are. Since they make up 3/5 of the population, there are (3/5) * 50 = 30 female porcupines.

Each female has 4 babies a month, so that's 30 * 4 = 120 babies born each month.

Over a whole year, that's 120 * 12 = 1440 babies!

Finally, we add the babies to the original population: 50 + 1440 = 1490 porcupines.

Half of the 3000 students are over 16, so that's 1500 students. A quarter of those older students are boys, meaning 375 are boys over 16. That leaves 1125 girls over 16.

The other half of the school, 1500 students, are under 16. Half of them are boys, so that's 750 boys under 16, leaving 750 girls under 16.

Adding the girls from both age groups, we get 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out! Bethany runs 10 laps. Trey runs 4 more than that, so he runs 14 laps. Shaelyn runs half as many as Trey, which is 7 laps. Quinn runs 2 fewer than Shaelyn, so she runs 5 laps.  That means Bethany runs 5 more laps than Quinn.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she pumped 4500 gallons * (3/4) = 3375 gallons.

Together on day one, they pumped 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons.

On day two, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her day one amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her day one amount, which is 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

On day two, they pumped a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons.

In total, they pumped 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

That means there are 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons left to fill. 



"
"Let me see... so her power bank was losing 9% every hour for 5 hours, that's 45% total. Then it lost another 21% over 3 hours.  So in total, it lost 66% of its charge. That means 34% was left after all that. But then her friends used some of it, and it ended up at 28%.  So her friends used 6% of the power bank's charge.

That 6% came from the 34% that was left after the initial losses.  So if 6% is what was left of the 34%, then the original charge must have been about 17.65%.



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Janet makes $25 an hour ($10 wages + $15 tips) and wants to save 20% of $10,000, which is $2000.  Since she earns $1000 a week, she'll need to work for 2 weeks to save enough for the down payment.

"
"Let's see... Jamaar spent $1.50 on peaches, $2.00 on pears, $2.00 on kiwis, and $3.75 on apples, for a total of $9.25. That leaves him with $0.75. Since plums cost $0.25 each, he can buy 3 plums. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Anne had 15 packs of sweets with 60 in each, so that's 15 * 60 = 900 sweets total. She kept 2 packs for herself, which is 2 * 60 = 120 sweets. That leaves 900 - 120 = 780 sweets to share with her friends.  Since she has 10 friends, each friend gets 780 / 10 = 78 sweets.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If the price goes up by 5% each year, here's how it would look:

* **Year 1:** $120 + (0.05 * $120) = $126
* **Year 2:** $126 + (0.05 * $126) = $132.30
* **Year 3:** $132.30 + (0.05 * $132.30) = $138.92

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the carrots would cost about $139 after three years.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Teresa sells the big stuffed animals for $12 each (since they're three times the price of the small ones).  She sold twice as many small ones as big ones, so let's say she sold 6 big ones. That means she sold 12 small ones.

Since each small one costs $4, she made 12 * $4 = $48 from the small ones.  

Let me know if you want to try another problem!

"
"Hmm, let me see... The twins found 30 eggs each, so that's 30 * 2 = 60 eggs.  If 10 eggs were left over, then their friends found 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs.

"
"Let's see... a dwarf with just his hands mines 12 pounds a day. With an iron pickaxe, that doubles to 24 pounds. A steel pickaxe is 50% better than iron, so that's 24 pounds * 1.50 = 36 pounds per day.

Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds a day * 30 days = 1080 pounds in a month.

With 40 dwarves, that's 1080 pounds/dwarf * 40 dwarves = 43200 pounds!

"
"Let's figure this out!  Since the prices are proportional, we know each sandwich costs the same amount no matter how many are in the package.  The 4-sandwich package is the best deal at $1.50 per sandwich.  So, 8 sandwiches would cost 8 * $1.50 = $12.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Sally starts with 25 red + 7 green + 12 yellow = 44 balloons.

Then 40% of the red balloons pop, which is 25 * 0.40 = 10 balloons.  That leaves her with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

She loses half her yellow balloons, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons gone. She has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then she finds 8 blue balloons and keeps 75% of them, which is 8 * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons.

Finally, she has 15 red + 6 yellow + 6 blue = 27 balloons when she gets to school.

"Okay, let's figure this out.  There are a few ways this could go down for Marcus.

If he gets a substitute, he's off the hook! That's a 50% chance.

If his regular teacher comes, there's a 40% chance she'll give the whole class more time.

Even if she doesn't give everyone an extension, Marcus is a smooth talker. He's got a 20% chance of convincing her his dog ate his homework.

So, let's see... 50% no homework, 40% extension, and 20% chance of faking it... that means there's a 30% chance he actually has to turn it in.

"Okay, so let's see... they have 6000 seats total, and 950 are for the graduates themselves, plus 300 for faculty. That leaves 4750 seats for guests.  If they split those evenly between the 950 graduates, each graduate gets 5 tickets. 



"
"Let's figure this out! Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, so that's 75 * 2 = 150 medium beans.  And since 3 small beans equal 1 medium bean, he can eat 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.

"Let's break this down! Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so that's 6 * 3 = 18 hours total. She earns $15 per day, so over three days she makes $15 * 3 = $45.  But wait, she has to pay $3 for parking each day, so that's $3 * 3 = $9 in parking fees.  

So, her total earnings after parking are $45 - $9 = $36.  To find her hourly rate, we divide her net earnings by the total hours worked: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Jim takes out $50,000 in loans each year for four years, so that's a total of $200,000 in loans.  He was making $25,000 a year before college, and his degree triples his income to $75,000 a year.  While he's in school, he misses out on earning $25,000 a year for four years, which is another $100,000.

So, in total, he needs to earn back $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost wages) = $300,000.

At his new salary of $75,000 a year, it will take him $300,000 / $75,000 per year = 4 years to earn back everything.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  Jim needs the fabric to be bigger than his bed, so we need to add to the length and width.  

* His bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.
* He wants the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider on each side.

That means the fabric needs to be 10 feet long (6 + 2 + 2) and 12 feet wide (8 + 2 + 2).

To find out how much fabric he needs, we multiply the length and width: 10 feet * 12 feet = 120 square feet.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* On Tuesday, they delivered one-fifth of Monday's amount plus 17 more, so that's (425 / 5) + 17 = 102 letters.
* On Wednesday, they delivered twice Tuesday's amount plus 5, meaning they delivered (102 * 2) + 5 = 209 letters.
* To find the total, we add up all three days: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.

"Let's break it down!

* His dad lost $5 on the first race.
* On the second race, he won twice the amount he lost on the first race plus $1, so he won (2 * $5) + $1 = $11.
* On the third race, he lost 1.5 times the amount he won on the second race, meaning he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.
* In total, he lost $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.
* His average loss per race is $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.

"Let's figure this out!

First, we need to make sure we're comparing apples to apples, so let's convert Xavier's height to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, add his growth: 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Cole was already in inches, so let's add his growth: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Finally, find the difference: 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If we let the first person's share be ""x"", the second person got ""x + $80"", and the third person got ""2(x + $80)"" which is the same as ""2x + $160"".

All together, that's x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Combining the 'x' terms and the dollar amounts, we get 4x + $240 = $1920

Subtracting $240 from both sides gives us 4x = $1680

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that x = $420.

So the first person's share was $420. 



"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

They worked 3/8 of a day, which is 9 hours (3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours). Over 3 weeks, that's 21 days of work (3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days).

So each painter put in 189 hours (21 days * 9 hours/day = 189 hours).

If Rory got half as many balls in the third set as the second, and the total is 19, we know the second set must be a pretty even number.  Let's think about it... if the second set was 6, the third would be 3, and that's 9 total.  That leaves 10 for the first set!

So the answer is 10.

"Hi there! Let's figure out the price of Ben's car in 2010.

Since the car depreciates 21% each year, we need to calculate that decrease for three years (2008, 2009, and 2010).

* **2008:** $20000 - (0.21 * $20000) = $15800
* **2009:** $15800 - (0.21 * $15800) = $12478
* **2010:** $12478 - (0.21 * $12478) = $9860.62


The price of the car in 2010 is $9860.62.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If half the books are in English, that's 50 / 2 = 25 books. And 10% in German is 50 * 0.10 = 5 books.  That means there are 25 + 5 = 30 books in English or German.

They had 4 pizzas with 8 slices each, so that's 4 * 8 = 32 slices total.

Becky ate 10 slices.  Jake ate 3 fewer than Becky, so he ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many as Jake, meaning she ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Adding up all the slices they ate: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Betsy took longer than Donovan, and their times add up to 98 minutes, we need to find how much time Betsy spent cooking.  

Let's think of it like this:

* Donovan's time =  'x'
* Betsy's time = 'x + 18'

Together, that's x + (x + 18) = 98 minutes

Combining those 'x's, we get 2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So Donovan took 40 minutes. Betsy took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Kayla's party will cost!

First, we need to know how many people are coming. She invited 25 classmates + 7 dance friends + 13 family members = 45 people.  But 4 people can't make it, so that leaves 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The theater rental is $125 for the first 20 people, and then it's $6 extra for each person after that. So Kayla has 41 - 20 = 21 extra guests. That'll cost 21 * $6 = $126.

Kayla's party will cost $251.

Adding it all up, Terry makes $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00.


162.00

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and hangs around for 20 minutes. The second train shows up 30 minutes after the first one leaves, which means it arrives at the 30-minute mark (10 + 20 = 30). This second train only stays for 5 minutes (20 / 4 = 5).

The third train gets in an hour after the second train leaves, so that's at the 95-minute mark (30 + 5 + 60 = 95).  This train takes off right away.

Finally, Paul's train, the fourth one, arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, putting it at the 115-minute mark (95 + 20 = 115).

So, Paul will be waiting for a total of 115 minutes.

"Let's see... Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks a week for 12 weeks, so that's 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.  She needs 200 toothpicks total, so she still needs 200 - 120 = 80 more.  If she saves 10 a week, it will take her 80 / 10 = 8 more weeks.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Mr. Rogers got the watch for 75% of $2000, which is $1500. Then he sold it for 120% of that price, meaning he sold it for $1800.  That's a $200 discount from the original $2000 price.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%

So the answer is 10%.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Twice Binkie's score is 90 * 2 = 180.  Frankie scored 15 more than that, so he got 180 + 15 = 195 points.

"Okay, so James walks 4 miles to the store, but turns around after 2 miles because he forgot something. That means he walks 2 miles back home, and then another 2 miles to the store.  

In total, he walks 6 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour.  

To find the total time, we divide the total distance by his speed: 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  If Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas with 4 bananas in each bunch, that's a total of 40 bananas.

Buying them individually would cost 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

But since she buys them in bunches, it only costs her 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

That means she saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Harry gets 60 more feet than Sam, think of it like splitting the fence into parts.  Since Harry gets more, his part is bigger.  

If we take away Harry's extra 60 feet, they'd have an equal amount. That means they'd each have 100 feet / 2 = 50 feet.

Since Harry gets 60 extra, Sam gets 50 feet - 30 feet = 20 feet. 


Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Marcel's earnings. 

First, we know he sold 150 Trekking bikes (half of 300), 45 BMX bikes (15% of 300), and the rest were MTB bikes, which is 105 bikes (300 - 150 - 45).

A BMX bike costs $250 (half the price of an MTB), so he earned $11,250 from BMX bikes (45 bikes * $250/bike).

He earned $67,500 from Trekking bikes (150 bikes * $450/bike) and $52,500 from MTB bikes (105 bikes * $500/bike).

Adding all those earnings together, Marcel made a total of $131,250 from selling bikes that month!

"Okay, let's figure this out!

John has 8 classes a day (6 normal + 2 extra) at 40 minutes each, so that's 320 minutes of class daily. Over 5 days, that's 1600 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

The ball starts on the third floor, which is 3 floors * 24 feet/floor = 72 feet high.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches. The second child is 2 inches taller, so they are 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second, making them 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall. Finally, the fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third, so they are 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!  The Allosaurus ate the last bit, which was 270 kg, and that was only half of what the velociraptors left. So, before the velociraptors got there, there must have been 270 kg * 2 = 540 kg. But remember, that was only half of what the T-Rex left behind!  That means the triceratops started with 540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg of meat. 

1080 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

First, we need to find the area of each pair of walls. The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so they each have an area of 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, that's 160 square feet total.

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, making them 40 square feet each. With two of those, we have another 80 square feet.

Adding those together, the total area of all the walls is 240 square feet.

Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so Tony will need 12 gallons (240 / 20 = 12).

At $12 per gallon, the total cost will be $144 (12 x $12 = $144).

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.  

If one train goes 60 miles an hour and the other goes half that, the slower train is going 30 miles an hour.  

Over 3 hours, the faster train travels 180 miles (60 x 3) and the slower train travels 90 miles (30 x 3).

That means after 3 hours, they're a total of 270 miles apart!

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people each day.

There are 31 days in March and 19 in April, for a total of 31 + 19 = 50 days.

He takes 20% of those days off, which is 50 * 0.20 = 10 days.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day, so that's 30 + 30 = 60 minutes of breaks daily. Over five days, that adds up to 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes.  Converting that to hours, we get 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Sheila starts with $85.00 on her card, then returns something for $15.00, so she's at $70.00.  The frying pan is $20.00 but on sale for 20% off, so that's $4.00 off, making it $16.00. The towels are $30.00 but 10% off, which is $3.00 off, so they're $27.00.  

Adding those together, the new stuff costs $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

So, her final balance is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Lauren wants to retire comfortably and live on 40% of her $100,000 salary, which is $40,000 per year.  She wants to do this for 20 years, meaning she needs a total of $800,000 saved up ($40,000 x 20).

Since she saves 20% of her salary each year, that's $20,000 saved annually. To reach her goal of $800,000, she'll need to save for 40 years ($800,000 / $20,000).

"Let's see... Soledad wants to hike 9300 miles in June, and she plans to hike 250 miles each day (125 miles twice a day).  That means in a month, she'll hike 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7500 miles.  

She needs to hike 1800 more miles (9300 - 7500 = 1800). To do that in 30 days, she needs to add 60 miles to her daily hikes (1800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day).

"Let's break this down!  

The first two workers make 6 toys an hour each, so together they make 12 toys an hour.  The other two workers make 4 toys an hour each, for a total of 8 toys an hour. That means those four workers make 20 toys an hour together (12 + 8 = 20).

Over 10 hours, they make 200 toys (20 toys/hour * 10 hours). Since they needed 400 toys and still need 20 more, they made 380 toys (400 - 20 = 380).

That means the fifth worker made 180 toys (380 - 200 = 180) over the 10-hour shift.  

So, the fifth worker makes 18 toys an hour (180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour).

Arnold and Madeline painted the rest, which is 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since they painted the same amount, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Camden painted 30 - 13 = 17 more eggs than Arnold.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Nik has a lot of crayons!  Since each box holds 8 crayons and he has 200 crayons, he'll need 25 boxes (200 / 8 = 25).  

That means he has 25 boxes weighing 8 ounces each, for a total of 200 ounces just from the boxes (25 x 8 = 200).  

The crayons themselves weigh another 200 ounces (200 crayons x 1 ounce each = 200).

So, all together, the crayons and boxes weigh 400 ounces (200 + 200 = 400).

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 25 pounds (400 / 16 = 25).

*  So, in total, there are 50 + 420 = 470 cows and 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

So Russell gets 9 bagels per pack, and he's buying 4 packs, which means he'll have 9 * 4 = 36 bagels.

Over 3 days, he makes $2.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

He earned $26 from individual sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over 3 days.

"Hey there! To find Sid's average speed, we need to figure out his total distance and total time. He traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, then another 140 miles in 3 hours. That's a total of 250 miles in 5 hours.  

To get the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Jim had 27 seashells, and that was 5 more than Carlos, so Carlos found 27 - 5 = 22 seashells. Carlos found twice as many as Carrey, meaning Carrey found 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

In total, they had 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.  When they split them evenly, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Okay, so Hortex makes 4200 bottles a day, and each bottle covers 20% of a person's energy needs. That means they're currently covering 4200 * 0.20 = 840% of a person's daily energy needs.

We need to know how much more they need to make to cover 100% of the needs for 2300 people. That's a total of 2300 * 100% = 230,000% of daily energy needs.

To find the difference, we subtract: 230,000% - 840% = 229,160%.

Since each bottle covers 20%, they need to produce 229,160% / 20% = 11,458 more bottles.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

Carla has eight babies, and three-quarters of them wear purple, so that's 6 babies. The rest, 2 babies, wear blue.  

Now, half of the purple-wearing babies have bows, which is 3 babies.  And all the blue-wearing babies have bows too, so that's another 2 babies. That means 5 babies total have bows.

Out of those 5 babies with bows, 3 of them are wearing purple. So, there's a 3 out of 5 chance, or 60%, that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

John has a lot of garbage to collect!  

* The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 * 2 = 400 apartments.

* That makes the third complex 400 + 240 = 640 apartments big.
* In total, he collects from 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.
* Since he collects from each place 3 times a week, that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 collections.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many fruits that avocado tree can produce.

* A 6-year-old tree makes 3 times the initial 50 fruits, so that's 150 fruits.

* An 8-year-old tree makes 200 less fruits than a 10-year-old tree.
* A 10-year-old tree makes 20 times the initial amount, meaning it produces a whopping 1000 fruits!
* So, the 8-year-old tree makes 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Adding up all the fruits from each year: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = 2350 fruits.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, we can use some algebra to solve for the red rope's length.

Think of it like this:

* **Yellow rope:**  Let's call its length ""y""
* **Blue rope:** It's 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so it's ""y - 7"" long.
* **Red rope:** It's four times the length of the blue rope, making it ""4 * (y - 7)"" long.

Since all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long, we can write an equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4 * (y - 7) = 37

Let's solve for ""y"":

* y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
* 6y - 35 = 37
* 6y = 72
* y = 12

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, we can find the length of the blue rope:

* Blue rope = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 centimeters

Finally, let's find the length of the red rope:

* Red rope = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters



The red rope is 20 centimeters long.

"Hi there! Let's figure out the total area of Tom's house. 

Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so that's 20 * 12 = 240 square feet per bedroom.  Since he has four bedrooms, that's 240 * 4 = 960 square feet for all the bedrooms.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, meaning it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding up the bedrooms and living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

Finally, don't forget the rest of the house, which is 1000 square feet.  

The total area of Tom's house is 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"Okay, let's break this down!

Team B scored 2 fewer goals than Team A in the first half, so they scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, Team B went on a scoring spree, getting 4 times the number of goals from the first half, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals.

Team A only scored 1/4 the number of goals Team B did in the second half, so they scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Adding up all of Team A's goals, they scored a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals.

Team B scored a total of 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

Finally, adding both teams' scores together, we get 6 + 10 = 16 goals in the whole match!

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down. 

Let's say Wendy's current age is ""w"" and Colin's current age is ""c"".

We know:

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years:  w = 5(c + 7)
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Let's solve for ""c"", Colin's current age.

From the first equation, we can say w = 5c + 35.

Now, substitute this value of ""w"" into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for ""c"":

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
40/3 = (2/3)c
c = (40/3) * (3/2)
c = 20


Colin is currently 20 years old.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oaks, bringing his total to 20 + 10 = 30 White Oaks. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pines than the day before, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pines. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pines on day two.

If the first floor is 180 inches and the whole house is 420 inches, then the second floor (including the space from the second floor to the roof) is 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches tall.

Saanvi needs 42 mL of the second medicine (14 mL * 3 = 42 mL). That means each dose has a total of 56 mL (14 mL + 42 mL).  

For 8 doses, she'd need 448 mL (56 mL/dose * 8 doses).

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

John's classes each hold 120 students / 8 = 15 students.  Since he has two classes, that's a total of 15 students/class * 2 classes = 30 students.

Adding that to Ali's class of 120 students, the combined capacity is 120 students + 30 students = 150 students.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Stephen owes his sister $300 plus 2% interest, which is $6. So, he needs to pay back a total of $306.

He pays $25 each month for 11 months, which is a total of $275.  That means he'll need to pay the rest in the twelfth month.

$306 - $275 = $31

Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Jordan has two little ones in diapers, and each one needs a change five times a day. That's 2 kids * 5 changes/kid = 10 diaper changes total.

His wife helps out and does half, so she changes 10 changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes.

That means Jordan changes the other 5 diaper changes.

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

First, we need to figure out how many jelly beans could fit in the jar. The jar is a rectangular prism, so we multiply the volume of the base by the height. That's 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

But jelly beans don't pack perfectly, so we need to account for that 80% efficiency. That means we can only fit 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches worth of jelly beans.

Now, each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we can fit 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans in the jar.

Tim thinks 30% of those are red, so he'd guess 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

The actual number is 900, so Tim was off by 900 - 864 = 36 jelly beans. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

The bus starts with 20 people. Then 40 more get on, so there are 20 + 40 = 60 people.

At the next stop, 3/4 of the people who got on at the first stop join, which is (3/4) * 40 = 30 people. Now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people.

At the third stop, the number of people doubles, so there are 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus can hold 200 people, so there's room for 200 - 180 = 20 more people.

"
"Let's break this down! Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year at $2 a visit, so that's 3 * $2 = $6 per year. Over 5 years, she spends $6 * 5 = $30.

Then the price jumps up by 150%! That means the new price is $2 + ($2 * 1.5) = $5 per visit. For the next 3 years, she spends $5 * 3 * 3 = $45.

In total, Pauline spends $30 + $45 = $75 on museum visits. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Each grade has 10 students, and they go in groups of 8. So each grade needs 2 groups to fit everyone. Since there are 4 grades, that's a total of 8 groups.

If each group gets 45 minutes, it will take 8 groups * 45 minutes/group = 360 minutes for everyone to go.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Ali owes John.  

John made 4 tables at $20 each, so that's 4 * $20 = $80. He also made 2 roof frames at $10 each, so that's 2 * $10 = $20.

In total, Ali needs to pay John $80 + $20 = $100.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If the longer piece is 4 times bigger than the shorter one, think of it like this: the shorter piece is one part, and the longer piece is four parts. That makes a total of five parts.

Since the board is 40 feet long, each ""part"" is 40 feet / 5 parts = 8 feet long.

The longer piece is four parts, so it's 4 parts * 8 feet/part = 32 feet long.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Aiden needs 80 meatballs, and he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of beef. So, he'll need 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of beef.  Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of beef, he'll need 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Luke has five windows that are each 35 inches wide, that's a total of 5 * 35 = 175 inches. Since he needs twice that amount of fabric, he should buy 175 * 2 = 350 inches of fabric. 


350 

"
"Okay, so the first 16 minutes cost $0.25 per minute, which is $4.00 total.  The rest of the call is 20 minutes at $0.20 per minute, so that's another $4.00.  Adding those together, the whole call costs $8.00. 


$8.00
"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Twice the rain from Monday would be 2 inches * 2 = 4 inches.  

Since it's supposed to rain one more inch than that, Tuesday will get 4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches of rain.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Carly needs enough treats for everyone in her class to have two each, so that's 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats total.  Let's say she makes 'c' cupcakes. She makes 3 times that many brownies minus 2, so that's 3c - 2 brownies.  

To find out how many cupcakes Carly made, we need to add the cupcakes and brownies together and set it equal to 10: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 4c - 2 = 10.  Adding 2 to both sides gives us 4c = 12.  Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that c = 3.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! A manicure is $35 and a pedicure is $40, so together that's $75.  But wait, there's a 20% discount for doing both, so that's $75 x 0.20 = $15 off. That brings the total to $75 - $15 = $60.

Now, Karen wants nail art on each of her 10 fingers, and that's $3 per nail, so that's an extra $3 x 10 = $30.

Adding that to the manicure and pedicure price, Karen will pay a total of $60 + $30 = $90.


$90
"
"Let's see... 3 magazines times 12 issues each is 36 issues.  Then there's 6 more from that one magazine. And the last one sends 4 times 6, so that's 24 more.  Adding those all up, 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 issues! 



"
"Let's figure this out! If Samantha has 27 paintings and that's 12 fewer than Shelley, then Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.  Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings. 

31 

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

The toy started at $40. In December, the price went up by 80%, which is like adding 80% of $40, or $32. So in December, the toy cost $72.

Then in January, the price dropped by 50%. That means it went down by half of $72, which is $36. So the final price in January was $36.


$36
"
"Okay, let's break this down. Charlie makes $80 for each regular lesson, and he has four of those, so that's 4 * $80 = $320.  For veterans, he discounts his rate by 25%, which is $80 * 0.25 = $20 off. That means he charges veterans $80 - $20 = $60 per lesson. He has two veteran lessons, so that's 2 * $60 = $120.  

Adding his earnings from both types of lessons, he makes a total of $320 + $120 = $440 today.

"
"Hey there! To find Sally's mean score, we add up all her quiz scores and then divide by the total number of quizzes.  

Let's see... 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630.

Now we divide that by 9 quizzes: 630 / 9 = 70.

So Sally's mean score is 70!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Walter ate 24 apples (2/5 of 60). That leaves him with 36 apples. He then gives his sister 9 apples (25% of 36).  That means he has 27 apples left to sell.  Since he sells each apple for $3, he makes $81. 



"
"Let's see... if 9 novels is three-quarters of the total, that means she wrote one-quarter more this year.  To find the whole amount, we can divide the number she wrote last year by three-quarters: 9 / (3/4) = 12. 


12
"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Michael's driving for 3 whole days at 50 km/hr, so he'll cover 50 * 24 * 3 = 3600 kilometers.  Since the total distance is 6000 km, he'll have covered 3600 / 6000 * 100% = 60% of the distance.

"
"Let's see... Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times that amount, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.  That means they used a total of 6 + 30 = 36 grapes for the juice.  

Their mom used 48 grapes for the pies because she needed 12 grapes per pie and made 4 pies.

So, at the beginning, there were 36 + 48 = 84 grapes. 


84
"
"Hmm, let's see... 82 teachers work at Rydell, but 13 were sick. That means 82 - 13 = 69 teachers were there.  And they got 9 substitute teachers to help out, so 69 + 9 = 78 teachers were at school that day!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Bud makes mac and cheese every week, so that's 52 times a year. Each time, he spends $1.00 on pasta, $3.00 on cheddar, and $6.00 on gruyere (since that's twice the cheddar cost).  

That means each week he spends $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Over a whole year, he spends $10.00/week * 52 weeks/year = $520.00 on his cheesy goodness!


520.00 

"
"Hmm, let me see... 80 classrooms times 15 minutes each is 1200 minutes of cleaning.  That's a lot of scrubbing!  They work 8 hours a day, which is 480 minutes. Over 5 days, that's 2400 minutes total. So, 1200 minutes of cleaning divided by 2400 total minutes is... 50%!  

50 

"
"Let's see... each middle shelf holds 10 books, and the bottom shelf holds twice that, so that's 20 books. The top shelf holds 5 fewer than the bottom, so it holds 15 books.  That means each bookcase can hold 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.  Since Elly has 110 books, she'll need 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out Rose's profit. 

First, she spent 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00 on eggs.

She has 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs.

That means she can make 60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets of eggs to sell.

She'll earn 20 sets * $1.00/set = $20.00.

So, her profit is $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Half of Skyler's hats are red, so that's 100 / 2 = 50 red hats. That leaves 100 - 50 = 50 hats that are either blue or white.

Three-fifths of those remaining hats are blue, meaning there are (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

That means there must be 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

"Okay, let's figure this out! Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions right, which means she needs to answer 77 questions correctly (110 total questions * 0.70 = 77).  She already got 42 right on the first test (70 questions * 0.60 = 42). That means she needs to get 35 right on the second test (77 - 42 = 35).

"
"Okay, let me see... Mary makes some strawberry cubes, and then blueberry cubes which are 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  If she makes 116 total, let's figure out how many blueberry cubes she made. Hmm...

If we say 's' is the number of strawberry cubes, then blueberry cubes are 5s - 4.  All together that's s + (5s - 4) = 116.

Combining the 's' terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116. Adding 4 to both sides gives us 6s = 120.  Dividing both sides by 6, we find s = 20.

So, she made 20 strawberry cubes. Now, to find the blueberry cubes: 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  Jason needs to sell 15 cars, and for every 25 calls he makes, one person comes to the dealership. Then, for every two people who visit, one buys a car.  

So, he needs 15 customers to buy cars, which means he needs 30 people to visit the dealership (15 customers * 2 people per customer = 30 visits). To get 30 visits, he'll need to make 750 phone calls (30 visits * 25 calls per visit = 750 calls).

"
"Okay, let's see... they have 4 people and each person gets a flashlight, so that's 4 flashlights.  Then there are 8 rooms and each room gets 2 flashlights, so that's 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights.  

They have small candles in half the rooms, which is 8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms.  Each of those rooms has 4 small candles, so that's 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles.

The other half of the rooms have medium candles, so that's another 4 rooms. Each of those rooms has 5 medium candles, for a total of 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles.

Adding all the candles together, they have 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Finally, adding the candles and flashlights, they have 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40 candles and flashlights.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If there were 20 helmets, and there were half as many robots, that means there were 20 / 2 = 10 robots.  There were also twice as many footballs as helmets, so there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.  

Adding them all up, Dominick saw 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 items.

Crista has a lot of thirsty plants!  

* The 4 plants that need half a cup need a total of 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.
* The 8 plants that need a full cup need 8 * 1 = 8 cups.
* That leaves 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants that need a quarter cup each, for a total of 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Adding it all up, Crista needs 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water every day.

"Okay, let's figure this out! Phineas has to travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.  

Since he hops at 20 yards per minute on land, that'll take him 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

Swimming at 10 yards per minute, the water part will take him 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

Adding those times together, it'll take Phineas a total of 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes to get home.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon of lemonade, and he gets 1 cup from 6 lemons.  Since he's making 4 gallons of regular lemonade, that's 4 gallons * 6 lemons/gallon = 24 lemons.

Now, Allen wants an extra gallon that's twice as tart, meaning it needs twice the lemon juice, or 2 cups. That's 2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons.

In total, Tim needs 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much dog food the Kennel house needs. 

The German Shepherds eat 5 kg each per day, and there are 3 of them, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 kg. The Bulldogs eat 3 kg each, and there are 2, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 kg.  

In total, they eat 15 + 6 = 21 kg of food every day. Over a week, that's 21 * 7 = 147 kg.

They'll need 147 kilograms of dog food for the week.

"Let's break this down! Elvis drives west for 5 hours at 18 mph, covering 5 * 18 = 90 miles. Then he drives east for 8 hours at 18 mph, covering 8 * 18 = 144 miles.  Since he's driving east (back towards his house), we subtract the westward distance: 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

Elvis is 54 miles from his house. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

The boat loses 30% of its value the first year, which is $9000 * 0.30 = $2700. That means it's worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300 after the first year.

The second year, it loses another 30%, or $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.  So now it's worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

Finally, in the third year, it loses 20%, which is $4410 * 0.20 = $882.  That leaves it with a value of $4410 - $882 = $3528.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

There are 54 red candies, and twice that amount of orange, so there are 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies. There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, meaning there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

That's a total of 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 red, orange, and yellow candies. Since there are 232 candies in total, there must be 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Helen spent.  

Her hotel cost $80 per night, and she stayed for 3 nights, so that's $80 * 3 = $240.

Each bus ride cost 10% of the hotel price, which is $80 * 0.10 = $8. She took 7 bus rides, so that's $8 * 7 = $56.

In total, Helen spent $240 + $56 = $296 on her trip.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage is 250 pounds, and his two kids weigh 75 pounds each, so that's another 150 pounds (75 x 2).  That means everything together weighs 1600 pounds (1200 + 250 + 150).

If it takes 1% of the weight to move the car, we need to find 1% of 1600.  That's 16 pounds (1600 x 0.01 = 16).

"Okay, let's figure this out!  Avery needs a plate setting for each of her 12 guests. Each setting costs $6.00 for a dinner plate + $5.00 for a bowl + $4.00 for a salad plate, which is $15.00 per person.  So, for 12 people, she'll spend 12 x $15.00 = $180.00.


$180.00 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Steve took 10 hours, and Anna took half that time plus 2 more hours. So, half of Steve's time is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.  Adding 2 more hours, Anna took 5 + 2 = 7 hours.

"
"Let's figure this out!  Each pig eats 8 pounds of feed a day (4 pounds twice a day).  That means all five pigs eat 40 pounds a day. Over a week, that's 280 pounds (40 pounds/day * 7 days). If Dexter started with 300 pounds, he'll have 20 pounds left.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! John needs enough hot dogs for 20 people, and they each want 2 hot dogs, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.  He already has 4, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 more.  

Hot dogs come in packs of 6, so he'll need 36 / 6 = 6 packs. If each pack costs $2, then he'll spend 6 * $2 = $12 on hot dogs.

"
"Let's figure out how much money Frances has left!

She earns $40 from selling cupcakes (20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake) and another $40 from cookies (40 cookies * $1/cookie). That's a total of $80.

Her trays cost $20 (5 trays * $4/tray).

So, she has $60 left ($80 - $20). 


$60
"
"Okay, so there are 5 kids at first. Then each kid brings a friend, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 kids.  Then on the next street, each of those 10 kids brings TWO more friends! So that's 10 times 2, which is 20 kids. But then the first 5 kids get tired and go home.  That leaves 20 minus 5, which is 15 kids.

"
"Let's see... Mamou started with 1360 meals and gave out 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals.  That means she has 1360 - 142 = 1218 meals left. 

1218 

"
"Let's see... a quarter is 25 cents, two nickels are 10 cents, and seven dimes are 70 cents.  Adding those up, James has 105 cents! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

The sisters are all 16, so together they're 16 x 3 = 48 years old. The younger brother is 12, and the older brother is 12 x 2 = 24 years old.  

Adding everyone up, we get 48 + 12 + 24 = 84 years old.

"
"Let's see... Charisma meditates for 30 minutes each day, and that's 210 minutes a week. She also does yoga for 300 minutes a week.  So in total, that's 510 minutes of practice each week. Over four weeks, she'd spend 2040 minutes on meditation and yoga.

"
"Let's see... 11 small shirts at 3 square feet each is 33 square feet.  8 medium shirts at 4 square feet each is 32 square feet. And 6 large shirts at 6 square feet each is 36 square feet.  Adding those together, the quilt will be 101 square feet!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is 3 * 12 = 36 seeds. A large sunflower has 50% more than that, so it has 36 * 0.50 = 18 extra seeds. That means a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.  

 Altogether, there are 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.


90 

"
"Let's figure this out! Timothy has three times the number of pens George has, so he has 3 * 18 = 54 pens. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, meaning she has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Anne is twice Albert's size, so she's 36"" * 2 = 72"" tall.

Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so she's 72"" - 2"" = 70"" tall now.

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, she was 70"" - 3"" = 67"" tall before.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

They make 5000 bars a day and sell each for $2, so that's 5000 * $2 = $10,000 per day.

In a week, that's $10,000 * 7 = $70,000.

Over two weeks, they'd make $70,000 * 2 = $140,000.


$140000 

"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Jake spent. 

The T-shirts are buy one get one 50% off, so the second shirt is $8 / 2 = $4. That means the total for the shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is $40 * 0.40 = $16.  The shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Adding it all up, Jake spent $12 + $24 = $36 at the store.

"
"Let's see... Ryan earned $6 a week for three weeks, so that's $6 * 3 = $18.  Then he spent $1.25 on each of his 3 friends plus himself, for a total of $1.25 * 4 = $5.00 on ice cream. That leaves him with $18 - $5 = $13.  Since movie tickets cost $6.50 each, he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Ellen and Lani spent. Ellen's leggings cost $100 and the frame was $5, so that's $100 + $5 = $105. Lani spent $30 on sunglasses and $100 each on two bathrobes, which is $100 x 2 = $200.  Adding the bathrobes to the sunglasses, she spent $200 + $30 = $230.  

Finally, to find the total, we add Ellen's spending and Lani's spending: $105 + $230 = $335.


$335 

"
"Okay, let's break down Tim's honey and jam business!

First, we need to figure out how much each jar costs to make.  The passion fruit costs $12 per jar (2 pounds * $6/pound), the jackfruit costs $12 per jar (1.5 pounds * $8/pound), and the honey costs $20 per jar (2 pounds * $10/pound). That means each jar costs $44 to make ($12 + $12 + $20).

Since he sells each jar for $50, he makes a profit of $6 per jar ($50 - $44).

If he sells 10 jars, his total profit would be $60 ($6/jar * 10 jars).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much money Justin has. 

* He has 32 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, so those are worth 32 * $0.25 = $8.00.
* His 95 dimes are worth 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.
* The 120 nickels add up to 120 * $0.05 = $6.00.
* And finally, his 750 pennies are equal to 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Adding it all together, Justin has $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00 in his jar.

"
"Let's see... Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 x 2 = $15.00 on movie tickets, and $8.50 on a bracelet. That's a total of $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00.  If her parents gave her $40.00, she has $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00 left.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Josh works 5 days a week and services 3 cars each day, so he works on 15 cars per week.  He makes $4 for each car, so he earns $60 per week. Over two weeks, he'd make $120. 


$120 

"
"Okay, let's see... Randy starts with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies, for a total of 18. He eats one of each kind for a snack, leaving him with 16. Then he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, bringing his total down to 14. He gives away 2 sugar cookies, leaving him with 12. Finally, he bakes 4 of each kind, adding 12 more cookies. That means he has 12 + 12 = 24 cookies!

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Matthew has 12 toys, so half of them is 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

He'd make 6 * $5 = $30 from the first half.

And 6 * $7 = $42 from the second half.

Adding those together, he'd earn a total of $30 + $42 = $72.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! The dog digs a ton of holes while Nate's gone.  

* He digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so that's 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

* Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 more each night, so he's really making progress by 9 - 6 = 3 holes each day.

* To fill all 84 holes, it'll take him 84 / 3 = 28 days.

* That's 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Butler High School enrolls 3/4 the number of students as Norman High School, which means they have (3/4) * 4000 = 3000 students.  

That means Norman High School has 4000 - 3000 = 1000 more students than Butler High School.


1000 

"
"Hmm, let's see... they made 7995 cookies total, and 2595 were rainbow and 3075 were oatmeal.  That means they made 2325 chocolate chip cookies! 



"
"Let's break this down!

Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, but Igor only brought 16 / 2 = 8.

He was supposed to get 14 Petri dishes, but brought 14 + 2 = 16.

Igor got the right number of beakers, but we don't know how many he lost.

In total, Igor put 29 items on the bench. That means he lost 37 - 29 = 8 items.

Since he brought the right number of beakers, he must have lost 8 - (16 - 8) = 0 beakers.

"
"Let's figure this out!  

James needs 2 screws per leg, and each table has 4 legs, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 screws per table.  Since he has 4 tables, he'll need 8 * 4 = 32 screws.  He starts with 40 screws, so he'll have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over.

"
"Hi there!  Let's see... if one basket has 10 eggs and the other has twice that amount, the second basket has 20 eggs.  That means together they have 30 eggs! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Alexandra raised $430, and Kim raised $320 more than that, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, meaning Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total, we add up everyone's earnings: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.


2180 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, who ran 2 miles.  Since Aaron finished in 16 minutes, that means he ran each mile in 8 minutes. Vanessa runs each mile in twice that time, so she runs each mile in 16 minutes. Since she ran 4 miles, her total time was 64 minutes. 


64
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  He needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock. That means he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line total.  Since he already has 6 feet, he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 more feet of line.


594 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations each night, and each group spends $15 (2 meals at $5 each plus a $5 bottle of wine). That means they make $90 each night. Since they're open 2 days a week, they make $180 a week.


$180 

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If the vendor wants to make a 25% profit on his $80 investment, he needs to make an extra $20 (because 25% of 80 is 20). That means he needs to sell all the watermelons for $100 total.

To find out how much each watermelon costs, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons: $100 / 50 = $2.

So each watermelon should be sold for $2. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down!

Dora is turning 12 in three years, so she's currently 9 years old.  James is twice her age, making him 18.  That means John was 19 when James was born, and he's now 37.  His youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest is 5 now. In three years, he'll be 8.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Mark paid.  

The radiator was originally $400, but he got a sweet deal at the junk shop for 80% off, so that's $400 * 0.80 = $320 off. That means the radiator only cost him $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic charged $50 an hour for 3 hours of work, so that's $50 * 3 = $150.

Adding the radiator cost and the mechanic's fee, Mark paid a total of $80 + $150 = $230.


$230 

"
"Let's see... 20 animals with 70 legs... hmm.  

If all the animals were chickens, they'd only have 40 legs (20 animals * 2 legs each). That means there have to be some cows in there to make up the extra 30 legs.

Since cows have 4 legs, that means there must be 7.5 cows (30 extra legs / 4 legs per cow).  But you can't have half a cow!

Let's try something else. If we had 15 chickens, that's 30 legs. That leaves 40 legs for the cows (70 total legs - 30 chicken legs).  

40 legs divided by 4 legs per cow means there would be 10 cows.

That adds up to 25 animals, which is too many.

Okay, let's try 10 chickens. That's 20 legs. That leaves 50 legs for the cows.

50 legs divided by 4 legs per cow means there would be 12.5 cows. Nope, still not right.

Let's go back to 5 chickens. That's 10 legs. That leaves 60 legs for the cows.

60 legs divided by 4 legs per cow means there would be 15 cows.

That adds up to 20 animals! 

So the answer is **5**.
