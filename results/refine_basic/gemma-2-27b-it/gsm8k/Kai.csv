"Let's break it down:

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day, but she uses 3 for breakfast and 4 for muffins, leaving her with 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs to sell.

Since she sells each egg for $2, she makes 9 * $2 = $18 at the farmers' market.

"Alright, let's break this down. Josh spent a total of $130,000 ($80,000 for the house + $50,000 for repairs).  The repairs increased the house's value by 150%, meaning it went up by $120,000 ($80,000 x 1.50).  

That brings the total value to $200,000.  

So, his profit is $70,000 ($200,000 - $130,000).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times that amount, then Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.

Adding them all up, Seattle's 20 + Charleston's 80 + Toulouse's 160 equals a total of 260 sheep.

"Alright, let's break this down. Carla hits a snag with that big download!

She gets 40% of the way through, which is 80 GB, before Windows throws a wrench in things with those pesky updates. That takes 20 minutes, and she has to start all over.

So, she downloads 80 GB in 40 minutes (80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes).  Then she's got 120 GB left to download, which takes another 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes).

Add it all up: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

It takes Carla a total of **120 minutes** to download the file.

"Hey there! Let's break down Eliza's earnings.

She gets $10 an hour for her first 40 hours, so that's 40 * $10 = $400.

She worked 5 hours of overtime, and her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.  So her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Darrell and Allen's ages have a ratio of 7:11, meaning their ages are like parts of a whole. If their combined age is 162, we need to figure out how big each ""part"" is.

Think of it like this: 7 + 11 = 18 parts make up their total age.

So, each ""part"" is worth 162 / 18 = 9 years.

Darrell is 7 parts, so he's 7 * 9 = 63 years old.

Allen is 11 parts, making him 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"Hey! Let's figure this out.

So, the first friend guesses 80 jelly beans. The second friend says 20 more than half of that, which is 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend, which is 80 * 0.25 = 20 more jelly beans, making their guess 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

To find the average, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Then we divide by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can think of it like this:

* **Silver coins:**  Let's call this number ""s""
* **Gold coins:** This would be ""s + 30""

Since she has 110 coins total, we can add those together: s + (s + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get 2s + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2s = 80

Divide both sides by 2: s = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  

To find the gold coins, we add 30: 40 + 30 = 70


Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Let's see... John sold his Lego sets for $15 each, and he had 13 of them. That means he made 13 * $15 = $195.  He spent $160 on video games, and had $5 left over.  That means he had $160 + $5 = $165 before buying the games.

So, he sold enough Lego sets to make $165, which is $165 / $15 per set = 11 Lego sets.

Since he started with 13 and sold 11, he has 13 - 11 = 2 Lego sets left.

"
"Let's break this down. Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half her running speed, so she runs at 6 miles per hour.  Since she runs four times faster than she walks, her walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends two hours running (one-third of six hours) and four hours walking (two-thirds of six hours).  That means she covers 12 miles running (6 miles/hour * 2 hours) and 6 miles walking (1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours).

In total, Dana travels 18 miles.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). That'll cost him $20.00 (2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00).

If he sells all 20 candles for $2.00 each, he'll make $40.00 (20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00).

So, his profit is $20.00 ($40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00).

* Petunias are $2 a pot, and he sells 9. So that's 9 * $2 = $18.
* Begonias are also $2 a pot, and he sells 17. That's 17 * $2 = $34.

Adding it all up, Artie makes $36 + $18 + $34 = $88 today.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If the top level is 16 square feet and each level is half the size of the one below it, we can work our way down:

* Level 3: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
* Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
* Level 1: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, add up all the levels: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet

Finally, divide the total by the number of levels to find the average: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

The puppy eats 1 cup a day for the first 180 days, so that's 180 cups. Then it eats 2 cups a day for the rest of the year, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. That's another 370 cups (2 x 185).

In total, that's 180 + 370 = 550 cups needed for the whole year. Since each bag has 110 cups, Cecilia will need 550 / 110 = 5 bags.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. Sylvie gets a 10% raise every year after five years.  

* After one year, her salary will be $600 + ($600 * 0.10) = $660
* After two years, it'll be $660 + ($660 * 0.10) = $726
* After three years, it'll be $726 + ($726 * 0.10) = $798.60

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Marilyn sold 10 times more than Harald, think of it like this: Harald's sales are one ""part,"" and Marilyn's are ten ""parts."" That makes a total of eleven ""parts"" representing the 88,000 copies sold.  

To find out how many copies are in one ""part"" (Harald's sales), we divide: 88,000 copies / 11 parts = 8,000 copies per part.

So Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Adult dinos eat a lot - 10 pounds of potato salad each! Since the little dinos eat half as much, they'll each munch on 5 pounds.

So, the grown-up dinos need 20 adults * 10 pounds/adult = 200 pounds of salad.

The little dinos need 5 children * 5 pounds/child = 25 pounds.

Add those together, and Ted needs a whopping 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds of potato salad!

"Let's break this down. Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald, meaning Gerald originally took 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.

A 10% improvement on Gerald's time is 40 seconds * 0.10 = 4 seconds.

So, Gerald's new time is 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  If there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, that means there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats.

That's a lot of cats!  

So, there are 120 cats + 60 dogs = 180 dogs and cats in total.

The problem says there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Finally, to find the total number of pets, we add up all the animals: 168 rabbits + 180 dogs and cats = 348 pets.

* The inside length is 5 inches (outside) - 2 inches (walls) = 3 inches.
* The inside width is 6 inches (outside) - 2 inches (walls) = 4 inches.
* The inside height is 4 inches (outside) - 2 inches (walls) = 2 inches.

That means each box has an inside volume of 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inside volume is 24 cubic inches/box * 3 boxes = 72 cubic inches.

"Alright, let's break this down. Julia's boat is taking on water at a rate of 2 liters every 10 feet.  She rows at a speed of 20 feet in 16 seconds, meaning she covers 1.25 feet per second. To reach the shore, it takes her 64 seconds, so she rows a total of 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.

Since she travels 80 feet, and the boat takes on 2 liters every 10 feet, it takes on a total of 80 feet / 10 feet/intake * 2 liters/intake = 16 liters of water.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Sasha's profit.

First, we need to see how much she'd make from the 2x4s. Since the price went up 50%, each 2x4 now costs $15. She has ten of those, so that's 10 * $15 = $150.

The 4x4s are now $24 each (because of the 50% increase), and she has five, so that's 5 * $24 = $120.

In total, she'll make $150 + $120 = $270.

She spent $100 on the 2x4s and $80 on the 4x4s, for a total of $180.

So, her profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

Think of it like this: the ratio 7:13 represents 20 total parts (7 + 13 = 20).  Each of those parts is worth 120 / 20 = 6.

Since the sugar part of the ratio is 7, Katy used 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"Alright, let's break this down.

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, meaning if Lylah made $100, Adrien made $130.  We know Adrien made $40,000 four years ago, so that's his $130. To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we divide: $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so he's now making $40,000 + ($40,000 * 0.40) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased, so four years later she's making $30,769.23 + ($30,769.23 * 0.30) = $40,000.

Finally, to find their combined salary, we add them up: $56,000 + $40,000 = $96,000.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, meaning 6 + 1 = 7 hours each night.  Since there are 4 more days left in the week, that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, so that's 3 * $15 = $45.

An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so it's $45 - $5 = $40.

Dillon's buying 4 watermelons at $45 each, so that's 4 * $45 = $180.

He's also getting 20 peppers at $15 each, which is 20 * $15 = $300.

And finally, 10 oranges at $40 each will cost him 10 * $40 = $400.

Adding it all up: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

So the total Dillon spends is $880.

"Hey there! Let's break this bee problem down.

We know there are 700 bees total.  Let's think about the ratios: there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees.

This means if we had 1 queen bee, there would be 2 baby bees and 4 worker bees. That's a total of 7 bees.

Since we have 700 bees, we can figure out how many groups of 7 that is: 700 bees / 7 bees per group = 100 groups.

So, if there are 100 groups, and each group has 4 worker bees, there are 100 groups * 4 worker bees per group = 400 worker bees.

"Let's break this down.  

First, 15 bees returned after the first 6 hours (half of the 30 that left). Then, 60 more bees flew out (twice the original 30). That means a total of 90 bees left the hive during the day. Since all the bees that left eventually came back, 90 bees returned in the last 6 hours.

"Let's figure this out!

First, we need to know how long it takes each of them to get home.  Steve has to go 3 miles, which is 15840 feet (3 miles * 5280 feet/mile). He bikes at 440 feet per minute, so it takes him 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.

Tim goes 2 miles, or 10560 feet (2 miles * 5280 feet/mile). He skateboards at 264 feet per minute, so it takes him 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

That means Steve gets home 4 minutes before Tim.

"Let's break it down:

* Shawnda inflated 10 tires from bicycles (5 bikes * 2 tires each).
* She inflated 9 tires from tricycles (3 trikes * 3 tires each).
* And 1 tire from the unicycle.

"Let's break this down.  The seagull ate half of Dave's 14 fries, so that's 7 fries.  Adding those to Dave's, there were 21 fries left. Then the pigeons ate 9 fries (3 each), leaving 12. The raccoon took two-thirds of those, which is 8 fries, leaving 4. Finally, the ants took 1, leaving 5.

Working backwards, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries before the ants, 6 + 8 = 14 before the raccoon, 14 + 9 = 23 before the pigeons, and 23 + 7 = 30 before the seagull.  

So there were originally 30 fries in the pack.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we gotta find the total length of each type of bread in inches.  

* Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
* Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
* Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette * 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Now, let's add those up: 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

Finally, we convert that to feet: 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet.

So the answer is 280.

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

If Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can say Seth's age is 2 times Brooke's age.  

In two years, they'll both be older. Seth will be 2 times Brooke's age plus 2 years, and Brooke will be her current age plus 2 years.  

We know that in two years, their ages added together will equal 28.

Let's use some algebra to solve for Seth's age:

* Let Brooke's current age be ""b""
* Seth's current age is ""2b""

In two years:

* Brooke's age will be ""b + 2""
* Seth's age will be ""2b + 2""

Their ages in two years added together equal 28:

(2b + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Simplify and solve for ""b"":

3b + 4 = 28
3b = 24
b = 8

Now that we know Brooke is 8, we can find Seth's age:

Seth's age = 2 * 8 = 16



Seth is 16 years old.

Let's break this down.  There are three numbers on a standard die that are bigger than 3 (4, 5, and 6), so there's a 50% chance of rolling one of those.

To get two even numbers in a row, you need to roll an even number, then another even number. Each of those has a 50% chance, so the chance of both happening is 25%.

That means rolling a number bigger than 3 is 25% *more* likely.

Mark edits 1000 sentences a week, splitting them evenly between two publishers. That means he edits 500 sentences for each. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so he earns 500 * $0.05 = $25 from them.

Publisher B pays double Publisher A's rate, which is 5 cents * 2 = 10 cents per sentence.  So, he earns 500 * $0.10 = $50 from Publisher B.

"Hey there! Let's crack this chicken egg problem.

Let's say Jerry has 'r' red chickens and 'w' white chickens. We know:

* White chickens lay 5 eggs a day, red chickens lay 3.
* Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so w = r + 2.
* He collects 42 eggs every day.

So, the total eggs from red chickens are 3r, and from white chickens are 5w.  That means:

3r + 5w = 42

We also know w = r + 2, so let's swap that into the equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Now we can solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4

Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"Let's break this problem down.

Think about what's happening: both pools are losing water at the same rate, so the *difference* in their water levels is changing because of the leak.

Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago, and now it has four times as much, that means the big pool lost less water *relative* to the small pool.

This tells us the small pool must have started with more water than the big pool.

Let's say the small pool has 'x' gallons now. Four minutes ago, it had x + 16 gallons (since it's losing 4 gallons per minute).

The big pool has 4x gallons now, meaning four minutes ago it had 4x + 16 gallons.

We know that four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So:

4x + 16 = 2(x + 16)

Solving for x:

4x + 16 = 2x + 32
2x = 16
x = 8


The small pool has 8 gallons now.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Lori needs to save $320 for the shoes plus $32 for the belt, so that's a total of $352. If she makes $8 an hour, she'll need to work $352 / $8 = 44 hours.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, Janeth needs to pay back the original $2000 plus 10% interest, which is $200. That means she owes a total of $2200.

If she pays $165 each month for 12 months, she'll have paid a total of $165 * 12 = $1980.

Subtracting that from the total amount owed, we get $2200 - $1980 = $220.

So Janeth will still owe $220 after 12 months.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Harriet is 21 now, and Adrian is three times her age, making him 21 * 3 = 63 years old. Zack is twice Harriet's age, so he's 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

In three years, Harriet will be 24, Adrian will be 66, and Zack will be 45.  

Adding those up, their total age will be 24 + 66 + 45 = 135.  

Dividing that by 3, we get an average age of 45.

"Let's break it down:

* Naomi scored 68 points.
* Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, so Yuri scored (68 / 2) + 10 = 44 points.
* Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Together, Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since the four students scored a total of 251 points, Jojo must have scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready at first, so that's 30/100 * 120 = 36 melons.

That leaves 120 - 36 = 84 melons.

Then, 3/4 of those were ready two weeks later, which is (3/4) * 84 = 63 melons.

So, there were 84 - 63 = 21 melons left that weren't ready.

On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies, for a whopping 26 * 200 = 5200 calories. Her sister had 13 cookies, which is 13 * 200 = 2600 calories.

In total, Sue ate 4000 + 5200 = 9200 calories, while her sister ate 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, meaning she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

In total, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

Then there's the transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price: 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

Now, let's add everything up: $350,000 (selling price) + $17,500 (brokerage) + $42,000 (transfer) = $409,500.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

It takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees, and then it takes 40% longer to get to 400 degrees. That means it takes an extra 20 * 0.40 = 8 minutes.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down. The car in the fast lane is zooming along at 60 miles per hour, while the slowpoke in the other lane is only doing half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.  If the fast car covers 480 miles, we need to figure out how long it takes the slower car to do the same.

Since time is distance divided by speed, we can do 480 miles / 30 miles per hour = 16 hours.

So the answer is 16. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less, so Izzy has 17. Together they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.  Since they have 10 times *less* medals than the total given out, that means 39 x 10 = 390 medals have been given out in total.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

On day two, Darren does 120 pushups, 40 squats, and 40 dumbbell presses.

That means on day one he did a total of 170 exercises (100 + 50 + 20) and on day two he did 200 (120 + 40 + 40).

Adding those together, Darren did a total of 370 exercises over the two days.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal and they eat twice a day, that's 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg of rice per person each day.

With 5 people, that's a total of 5 people * 0.4 kg/person = 2 kg of rice gone every day.

A 42 kg bag will last 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days.

That's 21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks!

"Let's figure this out!

John drives 60 miles each day (30 miles to work and 30 miles back). That's 300 miles a week (60 miles/day * 5 days/week) and a whopping 15,000 miles a year (300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year).

At $2 per mile, that's $30,000 just for mileage. Plus, he gives his driver a $1,800 bonus each year ($150/month * 12 months/year).

Adding those together, John pays $31,800 a year for his driving service.

"Let's break this down. Elise sold 45 books this year, and twice that amount in the first year, so she sold 45 * 2 = 90 books in the first year.  That means she's sold a total of 90 + 45 = 135 books. Since there are 50 books left, she sold 135 - 50 = 85 books in the second year.  

With each book selling for $20, she earned 85 * $20 = $1700 in the second year.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Theo's suits cost him 6 * $100 = $600. His suitcases cost 3 * $50 = $150.  His flight ticket is a bit trickier: 5 * $100 = $500, and then add $700, making it $500 + $700 = $1200.

So far, he's spent $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

He started with $6000 and wants to save $2000, leaving him with $6000 - $2000 = $4050 for other expenses.

That means he has $4050 - $1950 = $2050 left for gifts!

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

If we call the number of players on defense ""d"", we know the offense has twice that many, or 2*d* players. The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, which is *d*/2.

Since the total number of players is 105, we can write an equation: 2*d* + *d* + *d*/2 = 105

Combining the 'd' terms, we get 3.5*d* = 105.

Dividing both sides by 3.5 gives us *d* = 30.

So there are **30** players on the defense. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 people. She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, which is 3 * 4 = 12 people. That's a total of 12 + 12 = 24 people.

But, 8 people got sick and couldn't make it, and 8 / 4 = 2 people had other plans. So, in total, 8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't come.

That means 24 - 10 = 14 people showed up to Martha's party.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Solomon starts with 50 marbles and gets 20 more from Johanna, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 marbles. His dad gives him 2/5 * 20 = 8 more marbles.

That means Solomon has a total of 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2 kgs, the total weight is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

It costs $12.00 to fill the pool.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, we figure out how many junior programmers there are: 2/5 of 100 employees is 40. That means there are 60 senior programmers (100 total - 40 junior).

Senior programmers make $400 more than junior programmers, so they earn $2400 each.

Now, let's calculate the total salary for each group:

* Junior programmers: 40 programmers * $2000/programmer = $80,000
* Senior programmers: 60 programmers * $2400/programmer = $144,000

Finally, add those together to find the total salary for all programmers: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"Let's see... 20 people were on the bus before the third stop, and 7 got off at the second stop. That means there were 20 + 7 = 27 people on the bus before the second stop. Then 8 people got on at the second stop, so there were 27 - 8 = 19 people on the bus after the first stop.  Finally, 5 people got on at the first stop, so there must have been 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus at the terminal.

* He gives 14 to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 left.
* He buys twice the amount he gave away, which is 14 * 2 = 28 more lollipops.
* Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
* He eats 3, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33.
* Finally, he eats 2 more, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops. 

So the answer is 31.

For Job A, Nick makes $15 an hour times 2000 hours, which is $30,000. But then 20% in taxes comes out, leaving him with $24,000.

Job B pays a flat $42,000, but he has to pay $6,000 in property tax first. That leaves him with $36,000. Then 10% tax on that is $3,600, so his take-home pay is $32,400.

Job B pays him $8,400 more than Job A.

"Hey there! Let's break down these furniture costs. 

Furniture United wants $1350 upfront and then $350 a month for 6 months. That's $350 * 6 = $2100 in installments, plus the initial $1350, for a total of $3450.

Cozy Homes wants $1100 upfront and then $250 a month for 9 months. That's $250 * 9 = $2250 in installments, plus the initial $1100, for a total of $3350.

The difference in price is $3450 - $3350 = $100.

So Furniture United is $100 more expensive.

"Alright, let's break this down. Maria starts with 8 shares at $8 each, so that's 8 * $8 = $64.

The stock jumps up 50%, which is like adding half its value: $8 * 0.50 = $4. So now each share is worth $8 + $4 = $12.

But then it drops 25% the next year. That's a decrease of $12 * 0.25 = $3.  So each share ends up at $12 - $3 = $9.

Finally, her total value is 8 shares * $9/share = $72.

If two groups are the same size, and the third is 10 smaller, think of it like this:

*  Imagine the two bigger groups combined have 'x' students total.
* The smallest group has 'x - 10' students.
* All together, that's x + x + (x - 10) = 200 students.

Let's solve for x:

* 3x - 10 = 200
* 3x = 210
* x = 70

So, each of the bigger groups has 70 students. The smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can think of it like this:

* **Cows:** Let's say there are 'x' cows.
* **Chickens:** That means there are '2x' chickens.

Since he has 60 animals total, we can make an equation: x + 2x = 60

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 3x = 60.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 20. So there are 20 cows.

That means there are 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, let's count the legs!

* **Cows:** 20 cows * 4 legs each = 80 legs
* **Chickens:** 40 chickens * 2 legs each = 80 legs

Adding those together, all the animals have 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

* Red bird: 30 pounds (20 pounds less than the frog)

Adding up all the animals: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

"Let's break this down. The train travels 75 miles, then 100 miles, and then 125 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined first two distances) for a total of 300 miles per trip.  It does this three times a day, so that's 900 miles a day. To figure out how many days it takes to reach 18,000 miles, we divide: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

John's trip to his friend's house is 200 miles, but a detour adds 10 more miles, making it 210 miles total.  He drives that at 70 mph, so that part of the trip takes 3 hours (210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours).

The trip back home is 240 miles and he drives that at 80 mph, which also takes 3 hours (240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours).

Adding those times together, his whole trip took 6 hours.

"
"Hmm, let's see... there are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 are girls. That means there are 96 - 43 = 53 boys.  But 4 boys were absent, so there were 53 - 4 = 49 boys at school on Friday. 

49 

"
"Hey there! There are 6 girls, and twice that number of boys, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys.  That means there are 6 + 12 = 18 kids in the park.

"
"Let's break this down.  

We know 3 people got kicked out for not wearing masks. Four times that number, minus 5, were kicked out for shoplifting, so that's (3 * 4) - 5 = 7 shoplifters.

Then, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for fighting over deals, meaning 7 * 3 = 21 people.

In total, that's 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people kicked out for those reasons.

Since 50 people were kicked out in total, that means 50 - 31 = 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

"
"Let's figure out the total cost of the senior gifts.

*  First, the picture frames will cost 44 seniors * $20/frame = $880.
*  Etching adds 20% to each frame, so that's $20 * 0.20 = $4 per frame.  The total etching cost is 44 seniors * $4/frame = $176.
*  The pins for the two seniors will cost 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10.
*  There are 44 seniors / 4 = 11 officers who need cords. Those cords will cost 11 officers * $12/cord = $132.

Adding it all up: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"Let's break it down:

* Friday: 14 pairs sold
* Saturday: 14 * 2 = 28 pairs sold

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Half of Mary's sheep give 1 kg of milk each, and the other half give 2 kg each. So that's 15 sheep giving 1 kg and 15 sheep giving 2 kg. That means she gets 15 kg from the first group and 30 kg from the second group.  

Adding those together, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Karan borrowed $3650 for five months at 10% interest, and she pays the same amount each month, here's how to find her monthly payment:

First, we need to figure out the total interest. That's (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100, so it's ($3650 * 10 * 5) / 100 = $1825.

Next, we add the interest to the original amount: $3650 + $1825 = $5475.

Finally, divide the total amount by the number of months: $5475 / 5 = $1095.

So, Karan has to pay $1095 each month. 



"
"Let's figure this out! Cho hiked for 8 hours at 14 kilometers per hour, so he covered 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers. Chloe hiked for 5 hours at 9 kilometers per hour, meaning she hiked 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers.  Cho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

"Let's break this down. Millie makes 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup for $1, so she'll make $36 total.  

Since her supplies cost $18, her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

She sells 4 cups per hour, so her hourly profit is $18 / (36 cups / 4 cups/hour) = $2/hour.

"Hey there!  

If Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, that means the 12.8 hectares represent 2/5 of his original land. To find out how much he started with, we can set up a proportion:

(2/5) * Original Land = 12.8 hectares

To solve for the Original Land, we can divide both sides by (2/5):

Original Land = 12.8 hectares / (2/5) = 32 hectares

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

If the popsicle ratio is 5:6, that means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  

Think of it like groups. Each group has 5 + 6 = 11 popsicles.

They have a total of 165 popsicles, so there are 165 / 11 = 15 groups of popsicles.

Betty has 5 popsicles per group, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.

Sam has 6 popsicles per group, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

That means Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Tim ditches his $60 cable and goes for Netflix at $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus usually cost $10 each, but he snags a 20% discount for bundling them. That's a $4 discount ($20 total * 0.20 = $4).

So, the bundled Hulu and Disney Plus cost him $16 ($20 - $4 = $16).

Adding Netflix, his total streaming cost is $26 ($16 + $10 = $26).

By switching, Tim saves a sweet $34 each month ($60 - $26 = $34)!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

If Mel cuts back his AC use by 5 hours a day, he's saving 900 watts * 5 hours = 4500 watt-hours each day.  That's equal to 4.5 kilowatt-hours (since there are 1000 watts in a kilowatt).

Over 30 days, his savings add up to 4.5 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours.

Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. Then there's a zebra with 36 stripes and another with half that, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Adding them all up: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

Since there are 4 zebras, the average is 88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Tyson needs enough sandwiches for 20 people, and each sandwich feeds 4, so he'll need 5 sandwiches (20 / 4 = 5).

Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, meaning he'll need 5 pounds of each (5 sandwiches * 1 pound = 5 pounds).

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so that's $35.00 total (5 pounds * $7.00 = $35.00).

The cheese is $3.00 per pound, making the cheese cost $15.00 (5 pounds * $3.00 = $15.00).

Adding those together, Tyson will spend $50.00 on meat and cheese ($35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00).

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Allan starts with 40 cannolis and twice that amount in corn, which is 40 * 2 = 80 corns.

He then buys 60 more cannolis, bringing his total to 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

But he buys 40 fewer corns than his new cannoli total, meaning he gets 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Adding his original corn to his new corn, he has 80 + 60 = 140 corns.

Finally, adding all the cannolis and corn together, he has 140 + 100 = 240.

"Let's break this down. Toby has a 45-page book with 200 words per page, so that's 45 * 200 = 9000 words total.

He reads 300 words a minute, meaning it'll take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to finish.

Factoring in the 10-minute trip to the airport, he needs 30 + 10 = 40 minutes total.

Since he has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, he'll be 60 - 40 = 20 minutes early.

In June, they had 40 employees * (1/4) = 10 employees leave. That leaves 30 employees.

So, in June they paid 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = $72,000.

Adding those together, the total for both months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"Let's break this down. Joanne gets 30 apples from the tall trees and half that from the short trees, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister gets double the tall tree apples, meaning she gets 30 * 2 = 60 apples. She also gets triple the short tree apples, so that's 15 * 3 = 45 apples.  

Together, they got 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tall and short trees. That means Joanne got 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"Hey there! Let's break down Tom's trip.

He traveled 200 kilometers a day for the first four days, so that's 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of that distance, which is 800 * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.

He took a break for a day, so no kilometers there.

In the second week, he covered 300 kilometers each day for seven days, totaling 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Adding it all up: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers on his trip.

"Let's break this down. Kenny wants to buy a $100 ticket and has $50 left over for spending money, meaning he made $50 from selling his cards.

Since he sells each card for $1.50, he sold $50 / $1.50 = 33.33 cards.  He can't sell parts of cards, so he sold 33 cards.

He kept 1/3 of his cards and sold 2/3. If 33 cards represent 2/3 of his collection, then 33 cards / (2/3) = 49.5 cards is his total collection.  He can't have half a card, so he started with 50 cards.

"Let's figure this out!

First, Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions * 2 = 4 pounds of onions since he's doubling the recipe.

That'll cost him 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00.

The beef stock will cost 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00.

In total, his ingredients will cost $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

So, each serving will cost $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

First, we know the room is 3 yards long, which is the same as 9 feet (since there are 3 feet in a yard).

The area is 360 square feet, and we know area is length times width. So, to find the width, we divide the area by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now, to find the perimeter, we add up all the sides: 9 feet + 40 feet + 9 feet + 40 feet = 98 feet.

"Let's break this down. The oven heats the house up by 5 degrees each hour for 3 hours, so that's a total of 15 degrees warmer. That brings the temperature to 55 degrees.  Then the window cools things down by 2 degrees every 10 minutes, and it's open for 30 minutes, which is like three 10-minute chunks. So, the house cools down by 6 degrees.  That means the final temperature is 49 degrees. 



"
"Let's break this down.  

Jon's total time is 40 minutes + 80 minutes + 50 minutes = 170 minutes.

James is 10% faster swimming, so he takes 40 minutes * 0.90 = 36 minutes.

His bike time is 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 170 minutes - 10 minutes = 160 minutes.

That means James's run time is 160 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 39 minutes.

"
"Hmm, let me see... Movie C was 1.25 hours long, which is 75 minutes. Movie B was 5 minutes longer than that, so it was 80 minutes long.  Movie A was a quarter the length of Movie B, so it was 20 minutes long.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

The horse eats half a bale of hay for every mile it runs, and it runs 16 miles (32 MPH for half an hour). That means it eats 8 bales of hay (16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile).

Each bale costs $3, so the hay will cost $24 (8 bales * $3/bale). Michael has $30 (6 bills * $5/bill), so he'll have $6 left over after buying the hay ($30 - $24).

"Let's figure this out!

Joey starts with 214 points and gets 26 more, so he has 214 + 26 = 240 points.

Marcy starts with 225 points and gets 10 more, bringing her to 225 + 10 = 235 points.

To see how much Joey is winning by, we subtract Marcy's score from Joey's: 240 - 235 = 5 points.

"Let's break this down. First, we need to figure out how much each balloon cost originally. If 20 balloons cost $900, then each balloon cost $900 / 20 = $45.

After the price increase, each balloon costs $45 + $20 = $65.

Finally, to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons, we multiply the new price by the number of balloons: $65 * 170 = $11050.

"Hey there! To find the average speed, we gotta think about the total distance and the total time.  

The car went 120 miles in the first part and 30 miles in the second, for a total of 150 miles. It drove for 2 hours plus 1 hour, so 3 hours total.

Divide the total distance (150 miles) by the total time (3 hours) and you get 50 mph.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Bob's potting soil will cost.

First, we need to find the volume of one raised bed: 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.

Since he has 10 beds, the total volume needed is 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag holds 2 cubic feet, so he'll need 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Finally, at $12 per bag, the total cost will be 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, there are 15 red cards, and there are 60% more green cards than that. That means there are 15 * 0.60 = 9 more green cards.  

That gives us a total of 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Now, the yellow cards are the same amount as the red and green cards combined, so there are 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add up all the colors: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.

* Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
* Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, add it all up: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, so the farmer needs to make 4500 / 2250 = 2 trips.

"Let's figure out the cost of this anniversary trip!

First, the hotel is 20% more expensive than its usual $1500 per day because it's a busy weekend. That means the markup is $1500 * 0.20 = $300 per day.

So, the hotel costs $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Over three days, the hotel will cost $1800 * 3 = $5400.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and there are two of them, so that's $5000 * 2 = $10000.

Adding the hotel and plane ticket costs, the total trip cost is $5400 + $10000 = $15400.

We need to find the magic number of guests where both venues cost the same.

Venue 1 has a base cost of $200, plus $5 per guest for food. So the total cost there would be $200 + $5 times the number of guests.

Venue 2 is simpler – it's $25 per guest, and that includes food.

To find when they're equal, we set those two costs equal to each other and solve for the number of guests.

That means $200 + $5 times the number of guests equals $25 times the number of guests.

Solving that out, we find that 10 guests make the two venues cost the same.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If the house cost three times the lot, think of it like this: the lot is one part, and the house is three parts. That makes a total of four parts.

Since the whole thing costs $120,000, one part (the lot) is worth $120,000 / 4 = $30,000.

The house, being three parts, costs 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.

"Let's break this down. Tara bought 8 packs of bags, and each pack had 5 bags, so she had 8 * 5 = 40 bags total.

She spent $4 per bag, so her total cost was 40 * $4 = $160.

She sold each bag for $8, earning her 40 * $8 = $320.

Her profit is the difference between her earnings and her costs: $320 - $160 = $160.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

The computer cost $1100, and the printer cost $700 less, so the printer was $1100 - $700 = $400.

Together, the computer and printer cost $1100 + $400 = $1500.

That means the two monitors cost $2400 - $1500 = $900.

"Let's break this down.  If Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when it's cold, and it takes him twice that time plus 2 minutes when it's warm, that means he swims a mile in 34 minutes when it's warm (16 x 2 + 2 = 34).

So for 3 miles, in cold water, it takes him 48 minutes (16 x 3 = 48). In warm water, it takes him 102 minutes (34 x 3 = 102).

That means he takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day (102 - 48 = 54).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

So Alex invited 100 people, and each of them brings 2 friends, that's 100 * 2 = 200 friends.  

That's a total of 100 + 200 = 300 people from the emails.

Then she invites 10 more friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses, so that's another 8 people.

In total, Alex needs 300 + 10 + 8 = 318 seats.

"Let's break it down:

* The Dachshund weighs twice the Affenpinscher, so it weighs 10 pounds * 2 = 20 pounds.
* The Papillon weighs one-fourth the Dachshund, meaning it weighs 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds.
* Finally, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the Papillon, so it weighs 5 pounds * 44 = 220 pounds.

"Hey there!  Let's break this triangle problem down.

Think of the smallest angle as ""x"".  The next angle is double that, so it's ""2x"". The biggest angle is triple the smallest, making it ""3x"".

Since all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can write an equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining the 'x' terms gives us 6x = 180.

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 6, so x = 30.

The largest angle is 3x, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"Hey there!  

To figure this out, we need to find out how fast the plane is going. It travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so it's going 400 miles per hour (1200 / 3 = 400).

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

If the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that's 400 / 2 = 200 sets of 725 rotations. So, his tires rotate 200 * 725 = 145,000 times each month.

Each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement.  That means they'll last 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months.

That's 72 months / 12 months/year = 6 years. 

So the answer is 6. 

"
"Okay, so the shampoo bottle costs $24 and lasts for 120 washes if you use 2 pumps per wash.  If Jackie only uses 1 pump, the bottle will last twice as long, meaning she gets 120 washes * 2 = 240 washes.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we gotta see how much the clothes cost after the discount. The shirt is 30% off, so that's $25 * 0.30 = $7.50 off. The shorts are also 30% off, which is $35 * 0.30 = $10.50 off.

So the shirt costs $25 - $7.50 = $17.50, and the shorts cost $35 - $10.50 = $24.50.

That means the total cost is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00.

Since Joe started with $50, he'll have $50 - $42.00 = $8.00 left.

Now, to get her speed in Mb per hour, we need to do some more conversions. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. So, there are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 * 60 = 3600).

Finally, multiply her speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour: 0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour.

There are 7 days in a week, and it already towed for 3, leaving 7 - 3 = 4 days.

Alright, after some calculating, I've got the answer: 15 sheep. 



"
"Let's break this down. The fancy coffee costs 20% more than his usual $5 bag, so that's an extra dollar, making it $6 per pound. He needs 7 pounds for the week, so that's 7 * $6 = $42.  Don't forget the donut! That's another $2, bringing the grand total to $44. 


$44
"
"Let's see... Gus spent $20.00 total. The chips were $4.00, the chicken was $8.00, and the soda was $1.00.  That's $13.00 altogether. So the apple pie must have cost $7.00.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If James delivers 600 newspapers total and we know 198 go to District A and 209 go to District C, we can find out how many go to District B by subtracting those amounts from the total. 

600 - 198 - 209 = 193

So James delivers 193 newspapers to District B. 



"
"Let's break this down.  John's class is 4 times a week times 2 hours each, so that's 8 hours a week. Over 6 weeks, that's 8 times 6, or 48 hours total. Since he learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, he learns 48 divided by 1.5, which is 32 recipes.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

First, we gotta figure out how many math teachers there are. If 60% are history teachers, that means 40% are math teachers (100% - 60% = 40%). So, there are 150 teachers * 0.40 = 60 math teachers.

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours, so all the math teachers together sleep for 60 teachers * 6 hours/teacher = 360 hours.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we gotta see how much Kassidy has. Aurelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 of that, so Kassidy has (3/4) * $120 = $90.

Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so she has $90 + $60 = $150.

Altogether, they have $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.

If they split that evenly, each person gets $360 / 3 = $120.

"Let's break it down:

Each muffin needs 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons of dry ingredients.

For 16 muffins, Svetlana would need 8.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If they combine all their candy, they'd have 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds.  Since they're splitting it evenly, each person gets 12 / 3 = 4 pounds of candy.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Adam spent $3.50 on the type A candies and $7.50 on the type B candies, for a total of $11.00. Since he paid with $15.00, his change would be $4.00.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, and Janey has 21 books, we can set up an equation.  

Let 'x' be the number of books Sally has.  Twice the number of Sally's books is 2x, and Janey has 3 more than that, so 2x + 3 = 21.

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 18
x = 9

Sally has 9 books. 

"
"Hmm, let's see... the bamboo grows 30 inches a day and is currently 20 feet tall, which is 240 inches.  To reach 600 inches, it needs to grow another 360 inches (600 - 240 = 360).

That means it will take 12 days (360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days).

"
"Let's figure this out!

James starts with enough toys for 4 dogs, but then 8 more dogs arrive. That means he needs 8 more toys right away.

Then, the number of dogs doubles, so he needs toys for 16 more dogs! That's another 16 toys.

But wait, 3 dogs leave, so he doesn't need those toys anymore.  

So, he needed 8 + 16 = 24 toys, but then 3 dogs left, so he only needs 21 toys.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down. Dylan put in 2/5 of the $1200, which is $480. That leaves $720. Frances then put in 2/3 of that, which is another $480.  So, Skyler must have put in the rest: $1200 - $480 - $480 = $240.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Katarina has 68 cookies, and that's 5 less than Max. So Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, meaning he has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, giving her 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total, we add up everyone's cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.


298 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If the dress is 140cm long after adding 20cm of lace and extending the original length by 50%, we need to work backwards.

First, subtract the lace: 140cm - 20cm = 120cm. This 120cm represents 150% of the original length (100% + 50%).

To find the original length, divide 120cm by 1.50: 120cm / 1.50 = 80cm.


So the original dress was 80cm long. 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Since he mows the whole lawn in 60 minutes on turtle mode and 40 minutes on rabbit mode, half the lawn would take 30 minutes on turtle and 20 minutes on rabbit.

"
"Hmm, let's see... they've already walked for 6 minutes plus another 13, so that's 19 minutes total.  They have 30 minutes to get to school, so they have 30 minus 19 minutes left. That means they have 11 minutes left to get to school on time.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Catherine spends. 

* Apples cost $4.
* Bananas are $2 per kilo, and she buys 2 kilos, so that's $2 * 2 = $4.
* Oranges are $3 per kilo, and she gets 2 kilos, making it $3 * 2 = $6.

Adding it all up: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

Catherine pays $14 in total. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Celinda bakes double Greta's amount, so she bakes 30 * 2 = 60 cookies.  Together they baked 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. After snacking, they have 90 - 10 = 80 cookies left for the box.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

We know one twin is older than one of the triplets by 7 years.  If all their ages add up to 44, we can figure out how old the twin is.

Think of it like this:

* The triplets are all the same age, let's call that age ""r"".
* One twin is ""r + 7"" years old.
* The other twin is also ""r + 7"" years old.

So, the total age is: r + r + r + (r + 7) + (r + 7) = 44

That simplifies to 5r + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides: 5r = 30

Divide both sides by 5: r = 6

So, one of the triplets is 6 years old.

Since one twin is 7 years older than a triplet, that twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

"
"Hey there! Let's see... John has 3 hours, which is 180 minutes, before dinner. His homework takes 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes. That means he has 180 - 80 = 100 minutes to nap!

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, we figure out how much the lollipops cost: 5 lollipops * $0.40/lollipop = $2.00.

Then, we see how much the candies cost: $3.20 (total) - $2.00 (lollipops) = $1.20.

Each candy costs $1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30.

So, 10 lollipops would cost 10 lollipops * $0.40/lollipop = $4.00.

And 10 candies would cost 10 candies * $0.30/candy = $3.00.

Finally, 10 lollipops and 10 candies together would cost $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.


$7.00
"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Neil saves 2/5 * 20 coins = 8 more coins than Rong each month. That means Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Over ten years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.


5760 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

The vaccines cost $20 each, so that's $20 * 2 = $40. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total yet. Let's call the total cost ""x"". We know 0.60x = the cost of the heartworm check.

So, the total cost is $40 (vaccines) + the heartworm check.  That means x = $40 + 0.60x.

Solving for x, we get:

0.40x = $40
x = $100

That means the total bill is $100. Since John brought $125, he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"
"Hey there! Let's break down the cost of that fruit crate. 

Bananas are double the price of apples, so they're $0.50 * 2 = $1.00 each. Oranges are the priciest at three times the cost of a banana, making them $1.00 * 3 = $3.00 each.

That means the bananas cost 5 * $1.00 = $5.00, the apples cost 12 * $0.50 = $6.00, and the oranges cost 7 * $3.00 = $21.00.

Adding it all up, the crate costs $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Mia needs enough chairs for all the adults and babies.  She's got 8 high chairs, and since she has 5 times as many regular chairs, that's 8 * 5 = 40 regular chairs.  That's a total of 40 + 8 = 48 chairs.

But she's got 42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people coming!  So she needs 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam's 50 points, so she has 50 + (0.30 * 50) = 65 points.

Tom has 30 less points than Betty, putting him at 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected triple Tom's points, meaning she has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Adding up all their points, the class has 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 - 255 = 145 more points to reach their goal.

"
"Great Grandma Jones has a lot of great-grandbabies! Let's see... she has 3 kids, and each of them has 3 kids, so that's 9 grandkids.  And each of those grandkids has 3 babies, so that means there are 27 great-grandbabies.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Greta saves half her paycheck for retirement, which is $2400 / 2 = $1200. Then she spends 20% on her car, which is $2400 * 0.20 = $480.  That means she's spent a total of $1200 + $480 = $1680.  

So, she has $2400 - $1680 = $720 left over.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

The city is setting off a ton of fireworks: 15 boxes times 20 fireworks per box equals 300 fireworks. Hannah can see 40% of those, so that's 300 times 0.40, which equals 120 fireworks.

Hannah's also setting off her own show with 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, for a total of 15 fireworks.

Adding those together, Hannah will see 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks!

"Let's break this down!

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's 4000-pound truck, so Gordy can haul 4800 pounds.

Together, Gissela and Gordy can haul 4000 + 4800 = 8800 pounds.

That means Gary's truck must be able to haul 11600 - 8800 = 2800 pounds.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If each of the 6 girls ate 3 dumplings, they ate a total of 18 dumplings (6 x 3 = 18). The 8 guys each ate 1 more dumpling than the girls, so they each ate 4 dumplings (3 + 1 = 4). That means the guys ate a total of 32 dumplings (8 x 4 = 32).

To find the total, we add the dumplings the girls and guys ate: 18 + 32 = 50 dumplings.

Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings!

"Hey there! Let's break this down. If Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water and 80% of *that* water goes to industry, then the rest must be for other uses. That means 20% of the city's water is for non-industrial stuff.  Since they're using 40% of the total river water, they're using 8% of the river's water for non-industrial purposes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to see how much ice cream they make per hour. For chocolate, it's 100 quarts every 2 hours, so that's 50 quarts per hour. For vanilla, it's 50 quarts every 4 hours, which means they make 12.5 quarts per hour.

Together, they make 50 + 12.5 = 62.5 quarts per hour.

Now, in 48 hours, they'd make 62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts!

"Hey there! Let's figure out Marcus' bill. 

First, we gotta add up the cost of all the goodies:

* Cinnamon Rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
* Mini Quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
* Blueberry Muffins: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

That's a total of $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00 before his discount.

His loyalty card saves him 10%, so we take 10% of $50.00, which is $5.00.

Finally, we subtract the discount: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00


Marcus' total bill is $45.00.

That means Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

Amy has 58 - 44 = 14 more pieces than Ginger.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, James spent $20 to get in and then $1.50 for every pound of blueberries. Since he got 30 pounds, that's 30 * $1.50 = $45 just for the blueberries.  

Adding the entry fee, his total cost was $45 + $20 = $65.

If he bought them at the store, it would have cost him $2.50 a pound, so that's 30 * $2.50 = $75.

He saved $75 - $65 = $10 by picking his own blueberries.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, we gotta figure out how many inches are in Topher's shoe.  Since there are 12 inches in a foot, his 8-foot shoe is 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Add the extra 4 inches, and that's a whopping 100 inches long!

Now, let's call the length of Bobby's shoe ""x"". The problem says Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe, so we can write that as an equation: 100 = 9x + 10

To solve for x, we subtract 10 from both sides: 90 = 9x

Finally, divide both sides by 9: x = 10

So, Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long.

"Okay, let's break this down. Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars, which is 64 cars / 4 = 16 cars. Since each student car has 4 windows, that's 16 cars * 4 windows/car = 64 windows.

She also smashes 3/4 of the teachers' cars, which is 32 cars * (3/4) = 24 cars. With 2 windows per teacher car, that's 24 cars * 2 windows/car = 48 windows.

In total, Hannah smashes 64 windows + 48 windows = 112 windows.

"Let's break it down:

* Her math and science books together weigh 2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds.
* Her history book is double the weight of her English book, so it weighs 3 pounds * 2 = 6 pounds.
*  Adding up all the books: 4 pounds + 4 pounds + 3 pounds + 6 pounds = 17 pounds.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Candidate B got 50% more votes than Candidate A, who got 20%. That means Candidate B got 20 + (50/100)*20 = 30% of the votes.

Together, Candidates A and B got 20% + 30% = 50% of the votes.

That leaves 100% - 50% = 50% of the votes for Candidate C.

Since there were 100 voters, Candidate C got 50% of 100, which is 50 votes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Beck starts with 100 - 23 = 77 apples. After Boris gives him 10, Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples. Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples left.

That means Boris has 90 - 87 = 3 more apples than Beck.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Clara has 20 books, and that's twice the number Steven has. So Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, meaning she has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, 10 students like baking, 5 like basketball, and the rest like video games or music. We know the music lovers are double the basketball fans, meaning 5 * 2 = 10 students like music.

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down. If each class has the same number of students and there are 80 total, that means there are 40 students in each class.  Since 40% are girls, that's 16 girls per class (40 * 0.40 = 16).  

That leaves 24 boys in each class (40 - 16 = 24).

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Jake's family can save.

At the first park, two adults would cost 2 * $26 = $52, and two kids would cost 2 * $12 = $24. That's a total of $52 + $24 = $76.

At the second park, two adults would cost 2 * $14 = $28, and two kids would cost 2 * $10 = $20.  That's a total of $28 + $20 = $48.

The family would save $76 - $48 = $28 by going to the second park.

"Let's break it down:

He saves $0.10 per tomato with the new vendor.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Candy rents out 60 chairs per day on weekdays (that's 5 days a week) so that's 60 * 5 = 300 chairs.

On weekends, she rents out 100 chairs per day for 2 days, totaling 100 * 2 = 200 chairs.

So, each week she rents out 300 + 200 = 500 chairs.

In a month with 4 weeks, she'd rent out 500 * 4 = 2000 chairs.

Over two months, that's 2000 * 2 = 4000 chairs.

* Then Arnold sneaks another 12, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.
* Finally, Gunther adds 6 more, for a total of 37 + 6 = 43 bananas. 


Gunther finds 43 bananas.

"Alright, let's break this sticker and button trade down. 

Lorraine starts with a lot of stickers! She's got 30 small ones and 40 big ones.  She trades most of her small stickers for big buttons – 90% of them, which is 27.  Those 27 small stickers get her 9 big buttons (since each small sticker is worth one small button, and 27 small buttons equal 9 big buttons).

Then, she trades half of her big stickers for more big buttons. That's 20 big stickers, giving her another 20 big buttons.

She still has 20 big stickers left, and she trades those for small buttons. Each big sticker gets her 3 small buttons, so that's 60 more small buttons!

Let's add up all her buttons: 9 big buttons + 20 big buttons + 60 small buttons = 107 buttons!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, 11 kids need extra-small shirts. Twice that many, or 11 * 2 = 22 kids, need small shirts.

Four less than the number needing small shirts need medium, so that's 22 - 4 = 18 kids.

Half as many kids need large shirts as medium, meaning 18 / 2 = 9 kids need large shirts.

Finally, 6 more kids need extra-large shirts than large shirts, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 kids.

Adding all those up: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts.

Krissa needs to order 75 shirts.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If the third house needs double the first, and all three houses need 250 cases total, we can break it down:

* Let's say the second house needs 'x' cases of shingles.
* The first house needs half of that, so x/2 cases.
* The third house needs double the first, meaning x cases.

That means the total is x/2 + x + x = 250 cases.

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 2.5x = 250.

Dividing both sides by 2.5, we find that x = 100.

So, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  Mike's got a big movie collection!

So, a third of his 600 movies are in series, which is 200 movies. Since he can get those as a bundle for a discount, they'll cost him $666.67 (200 movies * ($10 * (1/3))).

That leaves him with 400 movies that aren't in a series.  Of those, 40% are older movies, so that's 160 older movies. Those will cost him $800 (160 movies * $5).

That means he has 240 newer movies left, which will cost him $2400 (240 movies * $10).

Adding it all up, replacing his whole collection will cost Mike $3866.67.

"Hmm, let's see... Dale started with 100 candies, but then sold 150. That means he needs more candy! He ordered another 100, so now he has 200 total. Since he already sold 150, he still needs to sell 50 more.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

If the student population doubles every month, here's how it grows:

* Starting with 10 students, they double to 20 at the end of January.
* Then to 40 at the end of February, 80 at the end of March, 160 at the end of April, and finally 320 at the end of May.

That means 310 extra students joined by the end of May!

"
"Let's break this down. Felix made $105 and charges $0.25 per branch. That means he climbed $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches. If he worked 5 days, he climbed an average of 420 branches / 5 days = 84 branches per day.

"Let's see... she picks a bunch of flowers, huh?  

Okay, so first she has 3 flowers with 5 petals each, that's 3 times 5, which is 15 petals. Then she gets 4 flowers with 6 petals, so that's 4 times 6, or 24 petals.  Then 5 flowers with 4 petals each, so 5 times 4 is 20 petals. And finally, 6 flowers with 7 petals each, which is 6 times 7, or 42 petals.

That's a lot of petals!  

So in total, before she drops any, she has 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 petals, which is 101 petals. But she drops one of each kind, so that's 5 petals gone.

That means she has 101 - 5 = 96 petals left in the vase.

"
"Hmm, let's see... they started with 35 marshmallows and used 18 to make their s'mores.  They also lost 3, so that's 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.  Since each s'more needs one marshmallow, they can each have 14 / 2 = 7 more s'mores!

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His buddies who aren't as good only get 10 minutes per quarter, and the really good one gets 30 minutes.  They play for 4 hours straight, which is 240 minutes.

So, Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

The not-so-good friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, and since there are two of them, that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters total.

The really good friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

Adding it all up, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

That means they spend 68 * $0.25 = $17.00 at the arcade. 


$17.00
"
"Let's break this down.  If she uses the same amount of zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar, those pairs add up to be equal. Let's call that amount ""y"".  Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the oil is ""2y"".

So, the total is: y + y + 2y + 2y = 10 ounces

That means 6y = 10 ounces

So, y = 10/6 = 1.67 ounces (approximately)

Since oil is 2y, she uses 2 * 1.67 = 3.33 ounces of oil.



Answer: 3.33

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  John bought 3 goats at $500 each, so that's 3 * $500 = $1500. He also got 2 cows for $1500 each, meaning those cost 2 * $1500 = $3000.  Adding those together, he spent a total of $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Joe has twice the cars Robert has, and Robert has 20. So Joe starts with 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

He sells 20% of those, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.

Then he gives his mom twice that amount, so 2 * 8 = 16 cars go to his mom.

In total, he gives away 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

That leaves Joe with 40 - 24 = 16 cars.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If the charity got $50,000 from organizations, that means the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.  Since there are 20 students, each student raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250. 


$6,250
"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day and half that time, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours, on the second day.  That means she walked a total of 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she walked for 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.


720

"Let's break this down. In the first game, Julie scored 4 less than Sasha's 14 points, so she scored 10 points.  In the second game, Sasha scored 6 less than Julie's first game score, meaning she scored 4 points.  Adding up Sasha's scores from both games, we get 14 + 4 = 18 points.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Kimberly bought a bunch of cat food tins (8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins) and dog food tins (6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins).  To find the difference, we subtract: 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins.

So Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Hey there! This sounds like a tricky card problem. Let me see...

Okay, so PJ has some cards, Smendrick has three times that amount, and Becca has 12 more than Smendrick.  

If we think of PJ's cards as ""x"", then Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards.  

All those cards together add up to 341. So, x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Let's solve that!

* Combine the 'x' terms: 7x + 12 = 341
* Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329
* Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

That means PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards.

And Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards!

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Cindy had 5 green eggs, and twice that many blue ones, so she had 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs. She had one less pink egg than blue eggs, meaning she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.  Adding them all up, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.

"Let's figure out how much Milly loses on this boring book.

First, the shipping cost based on weight is $0.35 per pound times 4 pounds, which is $1.40. Then, the shipping cost per mile is $0.08 per mile times 20 miles, making it $1.60.  Adding those together, the total shipping cost is $3.00.

Amazon will only give Milly back 75% of the $32 price, so her refund is $24.00.

Finally, to find her total loss, we subtract the refund and shipping from the original price: $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Boris makes 8000 bars in the first week. In the second week, he makes half of that, which is 4000 bars. In the third week, he makes three times the amount from the first week, so that's 8000 * 3 = 24000 bars.

That's a total of 8000 + 4000 + 24000 = 36000 bars for the first three weeks.

He wants to make 50000 bars total, so in the fourth week he needs to make 50000 - 36000 = 14000 bars.

"Hey! Let's figure this out. 

Britany makes 18 videos a week, and each one is 4 minutes long, so that's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes on videos.

She also spends 2 hours, or 120 minutes, writing songs.

And her makeup takes 15 minutes a day for 6 days, so that's 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

In total, that's 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes per week on TikTok.

Over a month with 4 weeks, she spends 282 * 4 = 1128 minutes.

That's 1128 / 60 = 18.8 hours on TikTok each month.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Pompei lifts a measly 1 inch. Saskay is a beast and lifts 12 times that, so Saskay lifts 12 inches. Kagiyami is even stronger, lifting 4 times what Saskay can, meaning Kagiyami lifts 48 inches. Now, Naruto is the strongest of them all, lifting 10 times what Kagiyami can, so Naruto lifts a whopping 480 inches!

But we need to know how high that is in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Mason travels 8 miles every hour.  He bikes for 4 hours, then rests, and then bikes for another 6 hours.  

So, for the first part of his trip, he covers 8 * 4 = 32 miles.

Then, for the second part, he covers 8 * 6 = 48 miles.

In total, he bikes 32 + 48 = 80 miles.

"Hey there! This is a tricky one. Let me see...

If three kangaroos take 18 hours, that means one kangaroo would take 54 hours to cross the whole highway.  Since turtles are slower, it'll take them longer.  

If a turtle is half as fast as a kangaroo, it would take twice as long, right? So one turtle would take 108 hours. But we have four turtles, so they'd be four times faster than one turtle.

Hmm, so four turtles would take 108 hours divided by 4... which is 27 hours!

* Glue stick 1 has 5/6 left, so that's (5/6) * 12 mm = 10 mm unused.
* Glue stick 2 has 1/3 left, so that's (1/3) * 12 mm = 4 mm unused.
* Glue stick 3 has 1/2 left, so that's (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm unused.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Julie sold 14 glasses and the boys sold the same amount, that means each boy sold 32 total glasses - 14 glasses (Julie) = 18 glasses / 2 boys = 9 glasses.

So Julie sold 14 glasses - 9 glasses (Micah) = 5 more glasses than Micah.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Iris spent $100 on her manicure (since that's a quarter of her hair cost). Her pedicure cost $75 (three-quarters of the manicure price).  Adding it all up, she spent $400 + $100 + $75 = $575 at the spa.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much money Kelly has left. 

First, each pack of chicken costs $2 since the bacon costs $10 for 5 packs, and each chicken pack is twice the price. That means the chicken costs $24 in total (6 packs * $4/pack).

Apples are half the price of strawberries, so they cost $2 per pack.  That makes the apples $14 total (7 packs * $2/pack).

The strawberries cost $12 (3 packs * $4/pack).

Adding it all up, Kelly's groceries cost $60 ($10 + $24 + $12 + $14).

Since she has a $65 budget, she has $5 left over ($65 - $60).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual ones plus a 15-minute encore, and the whole thing is 65 minutes, we can work backwards.  

First, take away the encore time: 65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes.

That 50 minutes is double the length of her usual concert. So, divide that in half: 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. They make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday and Wednesday, so that's 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas. On Friday, they make double the amount from Tuesday, which is 125 * 2 = 250 chimichangas.  

Adding all three days together, they make 250 + 250 = 500 chimichangas.

"
"Hey there! This is a bit of a tricky one.  Let's see... if 20% of the microphones don't fit, that means 80% do.  So 80% of 50 microphones is 40 microphones. Since each pair needs two microphones, he could make 20 pairs.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Jerry sees 6 birds in the bushes, then 2/3 of that number flying, which is 4 birds. He also spots 3 groups of 8 birds eating, so that's 24 birds.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  The daisies have way more petals than the orchids.  

The orchids have 5 petals each, and Joelle has 5 of them, so that's 5 * 5 = 25 petals.

The daisies have 10 petals each, and she has 4, so that's 10 * 4 = 40 petals.

The daisies have 40 - 25 = 15 more petals than the orchids.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, Mrs. Smith has 100 plants. A quarter of them are indoors, which is 25 plants (100 / 4 = 25). That leaves 75 plants (100 - 25 = 75).

Two-thirds of those are outdoor plants, so that's 50 plants (75 x (2/3) = 50).

That means the rest, 25 plants, must be flowering plants (75 - 50 = 25).

To find the percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

"Let's break this down. The whatchamacallit is super speedy at 121 meters per second, and it spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. That means the thingamabob spins at 121 meters per second / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now, the whirligig is a real speed demon, spinning 5 times faster than the thingamabob. So, the whirligig spins at 11 meters per second * 5 = 55 meters per second.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Ellen's yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.  Her salad and yogurt together cost $6 + $3 = $9. That means her carrots cost $11 - $9 = $2. Since she buys two carrots, each one costs $2 / 2 = $1.

"
"Hey there! This problem is a bit tricky because we don't know exactly how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.  

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times. That means she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid her $6 each time, she made $6x from mowing his lawn. Kamala paid her $18x (3x times * $6), and Alba paid her $30x (5x times * $6).

In total, Tasha made $54x from mowing lawns ($6x + $18x + $30x).

To figure out how much she made from lemonade, we'd subtract her mowing earnings from her total earnings: $80 - $54x.

Without knowing how many times she mowed Joe's lawn ('x'), we can't get an exact number for her lemonade earnings.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Carl weighs 16 kg more than Martin, so he weighs 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg.

Christian weighs 8 kg more than Carl, making him 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg.

Finally, Harry weighs 5 kg less than Christian, so he weighs 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.

Jo needs 0.5 yards of material per small mask (2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards/mask) and 0.75 yards per large mask (2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards/mask).

That means for 20 small masks, she'll need 10 yards (20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards) and for 8 large masks, she'll need 6 yards (8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards).

In total, Jo needs 16 yards of material (10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we gotta find out how many calories are in each mini pastry. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini one has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini one has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's multiply to find the total calories for each type:

* Cinnamon rolls: 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories
* Blueberry muffins: 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories

Finally, add those together to get the total calories for all the pastries: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

We know Peter, Paul, and Jean's ages add up to 100.  Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is the same as Paul's age plus John's age.

To find Peter's age, we can think like this:

*  Let's say John is ""J"" years old.
*  Paul is 10 years older, so Paul is ""J + 10"" years old.
*  Peter's age is Paul's age plus John's age, so Peter is ""J + (J + 10)"" years old, which simplifies to ""2J + 10"".

Now, we know all their ages add up to 100:

J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100

Combining like terms: 4J + 20 = 100

Subtracting 20 from both sides: 4J = 80

Dividing both sides by 4: J = 20

So John is 20 years old.

Now we can find Peter's age:

Peter = 2J + 10 = (2 * 20) + 10 = 50

Peter is 50 years old.

The Widgeteer 3000 would make 1440 widgets a day (60 x 24) and 43,200 widgets a month (1440 x 30). The WidgetMaster 9000 would make 1080 widgets a day (45 x 24) and 32,400 widgets a month (1080 x 30).

Since each widget sells for $6, the Widgeteer 3000 would earn $259,200 a month (43,200 x 6) and the WidgetMaster 9000 would earn $194,400 a month (32,400 x 6).

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, James spent 10 CDs * $15/CD = $150 on the CDs.

Then, he got a sweet 40% discount, so he saved $150 * 0.40 = $60.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Bahati scored the most and had 20 more points than Azibo, and 10 more than Dinar, we can use some algebra to solve for Azibo's points.

Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points. That means Bahati scored x + 20 points, and Dinar scored x + 10 points.

Since their total score is 45, we can write the equation: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms, we get 3x + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us 3x = 15

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 5.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Jonathan has 24 cups (two dozen). Since he has 2/3 the number of spoons as cups, he starts with 16 spoons (2/3 * 24 = 16). After giving Pedro 6 spoons, he has 10 left (16 - 6 = 10).  In total, he has 34 utensils (24 cups + 10 spoons = 34).

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, we figure out how many beds are full to start: 1000 beds * (1/5) = 200 beds.

That means there are 1000 beds - 200 beds = 800 beds empty.

Over two weeks, they get 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 new patients.

So now there are 200 beds + 700 patients = 900 occupied beds.

Finally,  1000 beds - 900 beds = 100 unoccupied beds left.

"Let's break it down:

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 are for work. That leaves 16 - 7 = 9 emails for family and her boyfriend.

Two-thirds of those 9 emails go to family, which is 9 * (2/3) = 6 emails.

That means 9 - 6 = 3 emails are for her boyfriend.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  If the supplies cost $400 and the tickets cost 50% more, that means the tickets cost an extra $200 (because 50% of $400 is $200).  So, the total cost of travel is $400 + $200 = $600.

"Hey there! This Pokemon problem is tricky, but I think I can crack it. Let's see...

If we call the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught ""A"", Stan caught ""S"", and Alex caught ""X"", we can set up some equations.

We know:

* Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch: S = 4A - 13
* Alex caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
* Together they caught 339: A + S + X = 339

Let's use substitution to solve for S.  Since we want to find S, let's plug the first two equations into the third:

A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339

Simplifying that gives us:

9A - 21 = 339

Adding 21 to both sides:

9A = 360

Dividing both sides by 9:

A = 40

Now we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon. Let's plug that back into the equation for S:

S = 4(40) - 13

S = 160 - 13

S = 147

So Stan caught 147 Pokemon!

* Finally, she flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, covering 110 miles (5 * 22 = 110).

To find the total distance between her homes, we need to consider her net southward movement: 300 miles (south) - 36 miles (north) + 110 miles (south) = 374 miles.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to know how many plants will fit in Pat's flower bed.  Since each plant needs 12 inches and there's 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between each one, that's a total of 30 inches per plant.  

Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long, which is 1332 inches. So, she can fit 1332 inches / 30 inches per plant = 44.4 plants. Since she can't buy parts of plants, she can fit 44 plants.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more plants.

Each plant costs $6, so she'll spend 27 plants * $6/plant = $162 at the store.

"Hey there! Let's crack this age puzzle.

We know Helene is twice the average age of the group, and the total age of all four kids is 20.  Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4, so let's add those up: 3 + 4 = 7.

That means Helene and Wilfred's ages combined must equal 20 - 7 = 13. Since Helene is twice the average age (which is 20 / 4 = 5), Helene is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

"Alright, let's figure this out. 

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 / 4 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she pumped 4500 * (3/4) = 3375 gallons.

That's a total of 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons on the first day.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her first day's amount, which is 4500 * (2/3) = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her first day's amount, which is 3375 * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

That's another 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons on the second day.

There are 60 questions total, and 40% are easy, so that's 60 * 0.40 = 24 easy questions. The rest, 36 questions, are split evenly between average and difficult, meaning there are 18 of each.

Aries gets 75% of the easy ones right, so that's 24 * 0.75 = 18 easy questions correct. She gets half of the average and difficult ones right, so that's 9 correct for each type.

In total, she's sure to get 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, and small ones cost $4, the large ones cost $12.

She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Her earnings from large stuffed animals would be 12x, and from small stuffed animals, it would be 8x (since 2x small stuffed animals * $4 each = 8x).

In total, she made $120, so 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find that x = 6.

Since she sold 2x small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"Alright, let's break this down. One dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which means they mine 24 pounds * 1.50 = 36 pounds a day.  

Over a month, that's 36 pounds/day * 30 days = 1080 pounds.

With 40 dwarves, that's a whopping 1080 pounds/dwarf * 40 dwarves = 43200 pounds!

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  Since the prices are proportional, we know each sandwich costs the same amount no matter how many are in the package.  

The 4-sandwich package for $6 tells us each sandwich costs $1.50.  So, an 8-sandwich package would cost 8 * $1.50 = $12.00.

"Let's break this down step by step. First, 40% of the red balloons popped, which is 25 * 0.40 = 10 balloons. That leaves Sally with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Then, she loses half her yellow balloons, meaning she loses 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. She has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Next, she finds 8 blue balloons and keeps 75% of them, which is 8 * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons.

Finally, she has 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 balloons when she gets to school.

"Let's see... 6000 seats total, minus 950 for the grads and 300 for the teachers leaves 4750 seats for everyone else.  If they split those evenly between the 950 grads, that means each grad gets 5 tickets.

"Let's break this down. Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so that's 6 * 3 = 18 hours total.

She earns $15 per day, so over three days she makes $15 * 3 = $45.

Parking costs her $3 per day, for a total of $3 * 3 = $9.

Subtracting her parking costs from her earnings, she nets $45 - $9 = $36.

Finally, to find her hourly rate after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total hours worked: $36 / 18 = $2 per hour.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

Jim needs the fabric to be bigger than the bed on all sides, so we add 2 feet to both the length and width. That makes the fabric 10 feet long (6 + 2 + 2) and 12 feet wide (8 + 2 + 2).

To find the total fabric needed, we multiply the length and width: 10 feet * 12 feet = 120 square feet.

Monday they delivered 425 letters. Tuesday they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's amount, so that's 425 / 5 = 85 letters, plus 17 more, for a total of 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

Wednesday they delivered 5 more than twice the amount from Tuesday, so that's (102 * 2) + 5 = 209 letters.

* On the second race, he won twice the amount he lost on the first race plus $1, so he won (2 * $5) + $1 = $11.
* On the third race, he lost 1.5 times the amount he won on the second race, meaning he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.
* In total, he lost $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.
* His average loss per race is $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.

"Hmm, let me see... 26 countries, 5 cities per country, and 1000 people in each city...  That's a lot of people!

Okay, so 5 cities * 1000 people/city = 5000 people per country.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If we call the first person's share ""x"", the second person got x + $80, and the third person got 2 * (x + $80).  

All together, that's x + (x + $80) + 2x + $160 = $1920

Combining the 'x' terms and the dollar amounts, we get 4x + $240 = $1920

Subtracting $240 from both sides gives us 4x = $1680

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that x = $420.

So the first person's share was $420.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Betsy took longer than Donovan, and their times add up to 98 minutes, we need to find the difference.  

Think of it like this:

* Donovan's time + Betsy's time = 98 minutes
* Betsy's time = Donovan's time + 18 minutes

Let's say Donovan took 'x' minutes. That means Betsy took 'x + 18' minutes.

So, x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining those 'x's, we get 2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So Donovan took 40 minutes.

Betsy took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

Since the theater costs $125 for the first 20 people, and Kayla has 41 guests, she'll need to pay extra for 41 - 20 = 21 people. That's 21 * $6 = $126 extra.

"Hey there! This is a tricky one, but I think I can figure it out.  Let's see... if the Allosaurus ate 270 kg, and that was half of what was left after the velociraptors had their fill, then there must have been 270 kg * 2 = 540 kg before the velociraptors showed up.

And since the 540 kg was only half of what the T-Rex left behind, the triceratops must have started with 540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg of meat! 

1080 

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Two walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so that's 10 * 8 = 80 square feet each.  That's 80 * 2 = 160 square feet total for those walls.

The other two walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so 5 * 8 = 40 square feet each. That's 40 * 2 = 80 square feet total.

Adding those together, the whole room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

At $12 a gallon, that'll cost 12 * $12 = $144.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

The faster train covers 60 miles every hour, so in three hours, it'll be 60 * 3 = 180 miles away from the station.

The slower train travels at half the speed, meaning it goes 30 miles per hour. In three hours, it'll be 30 * 3 = 90 miles from the station.

Since they're traveling in opposite directions, we add their distances to find how far apart they are: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to know how many days Billy is actually working. There are 31 days in March plus 19 in April, for a total of 50 days. He takes 20% of those days off, which is 50 * 0.20 = 10 days. That means he works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Since he helps 2 people per hour and works 3 hours a day, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people each day.

Over 40 days, he helps a total of 40 * 6 = 240 people.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If each bus held 35 people and there were 12 buses, that's 35 * 12 = 420 people.

Then, with 20 cars holding 3 people each, that's another 20 * 3 = 60 people.

Adding those together, there were 420 + 60 = 480 people at the wedding.

"Hmm, let's see... the big slide is 300 feet long and you go 60 feet per minute, so that's 300 divided by 60... which is 5 minutes. The smaller slide is 240 feet long and you zoom down at 80 feet per minute, so that's 240 divided by 80... which is 3 minutes.  

So the big slide takes 2 minutes longer. 



"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day, so that's 30 + (15 * 2) = 60 minutes of breaks daily.

Over five days, that adds up to 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes.

Converting that to hours, we get 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Micah ran 3.5 times Amber's distance, so he ran 3.5 * 8 miles = 28 miles. Together, Amber and Micah ran 8 miles + 28 miles = 36 miles.  That means Ahito ran 52 miles - 36 miles = 16 miles.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Sheila's credit card balance.

First, she returns that $15 item, so her balance goes down to $85 - $15 = $70.

Then she gets a frying pan for $20, but it's 20% off, so that's $20 * 0.20 = $4 off. The pan actually costs $20 - $4 = $16.

The towels are $30, but they're 10% off, which is $30 * 0.10 = $3 off. So the towels cost $30 - $3 = $27.

Adding those new purchases to her balance, we get $70 + $16 + $27 = $113.


Sheila's new credit card balance is $113.00. 

"
"Hmm, let's see... if 6 jellyfish changed color and that's only a third of the big ones, then there must be 6 * 3 = 18 big jellyfish.  And since those are only a fifth of the total, there must be 18 * 5 = 90 jellyfish in the tank!

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Lauren wants to live on 40% of her $100,000 salary during retirement, which is $40,000 per year.  Since she wants to retire for 20 years, she'll need a total of $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

She saves 20% of her salary each year, which is $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000. To reach her goal of $800,000, she'll need to save for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Soledad wants to hike a whopping 9300 miles in June. If she hikes 125 miles twice a day, that's 250 miles per day. Over 30 days, that's 7500 miles (250 miles/day * 30 days).  

She needs to hike 1800 more miles (9300 miles - 7500 miles). To do that in June, she needs to add 60 miles to her daily hikes (1800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day).

So, they've got 3 red balls at $9 each, that's 3 * $9 = $27.

Then there are 11 blue balls at $5 each, so that's 11 * $5 = $55.

Finally, 25 green balls at $3 each, which is 25 * $3 = $75.

Add it all up: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The store will have made $157 after selling all the balls.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

John drives 2 hours each way at 70 mph, so that's 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles one way.  Since it's a round trip, he drives 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles each visit.

He visits twice a month, so he drives a total of 280 miles/visit * 2 visits/month = 560 miles.

"Let's break this down. Sofie walks 10 miles a day for 7 days, meaning she'll walk a total of 70 miles (10 * 7 = 70). Brian walks half the distance Sofie does, so he'll walk 35 miles (70 / 2 = 35).

"
"Let's break this down.  

The first two workers make 6 toys an hour each, so together they make 12 toys an hour.  The other two workers make 4 toys an hour each, for a total of 8 toys an hour. That means those four workers make 20 toys an hour combined (12 + 8 = 20).

Over 10 hours, they make 200 toys (20 toys/hour * 10 hours). Since they needed to make 400 toys and still need 20 more, they've made 380 toys so far (400 - 20 = 380).

That means the fifth worker made 180 toys (380 - 200 = 180) over the 10-hour shift.

So, the fifth worker makes 18 toys an hour (180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour).

"Let's break this down!

John has 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces of M&Ms.

Since each ounce has 30 M&Ms, he has a total of 30 ounces * 30 M&Ms/ounce = 900 M&Ms.

If he puts 10 M&Ms in each small bag, he can make 900 M&Ms / 10 M&Ms/bag = 90 small bags.

Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30.  That means Sarah painted 9 eggs (30 - 12 = 18, then 18 / 2 = 9). Camden painted 21 eggs (9 + 12 = 21).

Arnold and Madeline painted the same amount, and together they painted 26 eggs (56 total eggs - 30 = 26). So, Arnold painted 13 eggs (26 / 2 = 13).

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold (21 - 13 = 8).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Nik has a lot of crayons!  Since each box holds 8 crayons and he has 200 crayons, he'll need 25 boxes (200 / 8 = 25). That's also 200 ounces of crayons (200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon).

The boxes themselves weigh 200 ounces too (25 boxes * 8 ounces per box).

So, all together, that's 400 ounces (200 crayons + 200 boxes).

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 25 pounds (400 / 16 = 25).

"Let's break this down! Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We know she spends 40 minutes on the beach, so we can figure out her beach speed.

Since she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, her beach speed is 2 miles / (40 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 3 miles per hour.

On the sidewalk, she walks twice as fast, so her sidewalk speed is 3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

It takes her 1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hour to walk on the sidewalk. That's equal to 10 minutes.

Adding up the time on the beach and the sidewalk, her total walking time is 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Melanie's dad starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.  Over three weeks, he gets 20 cows a day from Milkie Cows Limited, which is 20 * 7 * 3 = 420 cows. He also gets 10 chickens a day from Broilers Limited, so that's 10 * 7 * 3 = 210 chickens.

That means he has 50 + 420 = 470 cows and 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

In total, he has 470 + 230 = 700 animals on the farm.

Those 4 packs would normally cost $40, but he gets a 10% discount, which is $4.00 off. That means he pays $40 - $4 = $36 for all the bagels.

To find the price per bagel, we divide the total cost by the number of bagels: $36 / 36 = $1.00 per bagel.

So, the ratio of men to women is 5:9, meaning for every 5 men, there are 9 women.  That makes a total of 14 parts.

If there are 84 passengers in total, each ""part"" of the ratio represents 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers.

That means there were initially 9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women on the bus.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 women - 20 women = 34 women left.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Faraday makes $2 per sunflower and $8 per bouquet. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, that means he makes $8 / 12 = $0.67 per sunflower in a bouquet.

So, he makes a total of $2 + $0.67 = $2.67 per sunflower each day.

Over 3 days, he'd make $2.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

He earned $26 from individual sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over 3 days.

That means he sold $82 / $2.67 per sunflower = 30.67 sunflowers. Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, he sold 30 sunflowers.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to see how much energy 2300 people need in total. That's 2300 people * 100% = 230,000% of daily energy.

Right now, Hortex can cover 4200 bottles * 20% = 84,000% of daily energy needs.

To find the difference, we subtract: 230,000% - 84,000% = 146,000%.

Since each bottle covers 20% of the daily need, they'd need to produce 146,000% / 20% = 7300 more bottles.

Cole started with 3 dozen, which is 36 eggs.  That means there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hiding!

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, we gotta figure out how many apartments are in the biggest complex. The first two have 200 each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The last one is 60% bigger than that, so it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments. That means the biggest complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's add up all the apartments: 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

He collects from each place three times a week, so that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 collections.

Finally, he makes $0.40 per collection, so he earns 4320 * $0.40 = $1728.00 a week.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, the avocado tree's fruit production goes like this:

* Year 5: 50 fruits
* Year 6: 50 * 3 = 150 fruits
* Year 7: 50 * 7 = 350 fruits
* Year 8:  We know a 10-year-old tree makes 20 times the initial amount, which is 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits. An 8-year-old makes 200 less than that, so 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
* Year 9: No fruits
* Year 10: 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits

Adding all those up: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = 2350 fruits

That avocado tree can produce a whopping 2350 fruits in 10 years!

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope.  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, and all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long.

To find the red rope's length, we need to figure out the length of each rope.  

Think of it like this:

* If the blue rope is 'b' centimeters long, the red rope is '4b' centimeters long.
* The yellow rope is 'b + 7' centimeters long.

Now, let's add up the lengths:  b + 4b + (b + 7) = 37

Combining like terms, we get 6b + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides: 6b = 30

Divide both sides by 6: b = 5

So, the blue rope is 5 centimeters long.

Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, the red rope is 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

"Let's break this down. Rissa had three times the amount Ronnie had, so she started with $5 * 3 = $15.  

After giving some money to their sister, Rissa has 4/5 of her money left. That means she gave away 1/5 of $15, which is $3. Ronnie also gave $3 to their sister.

Since Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, he has $2 left.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.  

If half the mural is yellow, that's 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint. That leaves 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints for the red, white, and purple. Since they're used in equal amounts, each of those colors gets 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so that's 20 * 12 = 240 square feet per bedroom.

Since there are four bedrooms, the total bedroom space is 240 * 4 = 960 square feet.

The living room is five times bigger than one bedroom, meaning it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding the bedrooms and living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

Finally, including the rest of the house, the total area is 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

If the bigger box has 20% more pods, that's an extra 20 pods (20% of 100). So the new box has 120 pods total.

"Let's break this down step by step.

First, Thomas gets 1000 bucks in twenties, so that's 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Then he uses half for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

That leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

He triples his money, so now he has 20 * 3 = 60 bills worth twenty bucks each.

That's 60 * 20 = 1200 dollars total.

Finally, he trades them all in for fives, giving him 1200 / 5 = 240 bills.


So the answer is 240.

"Alright, let's break this down. Team A had a great first half with 4 goals! Team B was a bit behind with 2 fewer, so they scored 2 goals.  In the second half, Team B really stepped it up, scoring 4 times their first half amount, which is 8 goals! Team A only managed half of that, scoring 2 goals.

Adding it all up, Team A scored 6 goals total (4 + 2) and Team B scored 10 goals (2 + 8). That means there were a total of 16 goals in the match!

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

Let's say Wendy's current age is ""w"" and Colin's current age is ""c"".

We know:

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years:  w = 5(c + 7)
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Let's solve for ""c"", Colin's current age.

From the first equation, we can say w = 5c + 35.

Now, substitute this value of ""w"" into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for ""c"":

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
40/3 = (2/3)c
c = (40/3) * (3/2)
c = 20

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

But jelly beans don't pack perfectly, so we gotta account for that.  They only fill about 80% of the space, so that's 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches of actual jelly bean space.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we can fit 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans in the jar.

Tim thinks 30% of them are red, so that's 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

In total, Karen will pay $60 + $30 = $90.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Susan gets 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

Then she has one magazine that sends 6 issues.

Her last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6-issue one, so that's 6 * 4 = 24 issues.

Adding them all up: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 issues.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

The toy went up 80% in December, so that's an increase of $40 * 0.80 = $32.  That means it cost $40 + $32 = $72 in December.

Then in January, it went down 50%, which is a decrease of $72 * 0.50 = $36. So the final price was $72 - $36 = $36.

"Let's break it down:

* Charlie makes $80 for each regular lesson, and he has 4 of those, so that's 4 * $80 = $320.
* For veterans, he discounts his rate by 25%, meaning he charges $80 - ($80 * 0.25) = $60 per lesson.
* He has 2 veteran lessons, earning him 2 * $60 = $120.

Adding his earnings from both types of lessons, Charlie makes a total of $320 + $120 = $440 today.

"Hey there! To find Sally's mean score, we gotta add up all her quiz scores and then divide by the total number of quizzes.  

Let's see... 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630.

Now, divide that by 9 quizzes: 630 / 9 = 70.

Sally's mean score is 70.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If 9 novels is three-quarters of the total she wrote this year, we can think of it like this: 9 novels is 3 out of 4 equal parts. To find the whole (all 4 parts), we divide the number of novels she wrote this year by 3, and then multiply by 4.

So, 9 / 3 = 3, and 3 * 4 = 12.

Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

"Let's break this down. Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times that amount, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.  That means they used a total of 6 + 30 = 36 grapes for the juice and Madeline's snack.

Their mom used 48 grapes for the pies (4 pies * 12 grapes per pie = 48 grapes).

So, at the beginning, there were 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

The custodian needs to clean 80 classrooms at 15 minutes each, so that's 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes of cleaning.

They work 8 hours a day, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day. Over 5 days, that's 480 * 5 = 2400 minutes.

To find the percentage of time spent cleaning, we do (1200 / 2400) * 100% = 50%. 

So the answer is 50%. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Each middle shelf holds 10 books, and the bottom shelf holds double that, so 20 books. The top shelf holds 5 less than the bottom, meaning it holds 15 books. That's a total of 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books per bookcase.

Since Elly has 110 books, she'll need 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Rose's profit. 

First, she spent 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00 on eggs.

She has 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs.

That means she can make 60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets of eggs to sell.

She'll earn 20 sets * $1.00/set = $20.00.

So, her profit is $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Half of Skyler's hats are red, so that's 100 / 2 = 50 red hats. That leaves 100 - 50 = 50 hats that are either blue or white.

Three-fifths of those remaining hats are blue, meaning there are (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

The rest must be white, so Skyler has 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions right, which means she needs to answer 77 questions correctly (110 total questions * 0.70 = 77).

She already got 42 questions right on the first test (70 questions * 0.60 = 42).

That means she needs to get 35 questions right on the second test (77 - 42 = 35).

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  If Mary makes 's' strawberry cubes, she makes 5s - 4 blueberry cubes.  Since she makes 116 total, we know:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combining like terms, we get:

6s - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Dividing by 6:

s = 20

So she made 20 strawberry cubes. Now, let's find the blueberry cubes:

5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

"Alright, let's break this down. Jason needs to sell 15 cars, and he knows that for every 25 calls, he gets one person to visit the dealership.  Then, for every two visitors, one buys a car.  

So, he needs 15 customers, which means 30 dealership visits (15 customers * 2 visitors per customer = 30 visits). To get those 30 visits, he'll need to make 750 calls (30 visits * 25 calls per visit = 750 calls).

"
"Let's see... they have 4 people and each person gets a flashlight, so that's 4 flashlights.  Then there are 8 rooms and each room gets 2 flashlights, so that's 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights.  

Wait, that's too many flashlights! They only have 4 people, so it's just 4 flashlights.

Now for the candles. Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms.  Those rooms have 4 rooms * 4 small candles/room = 16 small candles.

The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 5 medium candles/room = 20 medium candles.

In total, they have 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Adding the candles and flashlights, they have 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40 candles and flashlights.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

The old varnish takes 7 minutes per painting, so for 6 paintings, that's 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much water Crista needs. 

Okay, so 4 plants need half a cup each, that's 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Then 8 plants need a full cup, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

The rest of her plants, 8 of them, need a quarter cup each, which is 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Adding it all up, Crista needs 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water.

"Hey there! This sounds like a tricky situation for Phineas. Let's break it down.

Since half the distance is on land and half is in water, he'll travel 100 yards hopping and 100 yards swimming.

Hopping at 20 yards a minute will take him 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

Swimming at 10 yards a minute will take him 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

Adding those times together, it'll take Phineas a total of 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes to get home.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Alicia's dry cleaning bill.

Okay, so she gets 5 blouses cleaned each week at $5.00 a pop, so that's 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Then she has 2 pairs of pants at $8.00 each, which is 2 * $8.00 = $16.00.

And finally, her skirt costs $6.00 to clean.

That means her total weekly cost is $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00.

Over 5 weeks, that adds up to $47.00 * 5 = $235.00.

There are 54 red candies, and twice that amount of orange, so there are 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies.  There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, meaning there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

That's a total of 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 red, orange, and yellow candies.

Tim makes a profit of $60 selling 10 jars.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much money Justin has.

* He's got 32 quarters, and each one is worth $0.25, so that's 32 * $0.25 = $8.00
* He's also got 95 dimes at $0.10 each, which is 95 * $0.10 = $9.50
* Then there are 120 nickels worth $0.05 each, making 120 * $0.05 = $6.00
* Finally, he has 750 pennies, and each penny is $0.01, so that's 750 * $0.01 = $7.50

Adding it all up: $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00


$31.00

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 x 2 = $15.00 on movie tickets, and $8.50 on a bracelet. That's a total of $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00.

If her parents gave her $40.00, she has $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00 left.

"Let's break this down. Josh works 5 days a week and services 3 cars each day, so he works on 15 cars per week.  He makes $4 per car, so he earns $60 each week. Over two weeks, he'd make $120.

"Let's break it down:

* Randy starts with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies, for a total of 18 cookies.
* He eats one of each kind for a snack, leaving him with 16.
* He eats 2 more oatmeal cookies for lunch, bringing his total down to 14.
* He gives away 2 sugar cookies, leaving him with 12.
* Finally, he bakes 4 of each type of cookie, adding 12 more to his stash.

That means he has 12 + 12 = 24 cookies!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Half of Matthew's toys is 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

He'd make 6 * $5 = $30 from the first half.

The other half would earn him 6 * $7 = $42.

Adding those together, he'd make a total of $30 + $42 = $72.

"Let's break this down. The dog digs a ton of holes! 

*  He digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so that's 6 * 14 = 84 holes.
* Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 more each night, so he's really making progress by 9 - 6 = 3 holes each day.
* To fill all 84 holes, it'll take him 84 / 3 = 28 days.
* That's 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

"Hmm, let's see... they made 7995 cookies total, and 2595 were rainbow and 3075 were oatmeal.  That means they made 2325 chocolate chip cookies!

"Let's break this down. Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, but Igor only got half, so that's 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. Igor got 2 more Petri dishes than the requested 14, meaning he had 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.  

We know Igor put 29 items on the bench, and we know he got the right number of beakers (7).  That means he must have lost some of the test tubes or Petri dishes.

Let's see... 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes + 7 beakers = 31 items. That's 2 more than what he put on the bench.  

Hmm, this means Igor didn't lose any beakers!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

James needs 2 screws per leg, and each table has 4 legs, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 screws per table.

Since he's building 4 tables, he'll need 8 * 4 = 32 screws total.

He starts with 40 screws, so he'll have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Alexandra raised $430, and Kim raised $320 more than that, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, meaning Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total, we add up everyone's earnings: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

"Let's break this down. Aaron is super speedy, running twice as fast as Vanessa. But Vanessa can go the distance, running twice as far as Aaron.  

We know Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron finished his part in 16 minutes. Since Aaron is twice as fast, he must have run half the distance, which is 2 miles.

If Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, that means he runs each mile in 8 minutes. Vanessa, being half as fast, takes 16 minutes per mile.

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles at 16 minutes per mile, her total time was 64 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  He needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and he's got 200 feet of dock. That means he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line total.  Since he already has 6 feet, he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 more feet of line.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Tom's restaurant gets 6 groups of people each night, and each group spends $15 (2 meals at $5 each plus a $5 bottle of wine). That means they make $90 each night. Since they're open two nights a week, they make $180 a week.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If the vendor made a 25% profit on 50 watermelons he bought for $80, that means he made an extra $20 (25% of $80).  So, he sold all the watermelons for $100.  To find out how much each one cost, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons: $100 / 50 = $2.

Each watermelon was sold for $2.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Ana peels oranges faster than Jane, so after an hour she'll have peeled more.  

Here's the thing:

* Ana peels 1 orange every 3 minutes. In an hour (60 minutes), she'll peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.
* Jane peels 1 orange every 4 minutes. In an hour, she'll peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

That means Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, the radiator normally costs $400, but he got a sweet deal at the junk shop for 80% off. That means he saved $400 * 0.80 = $320!

So the radiator only cost him $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic charged $50 an hour for 3 hours, so that's $50 * 3 = $150.

Adding it all up, Mark paid $80 + $150 = $230.

"Hey there! Let's crack this farm problem.

We know Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they have a total of 70 legs. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4.  

To figure out how many chickens there are, we can think about it like this:

* If all 20 animals were chickens, they'd have 40 legs (20 x 2 = 40).
* That means the extra 30 legs (70 - 40 = 30) must come from cows.
* Since each cow has 2 extra legs compared to a chicken, there must be 15 cows (30 / 2 = 15).
*  If there are 15 cows, there must be 5 chickens (20 - 15 = 5).


So the answer is 5 chickens!

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. They've got 7 pizzas with 8 slices each, so that's 7 * 8 = 56 slices total.  Since there are 4 people sharing, each person gets 56 / 4 = 14 slices.
