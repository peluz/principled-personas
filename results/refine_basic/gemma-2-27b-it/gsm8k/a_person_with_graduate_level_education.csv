"Let's analyze Josh's house flipping venture.  

The initial investment is the purchase price plus the cost of repairs: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the house's value by 150% of the original price, which is $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.

Adding this increase to the original value gives us the final value: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Therefore, Josh's profit is the final value minus his total investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Let's break down this download scenario.  

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file, which equates to 80 GB. This takes her 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Unfortunately, the restart adds a 20-minute delay.

She then needs to redownload the entire 200 GB file, which will take another 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

Adding these times together, the total download time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes.

* The program initiated with 60 downloads in the first month.
* In the second month, downloads tripled to 60 * 3 = 180.
* However, the third month saw a 30% reduction from the second month's total, meaning a decrease of 180 * 0.30 = 54 downloads.
* Consequently, the third month's downloads were 180 - 54 = 126.

Summing the downloads across all three months, we get 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

Here's the sequence of events:

1. **Green House:** Melanie sells x/3 vacuum cleaners.

2. **Remaining:** This leaves her with (2x/3) vacuum cleaners.

3. **Red House:** She sells 2 more, resulting in (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners remaining.

4. **Orange House:** She sells half of the remaining amount, which is [(2x/3) - 2] / 2 = (x/3) - 1 vacuum cleaners.

5. **Final Amount:** We know she has 5 left: (x/3) - 1 = 5

Solving for x:

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.  

First, we determine the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20 students * 0.20 = 4 students.

This leaves 20 students - 4 students = 16 students who are not enrolled in contemporary dance.

Next, we calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance: 16 students * 0.25 = 4 students.

Finally, the remaining students must be enrolled in hip-hop dance: 16 students - 4 students = 12 students.

To express this as a percentage of the total student body, we calculate: (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as 's' and the number of gold coins as 'g'. We're given two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110:  s + g = 110
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins: g = s + 30

We can solve this system of equations through substitution. Since we know g = s + 30, we can substitute this into the first equation:

s + (s + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

s = 40

Now that we know s = 40, we can plug this back into the equation g = s + 30 to find g:

g = 40 + 30

g = 70



Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Let's break down this problem step by step.  

We know Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, and this is half her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is 3 miles/hour * 2 = 6 miles/hour.

Her running speed is four times her walking speed, so her walking speed is 6 miles/hour / 4 = 1.5 miles/hour.

Over six hours, she spends one-third of the time running (6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours) and two-thirds of the time walking (6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours).

During her running time, she covers 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

During her walking time, she covers 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

In total, Dana travels 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

"Let's break down this installment problem.  

First, we need to determine the total cost of the cell phones: 5 phones * $150/phone = $750.

Next, calculate the interest for each phone: $150 * 0.02 = $3.

The total interest across all phones is $3/phone * 5 phones = $15.

Adding the interest to the original cost gives us the total amount Shiela will pay: $750 + $15 = $765.

Finally, divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment: $765 / 3 months = $255/month.

"Let's analyze the sandcastle's structure.  We know the top level (level 4) has 16 square feet. Since each lower level doubles the area of the one above it, we can work our way down:

* Level 3: 16 square feet * 2 = 32 square feet
* Level 2: 32 square feet * 2 = 64 square feet
* Level 1: 64 square feet * 2 = 128 square feet

To find the average, we sum the area of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

(16 + 32 + 64 + 128) / 4 = 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.

"Let's break down this problem. The puppy requires a specific feeding regimen: 1 cup of food daily for the initial 180 days, followed by 2 cups per day for the remainder of the year.  

First, we need to determine the food consumption for the initial period: 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

Next, we calculate the days remaining in the year after the initial 180 days: 365 days - 180 days = 185 days.

The puppy will consume 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups during the remaining period.

Therefore, the total food consumption for the year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Finally, since each bag contains 110 cups, Cecilia will need 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags of dog food.

"Let's analyze the given information. We know Sarah launders 400 pounds of clothing. Raymond completes half of Sarah's workload, meaning he launders 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.  David, on the other hand, has a workload four times smaller than Sarah's, resulting in 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.  

The difference in laundry volume between Raymond and David is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

"To determine the most economical option, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package size. 

Packages of 3 cost $2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.83 per flower.

Packages of 2 cost $1.00 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower.

Clearly, the packages of 2 offer a lower price per flower.  Purchasing 18 flowers this way would cost 18 flowers * $0.50/flower = $9.00.

Compared to the $15.00 cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3, Vincent saves $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.

"Let's denote the number of games won as 'w' and the number of games lost as 'l'. We're given two key pieces of information:

1. The team played a total of 22 games: w + l = 22
2. They won 8 more games than they lost: w = l + 8

We can solve this system of equations through substitution.  Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

(l + 8) + l = 22

Simplifying and solving for 'l':

2l + 8 = 22
2l = 14
l = 7

Now, substitute the value of 'l' back into the equation w = l + 8:

w = 7 + 8
w = 15

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

"Let's break down this problem. Since Christina anticipates a 25% no-show rate, she effectively plans for 75% of her invitees to attend.  This means she expects 16 friends * 0.75 = 12 guests.

Given her need for 0.75 gift bags per attendee, she'll require 12 guests * 0.75 gift bags/guest = 9 gift bags.

Finally, with each gift bag costing $2, her total expenditure will be 9 gift bags * $2/gift bag = $18.

"To determine the total potato salad needed, we must first calculate the consumption of the children.  Since children eat half the amount of an adult, they will consume 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs each.  

This means the children will eat a total of 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs of potato salad.

The adults will consume a total of 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs of potato salad.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring a total of 25 lbs + 200 lbs = 225 lbs of potato salad.

"Let's analyze Sasha's lumber resale situation.  

First, we need to calculate the current value of her 2x4 boards. Since prices have increased by 50%, each 2x4 board, originally costing $10, is now worth $15 ( $10 * 1.50). With ten boards, this yields a total revenue of $150.

Next, her 4x4 boards, initially costing $16 each, are now valued at $24 each ($16 * 1.50). With five boards, this generates $120 in revenue.

In total, Sasha's lumber resale will bring in $270 ($150 + $120).  Her total initial investment was $180 ($100 for the 2x4s + $80 for the 4x4s).

"Let's break down this salary problem step by step.

We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and this represented a 30% increase over Lylah's salary at that time.  This means Lylah's salary four years ago was $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

Adrien's salary increased by 40% over those four years, bringing his current salary to $40,000 + (0.40 * $40,000) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased proportionally.  Since her salary four years ago was $30,769.23, her current salary is $30,769.23 + (0.30 * $30,769.23) = $40,000.

Therefore, their combined salary four years later is $56,000 + $40,000 = $96,000.

The hospital incurs a cost of $150/hour * 200 hours = $30,000 for doctor's fees.  They generate revenue of $200/hour * 200 hours = $40,000 from patient charges.

Therefore, the hospital's profit is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

"Let's calculate the total cost of Rory's order. 

The subs cost 2 * $7.50 = $15.00. The chips cost 2 * $1.50 = $3.00, and the cookies cost 2 * $1.00 = $2.00. This brings her subtotal to $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

A 20% delivery fee is added, which amounts to $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00.  Adding this to the subtotal, we get $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Finally, Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip, making her final total $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"Let's break down this beehive population problem. We can represent the number of queen bees as 'q', baby bees as 'b', and worker bees as 'w'.  We're given the following relationships:

* **Total bees:** q + b + w = 700
* **Babies to Queens:** b = 2q
* **Workers to Babies:** w = 2b

We can use substitution to solve for the number of worker bees. Since we want to find 'w', let's start by expressing 'b' and 'w' in terms of 'q':

* b = 2q
* w = 2b = 2 * (2q) = 4q

Now, substitute these expressions into the total bees equation:

q + 2q + 4q = 700

Combine like terms:

7q = 700

Solve for 'q':

q = 100

Now that we know the number of queen bees, we can find the number of worker bees:

w = 4q = 4 * 100 = 400



Therefore, there are **400** worker bees in the hive.

"Let's break down this agricultural yield problem.  John has a substantial pineapple operation with 10 hectares of land dedicated to the crop. Given a density of 100 pineapples per hectare, his total yield per harvest is 1000 pineapples (10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare).  Since pineapples are harvested every three months, John reaps this yield four times a year (12 months / 3 months/harvest).  Therefore, his annual pineapple harvest totals 4000 pineapples (1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests).

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  We can work backwards from the final number of fries to determine the original quantity.

* **Before the ants:** Five fries remained after the ants took one, meaning there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries before the ants.

* **Before the raccoon:** The raccoon consumed two-thirds of the fries, leaving one-third, which equals 6 fries. This means there were 6 * 3 = 18 fries before the raccoon.

* **Before the pigeons:** The three pigeons ate a total of 9 fries (3 pigeons * 3 fries/pigeon), leaving 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

* **Before the seagull:** The seagull ate half the number Dave ate, meaning Dave ate twice the seagull's amount.  Since the seagull ate 7 fries, Dave ate 7 * 2 = 14 fries. This means there were 27 + 14 = 41 fries before the seagull.

Therefore, there were originally **41** fries in the pack.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

Over a decade, Tom plants 100 trees (10 trees/year * 10 years) but removes 20 (2 trees/year * 10 years), resulting in a net increase of 80 trees.  Adding this to his initial 50 trees gives him 130 trees after 10 years.  

However, a 30% mortality rate means he loses 39 trees (130 trees * 0.30).  

Therefore, Tom has 91 trees remaining.

"Let's analyze the flamingo situation.  After the initial prank, Sue has 18 pink flamingos. On Saturday, one-third are removed, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. This leaves 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.  The 6 removed flamingos are repainted white and added back, bringing the total white flamingos to 6. Finally, on Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos are added, resulting in a total of 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.  The difference between pink and white flamingos is 30 - 6 = 24.

"Let's break down this problem. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences per week, splitting his time evenly between two publishers.  Since Publisher B pays twice the rate of Publisher A, we know Publisher A's rate is the lower of the two.

Publisher A pays Mark $0.05 per sentence.  He edits half of his total sentences for Publisher A, meaning he edits 1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences for Publisher A. His earnings from Publisher A are then 500 sentences * $0.05/sentence = $25.00.

Publisher B pays double Publisher A's rate, so Publisher B pays $0.05 * 2 = $0.10 per sentence.  Mark also edits 500 sentences for Publisher B, earning 500 sentences * $0.10/sentence = $50.00.

In total, Mark earns $25.00 + $50.00 = $75.00 per week. Converting this to cents, we get $75.00 * 100 cents/$1 = 7500 cents.

"Let's break down this problem. We know the following:

*  There are 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples.
* Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
* Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a candied apple.

First, we can determine the weight of a single candied apple: 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams.

Next, calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars: 25 bars * 40 grams/bar = 1000 grams.

Then, calculate the total weight of the candied apples: 80 apples * 20 grams/apple = 1600 grams.

Finally, add the weight of the chocolate bars and candied apples to find the total weight of the candy: 1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams.

"Let's break down Sara's financial situation.  

First, we need to determine her total expenses. The jacket costs $30, and two pairs of shoes cost 2 * $20 = $40, for a total of $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara currently has $10 in savings and earned an additional $5/babysitting * 4 babysitting sessions = $20 from babysitting, giving her a total of $10 + $20 = $30.

Therefore, Sara needs to earn an additional $70 - $30 = $40.

Since she earns $4 per lawn mowing, she needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4/mow = 10 times.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We're given the following information:

*  w = r + 2 (two more white chickens than red chickens)
*  3r + 5w = 42 (total eggs collected)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to eliminate 'w':

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4

Therefore, Jerry has **4** red chickens.

"Let's analyze this problem systematically. We're dealing with a scenario involving two pools with identical leak rates, and we need to determine the current water volume in the smaller pool.

Let's denote the current water volume in the smaller pool as 'x'.  Since the larger pool currently holds four times the amount of water as the smaller pool, it contains 4x gallons.

Four minutes ago, the larger pool held twice the amount of water in the smaller pool, meaning it contained 2x gallons.  Both pools have been losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

Therefore, in the past four minutes, the smaller pool lost 16 gallons (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes), and the larger pool also lost 16 gallons.

This allows us to set up the following equation:

2x + 16 = 4x

Solving for x, we get:

16 = 2x
x = 8


Therefore, the small pool currently contains **8** gallons of water.

"Let's break down this probability problem.  

First, we need to adjust the number of water and grass type cards based on the changes described. James loses 8 water type cards, leaving him with 32 (40 - 8 = 32). He gains 14 grass type cards, bringing his total to 34 (20 + 14 = 34).

Now, we calculate the total number of cards: 30 fire + 34 grass + 32 water = 96 cards.

The probability of randomly selecting a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards: 32 / 96 = 0.3333.

Rounding this to the nearest integer gives us a 33% chance.

"Let's break down this problem.  First, we need to determine the total weight of the redwood before termite damage. With 20 ten-foot sections, each weighing 400 pounds, the tree originally weighed 8000 pounds (20 sections * 400 pounds/section).

Termites consumed 30% of the wood, which equates to 2400 pounds (8000 pounds * 0.30).  Subtracting this loss from the original weight, we find the redwood currently weighs 5600 pounds (8000 pounds - 2400 pounds).

"Let's break down this problem step by step. 

We know Andrea possesses 52 apples and has 8 more apples than Jamal. This means Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, giving him 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half the number of bananas as Jamal, meaning she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

In total, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

Therefore, they have a combined total of 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"Let's break down the costs associated with this property.  

First, we need to calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the $350,000 selling price. This amounts to $17,500.

Next, the transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, totaling $42,000.

Adding these additional costs to the base selling price, the total cost of the house becomes $409,500.

Finally, to determine how much this exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget of $400,000 from the total cost: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.  

We know the sweater body requires 900 stitches, and the collar takes one-tenth of that, which is 90 stitches. The rosette uses twice the number of stitches as the collar, meaning it requires 180 stitches (90 stitches * 2).

In total, the body, collar, and rosette account for 1170 stitches (900 stitches + 90 stitches + 180 stitches). Since the entire sweater uses 1800 stitches, the two sleeves must account for the remaining 630 stitches (1800 stitches - 1170 stitches).

Therefore, each sleeve requires 315 stitches (630 stitches / 2).

"Let's break down this problem step by step. 

First, we determine the number of junior programmers: (2/5) * 100 employees = 40 junior programmers.

This means there are 100 employees - 40 junior programmers = 60 senior programmers.

Senior programmers earn $400 more than junior programmers, so their salary is $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total salary paid to junior programmers is 40 programmers * $2000/programmer = $80,000.

The total salary paid to senior programmers is 60 programmers * $2400/programmer = $144,000.

Finally, the total salary paid to all programmers is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"Let's analyze Oscar's lollipop situation:

* He begins with 24 lollipops.
* After consuming 2, he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
* Distributing 14 to friends leaves him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
* Purchasing twice the number he gave away (14 * 2 = 28) increases his total to 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
* Consuming 3 more reduces his stash to 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
* Finally, eating 2 more leaves him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"Let's analyze each job offer to determine the net income Nick would receive.

**Job A:**

Nick's gross income from Job A would be $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000 per year.  With a 20% tax rate, his net income would be $30,000 * (1 - 0.20) = $24,000.

**Job B:**

Job B offers a gross income of $42,000. After deducting the $6,000 property tax, his net income is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.  A 10% tax rate on this net income results in $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600 in taxes. Therefore, his total net income from Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

The difference in net income between the two jobs is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400. Nick would earn $8,400 more per year by choosing Job B.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the larger groups as 'x'.  The smallest group, being 10 less than the others, would have 'x - 10' students.  The total student count is the sum of all three groups: 2x + (x - 10) = 200.

Simplifying the equation, we get 3x - 10 = 200. Adding 10 to both sides yields 3x = 210. Finally, dividing both sides by 3 gives us x = 70.

Therefore, the smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"Let's denote the number of cows as 'c' and the number of chickens as 'h'. We're given two key pieces of information:

* The total number of animals is 60:  c + h = 60
* The number of chickens is twice the number of cows: h = 2c

We can solve this system of equations. Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

c + 2c = 60

Combining like terms:

3c = 60

Dividing both sides by 3:

c = 20

This means there are 20 cows.  Substituting this back into the equation h = 2c, we find:

h = 2 * 20 = 40

Therefore, there are 40 chickens.

Now, to calculate the total number of legs:

* Cows have 4 legs each, contributing 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
* Chickens have 2 legs each, contributing 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

In total, the animals have 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

"Let's analyze the train's route and service schedule.  

The train traverses 75 miles between the first and second cities, followed by 100 miles between the second and third cities. The return journey from the third city back to the first is 50 miles shorter than the combined distance of the outbound legs, meaning it covers 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

A complete round trip encompasses 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles. Given the train completes three such round trips daily, its total daily mileage is 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day.

With a service interval of 18,000 miles, the train can operate for 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days before requiring maintenance.

"Let's calculate the total cost of the senior gifts. 

First, the cost of the picture frames is 44 seniors * $20/frame = $880.  

The etching adds an additional 20% to the cost of each frame, so the etching cost per frame is $20 * 0.20 = $4. The total etching cost is then 44 seniors * $4/frame = $176.

Two seniors will receive pins at a cost of 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10.

Since 1/4 of the seniors are officers, there are 44 seniors / 4 = 11 officers. The total cost of the cords for the officers is 11 officers * $12/cord = $132.

"To determine the difference in the quantity of flour bags and milk bottles Mark needs, we first calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for a quadruple batch.  A quadruple batch necessitates 3 cups/batch * 4 batches = 12 cups of flour and 1 cup/batch * 4 batches = 4 cups of milk.

Given that flour is packaged in 2-cup bags, Mark will need 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags of flour.  Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, he'll require 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

Therefore, Mark needs to purchase 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

Her sister gathered twice the amount Joanne did from the tallest trees (60 apples) and three times the amount from the shortest trees (45 apples). This means they gathered a combined 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

Therefore, Joanne must have gathered 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"This problem can be solved using a system of linear equations. Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries. We know the following:

* **Equation 1 (Heads):** c + d = 180 
* **Equation 2 (Humps):** 2c + d = 304

We can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries) using elimination. Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2, we get:

c = 124

Substituting this value of 'c' back into Equation 1:

124 + d = 180

"Let's break down this problem. We know the tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less, making them $22.  The key here is recognizing that the $6 savings represents the difference between the sale price and the original price for both pairs of jeans. Since Cole saved $6 total, and he saved 1/3 of that from the jogger jeans, he saved $6 * (1/3) = $2 on the jogger jeans. This means the jogger jeans originally cost $22 + $2 = $24.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $24 - $28 = -$4 more than the tattered jeans.

"Let's break down this problem. Kenny wants to buy a $100 amusement park ticket and ends up with $50 in spending money after selling some of his Pokemon cards. This means he earned $50 from the sale.

Since he sells each card for $1.50, he sold $50 / $1.50 per card = 33.33 cards.  Since he can't sell fractions of cards, we'll round down to 33 cards.

We know 33 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection (because he keeps 1/3). To find the total number of cards he started with, we can set up a proportion:

(2/3) * Total Cards = 33

Solving for Total Cards:

Total Cards = 33 / (2/3) = 49.5

Again, he can't have half a card, so he must have started with 50 cards.

The horse consumes 0.5 bales of hay per mile, so for a 16-mile run, it will eat 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, resulting in a total hay cost of 8 bales * $3/bale = $24.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.  

First, we need to determine the volume of a single raised bed:

Volume = width x length x height = 2 ft x 8 ft x 2 ft = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

Total volume = 32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil contains 2 cubic feet, so he'll need:

Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Finally, the total cost will be:

Total cost = 160 bags x $12/bag = $1920.

"Let's break down this card conundrum.  

We know there are 15 red cards. Green cards exceed red cards by 60%, which translates to an additional 15 * 0.60 = 9 green cards. This brings the total number of green cards to 15 + 9 = 24.

The number of yellow cards is equal to the combined total of red and green cards, so there are 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we sum the red, green, and yellow cards: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78.

"Let's analyze the farmer's feed procurement.  

First, we need to determine the total weight of each feed type:

* **Sugar cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
* **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
* **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
* **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Summing these weights gives us the total feed weight: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

Given the truck's capacity of 2250 pounds per trip, the farmer will require 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To determine the number of students without allergies, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.  

Let 'D' represent the set of students allergic to dairy, and 'P' represent the set allergic to peanuts. We are given:

* |D| = 9 (9 students are allergic to dairy)
* |P| = 6 (6 students are allergic to peanuts)
* |D ∩ P| = 3 (3 students are allergic to both)

We want to find |(D ∪ P)'|, the number of students not in either set. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states:

|(D ∪ P)| = |D| + |P| - |D ∩ P|

Substituting the given values:

|(D ∪ P)| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

"Let's break down this problem step by step. We're given that Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 insects. We also know that Lily found 7 more insects than David, and David found half the number of insects Bodhi found.

To solve for the number of insects Lily found, we can use a system of equations. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as 'B', David as 'D', and Lily as 'L'.

We can express the given information as follows:

* L = D + 7 
* D = B / 2
* L + D + B = 43

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate 'D':

* L = (B / 2) + 7

Next, substitute both the modified first equation and the second equation into the third equation:

* (B / 2) + 7 + (B / 2) + B = 43

Simplifying this equation, we get:

* 2B + 7 = 43
* 2B = 36
* B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

* D = B / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

* L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16



Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

"To determine the combined hourly strawberry-picking capacity, we need to calculate the individual rates for each person and sum them. 

Tony picks at a rate of 6 quarts per hour. Bobby picks one less than Tony, resulting in a rate of 5 quarts per hour. Kathy picks twice the amount Bobby does, giving her a rate of 10 quarts per hour. Finally, Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, leading to a rate of 8 quarts per hour.

Adding these individual rates, we get 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour.

"Let's break down Josh's workout regimen. He consistently exercised for 4 hours per week for the majority of the 8-week period.  However, there were a few deviations: two consecutive weeks with 5-hour workouts and one week with a 6-hour workout.

To calculate his total workout time, we can sum the hours from each type of week:

* Regular weeks: 6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours
*  5-hour weeks: 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours
* 6-hour week: 1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Adding these together, we find Josh's total workout time over the 8 weeks is 40 hours.

"Let's analyze the passenger changes step by step.

After the first stop, the bus loses 8 passengers and gains 8 * 5 = 40 passengers, resulting in a net increase of 32 passengers. This brings the total to 48 + 32 = 80 passengers.

At the second stop, 21 passengers disembark, and 8 / 3 = 2.67 passengers board. Rounding down to the nearest whole number, we have 2 passengers boarding. This results in a net loss of 19 passengers (21 - 2).

Therefore, the final number of passengers on the bus is 80 - 19 = 61.

"Let's break down the problem. We know the total cost of the purchase was $2400, and the computer cost $1100. The printer cost $400 less than the computer, meaning it cost $1100 - $400 = $700.  

Therefore, the combined cost of the computer and printer is $1100 + $700 = $1800. This leaves $2400 - $1800 = $600 for the two monitors.

Each monitor, therefore, cost $600 / 2 = $300.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  We're given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500. Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.  

We know the following:

* Red jelly beans: 0.99b (1% less than blue)
* Green jelly beans: 1.01b (1% more than blue)

The sum of all three types must equal the total: b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get 3b = 4500.

Solving for 'b', we find that b = 1500 (the number of blue jelly beans).

Now we can calculate the number of red and green jelly beans:

* Red: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
* Green: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

Finally, the difference between green and red jelly beans is 1515 - 1485 = 30.

"Let's analyze the cost of the boots on each platform.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the total cost is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21.

Therefore, the boots are $21 - $20 = $1 more expensive on eBay.

"This is a classic example of exponential growth.  The beanstalk's height doubles each day.  We need to find the smallest number of days for the height to exceed 20 feet.

* Day 1: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
* Day 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
* Day 3: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

Therefore, it will take **3 days** for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

*x = 2x - 10*
*10 = x*

Therefore, Jerry is currently 10 years old. In three years, he will be 13 years old.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as *x*.  The problem states that the other two angles measure 2*x* and 3*x*.  Since the angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we can set up the equation:

*x* + 2*x* + 3*x* = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

6*x* = 180

Dividing both sides by 6 yields:

*x* = 30

Therefore, the largest angle, which measures 3*x*, is:

3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

* His nickels are worth 14 * $0.05 = $0.70
* His pennies are worth 15 * $0.01 = $0.15

Adding these together, Colby has a total of $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, he can buy $3.45 / $0.05 = 69 gumballs.

"Let's analyze the tire wear.  Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles monthly, we can calculate the total monthly rotations: (400 miles/month) * (725 rotations/2 miles) = 145,000 rotations/month.

Knowing each tire has a lifespan of 10,440,000 rotations, we can determine the tire's longevity in months: (10,440,000 rotations) / (145,000 rotations/month) = 72 months.

Finally, converting this to years, we find the tire should last 72 months / 12 months/year = 6 years.

"Let's break down this culinary conundrum.  Each guest will consume 3 deviled egg halves, and since Lori has 16 guests, she'll need a total of 48 deviled egg halves (16 guests * 3 halves/guest = 48 halves).  Given that each whole egg yields 2 deviled egg halves, Lori will require 24 eggs (48 halves / 2 halves/egg = 24 eggs). Finally, to determine the number of dozens, we divide the total eggs needed by 12 eggs per dozen, resulting in 2 dozen eggs (24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozen eggs).

"To determine the total cost, we need to consider both the initial purchase price and the recurring annual expenses.  The plane's purchase price is a one-time cost of $150,000.  

The annual hangar rental cost is $5000 per month * 12 months = $60,000.

Fuel costs are double the hangar rental, amounting to $60,000 * 2 = $120,000 per year.

Therefore, the total cost for the first year is $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"Let's break down this culinary conundrum.  We know the rice cooks for 30 minutes. The pork takes 20 minutes longer than the rice, meaning it requires 30 + 20 = 50 minutes. The beans, however, take half the combined cooking time of the rice and pork.  That combined time is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes for the beans.

Therefore, the total cooking time for all three items is 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"Let's analyze the cost difference between the two nut mixtures. 

The first mixture comprises 0.5 pounds of almonds at $10 per pound and 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound. This totals to $5 + $5 = $10.

The second mixture consists of 0.2 pounds of almonds at $10 per pound and 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound. This amounts to $2 + $5 = $7.

Therefore, the first mixture is $10 - $7 = $3 more expensive than the second mixture.

"This problem can be solved using a system of equations. Let 's' represent the number of sheep and 'g' represent the number of geese. We know the following:

* Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2 legs.
* Each animal has 1 head.

This gives us the following system of equations:

* 4s + 2g = 70 (total legs)
* s + g = 20 (total heads)

We can solve for 's' (the number of sheep) using substitution.  Solving the second equation for 'g', we get g = 20 - s. Substituting this into the first equation:

4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Simplifying and solving for 's':

4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s = 30
s = 15



Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"Let's break down this problem systematically. 

First, we determine Kassidy's funds. Kassidy possesses three-quarters the amount Aurelia has, who has $120.  Therefore, Kassidy has (3/4) * $120 = $90.

Next, we calculate Rayna's amount. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, meaning she has $90 + $60 = $150.

To find the total sum, we add the amounts each person has: $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.

Finally, to determine the equal share if they pooled their money, we divide the total by the number of people: $360 / 3 = $120.

"Let's denote the age of each twin as 't' and the age of each triplet as 'r'. We're given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, which translates to the equation t = r + 7.  We also know that the sum of their ages is 44: 2t + 3r = 44.

We can solve this system of equations. Substituting the first equation into the second, we get: 2(r + 7) + 3r = 44. Simplifying, we have 2r + 14 + 3r = 44, which leads to 5r = 30.  Therefore, r = 6.

Substituting this value back into t = r + 7, we find that t = 13.

"Let's break down this problem step by step.  

First, we need to determine the cost of the candies. We know the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40. The cost of the lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. Subtracting this from the total cost, we find the candies cost $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

This means each candy costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can calculate the cost of ten lollipops and ten candies. Ten lollipops would cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00, and ten candies would cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

Therefore, the total cost of ten lollipops and ten candies would be $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"Let's break down the costs. The vaccines total $40 (2 vaccines * $20/vaccine).  The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which we'll calculate after factoring in the vaccines.  

Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, let 'x' represent the total bill. We know 0.60x = heartworm check cost.  We also know the total bill (x) is the sum of the vaccine cost and the heartworm check cost: x = $40 + 0.60x.

Solving for x, we get: 0.40x = $40, so x = $100.

Therefore, John's total bill is $100.  Since he brought $125, he leaves with $25.

"To determine the points still needed, we must first calculate the total points accumulated by the class.  

Betty earned 30% more than Adam's 50 points, which equates to 0.30 * 50 = 15 additional points. This brings Betty's total to 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 fewer points than Betty, giving him 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta's point total is three times Tom's, meaning she has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Summing the points for all students, the class has a total of 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

"Let's analyze Lorraine's sticker-button transactions systematically.

First, Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers, resulting in 27 small stickers being exchanged for an equivalent number of small buttons.  This yields her 27 small buttons.  These 27 small buttons can be further traded for 9 large buttons (27 / 3 = 9).

Next, Lorraine trades half of her 40 large stickers, which is 20 large stickers, directly for 20 large buttons.

She is left with 20 large stickers.  Each of these can be traded for 3 small buttons, giving her an additional 60 small buttons (20 * 3 = 60).

"This problem requires us to analyze the scoring system and the differences in Ava and Emma's performance to determine the potential difference in their scores.

Let's break it down:

* **Scoring:**
    * Enemies: 10 points each

    * Time Bonus: 30 points per second remaining

* **Ava's Performance:**
    * Enemies: 8 more than Emma
    * Berries: 3 more than Emma
    * Time: 4 seconds slower than Emma

We can express their scores as follows:

* **Emma's Score:** 10x + 5y + 30t  (where x = enemies jumped, y = berries collected, t = time remaining)
* **Ava's Score:** 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(t - 4)

"Let's analyze the situation to determine the total cost.

First, we need to calculate the playtime for each friend in terms of quarters. Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His two less-skilled friends play for half that time, meaning they get 10 minutes per quarter. His more skilled friend plays for 1.5 times Jack's duration, resulting in 30 minutes per quarter.

Next, we convert the total playtime of 4 hours into minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, we can determine the number of quarters each person uses:

* Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters
* Less-skilled friends: 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters each, totaling 48 quarters.
* More-skilled friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

Finally, we sum the quarters used by everyone: 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is 68 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17.00.

"Let's break down this problem systematically. We can represent the quantities of each ingredient with variables.  Since the amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance, we can denote both as 'x'.  

The problem states that the amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so salt would be '2x'.  Similarly, the amount of sugar is also '2x'.

Finally, the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, making it '4x'.

The total weight of all ingredients must equal 10 ounces. Therefore, we have the equation: x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 10x = 10.

Solving for x, we find that x = 1.

Since the amount of oil is 4x, the amount of oil Tanya uses is 4 * 1 = 4 ounces.

Subsequently, Joe makes a generous gesture, gifting his mother twice the number of cars he sold, amounting to 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

In total, Joe parts with 8 + 16 = 24 cars.  Therefore, after these transactions, Joe retains 40 - 24 = 16 cars.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Smendrick possesses three times that amount, or 3x cards. Becca, in turn, has 12 more cards than Smendrick, giving her a total of 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards across all three collections is 341.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Finally, dividing both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since Becca has 3x + 12 cards, she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 153 cards.

"Let's analyze Milly's situation to determine her financial loss. 

First, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and the book weighs 4 pounds, resulting in a cost of $0.35 * 4 = $1.40. Additionally, there's a mileage charge of $0.08 per mile for the 20-mile distance, amounting to $0.08 * 20 = $1.60. Therefore, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, we determine the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. They offer a 75% refund on the book's $32 price, which equals $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.

Finally, to calculate Milly's total loss, we subtract the refund and shipping cost from the original price: $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.00.

"To determine the production for the fourth week, we first need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks.  

The second week's production is half of the first week's 8,000 bars, which is 4,000 bars. The third week's production is triple the first week's production, amounting to 24,000 bars.

Therefore, the total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Boris aims to produce 50,000 bars per month.  Subtracting the production from the first three weeks, we find that he needs to produce 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

Turtles, traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, would have a speed of (1/54) / 2 = 1/108.

Finally, with four turtles each traveling at 1/108 the highway length per hour, their combined speed is 4 * (1/108) = 1/27. This means it would take them 1 / (1/27) = 27 hours to cross the highway.

Peter also has half the number of dishes as Jack, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

In total, they have 90 socks (60 + 30) and 90 dishes (30 + 60), giving us a grand total of 180 socks and dishes combined.

"Let's analyze the situation to determine the class's profit.  

First, we calculate the total revenue generated by selling the lollipops: 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.80/lollipop = $240.

Next, we determine the total cost of purchasing the lollipops: 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.50/lollipop = $150.

Finally, the profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost: $240 - $150 = $90.

"Let's break down Larry's menagerie:

* He begins with 3 cats.
* He owns three times that number of dogs, meaning he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
* Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, giving him 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
* His fish tank contains three times the number of rabbits, so he has 7 * 3 = 21 fish.
* Finally, his gerbil collection is one-third the size of his fish population, meaning he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

In total, Larry has 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets.

"Let's break down this problem. The tank initially holds half the volume of the pool, which is 10000 gallons / 2 = 5000 gallons.  Over six days, the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, resulting in a total of 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons being used.  Therefore, the remaining water in the tank after six days would be 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons.

"Let's analyze Colby's movie budget.  He has $150 allocated for the month.  

We need to calculate his expenditures thus far:

* **Friday/Saturday Movies:** 5 movies * $10/movie = $50
* **Weekday Movies:** 8 movies * $7/movie = $56
* **Popcorn:** 2 tubs * $8/tub = $16
* **Candy:** 4 boxes * $2/box = $8

His total spending is $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

This leaves him with $150 - $130 = $20 for the remainder of the month.

Considering it's Friday and he wants popcorn and candy, which will cost $8 + $2 = $10, he can afford one more movie at a cost of $10.

"Let's break down this caloric calculation.  

First, we need to determine the caloric content of each mini pastry. A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 the calories of a regular cinnamon roll, which contains 600 calories. Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. Similarly, a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Next, we calculate the total calories for each type of pastry. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, totaling 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories. He also baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, contributing 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we sum the calories from both types of pastries: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

"Let's break down this age problem systematically. We're given the following information:

* The sum of Peter, Paul, and John's ages is 100.
* Paul is 10 years older than John.
* Peter's age is the sum of Paul's and John's ages.

We can represent this with equations:

* P + Pa + J = 100 
* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

Where:

* P = Peter's age
* Pa = Paul's age
* J = John's age

We can solve for Peter's age (P) by substitution.  Since we know Pa = J + 10, we can substitute that into the equation P = Pa + J to get:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Simplifying and solving for J:

4J + 20 = 100
4J = 80
J = 20

Finally, substitute J = 20 back into the equation P = 2J + 10:

P = 2(20) + 10
P = 40 + 10
P = 50



Therefore, Peter is 50 years old.

"Let's analyze the profitability of each widget-making machine.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, while the WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45.  Over a 24-hour day, the Widgeteer 3000 churns out 1440 widgets (60 widgets/hour * 24 hours), and the WidgetMaster 9000 produces 1080 widgets.

Extrapolating to a 30-day month, the Widgeteer 3000 would produce 43,200 widgets (1440 widgets/day * 30 days), and the WidgetMaster 9000 would produce 32,400 widgets.

Assuming each widget sells for $6, the Widgeteer 3000 would generate $259,200 in revenue per month (43,200 widgets * $6/widget), while the WidgetMaster 9000 would generate $194,400 (32,400 widgets * $6/widget).

Therefore, the Widgeteer 3000 would yield $64,800 more in revenue per month than the WidgetMaster 9000 ($259,200 - $194,400).

First, we determine the original cost of the CDs: 10 CDs * $15/CD = $150.

Next, we calculate the discount: $150 * 0.40 = $60.

This means James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He then sells 5 CDs for $40 each, earning him 5 CDs * $40/CD = $200.

Finally, we find the net amount James has: $200 - $90 = $110.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

First, determine the distance James covers during his initial swim: 20 miles * 0.60 = 12 miles.

The time taken for this leg is calculated as distance divided by speed: 12 miles / 2 mph = 6 hours.

His rest period is half the duration of his swim: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

For the final leg, his speed is halved: 2 mph / 2 = 1 mph.

Therefore, the time taken for the last leg is 8 miles / 1 mph = 8 hours.

Finally, add up all the time components: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

"Let's denote Azibo's score as *x*. Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, so Bahati scored *x + 20* points. Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati, meaning Dinar scored *x + 20 - 10 = x + 10* points.

The total score is the sum of their individual scores: *x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45*.

Combining like terms, we get *3x + 30 = 45*.  Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us *3x = 15*. Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find that *x = 5*.

Next, we convert this time into minutes: 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Since Vince staples in 15-minute intervals, we divide the total time in minutes by 15: 900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

Finally, we multiply the number of intervals by his stapling rate: 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

We can solve for S, the number of Pokémon Stan caught, by using substitution.  

First, substitute the expression for S from the first equation into the third equation:

A + (4A - 13) + X = 339

Next, substitute the expression for X from the second equation into the above equation:

A + (4A - 13) + (S + 5) = 339

Now, substitute the expression for S from the first equation again:

A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339

Simplify and solve for A:

9A - 21 = 339
9A = 360
A = 40

Finally, substitute the value of A back into the equation for S:

"Let's break down this problem.  

First, we determine the number of football players: 30 students * 0.20 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students who are neither football players nor in the cheerleading/band group: 30 students - 6 students = 24 students.

Then, we calculate the number of students in cheerleading or band: 24 students * 0.25 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 students + 6 students = 12 students.

"Let's break down this problem systematically. First, we need to determine the total number of plants that can fit in Pat's flower bed.  

We know the bed is 111 feet long, which translates to 1332 inches (111 feet * 12 inches/foot). Each plant requires 12 inches of space, plus an additional 18 inches for spacing (1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot), totaling 30 inches per plant.

Dividing the total length of the bed by the space required per plant, we get 1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants. Since Pat can't purchase fractions of plants, she can accommodate 44 plants.

Pat already possesses 17 plants, meaning she needs to acquire an additional 27 plants (44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants).

Finally, with each plant costing $6, the total expenditure at the store will be $162 (27 plants * $6/plant).

"Let's analyze the soil usage:

* Sunflowers consume 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds of soil.
* Carnations require 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds of soil.

This totals 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds of soil for sunflowers and carnations.

With 30 pounds of soil initially, they have 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds remaining for roses.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses.

"To determine the total time, we need to consider both peeling and cooking times.  

First, peeling 90 shrimp at a rate of 6 shrimp per minute will take 90/6 = 15 minutes.

Next, since she cooks 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, cooking 90 shrimp will take (90/30) * 10 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the total time required is 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes.

"Let's analyze the temperature changes step by step. The air conditioner's cooling effect must be considered alongside the natural warming of the room.

* **Cooling Phase 1:** On low, the room cools by 2 degrees per hour for 3 hours, resulting in a net cooling of 6 degrees.
* **Cooling Phase 2:**  Switching to high increases the cooling rate to 3 degrees per hour for 4 hours, leading to an additional cooling of 12 degrees.
* **Total Cooling:** The combined cooling effect is 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees.
* **Warming Phase:** After the air conditioner is turned off, the room warms up by 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours, resulting in a 4-degree increase.
* **Net Temperature Change:** Subtracting the warming effect from the total cooling gives us a final temperature 14 degrees lower than the starting point.

"Let's break down this problem. Comet Halley's orbit is 75 years.  Bill's father observed the comet at age 30. Bill saw it again when he was three times his father's age at the time of the first sighting. This means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old during his second viewing.

Since the comet appears every 75 years, 90 / 75 = 1.2 cycles have elapsed between the father's and Bill's second viewing. This indicates Bill was 75 years old when he first saw the comet.

"Let's analyze the flight patterns. The second plane's 44 flights to Poland represent half the workload of the first plane, indicating the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 flights daily.  Of these, 88 * (3/4) = 66 are dedicated to Greece. This leaves 88 - 66 = 22 flights for France and Germany.  Since these are split evenly, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France each day.

"Let's analyze the howling durations:

* Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
* Chikote's howl is twice Tobias's, meaning he howls for 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.
* Igneous's howl is the sum of Tobias's and Chikote's howl durations, totaling 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

The combined howling time for all three wolves is 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.  Converting this to minutes, we get 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we need to follow these steps:

First, calculate the pool's volume:

Volume = width x length x depth = 14 feet x 25 feet x 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

Next, convert the volume to gallons by multiplying by the given conversion factor:

Gallons = 1400 cubic feet x 5.9 gallons/cubic foot = 8260 gallons.

Finally, calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of gallons by the price per gallon:

Cost = 8260 gallons x $0.10/gallon = $826.00. 


Therefore, it will cost $826.00 to fill the pool.

"Let's analyze the water pumping scenario.

On the first day, Wanda pumps 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is (1/4) * 18000 gallons = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumps 3/4 the amount Wanda pumps, meaning she contributes (3/4) * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumps 2/3 of her day one amount, which is (2/3) * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of her day one amount, contributing (1/3) * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons.

In total, after two days, they pump 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

Therefore, the tank still needs 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons to be full.

"This problem requires us to work backwards from the final charge state.  

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as 'x'.  

* After 5 hours of losing 9% per hour, the remaining charge would be x(1 - 0.09)^5.
* Over the subsequent 3 hours, with a loss rate of 7% per hour, the charge further reduces to x(1 - 0.09)^5 * (1 - 0.07)^3.
* We are given that this final charge is 28%, so we have the equation: x(1 - 0.09)^5 * (1 - 0.07)^3 = 0.28x

Solving for x, the initial charge, involves some algebraic manipulation.  

x = 0.28x / [(1 - 0.09)^5 * (1 - 0.07)^3]

Calculating this expression yields x ≈ 0.1765, or approximately 17.65%.

"Let's analyze Jamaar's fruit-buying situation.  

First, we need to determine his total spending thus far.  He's purchased 3 peaches at $0.50 each, totaling $1.50.  He bought 4 pears at $0.50 each, for a cost of $2.00. Two kiwis at $1.00 apiece add another $2.00 to his total. Finally, his 5 apples at $0.75 each cost $3.75.

Summing these costs, we find Jamaar has spent $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25.

This leaves him with $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 for plums.

Since each plum costs $0.25, Jamaar can purchase $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums.

"To determine the price of carrots after three years, we'll use the compound interest formula, as the price increases by a percentage of the previous year's price.

The formula is: Future Value = Present Value * (1 + Interest Rate) ^ Number of Years

In this case:

* Present Value = $120
* Interest Rate = 5% or 0.05
* Number of Years = 3

Plugging these values into the formula:

Future Value = $120 * (1 + 0.05) ^ 3 
Future Value = $120 * (1.05) ^ 3
Future Value = $120 * 1.157625
Future Value ≈ $138.92

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be **$139**.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  We know Teresa earns $120 in total and that each small stuffed animal costs $4.  Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'x'. This means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

The revenue from large stuffed animals is 3 * $4 * x = $12x, since large animals cost three times the price of small ones. The revenue from small stuffed animals is 2x * $4 = $8x.

The total revenue is the sum of these two: $12x + $8x = $120. Combining like terms, we get $20x = $120.

Solving for x, we find x = 6. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"To determine the total fabric needed, we must first calculate the dimensions of each piece.  Since the fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and wider than the bed, we add 4 feet to both the length and width of the bed. This results in fabric pieces measuring 10 feet by 12 feet.  The total area of fabric required is then 10 feet * 12 feet = 120 square feet.

"Let's analyze the height difference between Cole and Xavier.  

First, we need to ensure we're working with consistent units. Xavier's initial height is given in feet, so let's convert that to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

After their summer growth spurts, Xavier is 51 inches tall (48 inches + 3 inches) and Cole is 52 inches tall (50 inches + 2 inches).

The difference in their heights is 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

"Let's denote the first person's share as  'x'. The second person received x + $80, and the third person received 2(x + $80) = 2x + $160.  The sum of their shares equals $1920:

x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Simplifying the equation: 4x + $240 = $1920

Subtracting $240 from both sides: 4x = $1680

Finally, dividing both sides by 4: x = $420 

Therefore, the first person's share was $420.

"Let's break down this problem.  

First, we need to determine the total number of days worked. Since there are 7 days in a week, the team worked for 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Next, we calculate the daily hours worked by each painter: (3/8) day * 24 hours/day = 9 hours.

Finally, to find the total hours worked by each painter, we multiply the daily hours by the total number of days: 21 days * 9 hours/day = 189 hours.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'.  The problem states that Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than the second, so the first set yielded x + 4 balls. In the third set, he retrieved half the number of balls from the second set, meaning x/2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved across all three sets is 19.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

Combining like terms, we get:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

2.5x = 15

Finally, dividing both sides by 2.5:

x = 6

This means Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.  Since the first set had four more balls than the second, he retrieved 6 + 4 = 10 balls in the first set.

"Let's analyze the car's depreciation.  The car loses 21% of its value each year.  

* In 2008, the car is worth 79% of its original value: $20000 * 0.79 = $15800
* In 2009, the car is worth 79% of its 2008 value: $15800 * 0.79 = $12478
* In 2010, the car is worth 79% of its 2009 value: $12478 * 0.79 = $9860.62



Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is $9860.62.

"Let's analyze this scenario. Mr. Rogers purchased the watch at a 25% discount from the original price (100% - 75% = 25%).  This means he paid 75% of the original $2000, which is $1500.

He then sold the watch for 120% of his purchase price, resulting in a sale price of $1800 (120/100 * $1500 = $1800).

The discount Mr. Rogers' friend received is the difference between the original price and the price he paid: $2000 - $1800 = $200.

To express this discount as a percentage of the original price, we calculate: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%.



Therefore, Mr. Rogers' friend received a 10% discount from the original price.

"Let's break down Marcel's bicycle sales to determine his earnings.

* **Trekking Bikes:** Marcel sold half of his 300 bikes as Trekking bikes, resulting in 150 Trekking bike sales. At $450 per Trekking bike, his earnings from this category are 150 * $450 = $67,500.

* **BMX Bikes:** BMX bikes represent 15% of his total sales, which equates to 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes sold.  Since each BMX bike costs $250 (half the price of an MTB), his earnings from BMX bikes are 45 * $250 = $11,250.

* **MTB Bikes:** The remaining bikes must be MTBs: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.  At $500 per MTB, his earnings from this category are 105 * $500 = $52,500.

* **Total Earnings:** Summing up his earnings from each bike type, Marcel earned a total of $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250 from bicycle sales that month.

"Let's break down the cost of painting this room.  

First, we need to determine the total paintable surface area. The north and south walls each have an area of 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, they contribute a total of 80 square feet/wall * 2 walls = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls each have an area of 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet. With two of these walls, they add another 40 square feet/wall * 2 walls = 80 square feet.

The total paintable area is 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

Knowing that each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we'll need 240 square feet / 20 square feet/gallon = 12 gallons of paint.

Finally, at a cost of $12 per gallon, the total cost to paint the room will be 12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144.

"Let's analyze Sheila's credit card activity step-by-step.

After returning the $15.00 item, her balance is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

The frying pan, discounted by 20%, costs $20.00 - (0.20 * $20.00) = $16.00.

The towels, discounted by 10%, cost $30.00 - (0.10 * $30.00) = $27.00.

Therefore, her total new purchases amount to $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

Adding this to her previous balance, Sheila's new credit card balance is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

"To determine the additional mileage Soledad needs to hike each day, we first calculate her total mileage for June based on her current plan.  Hiking 125 miles twice daily results in 250 miles per day. Over 30 days, this totals 7500 miles (250 miles/day * 30 days).

Since her goal is 9300 miles, she needs to cover an additional 1800 miles (9300 miles - 7500 miles).  

To achieve this, she must increase her daily mileage by 60 miles (1800 miles / 30 days).

"Let's analyze the situation. The manufacturer needs 400 toys and is short 20 after the first four workers complete their shifts. This means those four workers produced 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, totaling 12 toys per hour. The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, totaling 8 toys per hour.  Combined, the first four workers produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Over a 10-hour shift, they produce 20 toys/hour * 10 hours = 200 toys. This confirms our earlier calculation that the four workers produced 380 toys.

Therefore, the fifth worker must have produced 380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys.

Since the fifth worker also worked a 10-hour shift, their hourly production rate is 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted was 56, they each painted 13 eggs (56 - 30) / 2.

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold (21 - 13).

"Let's break down this problem.  We know Nik has 200 crayons, and each box holds 8 crayons. This means he'll need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total crayon weight is 200 ounces.  The boxes themselves also weigh 8 ounces each, for a total box weight of 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.

Therefore, the combined weight of the crayons and boxes is 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.  Finally, converting ounces to pounds, we get 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

"Let's break down this problem. We know Grandma spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach. This allows us to calculate her beach speed: 2 miles / (40 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 3 miles per hour.

Since her sidewalk speed is double her beach speed, she walks at 6 miles per hour on the sidewalk.  

She covers 1 mile on the sidewalk, so this portion of her walk takes 1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hour, or 10 minutes.

Therefore, her total walking time is 40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes.

Now, we add the initial number of each animal to the deliveries:

* Total cows: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
* Total chickens: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Finally, we sum the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm: 470 + 230 = 700 animals.

"Let's break down this problem step by step.

Faraday's earnings from individual sunflowers per day are $26.  His earnings from bouquets, which contain 12 sunflowers each, are $56 per day. This means he earns $56 / 12 = $4.67 per sunflower within a bouquet.

Therefore, his total earnings per sunflower per day are $2 + $4.67 = $6.67. Over three days, his total earnings from sunflowers would be $6.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $20.01/sunflower.

His total earnings from sunflowers over three days are $26 (individual) + $56 (bouquets) = $82.  Dividing this by his earnings per sunflower, we find he sold $82 / $6.67 per sunflower = 12.29 sunflowers.

Since we can't sell fractions of sunflowers, Faraday sold **12** sunflowers after three days.

"Let's analyze the situation.  Hortex currently produces enough juice to satisfy 20% of the daily energy needs per bottle, and they produce 4200 bottles daily. This means their current output covers 4200 bottles * 20% = 840% of the daily energy requirements for a population.

We need to determine the additional bottles required to meet 100% of the daily energy needs for 2300 people. This translates to a total energy requirement of 2300 people * 100% = 230000%.

The energy deficit is 230000% - 840% = 229160%.

Charlie, locating 2 fewer eggs than Stacy (10 - 2 = 8 eggs), adds to the total, now at 23. Finally, Mei's haul, half the size of Charlie's (8 / 2 = 4 eggs), brings the grand total of found eggs to 27.  

Subtracting the found eggs from the initial number reveals that 36 - 27 = 9 eggs remain hidden.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

First, we determine the total number of apartments in the first two complexes: 200 apartments/complex * 2 complexes = 400 apartments.

The third complex is 60% larger than the combined size of the first two, meaning it has 400 apartments * 0.60 = 240 more apartments than each of the first two.

Therefore, the third complex has 400 apartments + 240 apartments = 640 apartments.

In total, John services 400 apartments + 400 apartments + 640 apartments = 1440 apartments.

Since he collects from each apartment three times a week, he makes 1440 apartments * 3 collections/apartment/week = 4320 collections per week.

Finally, at a rate of $0.40 per collection, his weekly earnings are 4320 collections * $0.40/collection = $1728.00.

"Let's analyze the avocado tree's fruit production over its first 10 years:

* **Years 1-5:** We're given that a 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits. We don't have data for the preceding years.
* **Year 6:** Production triples from year 5, resulting in 50 fruits * 3 = 150 fruits.
* **Year 7:** Production is seven times that of year 5, yielding 50 fruits * 7 = 350 fruits.
* **Year 8:**  We know a 10-year-old tree produces 200 more fruits than an 8-year-old tree. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, or 50 fruits * 20 = 1000 fruits. Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits - 200 fruits = 800 fruits.
* **Year 9:** The tree bears no fruit.
* **Year 10:** As calculated earlier, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.

Summing the fruit production across all 10 years: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = **2350 fruits**.

"Let's break down this problem systematically. We're given the following relationships:

* The red rope's length is four times that of the blue rope.
* The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
* The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.

We can represent these relationships mathematically:

*  Let 'r' be the length of the red rope.
*  Let 'b' be the length of the blue rope.
*  Let 'y' be the length of the yellow rope.

This gives us the following equations:

1. r = 4b
2. b = y - 7
3. r + b + y = 37

Now, we can solve for 'r' (the length of the red rope).  

Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:

r = 4(y - 7)

Simplifying:

r = 4y - 28

Now, substitute both this expression for 'r' and the expression for 'b' from equation (2) into equation (3):

(4y - 28) + (y - 7) + y = 37

Combining like terms:

6y - 35 = 37

Adding 35 to both sides:

6y = 72

Dividing both sides by 6:

y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope ('y'), we can find the length of the blue rope ('b'):

b = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope ('r'):

r = 4b = 4 * 5 = 20

"Let's break down this word problem. Rissa has three times the amount Ronnie has, meaning she initially possesses $5 * 3 = $15.  

After both siblings contribute equally to their sister, Rissa retains 4/5 of her original sum. This indicates she donated 1/5 of $15, which equals $3.  

Since both siblings donated the same amount, Ronnie also gave $3 to their sister. Consequently, Ronnie has $5 - $3 = $2 remaining.

"Let's break down the problem to find the total area of Tom's house.

Each bedroom occupies 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet.

With four bedrooms, the total bedroom area is 240 square feet/bedroom * 4 bedrooms = 960 square feet.

The living room, being five times larger than a single bedroom, spans 240 square feet/bedroom * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding the bedroom and living room areas, we get 960 square feet + 1200 square feet = 2160 square feet.

Finally, including the remaining 1000 square feet of the house, the total area is 2160 square feet + 1000 square feet = 3160 square feet.

"Let's analyze the scoring pattern in this match.  

Team B scored 2 fewer goals than Team A in the first half, meaning they scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, Team B quadrupled their first-half score, netting 2 * 4 = 8 goals.

Team A, in contrast, scored a quarter of Team B's second-half total, adding 8 / 4 = 2 more goals to their tally.

Summing up Team A's goals across both halves gives us 4 + 2 = 6 goals.

Similarly, Team B's total goals are 2 + 8 = 10.

Therefore, the match concluded with a combined total of 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as 'w' and Colin's current age as 'c'.  We can establish a system of equations based on the given information:

*  ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now"": w = 5(c + 7)
* ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now"": c + 25 = (1/3)w

We can solve for 'c' by substitution. From the first equation, we know w = 5c + 35. Substituting this into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplifying and solving for 'c':

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
40/3 = (2/3)c
c = (40/3) * (3/2)
c = 20

Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the total volume of the jar:

Volume = base area * height = (6 inches * 6 inches) * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Considering the 80% packing efficiency, the usable volume for jelly beans is 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Given that each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches, the jar can hold approximately 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

If Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red, his estimated count would be 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

"Let's break down this problem. We know Carly needs to provide 10 treats in total (5 people * 2 treats each). Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes.  She makes three times the number of brownies as cupcakes minus two, which can be represented as 3c - 2.

The total number of treats can be expressed as: c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combining like terms, we get 4c - 2 = 10.

Adding 2 to both sides gives us 4c = 12.

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that c = 3.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's'. The problem states that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  This can be represented as 5s - 4.

The total number of cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, which equals 116.  Therefore, we have the equation:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combining like terms, we get:

6s - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Finally, dividing both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now, we can calculate the number of blueberry cubes:

5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

"To determine the total age of the siblings, we need to consider each individual's age.  The sisters' combined age is 16 years/sister * 3 sisters = 48 years. The younger brother is 12 years old, and the older brother is twice that age, or 24 years old.  Summing these ages, we find the total age of all the siblings is 48 + 12 + 24 = 84 years.

"Let's break down Charisma's practice regimen. She meditates for 30 minutes each day (15 minutes twice) and practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) five days a week.  

Over a week, her total meditation time is 210 minutes (30 minutes/day * 7 days/week). Adding her yoga time, her total weekly practice is 510 minutes (210 minutes + 300 minutes).

Extrapolating to four weeks, her total practice time becomes 2040 minutes (510 minutes/week * 4 weeks).

"To determine the total area of the quilt, we need to calculate the area contributed by each shirt size and sum them.

* Small shirts contribute 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.
* Medium shirts contribute 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.
* Large shirts contribute 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Therefore, the total area of the quilt is 33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 101 square feet.

"Let's break down this problem. A small sunflower yields 3 dozen seeds, which equates to 3 * 12 = 36 seeds. A large sunflower produces 50% more than this, meaning it has an additional 36 * 0.50 = 18 seeds.  Therefore, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds. In total, both sunflowers produce 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

"Let's break down this problem. The company produces 5000 chocolate bars per day at a selling price of $2 per bar. This translates to a daily revenue of $10,000 (5000 bars * $2/bar).

Over a week, their revenue would be $70,000 ($10,000/day * 7 days/week).  

Finally, for two weeks, the total revenue would be $140,000 ($70,000/week * 2 weeks).

"Let's analyze Jake's purchases to determine his total spending.

For the T-shirts, the buy-one-get-one-50% off deal means the second T-shirt is effectively half price.  Therefore, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + ($8 * 0.50) = $12.

The shoes are discounted by 40%, resulting in a price of $40 - ($40 * 0.40) = $24.

Adding the cost of the T-shirts and shoes, Jake's total expenditure is $12 + $24 = $36.

"Let's break down Ryan's financial situation. He earns $6 per week for completing his chores and has done so for three weeks, resulting in a total of $6 * 3 = $18.  After purchasing ice cream cones for himself and three friends at $1.25 each, his expenses amount to $1.25 * 4 = $5. This leaves him with $18 - $5 = $13 for movie tickets. Since each ticket costs $6.50, he can afford to buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"To determine their total expenditure, we need to calculate the individual spending of Ellen and Lani and then sum those amounts. 

Ellen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a photo frame, for a subtotal of $105. Lani purchased sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each, totaling $230.  

Therefore, their combined spending is $105 + $230 = $335.

"Let's analyze Tim's honey and jam venture.  

The cost of producing one jar is the sum of the ingredient costs:

* Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
* Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
* Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20
* Total cost per jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Tim sells each jar for $50, yielding a profit of $50 - $44 = $6 per jar.

Therefore, his profit for selling 10 jars would be $6/jar * 10 jars = $60.

"To determine the total dollar amount, we need to calculate the value of each coin type and sum them.

* Quarters: 32 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $8.00
* Dimes: 95 dimes * $0.10/dime = $9.50
* Nickels: 120 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $6.00
* Pennies: 750 pennies * $0.01/penny = $7.50

Adding these values, we find the total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00.

"Let's analyze Josh's earnings. He services 3 cars daily at a rate of $4 per car, resulting in a daily income of $12.  However, his shop is closed on Sundays and Wednesdays, leaving him with 5 operational days per week. Consequently, his weekly earnings amount to $12/day * 5 days/week = $60.  Over a two-week period, his total earnings would be $60/week * 2 weeks = $120.

"Let's analyze this situation economically.  Matthew can maximize his revenue by segmenting his market.  Selling half his collection at a lower price point and the other half at a premium allows him to capture value from buyers with varying price sensitivities.  

In this case, he'll earn $30 from the first half and $42 from the second, resulting in a total of $72.

"Let's break down this canine excavation problem. The dog digs a total of 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.  Nate then works to reduce this surplus at a rate of 9 holes filled per day, but the dog counteracts this by digging 6 new holes each night. This results in a net reduction of 9 - 6 = 3 holes per day.  Therefore, it will take Nate 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days to fill all the holes. This equates to 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.

"Let's analyze the situation logically. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, totaling 37 items. Igor, however, only managed to place 29 items on the bench. 

Igor brought 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes and 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes. This accounts for 8 + 16 = 24 items.  

Therefore, Igor must have lost 37 - 29 = 8 items. Since he brought the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 8 - (16 - 8) = 0 beakers.

"Let's analyze the situation. James requires 2 screws per leg, and each table has 4 legs.  Therefore, each table needs 2 screws/leg * 4 legs/table = 8 screws. With 4 tables, the total screw requirement is 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws.  Since James possesses 40 screws, he will have 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws remaining.

"To determine the total amount raised, we need to calculate the earnings of each girl and then sum them. 

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, who raised $430, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, meaning Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Finally, the total amount raised is $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

"Let's analyze the situation.  Vanessa's distance is twice Aaron's, implying Aaron covers half the distance Vanessa does. Since Aaron runs each mile at twice Vanessa's speed, his time for a given distance is half of Vanessa's.

We know Aaron completes his portion (half of Vanessa's distance) in 16 minutes.  Therefore, Vanessa, running at half Aaron's speed, would take twice as long to cover the same distance. Consequently, Vanessa's time for her 4-mile run is 16 minutes * 2 = 32 minutes.

However, this only accounts for half of Vanessa's total distance. Since she runs twice as far as Aaron, her total time is 32 minutes * 2 = 64 minutes.

"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we first need to calculate the total profit. A 25% profit on a $80 cost price equates to $20 (0.25 * $80 = $20).  

Adding this profit to the initial cost, the vendor earned a total of $100 from the sale of all watermelons ($80 + $20 = $100).

Finally, dividing the total revenue by the number of watermelons sold gives us the selling price per watermelon: $100 / 50 = $2.

"Let's break down this age problem systematically. Dora will be 12 in three years, meaning she is currently 9 years old.  James is twice Dora's age, making him 18.  Since John was 19 when James was born, he is currently 37 years old. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, making the son 5 years old currently. In three years, the youngest son will be 8 years old.

"Let's analyze the situation. Ana peels oranges at a rate of one orange every three minutes, while Jane takes four minutes per orange.  Over the course of an hour (60 minutes), Ana will peel 20 oranges (60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges). Jane, on the other hand, will peel 15 oranges in the same time frame (60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges).

Therefore, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

"Let's analyze Mark's expenses.  The radiator, originally priced at $400, was obtained at an 80% discount, resulting in a cost of $400 - (0.80 * $400) = $80. The mechanic's labor, at $50 per hour for 3 hours, adds an additional $50/hour * 3 hours = $150. Therefore, Mark's total expenditure is $80 + $150 = $230.

"This problem can be solved using a system of equations. Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows. We know the following:

*  c + w = 20 (The total number of animals is 20)
* 2c + 4w = 70 (The total number of legs is 70)

We can solve for 'c' by substitution. From the first equation, we know w = 20 - c. Substituting this into the second equation gives us:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2c + 80 - 4c = 70
-2c = -10
c = 5

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
