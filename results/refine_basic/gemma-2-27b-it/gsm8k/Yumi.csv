"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So Josh spent $80,000 on the house and another $50,000 on repairs, for a total of $130,000.  The repairs increased the value by 150%, which means the house is now worth $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000 more than before. That brings the total value to $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh's profit is the difference between the final value and his total investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 40 cups. Since each chicken needs 3 cups a day, and she has 20 chickens, she needs a total of 60 cups.  That means she needs to give them 20 more cups in the final meal.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Since every second glass is 60% off, Kylar is basically buying glasses in pairs for a discounted price.  

Each pair costs $5 + ($5 x 0.60) = $8.

He's buying 16 glasses, which is 8 pairs, so the total cost is $8 x 8 = $64.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times that amount, then Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.  

To find the total, we add up the sheep from all three places: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Carla downloads 40% of the file, which is 80 GB, before the restart. That takes her 40 minutes (80 GB / 2 GB/minute). Then there's a 20-minute restart delay.  After that, she has 120 GB left to download, which takes another 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB/minute).

Adding it all up: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  John drives 180 miles out (3 hours * 60 mph). Then, he spends 2 hours stuck, so he's still 180 miles away. He then drives 15 more miles (0.5 hours * 30 mph), putting him 165 miles from home. Finally, he drives another 120 miles (1.5 hours * 80 mph), leaving him 45 miles from home (165 miles - 120 miles).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out Eliza's earnings. 

She makes $10 an hour for her first 40 hours, so that's 40 * $10 = $400.

She worked 5 hours of overtime, and her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.  So her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

Adding her regular pay and overtime pay, Eliza earned a total of $400 + $60 = $460 this week.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The program had 60 downloads the first month. In the second month, it got three times that amount, which is 60 * 3 = 180 downloads. But then in the third month, downloads went down by 30% from the second month. That's a reduction of 180 * 0.30 = 54 downloads. So, the third month had 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Adding up all three months, we get 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

Adding those all up, Toula spent a total of $694. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

It costs $3 each year to take care of the tree, but Carlos makes $10.50 selling the lemons. That means he makes a profit of $7.50 each year. To make back the $90 it cost to plant the tree, it will take him 12 years.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that's after selling some, we need to work backwards. Think of it like this:

* **Before the orange house:** She had 5 + the amount she sold at the orange house. That amount was half of what she had before the red house.
* **Before the red house:** She had double the amount she had before the orange house, plus 2 (the extra she sold at the red house).
* **Before the green house:** She had triple the amount she had before the red house.

Let's say she started with 'x' vacuum cleaners.  We can set up an equation to solve for x! 

Let me know if you want to work through the equation together! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so 20% of the students like contemporary dance, which is 20 students * 0.20 = 4 students. That leaves 20 students - 4 students = 16 students.

Then, 25% of those remaining students like jazz, so that's 16 students * 0.25 = 4 students.

That means 16 students - 4 students = 12 students like hip-hop.

To find the percentage, we do (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%.

"
"Hi there!  Let's see... the jewelry would make a profit of $5000 * 0.025 = $125. The electronic gadgets would make a profit of $8000 * 0.012 = $96.  

So, the merchant should buy the jewelry to maximize profit this month.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Jill's salary. 

She makes $20 an hour teaching and works 35 hours a week doing that, so she earns $20 * 35 = $700 each week from teaching.

As a cheerleading coach, she earns $30 an hour and works 15 hours a week, bringing in $30 * 15 = $450 per week.

In total, she makes $700 + $450 = $1150 every week.

Over a year, that's $1150 * 50 = $57500.

"Hey there! To figure this out, let's think about it step-by-step. Marissa wants to average 4 miles per hour over the whole 12-mile trail.  She's already walked 6 miles in 2 hours. That means she has 6 miles left to go and only 1 hour to do it! To cover those last 6 miles in one hour, she needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The orange drink has 6.67 liters of water (10 liters * 2/3 = 6.67 liters). The pineapple drink has 9 liters of water (15 liters * 3/5 = 9 liters).  

After the spill, there are 9 liters of orange drink left. That means there's a total of 15.67 liters of water in the combined 24 liters (6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Samantha is 31, and Raymond is older by 6 years, making him 37. Raymond had his son when he was 23, so his son is 37 - 23 = 14 years old. That means Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"Hey there!  

If the book is 25% off, that means Kyle paid 75% of the original price. To find the original price, we can set up a proportion: 0.75x = $19.50.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Marie spent $12 on chicken, $15 on milk, and $6 on apples, for a total of $33. That means the pizza cost $17 ($50 - $33 = $17). Since each pizza box costs $8.50, Marie bought 2 boxes of pizza ($17 / $8.50 = 2).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Mishka spent. 

She bought 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each, so that's 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.

Then she got 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each, which is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

Finally, she bought 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each, making it 3 * $42 = $126.00.

To find the total, we add up all the costs: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Cynthia eats ice cream every day for 60 days, so that's 60 servings. Each carton has 15 servings, so she'll need 4 cartons (60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons).  Since each carton costs $4.00, she'll spend $16.00 in total (4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00).

"
"Let's break this down!  One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice that, so they cost $33 * 2 = $66. Together, the heels cost $33 + $66 = $99. Since the boots cost $5 more than the heels, they must be $99 + $5 = $104.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Since Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11, we know their ages are like parts of a whole. If we add those parts together, we get 7 + 11 = 18 parts.

Their total age is 162 years, so each ""part"" represents 162 / 18 = 9 years.

That means Darrell is 7 * 9 = 63 years old, and Allen is 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"
"Hi! Let's figure this out.  

The second friend said 20 more than half of the first friend's guess, so that's 80 / 2 + 20 = 60.

The third friend said 25% more than the first friend's guess, which is 80 * 0.25 + 80 = 100.

Adding up all the guesses, we get 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

Dividing by 3 to find the average, we get 240 / 3 = 80.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can think of it like this:

* **Silver coins:**  Let's say Gretchen has 'x' silver coins.
* **Gold coins:** She'd have 'x + 30' gold coins.

Since she has 110 coins total, we can make an equation: x + (x + 30) = 110

Let's solve for 'x':

* 2x + 30 = 110
* 2x = 80
* x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  

That means she has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins!

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he'll eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts. Since the yogurts come in packs of 4 for $5.00, he'll need 60 / 4 = 15 packs. That means he'll spend 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. John sold enough Lego sets to buy video games and have $5 leftover.  That means he had $165 before buying the games ($160 spent + $5 leftover). Since each Lego set sold for $15, he sold 11 sets ($165 / $15 per set = 11 sets). If he started with 13 sets and sold 11, he has 2 Lego sets left!

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  John runs 3 hours the first day and 1.5 hours each of the other two days, for a total of 6 hours of running per week. Since he runs 60 miles in that time, he must be running at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Dana's skipping speed is half her running speed, so she runs at 3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since she runs four times faster than she walks, her walking speed is 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends 2 hours running (6 hours * 1/3) and 4 hours walking (6 hours * 2/3).

That means she runs 12 miles (6 miles/hour * 2 hours) and walks 6 miles (1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours).

In total, she travels 18 miles!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's is twice as old, then Ben's is 1 * 2 = 2 years old.  Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's, so it's 2 * 4 = 8 years old.

"
"Hmm, let's see... You have 200 calories left and each serving of chips is 250 calories. That means you can only have 0.8 servings.  Since a bag has 5 servings and weighs 300 grams, one serving is 60 grams. So, you can eat 0.8 servings * 60 grams/serving = 48 grams of chips. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure out Charlie's profit. 

He needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). That'll cost him $20.00 (2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00).

Selling all 20 candles will bring in $40.00 (20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00).

So, his profit is $20.00 ($40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday and then 2/5 * 5 = 2 more on Tuesday, for a total of 5 + 2 = 7 articles. On Wednesday, she doubled her Tuesday output, writing 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

That means she wrote a total of 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how many eggs Lloyd gets in a week: 252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs.

Then, we see how many dozens that is: 1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen.

Finally, we multiply that by the price per dozen: 147 dozen * $2/dozen = $294.

Lloyd makes $294 per week from his eggs.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much more the mechanic made on the busier day.

On Thursday, they made $60 per truck tire times 6 tires, which is $360. Plus, they made $40 per car tire times 4 tires, which is $160. So Thursday's total is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, they only worked on cars, earning $40 per tire times 12 tires, for a total of $480.

The difference is $520 - $480 = $40.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Aleena pays $140 a month for the first six months, so that's $140 * 6 = $840.

For the next six months, she gets a 10% discount, which is $140 * 0.10 = $14 off her monthly bill.

That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the last six months, totaling $126 * 6 = $756.

Adding the two halves together, Aleena pays a total of $840 + $756 = $1596 for the whole year.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

So Shiela's buying five phones at $150 each, which means they cost $750 in total.  Since there's a 2% interest on each phone, that's an extra $3 per phone (150 x 0.02 = 3).  With five phones, the total interest is $15.

Adding the interest to the original price, Shiela needs to pay $765 overall.  Spread out over three months, her monthly payment will be $255 ($765 / 3 = 255).

* He sells 12 marigolds for a total of 12 * $3 = $36
* He sells 9 petunias for a total of 9 * $2 = $18
* He sells 17 begonias for a total of 17 * $2 = $34

Adding those up, Artie makes $36 + $18 + $34 = $88 today.

"Hi! Let's figure this out.  If the top level is 16 square feet and each level is half the size of the one below it, we can work our way down:

* The third level is 16 * 2 = 32 square feet.
* The second level is 32 * 2 = 64 square feet.
* The first level is 64 * 2 = 128 square feet.

Adding all the levels together: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

To find the average, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The puppy needs 1 cup a day for the first 180 days, so that's 180 cups. Then it needs 2 cups a day for the rest of the year, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. That's another 370 cups (2 x 185).

In total, Cecilia needs 550 cups (180 + 370). Since each bag has 110 cups, she'll need 5 bags (550 / 110).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half as much, he does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.  David does 4 times less than Sarah, so he does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds. That means Raymond does 200 - 100 = 100 pounds more laundry than David.

"Hi there! Let's figure out the best deal for Vincent. 

Buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 would cost 18 / 3 = 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.00.

Buying them in packages of 2 would cost 18 / 2 = 9 packages * $1.00 per package = $9.00.

Vincent saves $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00 by choosing the packages of 2.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many stickers Charlie has left. 

He started with 10, got 21 more, and then 23 for his birthday! That's 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The alarm rang 4 times the first time, then 4 times * 3 = 12 times the second time. The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so that's 12 times / 2 = 6 times.

In total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Sylvie gets a 10% raise every year after five years.  

* After one year, her salary will be $600 + ($600 * 0.10) = $660.
* After two years, it'll be $660 + ($660 * 0.10) = $726.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much potato salad Ted needs.

Okay, so adults eat 10 pounds each, and there are 20 adults, so that's 10 * 20 = 200 pounds of potato salad right there.

Kids eat half as much, so they'll eat 10 / 2 = 5 pounds each. With 5 kids, that's 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

In total, Ted needs 200 + 25 = 225 pounds of potato salad!

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and is 2 seconds faster than Gerald, that means Gerald originally ran it in 40 seconds.  

Since Gerald improved his time by 10%, we need to find 10% of 40 seconds: 40 * 0.10 = 4 seconds.

That means Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, that means there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats.

That's a lot of cats!  

So, there are 120 cats + 60 dogs = 180 dogs and cats in total.

The problem says there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Adding them all up, there are 168 rabbits + 180 dogs and cats = 348 pets in the neighborhood.

If 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, then 80 girls are in the Girl Scouts (2/3 * 120 = 80).  

That means 40 girls are not in the Girl Scouts (120 - 80 = 40).

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find the space inside each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each outside measurement (one inch from each side). That means each box is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches on the inside.

To find the volume, we multiply those numbers together: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has three boxes, we multiply that volume by 3: 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches.

Beatrice ate 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups. Marcell ate 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups. Together they ate 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups.  Since there are two of them, they ate an average of 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups each.

"Let's see... Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so she rows at a speed of 1.25 feet per second.  It takes her 64 seconds to get to shore, meaning she rows 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water every 10 feet, over 80 feet it takes on 80 feet / 10 feet/intake * 2 liters/intake = 16 liters of water.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Sasha's profit. 

Her 2x4s cost her $100 originally, and with the price increase, she can sell them for $150.  Her 4x4s cost $80 and she can sell those for $120.

That means she'll make $150 + $120 = $270 in total.

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

Adrien earned 30% more than Lylah, meaning if Lylah earned $100, Adrien earned $130.  We know Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, so that means $40,000 represents 130% of Lylah's salary from four years ago.

To find Lylah's salary from four years ago, we can divide Adrien's salary by 1.30: $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

Now, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so four years later he's making $40,000 + (0.40 * $40,000) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased, so four years later she's making $30,769.23 + (0.30 * $30,769.23) = $40,000.

Finally, to find their combined salary, we add their individual salaries: $56,000 + $40,000 = $96,000.

"Let's see... Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. Then she slept 2 hours less each of the next two days, so that's 8 - 2 = 6 hours each night. That's a total of 6 + 6 = 12 hours. For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, meaning 6 + 1 = 7 hours each night.  Since there are 4 more days, that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.  Adding it all up, Sadie slept 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours total.

* Dillon buys 4 watermelons for a total of 4 * $45 = $180.
* He buys 20 peppers for a total of 20 * $15 = $300.
* He buys 10 oranges for a total of 10 * $40 = $400.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so the hospital sees 500 patients a day, and each visit takes 24 minutes. That's a total of 12,000 minutes (500 x 24) of doctor time, which is equal to 200 hours (12,000 / 60).

The doctors cost the hospital $150 per hour, so that's $30,000 for the day (200 x 150). But they charge patients $200 per hour, bringing in $40,000 (200 x 200).

That means the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 each day ($40,000 - $30,000).

If there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens, we can think of it like this:

* Imagine the queens are 1 group.
* The babies are 2 groups (twice as many as the queens).
* The workers are 4 groups (twice as many as the babies).

That means there are 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 groups of bees in total.

Since there are 700 bees altogether, each group has 700 / 7 = 100 bees.

The worker bees are 4 groups, so there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. If Charlie has 12 friends and that's three times the number Dorothy has, then Dorothy has 12 / 3 = 4 friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so he has 4 * 4 = 16 friends.

"Let's figure this out!

First, we need to know how long it takes each of them to get home.  Steve has to go 3 miles, which is 15840 feet (3 miles * 5280 feet/mile). Since he bikes at 440 feet per minute, it'll take him 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.

Tim has a shorter trip of 2 miles, or 10560 feet.  At 264 feet per minute, it'll take him 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

That means Steve will be waiting for Tim for 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Shawnda made. 

She inflated 10 tires from bicycles (5 bikes * 2 tires each), 9 tires from tricycles (3 trikes * 3 tires each), and 1 tire from the unicycle. That's a total of 20 tires!

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, she made 20 * $0.25 = $5.00.

"Hi there! This sounds like a tricky situation for Dave! Let's see...

* The seagull ate half of Dave's 14 fries, so that's 14 / 2 = 7 fries.

* That means there were 14 + 7 = 21 fries left.

* The pigeons ate 3 fries each, for a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.

* So, there were 21 - 9 = 12 fries left.

* The raccoon was sneaky and took two-thirds of those, which is (2/3) * 12 = 8 fries.

* That leaves 12 - 8 = 4 fries.

* Since only 5 fries were left at the end, the ants must have taken 1 fry.

*  Working backwards, there were 5 - 1 = 4 fries before the ants.

* Adding up all the fries, we get 4 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 14 = 43 fries!

Dave must have started with a big pack of 43 fries!

"Let's break this down! Kimo has 9 hours of class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays (3 classes x 1 hour/class x 3 days). He has 8 hours of class on Tuesdays and Thursdays (2 classes x 2 hours/class x 2 days). That's a total of 17 hours per week. Over a 16-week semester, he spends 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours in class.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find the total length of each type of bread in inches.  

* The rolls are 300 * 4 inches = 1200 inches long.
* The croissants are 120 * 6 inches = 720 inches long.
* The baguettes are 60 * 2 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches long.

Now, let's add up all the lengths: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

Finally, we convert that to feet: 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet.

"Hmm, let's see... the monkeys eat 200 bananas a month, the gorillas eat 400, and the baboons eat 100. That's 700 bananas in total each month! Since the zookeeper orders bananas every two months, he needs 700 times 2, which is 1400 bananas.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field, so he runs 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, covering 80 yards each time (40 yards there and 40 yards back). That's 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. In total, Kelly runs 100 + 2720 = 2820 yards.

Kelly runs 2820 - 1500 = 1320 yards farther than Blake.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.  

If the price goes up 20% every two months, that means it goes up $4 each time ($20 x 0.20 = $4).

Over 36 months, there are 18 of these price increases (36 / 2 = 18).

So, the price goes up a total of $72 ($4 x 18 = $72).

Adding that to the original price, the bag of marbles would cost $92 after 36 months ($20 + $72 = $92).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can think of it like this:

* Brooke's age = 1 part
* Seth's age = 2 parts

In two years, they'll both be older, so we need to add 2 to each of their ages.  

Since their ages in two years will add up to 28, we can set up a little equation:

1 part + 2 + 2 parts + 2 = 28

Combining like terms:

3 parts + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

3 parts = 24

Dividing both sides by 3:

1 part = 8

So Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice her age, he's 16!

"Hi there! Let's help Jessica figure out her payments.

Now, we add the extra amount to her minimum payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500 per month.

Finally, to find her yearly payment, we multiply her monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18000.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money Zaid has left. 

First, we need to see how much he spends on rent and fuel:

* Fuel: (1/3) * $6000 = $2000

That's a total of $1500 + $2000 = $3500.

He has $6000 - $3500 = $2500 left.

He donates half of that, which is $2500 / 2 = $1250.

Now, let's add up all his expenses: $3500 (rent and fuel) + $1250 (donation) + $200 (daughter) + $700 (wife) = $5650

Finally, subtract his total expenses from his salary: $6000 - $5650 = $350


Zaid will have $350 left.

Let's break this down.  There are three numbers on a die bigger than 3 (4, 5, and 6), so there's a 50% chance of rolling one. To get two even numbers in a row, you need to get an even number, then another even number. Each of those has a 50% chance, so the chance of both happening is 25%. That means rolling a number bigger than 3 is 25% *more* likely.

Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 more each year, so after 10 years he's planted 100 more trees (10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees). But he also chops down 2 trees each year, so he loses 20 trees over those 10 years (2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees).

That means he has 130 trees after 10 years (50 + 100 - 20 = 130).  

Uh oh, 30% of those trees die! That's 39 trees (130 trees * 0.30 = 39 trees).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If we let 'r' be the number of red chickens and 'w' be the number of white chickens, we know a couple of things:

* There are two more white chickens than red chickens, so w = r + 2.
* All the chickens together lay 42 eggs a day, and red chickens lay 3 eggs each while white chickens lay 5. That means 3r + 5w = 42.

We can use these facts to solve for 'r'. Let's substitute 'r + 2' for 'w' in the second equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplifying that gives us:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4

So, Jerry has **4** red chickens.

"Hi there! To figure out how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to find the total cost of the shoes and belt. That's $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.  Then, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage: $352.00 / $8.00 per hour = 44 hours.

Lori needs to work 44 hours. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Janeth owes $2000 plus 10% interest, which is $200. That means she needs to pay back a total of $2200.

If she pays $165 each month for 12 months, she'll have paid $165 * 12 = $1980.

Subtracting that from the total amount owed, she'll still have $2200 - $1980 = $220 left to pay.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Harriet is 21 now, and Adrian is three times her age, so he's 21 * 3 = 63 years old. Zack is twice Harriet's age, making him 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

In three years, Harriet will be 24, Adrian will be 66, and Zack will be 45.  That means their total age will be 24 + 66 + 45 = 135.  

The average age of the three in three years will be 135 / 3 = 45.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out Jojo's score.  

Naomi scored 68 points, and Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, which is 34 + 10 = 44 points. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she got 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Together, Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since the four students scored a total of 251 points, Jojo must have scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Carmen spent 30 minutes on crosswords (3 puzzles * 10 minutes/puzzle) and 40 minutes on sudokus (8 puzzles * 5 minutes/puzzle).  That means she spent a total of 70 minutes playing games.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Celine started with 120 liters and used 90, leaving her with 30 liters.  Then she collected double that amount in rainwater, which is 60 liters.  

So, 30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters in the tank now! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, so he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.  In total, he plants 90 + 50 = 140 flowers.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Carlos and Benji spend. Carlos pays $30 per hour for his canoe and uses it for 3 hours, so that's $30 * 3 = $90. Benji pays $18 per hour for his raft and uses it for 5 hours, so his cost is $18 * 5 = $90.  

Adding their costs together, they pay a total of $90 + $90 = $180.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so James starts with 32 water Pokemon (40 - 8). He has a total of 96 Pokemon (30 + 34 + 32).  

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type, we do (32 / 96) * 100% which equals 33.33%. Rounding that to the nearest integer gives us 33%.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Chad owes. 

His burrito starts at $6.50. Then he adds $2.00 for meat, $1.00 for cheese, $1.00 for avocado, and $0.50 for two sauces. That's a total of $11.00 so far.

Adding the $3.00 meal upgrade brings it to $14.00.  But he has a $5.00 gift card, so he only owes $9.00.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready at first, so that's 30/100 * 120 = 36 watermelons.

That left 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Then, 3/4 of those were ready two weeks later, meaning 3/4 * 84 = 63 watermelons were picked.

So, there were 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons left.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Mark spends $20,000 per car times 12 cars, which is $240,000. Then he pays 10% tax on that, so that's another $24,000.  Adding those together, the cars and tax cost $264,000.  Don't forget the $1000 registration fee per car, so that's another $12,000.  In total, Mark pays $276,000 for everything.

"
"Hi there!  Let's see... 36 penguins start sunbathing, and then one-third go swimming and another one-third go eat. That means 2 groups of 12 penguins leave the sunbathing spot.  So, 36 - 24 = 12 penguins are still left sunbathing!

"Hmm, let's see... Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes a day, and his girlfriend eats half that amount, so she eats 3. Together, that's 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes a day.  

In a week, they'd need 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes a week, Steve needs 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but now he only has 3.  Each of those pen pals sends him 2 letters a week, and he writes 2 back, so that's 6 letters he writes and 6 letters he receives each week.  Each letter is 5 pages long, so that's 60 pages total! If he writes a page every 6 minutes, that means he spends 360 minutes writing each week.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 6 hours writing each week.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so the makeup artist charges $250 an hour and it takes 6 hours each day, so that's $250 * 6 = $1500 per day.

She needs it done 4 times a week, so that's $1500 * 4 = $6000 per week.

The movie is 5 weeks long, making the total cost $6000 * 5 = $30000.

But wait! There's a 10% discount because it was a big job. That's $30000 * 0.10 = $3000 off.

So, Jean paid $30000 - $3000 = $27000 for her makeup.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Sue ate a lot of cookies! On Monday, she ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. That's 20 * 200 = 4000 calories! Her sister only ate 5 * 200 = 1000 calories.

On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies, which is 26 * 200 = 5200 calories. Her sister had 13 * 200 = 2600 calories.

In total, Sue ate 4000 + 5200 = 9200 calories, and her sister ate 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories.

That means Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, so she went down 30 * 0.30 = 9 fewer times. That means Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so he went down 21 * 4 = 84 times.

"Hmm, let me see...  

If there are 20 stalls with 20 cows each, that's 20 * 20 = 400 cows! Then Mr. Sylas adds 40 more cows, so now there are 400 + 40 = 440 cows.

He puts the new cows in all the stalls, so each stall gets 440 / 20 = 22 cows.

Finally, 8 stalls would have 8 * 22 = 176 cows.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.  

The redwood is 200 feet tall and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, so it has 200 / 10 = 20 sections. That means it originally weighed 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

Those pesky termites ate 30%, which is 8000 * 0.30 = 2400 pounds.

That leaves the redwood weighing 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Andrea has 52 apples and that's 8 more than Jamal, then Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, meaning she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

In total, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

That means they have a combined total of 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

The house costs $350,000, but there's also a 5% brokerage fee and a 12% transfer fee.  

* Brokerage fee: $350,000 * 0.05 = $17,500
* Transfer fee: $350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000

Adding those to the selling price: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

That's $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's $400,000 budget.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Mr. Tan's net proceeds. 

First, we need to find out how much he paid in fees:

* Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = $12,000
* Brokerage fees: 5% of $400,000 = $20,000
* Total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

Now, let's add the remaining loan amount to his fees:

* Total expenses: $32,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

Finally, subtract the total expenses from the selling price to find his net proceeds:

* Net proceeds: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000


Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house are $118,000. 

"
"Hmm, let's see... it takes 20 minutes to get to 300 degrees, and then 40% longer to reach 400 degrees.  That means it takes 20 * 0.40 = 8 more minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up.

Then, cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating, so that's 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

In total, from starting the oil to finishing cooking, it takes 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

The collar takes 1/10th the stitches of the body, so that's 900 / 10 = 90 stitches. The rosette takes twice the collar stitches, meaning it uses 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

Together, the body, collar, and rosette use 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, each sleeve must use (1800 - 1170) / 2 = 315 stitches.

Scene 2 has 6 more lines than the song, meaning it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. He has to memorize four-fifths of those, which is 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines.

Adding up all his lines, Sean needs to memorize 36 + 48 + 54 = 138 lines.

That means 24 cards are left (48 - 24 = 24). Of those, 5/8 have the letter C, which is 15 cards (24 * 5/8 = 15).

Finally, 9 cards are left with the letter D (24 - 15 = 9).

Okay, so Matthew takes 3 minutes per small hole and he's digging 30 of those. That's 30 * 3 = 90 minutes.

For the large holes, it's 10 minutes each and he's doing 15, so that's 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.

In total, that's 90 + 150 = 240 minutes of digging.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.  

If Ruby is 6 times older than Sam now, that means Ruby's age is 6 times Sam's age. In 9 years, Ruby will be even older, and 3 times Sam's age at that time.  

To solve this, we can think about it like this:

* Let's say Sam is ""s"" years old now.
* Ruby is 6 times Sam's age, so Ruby is 6s years old now.
* In 9 years, Sam will be s + 9 years old.
* In 9 years, Ruby will be 6s + 9 years old.

We know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times Sam's age then. So:

6s + 9 = 3(s + 9)

Let's solve for ""s"":

6s + 9 = 3s + 27
3s = 18
s = 6

So Sam is 6 years old now!

In the second week, they each doubled their stories. So Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories. That's 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories for the second week.

Altogether, they wrote 120 + 240 = 360 stories.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

On the second day, Darren does 120 pushups, 40 squats, and 40 dumbbell presses.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal and they eat twice a day, that's 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg of rice per person each day.

With 5 people eating, that's a total of 0.4 kg/person * 5 people = 2 kg of rice per day.

A 42 kg bag will last 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days.

That's 21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks!

To see how far off he was, we subtract: 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

Sam was 55 crates off from his target.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much John pays for his driving service.

Okay, so he travels 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home every day, which is 60 miles total. He does this 5 days a week, so that's 300 miles per week. Over a year, with 50 weeks of work, he covers 15,000 miles (300 miles/week * 50 weeks).

At $2 per mile, that's $30,000 just for the mileage. Plus, he gives his driver a $150 bonus each month, totaling $1,800 per year ($150/month * 12 months).

Adding those together, John pays $31,800 a year for his driving service.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Elise sold 45 books this year, and twice that amount in the first year, so she sold 45 * 2 = 90 books in the first year.  That means she's sold a total of 90 + 45 = 135 books. Since she has 50 books left, she sold 135 - 50 = 85 books in the second year.  

That means she earned 85 * $20 = $1700 in the second year.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Theo has left for gifts. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 suits * $100/suit = $600.

Then, the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150.

His flight ticket is a bit trickier: 5 times the cost of a suit is $500, and $700 more than that is $1200.

So far, he's spent $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

If he started with $6000 and wants to save $2000, he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left for expenses and gifts.

Subtracting his other expenses, he has $4000 - $1950 = $2050 for gifts.

"Hey there! Let's crack this problem.  

Six years ago, Cera was 40, and Noah was half her age, meaning Noah was 20.  That means the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, or 3000 * 20 = 60000.

Since the population six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 60000 * 2 = 120000.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If we call the number of players on defense ""d"", we know the offense has twice that many, or 2*d* players. The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, which is *d*/2.

Since all the players together make up 105, we can write an equation: 2*d* + *d* + *d*/2 = 105

Combining the 'd' terms, we get 3.5*d* = 105.

Dividing both sides by 3.5 tells us that *d* = 30.


So there are **30** players on the defense. 

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how many people made it to Martha's party.  

She invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 people.

Then she invited 3 families with 4 people each, which is 3 * 4 = 12 more people.

That's a total of 12 + 12 = 24 people invited.

But 8 people got sick and couldn't come, and 8 / 4 = 2 people had other plans.

So, in total, 8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't make it.

That means 24 - 10 = 14 people were at the party!

"Hi there! Let's break down this problem. 

First, we know 40 out of the 100 employees are junior programmers because that's 2/5 of the total.  Since each junior programmer makes $2000 a month, the company pays them a total of $80,000 (40 programmers * $2000/programmer).

Senior programmers make $400 more than junior programmers, so they earn $2400 each. With 60 senior programmers, the company pays them $144,000 (60 programmers * $2400/programmer).

Adding the junior and senior programmer salaries together, the company pays a total of $224,000 per month.

"Hmm, let's see... 20 people were on the bus before the third stop, and 7 got off at the second stop. That means there were 20 + 7 = 27 people on the bus before the second stop. Then 8 people got on at the second stop, so there were 27 - 8 = 19 people on the bus after the first stop.  Finally, 5 people got on at the first stop, so there must have been 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus at the terminal.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we need to find out how much Nick makes after taxes for each job.

For Job A, he earns $15 an hour times 2000 hours, which is $30,000.  With a 20% tax rate, he pays $6,000 in taxes, leaving him with $24,000.

For Job B, he makes a flat $42,000. After paying $6,000 in property tax, he has $36,000 left. Then, a 10% tax on that amount is $3,600, leaving him with $32,400.

That means Job B pays him $8,400 more than Job A.

Maria starts with 8 shares at $8 each, so that's 8 * $8 = $64.

The first year, the price goes up 50%, which is like half the original price: $8 / 2 = $4. So each share is now worth $8 + $4 = $12.

The second year, the price drops 25%, which is a quarter of the new price: $12 / 4 = $3.  That means each share is now worth $12 - $3 = $9.

Since she has 8 shares, they're worth a total of 8 * $9 = $72.

*  Imagine the two bigger groups combined have 'x' students.
* The smaller group has 'x - 10' students.
* All together, that's x + x + (x - 10) = 200 students.

Let's solve for x:

* 3x - 10 = 200
* 3x = 210
* x = 70

So, each of the bigger groups has 70 students. The smaller group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can think of it like this:

* **Cows:** Let's say there are 'x' cows.
* **Chickens:** That means there are '2x' chickens.

Since he has 60 animals total, we can make an equation: x + 2x = 60

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 3x = 60.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 20. So there are 20 cows.

That means there are 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, let's count the legs!

* **Cows:** 20 cows * 4 legs each = 80 legs
* **Chickens:** 40 chickens * 2 legs each = 80 legs

Adding those together, all the animals have 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

* Red bird: 30 pounds (20 pounds less than the frog)

Adding up all the animals' weights: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so that's 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. He also watched 3 shows at 2 hours each, for a total of 3 * 2 = 6 hours of shows.

That means he spent 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours boating, swimming, and watching shows. We know that's 30% of his total vacation time.

To find his total vacation time, we can divide the time we know (15 hours) by the percentage it represents (30% or 0.30): 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours.

Finally, he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so he spent 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours sightseeing.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Billy spent half his change on gumballs, that means he had $4.00 left after buying candy ($2.00 for gumballs is half of $4.00). Since candy costs $1.50 a pound, he must have bought 2.67 pounds of candy.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. If Carver is 45 and that's 5 years less than twice his son's age, we can set up a little equation.  Twice his son's age would be 45 + 5 = 50.  So, his son is 50 / 2 = 25 years old.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The train travels 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles between the first two cities. Then it goes 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles back to the starting city. That means each full trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this three times a day, it travels 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles every day.

To find out how many days it can go between services, we divide the total service mileage by the daily mileage: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. A collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing (that's right in the middle of a Rottweiler's 8 pounds and a chihuahua's 2 pounds).  

So, for the chihuahuas, Mark needs 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds of stuffing.

For the collies, he needs 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds of stuffing.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how long John's trip took. 

Going to his friend's house took him 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

The return trip was 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Adding those together, his total trip time was 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

"Hmm, let me see... 

So, 3 people got kicked out for not wearing masks. Then, four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting, which is 3 * 4 - 5 = 7 people.  Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for fighting over sales, so that's 7 * 3 = 21 people.

In total, that's 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people kicked out for those reasons. Since 50 people were kicked out in total, that means 50 - 31 = 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

"Hi there! Let's figure out the cost of these senior gifts. 

Okay, so 44 seniors need picture frames at $20 each, that's $880.  Each frame also needs etching which adds 20% of $20, or $4 per frame. So etching all the frames will cost $176.

Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so that's $10.

Now, a quarter of the seniors are officers, which is 11 officers. They each need cords that cost $12, so that's $132 for the cords.

Adding it all up: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

They sold 14 pairs on Friday, then double that on Saturday, which is 28 pairs. On Sunday, they sold half of Saturday's amount, so that's 14 pairs. But then 6 pairs were returned, leaving them with 8 pairs sold on Sunday.

Adding up all the days: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs

So the answer is 50!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

To find out Karan's monthly payment, we need to calculate the total amount she'll repay and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's find the total interest:

* Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
* Interest = ($3650 * 10 * 5) / 100 = $1825

Now, let's find the total amount Karan needs to repay:

* Total amount = Principal + Interest
* Total amount = $3650 + $1825 = $5475

Finally, divide the total amount by the number of months:

* Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
* Monthly payment = $5475 / 5 = $1095


Karan has to pay $1095 each month.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Cho hiked for a long time! 

Cho hiked 14 kilometers every hour for 8 hours, so he hiked 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers.

"Hi there!  

Let's figure this out. If Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, that means the 12.8 hectares represent 2/5 of his original land.  To find the total land he started with, we can set up a proportion:

(2/5) * Original Land = 12.8 hectares

To solve for the Original Land, we can divide both sides by (2/5):

Original Land = 12.8 hectares / (2/5) = 32 hectares

If the popsicle ratio is 5:6, that means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  

If they have 165 popsicles total, we need to figure out how many are in each ""part"" of the ratio.  

165 popsicles divided by 11 (5 + 6) parts equals 15 popsicles per part.

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 75 popsicles (5 x 15). Sam has 6 parts, so he has 90 popsicles (6 x 15).

That means Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty!

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Tyson will spend.

He needs enough sandwiches for 20 people, and each sandwich feeds 4, so he'll need 5 sandwiches (20 / 4 = 5).

Each sandwich uses 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, meaning he'll need 5 pounds of each.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so that's $35.00 total for the meat (5 * $7.00 = $35.00).

The cheese is $3.00 per pound, making the cheese cost $15.00 (5 * $3.00 = $15.00).

Adding the cost of the meat and cheese together, Tyson will spend $50.00  ($35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

In May, the company paid each employee $15/hour * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = $2400 per month.  That means they paid out $2400/employee * 40 employees = $96,000 in May.

In June, they had 40 employees * (1/4) = 10 fewer employees, leaving 30. Their total June payroll was $2400/employee * 30 employees = $72,000.

"Hmm, let's see... Kenny wants to go to the amusement park, which costs $100. He has some extra cash for snacks and stuff, so he made $50 from selling his cards.  If each card is worth $1.50, that means he sold 33 cards (50 / 1.5 = 33.33, but you can't sell parts of cards!).

Since he sold 2/3 of his cards, those 33 cards represent two-thirds of his total collection. To find the whole amount, we divide the number of cards sold by 2/3, which gives us 49.5.  Since he can't have half a card, Kenny must have started with 50 cards!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If 15 gallons of gas are split evenly into 5 containers, each container would have 3 gallons (15 / 5 = 3). Josey needs a quarter of a container, which is 0.75 gallons (3 x 0.25 = 0.75).  Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, Josey needs 6 pints of gas (0.75 x 8 = 6).

"Let's see... George had $5 and spent 1% of it, which is $0.05. That means he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95 on snacks.

He bought 3 bags of chips for a total of 3 * $0.40 = $1.20.  

That leaves $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 for candy bars.

Since each candy bar costs $0.75, he bought $3.75 / $0.75 = 5 candy bars.

"Hi there! Let's figure out the cost per serving of Antoine's soup. 

First, he doubles the onions to 2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds. That'll cost him 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00.

The beef stock costs 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00.

In total, the ingredients cost $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, each serving costs $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00.

"Hi there! To find the perimeter, we need to know the width of the room.  We can do that by dividing the area by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now, the perimeter is twice the length plus twice the width: 2 * 9 feet + 2 * 40 feet = 18 feet + 80 feet = 98 feet.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The oven heats the house up by 15 degrees (5 degrees per hour for 3 hours). That brings the temperature to 55 degrees. Then the window cools it down by 6 degrees (2 degrees every 10 minutes for 30 minutes).

So the final temperature is 49 degrees! 



"
"Let's break this down!

Jon's total time is 40 minutes + 80 minutes + 50 minutes = 170 minutes.

James swims 10% faster than Jon, so he takes 40 minutes * 0.90 = 36 minutes to swim.

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 170 minutes - 10 minutes = 160 minutes.

To find James's run time, we subtract his swim and bike times from his total time: 160 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 39 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Movie C was 1.25 hours long, which is 75 minutes. Movie B was 5 minutes longer than that, so it was 80 minutes long. Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, it was 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes long.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to see how far the horse runs. It goes 32 miles per hour for half an hour, so that's 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

For every mile, the horse eats half a bale of hay, so it eats 16 * 0.5 = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so the hay will cost 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is 6 * $5 = $30.

After buying the hay, he'll have $30 - $24 = $6 left.

First, we need to find out how much each balloon cost originally. If 20 balloons cost $900, then each balloon cost $900 / 20 = $45.

After the price increase, each balloon costs $45 + $20 = $65.

Finally, to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons, we multiply the new price by 170: $65 * 170 = $11050.

"Hi there! To find the average speed, we need to think about the total distance traveled and the total time it took.  

The car went 60 mph for 2 hours, so that's 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then it went 30 mph for 1 hour, adding another 30 miles. That's a total of 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The whole trip took 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

So, the average speed is 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

Each bag holds 2 cubic feet, so he'll need 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Finally, at $12 per bag, the total cost will be 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

That means there are 15 + 24 = 39 red and green cards in total.

Since there are as many yellow cards as red and green cards combined, there are also 39 yellow cards.

Adding them all up, there are 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.

* Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
* Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add it all up: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, so the farmer needs 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips.

For a 3-day stay, the hotel will cost $1800 * 3 = $5400.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, so for two people, they'll be $5000 * 2 = $10000.

"Okay, so we have nine cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall, and one who is 60 inches.  That means the tallest layer of the pyramid will be 64 inches. Then we have a layer of 3 cheerleaders at 64 inches each, so that's 64 x 3 = 192 inches.  Then another layer of 2 cheerleaders at 64 inches each, which is 64 x 2 = 128 inches. Finally, the bottom layer has 4 cheerleaders at 64 inches each, so that's 64 x 4 = 256 inches.

Adding all those layers together: 256 + 128 + 192 + 64 = 640 inches.

But wait! We have to add the shortest cheerleader on top, who is 60 inches tall. So the total height is 640 + 60 = 700 inches.

Venue 1 costs $200 plus $5 per guest (5x), so the total cost is $200 + $5x.

Venue 2 costs $25 per guest, so the total cost is $25x.

To find when they're equal, we set the two costs equal to each other: $200 + $5x = $25x

Subtracting $5x from both sides gives us: $200 = $20x

Finally, dividing both sides by $20 tells us x = 10.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If we call the number of insects Bodhi found ""B"", David found half that amount, or B/2. Lily found 7 more than David, so she found B/2 + 7 insects.

B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combining like terms:

2B + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

2B = 36

Dividing both sides by 2:

B = 18

That means Bodhi found 18 insects. David found half that, or 9 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so she found 16 insects.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Janet spends $4.40 each day on bus fare (2 trips x $2.20 per trip). Over five days, that's $22.00.  Since the weekly pass is $20.00, she'd save $2.00.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The zoo has a lot more cows than the farm!  If the farm has 30 cows and the zoo has twice that, the zoo must have 30 * 2 = 60 cows.

And the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.

Okay, let's add up all the animals:

* Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
* Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Together, they have 40 + 80 = 120 animals!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Rose bought 12 onions and that's 4 times more than Sophia, so Sophia bought 12 onions / 4 = 3 onions. Rose also bought 4 potatoes, which is 4 times more than Sophia, so Sophia bought 4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato.  In total, Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items.

"Hey there! To figure this out, we need to know how many days are between now and Andy's birthday.  Let's say there are about 200 days until July 19th.

Since he wants to lose 30 pounds and each pound takes 3500 calories to burn, he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find out how many calories he needs to cut each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories per day.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Hannah runs 8 laps at 0.25 km each, she'll run a total of 2 kilometers (8 x 0.25 = 2). Since she needs 60 ml of water per kilometer, she'll need 120 ml in total (2 x 60 = 120).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Julie starts with $500. She spends 20% on clothes, which is $100 (20/100 * $500 = $100). That leaves her with $400. Then she spends 25% of that on CDs, which is another $100 (25/100 * $400 = $100).  So, Julie has $300 left.

"
"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. If the house cost three times as much as the lot, we can think of it like this: the lot is one part, and the house is three parts. That makes a total of four parts.

Since the whole thing costs $120,000, one part (the cost of the lot) is $120,000 / 4 = $30,000.

The house, being three parts, costs 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.


$90,000 

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out Tara's profit. She bought 8 packs of 5 bags, so that's 8 * 5 = 40 bags total.  She spent 40 * $4 = $160 on the bags. Then she sold them for 40 * $8 = $320.  Her profit is $320 - $160 = $160.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Martha needs a lot of wool for all those cozy winter clothes!

* Each grandchild needs 2 skeins for a hat + 4 for a scarf + 12 for a sweater + 1 for mittens + 2 for socks = 21 skeins.
* Since she has 3 grandchildren, she'll need 21 skeins/grandchild * 3 grandchildren = 63 skeins of wool.

"Hi there! Let's help Chris out with his math homework. 

Okay, so he did 12 problems on Monday and then 3 times that on Tuesday, which is 12 * 3 = 36 problems. That's a total of 12 + 36 = 48 problems done.

He started with 100 problems, so he has 100 - 48 = 52 left. On Wednesday, he finished another 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

That means he has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left to do on Thursday.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means they paint 1/10 of the house each day.  With five people, they'd paint 5 times faster, so they'd paint 1/2 the house each day.  That means it would take them 2 days to paint the whole house, which is 48 hours! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she must have 22 chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 66 chairs.  Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 64 sofas.

In total, they have 84 sofas (20 + 64) and 88 chairs (22 + 66), which means they have a total of 172 sofas and chairs.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Josh's total workout time. 

He worked out for 4 hours a week for most of the 8 weeks, so that's 6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours.

Then he had two weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each, adding another 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours.

Finally, there was one week with a 6-hour workout.

Adding it all up: 24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Okay, so 48 people start on the bus. Then 8 get off, and 40 get on (that's 8 times 5!).  So now there are 80 people on the bus.

At the next stop, 21 people get off, and only 2 get on (that's 8 divided by 3, rounded down since you can't have parts of people). That means there are 61 people left on the bus.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If the computer cost $1100 and the printer cost $400 less, that means the printer cost $700. Together, the computer and printer cost $1800.  Since Errol spent $2400 total, that means the two monitors cost $600.  

If two monitors cost $600, then one monitor costs $300.

"Hi!  Let's see... the boys each found 60 seashells, and there were 10 girls. The girls found the same amount as the boys plus four times that amount, so they each found 60 + (4 * 60) = 300 shells.  

That means each girl found 300 / 10 = 30 seashells.

"Let's see... Ali calls 3 families first. Then each of those families calls 3 more, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 families.  Those 9 families each call 3 more, making it 9 times 3, or 27 families.  And in the fourth round, those 27 families each call 3, so that's 27 times 3, which equals 81 families.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Daniel needs to spend. 

Five notebooks will cost him 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.

Two pens will cost him 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.

The calculator is $12.00, and the geometry set is $10.00.

Adding those all up, we get $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

But wait! There's a 10% discount.  That means he saves $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00.

"Hmm, let's see...  

When the water is warm, Ray takes twice as long as his cold water time plus 2 minutes, so that's 16 minutes * 2 + 2 minutes = 34 minutes per mile.

For 3 miles in cold water, it takes him 16 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes him 34 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 102 minutes.

That means he takes 102 minutes - 48 minutes = 54 minutes longer in warm water.

"Let's break this down!

We know Juan needs to get down to 4 cups of coffee a day.  He currently drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the recommended amount.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so she weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, meaning he weighs 130 * 2 = 260 pounds.

To find the average, we add up their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds. Then, we divide by 3 since there are three friends: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Pete gets 90 contacts per box and they last him 45 days, that means each pair lasts him 45 days / 45 pairs = 1 day.

Since he buys two boxes, he'll have 90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts.

That's 180 contacts / 2 contacts per pair = 90 pairs of contacts.

Each box costs $100.00, but it's 10% off, so he pays $100.00 - ($100.00 * 0.10) = $90.00 per box.

For two boxes, that's $90.00/box * 2 boxes = $180.00

So, each pair of contacts costs $180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Jill worked a total of 3 hours (2 on Saturday + 1 on Sunday). John worked 4 hours on Saturday (twice Jill's time) and 3 hours on Sunday (three times Jill's time), for a total of 7 hours.

Jill earned $30 (3 hours * $10/hour), and John earned $70 (7 hours * $10/hour). That means John earned $40 more than Jill.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Hannah burns a lot of calories!  

First, she burns 500 calories per hour doing aerobics for 2 hours, so that's 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

Then she burns 600 calories per hour running for 1 hour, adding another 600 calories.

In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 1600 / 200 = 800 ml of water.

"Hmm, this is a tricky one! Let's see... if there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue ones, and 1% more green than blue, we need to figure out how many of each color there are.  

Since there are 4500 jelly beans total, we can think about the blue jelly beans as our starting point.  If we figure out how many blue ones there are, we can calculate the red and green amounts.

After some calculations, I think there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans!

"Hi there!  Let's break this triangle problem down.

Think of the smallest angle as ""x"".  The next angle is double that, so it's ""2x"". The biggest angle is triple the smallest, making it ""3x"".

Since all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can write an equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining the 'x' terms gives us 6x = 180.

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 6, so x = 30.

The largest angle is 3x, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"Hi there! Let's see... Colby has a lot of coins!  

First, we need to figure out how much money he has.

* His nickels are worth 14 * $0.05 = $0.70
* His pennies are worth 15 * $0.01 = $0.15

Adding it all up, Colby has $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Together, they make 60 pounds/hour + 45 pounds/hour = 105 pounds per hour.

Now, let's find the sale prices. The shirt costs $25 - $7.50 = $17.50. The shorts cost $35 - $10.50 = $24.50.

Adding those together, the total cost is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00.

In the second month, she made 3/4 of her first month's sales, which is $1200 * (3/4) = $900.

Over two months, she made a total of $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The plane cost $150,000 to buy.  Then, he spends $5000 a month on the hanger and $10,000 a month on fuel (since that's twice the hanger cost). That's $15,000 a month total. Over a year, that's $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Adding the initial cost of the plane, the total cost for the first year is $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.


$330000 

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If rice took 30 minutes, and pork took 20 minutes longer, then pork took 50 minutes. Together, rice and pork took 80 minutes to cook. Since beans took half that time, they took 40 minutes.  

Adding it all up: 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

A pound of almonds costs $10, and a pound of walnuts costs $15.  

The first mixture has half a pound of almonds ($5) and a third of a pound of walnuts ($5), for a total of $10.

The second mixture has a fifth of a pound of almonds ($2) and a third of a pound of walnuts ($5), for a total of $7.

That means the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If we think about it, each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2.  We know there are 70 legs total, and 20 heads.  

Hmmm... if we try different numbers of sheep, we can see that 15 sheep would have 60 legs (15 x 4 = 60). That leaves 10 legs for the geese (70 - 60 = 10), which means there would be 5 geese (10 / 2 = 5).

And guess what? 15 sheep and 5 geese add up to 20 heads!

So the answer is 15. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Roger spent.

His usual coffee is $5 a pound, but the new one is 20% more, so that's $5 + ($5 * 0.20) = $6 per pound.

He needs 1 pound a day for 7 days, so that's 7 pounds total, costing 7 * $6 = $42.

Don't forget the donut! That's another $2, bringing the grand total to $42 + $2 = $44.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  John has a lot of cooking to do!

He's in class for 4 days a week times 2 hours a day, so that's 8 hours a week. Over 6 weeks, that's 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours total.

Since he learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, he'll learn 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes!

"Hmm, let's see... 60% of the teachers are history teachers, so that means 150 teachers * 0.60 = 90 teachers are history teachers.  That leaves 150 teachers - 90 teachers = 60 math teachers.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we need to find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 the amount Aurelia has, Kassidy has (3/4) * $120 = $90.

Next, we find out how much Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so she has $90 + $60 = $150.

Now, let's add up all their money: $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.

Finally, to find out how much each person would have if they shared equally, we divide the total by 3: $360 / 3 = $120.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Adam's change. 

He bought 7 candies of type A at $0.50 each, so that's 7 * $0.50 = $3.50.

He also got 10 candies of type B at $0.75 each, which is 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

In total, his candies cost $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. If Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, and Janey has 21 books, we can set up an equation.  

Let's say Sally has 'x' books. Twice the number of Sally's books is 2x, and Janey has 3 more than that, so Janey has 2x + 3 books. We know Janey has 21 books, so 2x + 3 = 21.

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 18
x = 9

Sally has 9 books!

"Hmm, let's see... Mrs. Jameson's bamboo is already 20 feet tall, which is 240 inches.  She wants it to be 600 inches tall. That means it needs to grow another 360 inches (600 - 240 = 360).

Since it grows 30 inches every day, it will take 12 days to reach 600 inches (360 / 30 = 12).

If Katarina has 68 cookies and that's 5 less than Max, then Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, so he has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, meaning she has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

"Hi there!  Let's see... one twin is older than a triplet by 7 years, and all their ages add up to 44.  

To figure out how old one of the twins is, we can think like this:

* If we take away the extra 7 years from the older twin, we're left with a group where everyone is the same age.

*  That means we have 2 twins and 3 triplets, making a total of 5 people who are all the same age.

*  If their combined age is 44, and there are 5 of them, each person would be 44 / 5 = 8.8 years old.

* Now, remember the older twin is 7 years older, so they are 8.8 + 7 = 15.8 years old.

"Hi there! Let's figure out the price of that fruit crate. 

Okay, so we have 5 bananas, and each banana costs twice as much as an apple, which is $0.50. So each banana costs $1.00.  Then we have 12 apples at $0.50 each, and 7 oranges that cost three times the price of a banana, so $3.00 each.

Let's add it all up:

* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

Total cost: $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00


The crate costs $32.00.

* She has 6 more green squares than blue, meaning she has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
* She has 12 fewer white squares than green, so she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Adding up all their points, the class has 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 points to go on the trip, so they still need 400 - 255 = 145 more points.

"Hi there! Let's see... they started with 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs, so that's 193 in total.  They took away 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs, which is 33 chairs total.  That means they have 193 - 33 = 160 chairs left.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, which is (2/3) * 12 slices/pizza = 8 slices per pizza. Since there are three of them, they ate a total of 8 slices/pizza * 3 pizzas = 24 slices.

The other two friends ate (3/4) * 12 slices/pizza = 9 slices per pizza. With two of them, they ate 9 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 18 slices.

In total, they ate 24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices.

They started with 12 slices/pizza * 5 pizzas = 60 slices.

That means there were 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices left.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.  

The dog eats the sausages in 2/3 the time the cat does, so the dog takes 30 minutes * (2/3) = 20 minutes.

To find the average, we add the cat's time and the dog's time, then divide by 2: (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2 = 25 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to know how many inches are in Topher's shoe. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, his shoe is 8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 100 inches long.

The problem says Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  So, if we let 'x' be the length of Bobby's shoe, we can set up an equation: 100 = 9x + 10.

Solving for x, we get:

90 = 9x
x = 10

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

"Oh my gosh, that's terrible!  Let's see... 

She smashed windows on a quarter of the students' cars, so that's 64 cars / 4 = 16 cars. Since each of those cars has 4 windows, she broke 16 cars * 4 windows/car = 64 windows.

Then she smashed windows on 3/4 of the teachers' cars, which is 32 cars * (3/4) = 24 cars. With 2 windows per teacher car, that's 24 cars * 2 windows/car = 48 windows.

In total, Hannah smashed 64 windows + 48 windows = 112 windows.  

Yikes!

Her math and science books each weigh 2 pounds, so those are 2 * 2 = 4 pounds total. Her history book is twice as heavy as her 3-pound English book, so it weighs 3 * 2 = 6 pounds.

Adding up all the books: 4 pounds + 4 pounds + 3 pounds + 6 pounds = 17 pounds.

Cindy's books weigh a total of 17 pounds.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A, who got 20%. That means B got 20 + (50/100)*20 = 30% of the votes.  Together, A and B got 20% + 30% = 50% of the votes.  That leaves 100% - 50% = 50% of the votes for candidate C. Since there were 100 voters, candidate C got 50% of 100, which is 50 votes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Lorraine's got a lot of trading to do!

Okay, so she starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them, which is 27 stickers.  Since each small sticker gets her one small button, that's 27 buttons right there. She can also trade those 27 small buttons for 9 large buttons (27 divided by 3).

Then she trades half of her 40 large stickers, which is 20 large stickers. Each of those is worth one large button, so that's another 20 large buttons.

She has 20 large stickers left, and each of those can be traded for 3 small buttons, giving her 60 more small buttons.

Adding it all up, Lorraine has 27 small buttons + 20 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 107 buttons!

If the third house needs double the first house's shingles, and the first house needs half of the second house's shingles, we can think of it like this:

* **Second house:**  Let's say it needs 'x' cases of shingles.
* **First house:** Needs x / 2 cases.
* **Third house:** Needs 2 * (x / 2) = x cases.

Since all three houses need a total of 250 cases, we know:

x / 2 + x + x = 250

That means 2.5x = 250

Dividing both sides by 2.5, we find that x = 100.

So, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

Billy's hourly rate is now $11.50 after all his raises. Sally makes $10.50 an hour.

For 20 hours, Billy earns $11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally earns $10.50 * 20 = $210.

That means Billy earns $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. Nikita scored 11 more than that, so she got 139 + 11 = 150 points.

"Hi! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so there are 40 classes with 25 students each, that's 40 * 25 = 1000 students. And each student plants one tree, so that's 1000 trees!

There are also 3 teachers per class, so that's 40 * 3 = 120 teachers. Each teacher plants 2 trees, so they plant 120 * 2 = 240 trees.

In total, they'll plant 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Kris plays for half an hour a day for two weeks, which is 14 days. That's 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours. Then she plays 2 hours a day for a week, so that's 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours. In total, she plays 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours. To get the achievement, she needs to play 30 hours, so she still needs 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 more hours.

"Hi there! To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to figure out how many students passed in total and divide that by the total number of students. 

Let's see... 340 third-graders passed, plus 40 fourth-graders, and 400 fifth-graders passed at twice the rate of the fourth graders, so that's 400 * 2 = 800 fifth-graders.  

That means a total of 340 + 40 + 800 = 1180 students passed.

There are 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 students in total.

So the overall pass rate is 1180 / 1000 = 1.18 or 118%. 

Oops, that doesn't seem right!  It looks like I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check my work... 

Ah, I see the problem! I accidentally added the number of fifth graders who passed twice instead of multiplying the pass rate by the number of fifth graders. 

Let's try that again. 

The fifth-grade pass rate is 40/100 * 2 = 0.8 or 80%.

So, 400 fifth graders * 0.8 = 320 fifth graders passed.

That means a total of 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 students passed.

The overall pass rate is 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Milo needs 12 chips per square inch, and his mosaic will be 3 inches tall. That means he needs 12 chips/inch * 3 inches = 36 chips for every inch of length.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

So, 4 students drank 1.5 quarts each, which is a total of 6 quarts. Then, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, for a total of 32 quarts. That means they drank 6 + 32 = 38 quarts altogether.

Since there are 10 quarts left, they must have started with 38 + 10 = 48 quarts of tea.  

And since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, they started with 48 / 4 = 12 gallons of tea.

"Hi! Let's see... Rose picked a lot of flowers!  

She started with 3 flowers that had 5 petals each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 petals. Then she got 4 flowers with 6 petals each, for a total of 4 * 6 = 24 petals.  

Next, she added 5 flowers with 4 petals each, which is 5 * 4 = 20 petals. Finally, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each, making 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

That's a grand total of 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals!

But oh no, she dropped one of each kind of flower!  That means she lost 5 petals.

So, the flowers in the vase have 101 - 5 = 96 petals.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His two friends who aren't as good only get 10 minutes per quarter, and his really good friend gets 30 minutes per quarter.  They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

His not-so-good friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, so together they use 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

His awesome friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

In total, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

That means they spend 68 * $0.25 = $17.00 at the arcade.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar. She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.  

Since everything is measured in relation to the zest, let's say she uses 1 ounce of zest. That means she also uses 1 ounce of fragrance. Salt would be twice the zest, so 2 ounces. Sugar is also 2 ounces. Oil is twice the salt, making it 4 ounces.

Adding it all up: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10 ounces, which fills her jar perfectly!

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"Hey there! This sounds like a fun card problem! Let's see...

If we call the number of cards PJ has ""x"", then Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards.  

Since they have a total of 341 cards, we can write an equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.  

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329.

Finally, dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 47.

That means Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 153 cards.

Cindy has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, meaning she has 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Adding them all up, Cindy has 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs!

"Let's figure out how much Milly loses!

First, the shipping cost based on weight is $0.35/pound * 4 pounds = $1.40.

So, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Amazon will give Milly back 75% of the book's price, which is $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.

Finally, Milly's total loss is $32 (original price) - $24 (refund) - $3 (shipping) = $5.00.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars each month. In the first week, he makes 8,000. The second week, he makes half of that, which is 4,000. In the third week, he makes three times the amount from the first week, so that's 8,000 x 3 = 24,000 bars.

That means in the first three weeks, he makes a total of 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars. To reach his goal of 50,000, he needs to make 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

And don't forget the makeup, which is 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.

So, in a week, she spends 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes on TikTok.

That means in a month, she spends 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 1128 minutes.

* The second glue stick has 2/3 used, meaning 1/3 is missing. That's (1/3) * 12 mm = 4 mm.
* The third glue stick has 1/2 used, so 1/2 is missing. That's (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm.

They have 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars, so that's 10 green cars. They have 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, meaning they have 30 blue cars. That's a total of 52 red, green, and blue cars. Since they have 75 cars in total, they must have 23 yellow cars! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If we call the number of books Fawn has ""F"", we know Anne has F - 12 books, and Sofie has F + 13 books.  

Since they have 85 books total, we can write an equation: F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Combining like terms, we get 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives us 3F = 84.

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find that F = 28.

So Fawn has 28 books!

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much jello Greg needs to buy.  

He needs enough for 30 kids to have 4 cups each, so that's 30 * 4 = 120 jello cups.

Each box makes 10 cups, so he'll need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of jello.

If each box costs $1.25, then 12 boxes will cost 12 * $1.25 = $15.00.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how many pizza pieces Tobias ate. 

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, which is 24 pieces. Then he ate 10 more on the second day.  On the third day, he had 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left. He ate 7/13 of those, which is 14 pieces.

In total, Tobias ate 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces of pizza.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If 7 sodas cost $21, then one soda costs $3 ($21 / 7 = $3).  

And if 4 waters cost $8, then one water costs $2 ($8 / 4 = $2).

So, 3 sodas would cost $9 (3 x $3 = $9) and 2 waters would cost $4 (2 x $2 = $4).

In total, that's $13!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  David starts with $12.48 and each bolt costs $0.03.  If he buys 16 bolts, that's 16 * $0.03 = $0.48 spent on bolts.  

That means he has $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00 left.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Amy's score. 

Okay, so she gets 80% of the multiple-choice right, which is 10 questions * 0.80 = 8 questions correct. Those are worth 1 point each, so that's 8 points.

For true/false, she gets 90% right, so that's 20 questions * 0.90 = 18 questions correct. Those are also worth 1 point each, for another 18 points.

Finally, for the long answer, she gets 60% right, which is 5 questions * 0.60 = 3 questions correct. Those are worth 5 points each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Adding it all up, Amy scores 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Isaias wants to make a $2000 profit, and he's selling each chicken for $50.  He's selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is 180 chickens. That means he'll earn 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.

To find out how much he paid for the chickens, we subtract his profit from his total earnings: $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money Kelly has left. 

Okay, so the bacon costs $10 total, and each chicken pack costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, which is $2.  That means the chicken costs $4 per pack, and 6 packs cost $24. The strawberries are $4 each, so 3 packs cost $12. The apples are half the price of strawberries, so they're $2 each, and 7 packs cost $14.

Adding it all up, the bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples cost $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

If Kelly had $65 to start, she has $65 - $60 = $5 left.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual ones plus a 15-minute encore, and the whole thing is 65 minutes, we can work backwards.  

First, take away the encore time: 65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes.

That 50 minutes is double the length of her usual concert. So, divide that in half: 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Mrs. Smith has 100 plants and a quarter are indoors, that's 25 indoor plants (100 / 4 = 25). That leaves 75 plants (100 - 25 = 75).

Two-thirds of those are outdoor plants, so that's 50 outdoor plants (75 x (2/3) = 50).

That means the rest, 25 plants, must be flowering plants (75 - 50 = 25).

So, 25 out of 100 plants are flowering plants, which is 25%!

"Hmm, let's see... a whatchamacallit is super speedy at 121 meters per second, and it spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. That means the thingamabob spins at 121 meters per second divided by 11, which is 11 meters per second.  Now, the whirligig is a real speed demon, spinning 5 times faster than the thingamabob. So, the whirligig spins at 11 meters per second times 5, which equals 55 meters per second!

If each yellow balloon got 3 pieces, then there were 18 pieces / 3 pieces/balloon = 6 yellow balloons.

Larry has three times as many fish as rabbits, so he has 7 * 3 = 21 fish.

His gerbil collection is 1/3 the size of his fish collection, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages, and Paul is 10 years older than John, we can do some clever adding!

Let's say John is ""J"" years old. That means Paul is ""J + 10"" years old.  Since Peter is the sum of their ages, Peter is ""J + (J + 10)"" which is ""2J + 10"" years old.

We know all three of their ages add up to 100, so:

J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100

Combining like terms: 4J + 20 = 100

Subtracting 20 from both sides: 4J = 80

Dividing both sides by 4: J = 20

Now we know John is 20.  Let's plug that back into our equation for Peter's age:

Peter = 2J + 10 = (2 * 20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50


Peter is 50 years old!

"
"Hi there! Let's see... the teacher has 9 coupons for 100 bottles each, so that's 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.  She gives each of her 29 students 2 bottles, for a total of 29 * 2 = 58 bottles. That means she has 900 - 58 = 842 bottles left for herself!

"Hi there! Let's figure out Patty's total charge. 

The visit cost is $40, and the labor for 2.25 hours is 2.25 * $35 = $78.75.  Don't forget the $60 in parts!

Adding it all up: $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75


$178.75

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

James saved 40% on the CDs, so he paid 60% of the original price. That means he spent 0.60 * $150 = $90 on the CDs.

Then he sold 5 of them for $40 each, making $200.

So, he ended up with $200 - $90 = $110.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 12 miles. At 2 miles per hour, that takes him 6 hours. He then rests for 3 hours (half the swimming time). For the remaining 8 miles, he swims at 1 mile per hour (half his original speed), taking another 8 hours.

Adding it all up, his total time is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If Sam had 70 loaves and the bakery has 40 less than seven times that amount, we need to do some math!

Seven times the loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Then, 40 less than that is 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Cayley's commission. 

For the New York Times, he earns $0.50 per copy (10% of $5) and sells 6, so that's $3.00.

For the Wall Street Journal, he earns $1.20 per copy (8% of $15) and sells 10, so that's $12.00.

Adding those together, his total commission is $15.00.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Deanna is 26, and Marcus is 5 years younger than her, so Marcus is 21. Marcus is half Leo's age, meaning Leo is twice Marcus's age. That makes Leo 42 years old!

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If we let Azibo's points be ""x"", Bahati scored x + 20, and Dinar scored x + 10.  

Together, that's x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45 points.

Combining like terms, we get 3x + 30 = 45.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us 3x = 15.

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 5.


So Azibo scored 5 points.

"Hmm, let's see... 100 pages per inch and the book is 1.5 inches thick...  That means there are 100 * 1.5 = 150 pages in the book! 



"
"Let's see... Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.  He worked for 15 hours, which is 900 minutes. That means he had 900 / 15 = 60 sets of 15 minutes.  So, he stapled a total of 60 * 30 = 1800 reports!

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Jonathan has 24 measuring cups (two dozen). Since he has 2/3 as many spoons as cups, he starts with 16 measuring spoons (2/3 * 24 = 16). After giving Pedro 6 spoons, he has 10 left (16 - 6 = 10).  In total, Jonathan has 34 utensils (24 cups + 10 spoons = 34).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how many beds are empty at the start. If 1/5 of the 1000 beds are full, then 1000 / 5 = 200 beds are occupied. That means 1000 - 200 = 800 beds are empty.

Over two weeks, 50 patients come in each day, so that's 50 * 14 = 700 new patients.

Adding those to the initially occupied beds, we get 200 + 700 = 900 occupied beds.

Finally, subtracting the occupied beds from the total gives us 1000 - 900 = 100 unoccupied beds.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 are for work. That leaves 9 emails for family and her boyfriend.  Two-thirds of those 9 emails go to family, which is 6 emails. That means 3 emails are left for her boyfriend.

"Hmm, let's see. If Courtney overstated the number by 20%, that means the real number is 20% less than what she said.  

20% of 48 is 9.6, so we subtract that from Courtney's count: 48 - 9.6 = 38.4. Since we can't have part of a person, we round down.

"Ahoy there, matey! Let's see... they dug 10 holes the first day, then 13 more the second, and 8 more the third. That's 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes. But they filled in 2, so that leaves 29 holes. The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first, so they must have dug 29 / 4 = 7.25 holes on the first day.  Since ye can't dig a quarter of a hole, let's say they dug 7. That means they dug 29 - 7 = 22 holes on the fourth day!

"
"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. If Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 15 more than them, that means Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.  To find the total, we add up what everyone got: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 corn chips.

"
"Hey there! This Pokemon catching problem is totally solvable! Let's see...

If we call the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught ""A"", Stan caught ""S"", and Alex caught ""X"", we can set up some equations.

We know Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch, so S = 4A - 13.

Alex caught 5 more than Stan, so X = S + 5.

And together they caught 339 Pokemon, so A + S + X = 339.

Let's plug those first two equations into the third one and solve for S:

A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339

That simplifies to 9A - 21 = 339.

Solving for A, we get A = 40.

Now, let's plug that back into the equation for S:

S = 4(40) - 13

S = 160 - 13

S = 147

So Stan caught 147 Pokemon! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as minutes in each episode, there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.  That means John will spend 10 * 20 = 200 minutes watching the whole show!

Finally, she flew south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, covering 5 * 22 = 110 miles.

To find the total distance between her homes, we add up the southward distances and subtract the northward distance: 300 - 36 + 110 = 374 miles.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how long it takes Andy to string all those racquets. 

*  He spends 15 minutes on each synthetic gut racquet, and he has 3 of those, so that's 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.
* For the polyester ones, it's 22 minutes each, and he has 5, so that's 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.
* The hybrid ones take 18 minutes each, and he has 4, meaning 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Adding all that up: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

John buys two phones at full price, which is 2 * $600 = $1200. The other two phones are half price, so they cost $600 / 2 = $300 each. That means those two cost 2 * $300 = $600.

In total, John spends $1200 + $600 = $1800 on phones.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Sunny earned.

On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 6 boxes of apple pie (10 - 4 = 6). That's $60 from gingerbread (10 * $6) and $90 from apple pie (6 * $15).

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread (10 + 5 = 15) and 15 boxes of apple pie. That's $90 from gingerbread (15 * $6) and $225 from apple pie (15 * $15).

In total, Sunny made $150 on Saturday ($60 + $90) and $315 on Sunday ($90 + $225).  That means he earned a total of $465 over the two days ($150 + $315).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Emil is 24, his dad will be double his age, which is 48.  That means his dad is currently 43 (48 - 5). When Emil is 24, his brother will be half his age, meaning he'll be 12.  Right now, his brother is 7 (12 - 5).

Adding their ages together, we get 43 + 7 = 50.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. If Charlie's boots are five times bigger than Sophie's size 5 boots, that means Charlie wears a size 25!  To find the average, we add their sizes together (5 + 25 = 30) and then divide by 2 because there are two people (30 / 2 = 15). 

So the average shoe size is 15. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money Pat will spend on plants.

First, we need to figure out how many plants will fit in her flower bed.  Her bed is 111 feet long, which is 1332 inches (111 x 12). Each plant needs 30 inches of space (12 inches wide plus 18 inches between plants). So, she can fit 44 plants (1332 / 30).

Since Pat already has 17 plants, she needs to buy 27 more (44 - 17).

Each plant costs $6, so she'll spend $162 in total (27 x 6). 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, who eats 18 a day. So, his brother eats 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.  In a week, that's 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Katherine will spend.  

Each basket needs 3 petunias at $3.00 each, so that's 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.

She also wants 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so that's 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.

One basket will cost $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

"Let's break it down!

The AC cooled the room 6 degrees on low (2 degrees/hour * 3 hours) and then another 12 degrees on high (3 degrees/hour * 4 hours). That's a total of 18 degrees cooler.

But then the room warmed up 4 degrees while the AC was off (2 degrees/hour * 2 hours).

So, the final temperature was 14 degrees cooler than the starting temperature (18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Comet Halley comes around every 75 years. Bill's dad saw it when he was 30. Bill saw it again when he was three times his dad's age then. That means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Since the comet comes every 75 years, and Bill was 90 when he saw it, that means one full cycle (75 years) had passed, and then another 15 years.  

So, Bill was 75 years old when he first saw the comet!

"
"Hmm, let's see... Buford pays his electric and gas bills monthly, so that's 12 checks for each of those. He gives to the church twice a month, so that's 24 checks a year.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The second plane takes 44 trips, which is half the number the first plane takes. So the first plane takes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

It flies to Greece for three-quarters of those, which is 88 * (3/4) = 66 flights. That leaves 88 - 66 = 22 flights for France and Germany.

Since those are split evenly, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France each day.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice that, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for the combined time of the other two, meaning he howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  

In total, they howl for 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, their total howl time is 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If the total age of the four children is 20, and we know Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4, that's 3 + 4 = 7 years accounted for. Helene is twice the average age of the group, and since there are four kids, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5 years old. That means Helene is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

So far, that's 7 + 10 = 17 years.  

To find Wilfred's age, we subtract the ages we know from the total age: 20 - 17 = 3 years old.

Wilfred is 3 years old.

"Hi there!  Let's think about this watermelon problem.  

Since each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid's slice, we can think of it like this: imagine each kid's slice is worth 1 unit. Then each adult's slice is worth 2 units.

That means each adult gets 2 units, and there are 2 adults, so they get a total of 2 * 2 = 4 units.

If the whole watermelon is 6 units (4 kids' units + 2 adults' units), then each adult gets 4/6 of the watermelon.

That's the same as 66.67%, but since we usually talk about percentages in whole numbers, we'd say each adult gets about 67% of the watermelon.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Doctor Jones spends 20 minutes per inpatient, and he has 9 inpatients, so that's 20 * 9 = 180 minutes for rounds. That's equal to 3 hours.

His appointments take 30 minutes each, and he has 10, so that's 30 * 10 = 300 minutes, or 5 hours.

In total, he spends 3 + 5 = 8 hours on rounds and appointments.

Since he works a 9-hour day, he has 9 - 8 = 1 hour left for records.

Okay, so half of the 3000 students are over 16, which is 1500 students. A quarter of those older students are boys, meaning 375 are boys over 16. That leaves 1125 girls over 16.

The other half of the students are under 16, so that's another 1500 students. Half of them are boys, which is 750 boys. That means there are 750 girls under 16.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she pumped 4500 gallons * (3/4) = 3375 gallons.

Together on day one, they pumped 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons.

On day two, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her day one amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her day one amount, which is 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

On day two, they pumped a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons.

In total, they pumped 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

That means there are 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons left to fill.

"Hmm, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

Okay, so the power bank lost 9% of its charge every hour for 5 hours, that's a total of 45% gone. Then it lost another 21% over the next 3 hours.  That means it lost a total of 66% of its charge before it got to 28%.

So, if 28% is what was left after losing 66%, that means the power bank had 34% (28% + 6%) of its charge left after the initial losses.

Since 34% represents what was left after the losses, and the friends used 6% of that, the power bank must have been at 17.65% when Maria left for the park.

"Hi! Let's figure this out. Anne had 15 packs of sweets with 60 in each, so that's 15 * 60 = 900 sweets total. She kept 2 packs for herself, which is 2 * 60 = 120 sweets. That leaves 900 - 120 = 780 sweets to share with her friends.  Since she has 10 friends, each friend gets 780 / 10 = 78 sweets.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If the price goes up by 5% each year, here's how it would look:

* **Year 1:** $120 + (0.05 * $120) = $126
* **Year 2:** $126 + (0.05 * $126) = $132.30
* **Year 3:** $132.30 + (0.05 * $132.30) = $138.92

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the carrots would cost $139 after three years.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

So, the hotel started with 100 guests. Some left early, some stayed late, and then more people checked in.  

* 100 guests - 24 guests (early checkout) = 76 guests
* 15 guests (late checkout) * 2 = 30 guests (afternoon check-ins)

"Let's break this down!

There are 60 questions total, and 40% are easy, so that's 60 * 0.40 = 24 easy questions.  The rest, 60 - 24 = 36 questions, are split evenly between average and difficult, meaning there are 36 / 2 = 18 of each.

Aries gets 75% of the easy ones right, so that's 24 * 0.75 = 18 easy questions correct. She gets half of the average and difficult ones right, so that's 18 * 0.50 = 9 correct for each type.

In total, she's sure to get 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, and each small one costs $4, a large one costs $12.

She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Her earnings from the large stuffed animals would be 12x dollars, and from the small ones, it would be 8x dollars (since 2x small stuffed animals * $4 each = 8x dollars).

In total, she made $120, so 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find that x = 6.

Since she sold 2x small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If we think of the first person's share as ""x"", the second person got ""x + $80"", and the third person got ""2 * (x + $80)"" which is the same as ""2x + $160"".

All together, that's x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Combining the 'x' terms and the dollar amounts, we get 4x + $240 = $1920

Subtracting $240 from both sides gives us 4x = $1680

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that x = $420.

So the first person's share was $420.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so the first train comes in 10 minutes and hangs around for 20 minutes. The second train shows up 30 minutes after the first one leaves, which means it arrives 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train was supposed to arrive. That second train only stays for 5 minutes (a quarter of the first train's time).

The third train gets in an hour after the second train leaves, so that's 60 + 5 + 60 = 125 minutes after the first train was due.  This third train takes off right away.

Finally, Paul's train, the fourth one, arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, putting it at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the first train was scheduled.

"Hmm, let's see... Melanie needs 200 toothpicks and has 10 saved each week for 12 weeks. That's 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.  She still needs 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks.

If she saves 10 each week, it will take her 80 / 10 = 8 more weeks.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Mr. Rogers got the watch for 75% of $2000, which is $1500. Then he sold it for 120% of that price, meaning he sold it for $1800. That's a $200 discount from the original $2000 price.  

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%

So the answer is 10%. 



"
"Hmm, let's see... if one spring makes a jellyfish every second, that's 60 jellyfish every minute, and 3600 every hour!  With five springs, that's 18,000 jellyfish in an hour!  Over four hours, they'd make a whopping 72,000 jellyfish!

"
"Hmm, let's see. James walked 2 miles to the halfway point, then 2 miles back home, and finally another 2 miles to the store. That's a total of 6 miles!  Since he walks at 4 miles per hour, it took him 1.5 hours to get to the store.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas with 4 bananas in each bunch, that's a total of 40 bananas.

Buying them individually would cost 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

But since she buys them in bunches, it only costs her 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

That means she saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If Harry gets 60 more feet than Sam, think of it like splitting the fence into groups.  Since Harry gets more, his group is bigger.  

If we take away Harry's extra 60 feet, we have 100 - 60 = 40 feet left to split evenly.

That means Sam gets 40 / 2 = 20 feet.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Marcel's earnings.

* He sold 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each, making $67,500.
* He sold 45 BMX bikes at $250 each, making $11,250.
* He sold 105 MTB bikes at $500 each, making $52,500.

Adding those up, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bikes that month.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. The farmer makes 5 bales each hour for 6 hours, so that's 5 * 6 = 30 bales. The truck picks up 3 bales each hour for 6 hours, meaning it takes 3 * 6 = 18 bales.  That leaves 30 - 18 = 12 bales in the field.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

John has a busy week!  He has 8 classes a day, which is 320 minutes of class time. Over five days, that's 1600 minutes. Then he adds another 100 minutes each day on the weekend, for a total of 200 extra minutes.  

That means he spends 1800 minutes learning each week.  

To get that in hours, we divide by 60, which gives us 30 hours.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The ball starts at 72 feet (3 floors * 24 feet/floor). After the first bounce, it goes up to 72 * (2/3) = 48 feet. Then, on the second bounce, it goes up to 48 * (2/3) = 32 feet.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches. The second child is 2 inches taller, so they are 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second, making them 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall. Finally, the fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third, so they are 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

"Hmmm, let me see...  If the Allosaurus ate 270 kg, and that was half of what was left after the velociraptors had their fill, then there must have been 270 kg * 2 = 540 kg before the velociraptors got there.  And since that 540 kg was only half of what the T-Rex left behind, the triceratops must have started with 540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg of meat!

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much it will cost to paint Tony's room. 

First, we need to find the total area of all the walls. The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so they each have an area of 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, that's 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, giving us 40 square feet each. With two of those walls, that's another 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.

Adding those together, the total area of all the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so Tony will need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

If each gallon costs $12, the total cost will be 12 * $12 = $144.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people each day.

There are 31 days in March and 19 in April, for a total of 31 + 19 = 50 days.

He takes 20% of those days off, which is 50 * 0.20 = 10 days.

That means he works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

In total, he helps 40 * 6 = 240 people.

"Hmm, let's see... the big slide is 300 feet long and you go 60 feet every minute. So that's 300 divided by 60, which is 5 minutes.  The smaller slide is 240 feet long and you zoom down at 80 feet per minute. That's 240 divided by 80, which is 3 minutes.  

So the big slide takes 2 minutes longer! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day, so that's 30 + 30 = 60 minutes of breaks daily. Over five days, that adds up to 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes.  Converting that to hours, we get 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. Lauren wants to live on 40% of her $100,000 salary during retirement, which is $40,000 per year.  Since she wants to retire for 20 years, she'll need a total of $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

She saves 20% of her salary each year, which is $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000. To save up $800,000, it will take her $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Soledad wants to hike a whopping 9300 miles in June. If she hikes 125 miles twice a day, that's 250 miles per day.  Over 30 days, that's 7500 miles (250 miles/day * 30 days).  

She needs to hike 1800 more miles (9300 miles - 7500 miles). To do that in 30 days, she needs to add 60 miles to her daily hikes (1800 miles / 30 days).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Those first four workers made a good start, but we still need to figure out how many toys the fifth worker made per hour.  

Since they needed 20 more toys at the end of the shift, that means the first four workers made 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

They worked for 10 hours, so the fifth worker must have made 180 toys (400 total - 380 from the others) in those 10 hours.

That means the fifth worker made 18 toys per hour!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30.  That means Sarah painted 9 eggs (30 - 12 = 18, then 18 / 2 = 9). Camden painted 21 eggs (9 + 12 = 21).

Arnold and Madeline painted the same amount, and together they painted 26 eggs (56 total eggs - 30 = 26). So, Arnold painted 13 eggs (26 / 2 = 13).

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold (21 - 13 = 8).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Nik has a lot of crayons!  Since each box holds 8 crayons and he has 200 crayons, he'll need 25 boxes (200 / 8 = 25). That means he'll have 25 boxes weighing 8 ounces each, for a total of 200 ounces just from the boxes (25 x 8 = 200).

The crayons themselves weigh 200 ounces too (200 crayons x 1 ounce each = 200 ounces).

So, all together, the crayons and boxes weigh 400 ounces (200 + 200 = 400).

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 25 pounds (400 / 16 = 25).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and it takes her 40 minutes. That means she walks at 3 miles per hour on the beach. On the sidewalk, she's twice as fast, so she walks at 6 miles per hour. Since the sidewalk part is only 1 mile, it takes her 10 minutes to finish that part (1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hour, which is 10 minutes).  

So, her total walking time is 40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes.

* He also gets 10 chickens a day from Broilers Limited, so that's 10 * 7 * 3 = 210 chickens.

So, after three weeks, he has 50 + 420 = 470 cows and 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

That means he has a total of 470 + 230 = 700 animals on his farm!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If the ratio of men to women is 5:9, that means there are 14 parts in total (5 + 9 = 14).  Since there are 84 passengers, each ""part"" represents 6 passengers (84 / 14 = 6).

That means there were originally 54 women on the bus (9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women). After 20 women get off, there are 34 women left (54 - 20 = 34).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Faraday makes $2 per sunflower and $8 per bouquet. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, that means he makes $8 / 12 = $0.67 per sunflower in a bouquet.

So, each day he makes $2 + $0.67 = $2.67 per sunflower.

Over 3 days, he makes $2.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

He earned a total of $26 from individual sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over 3 days.

That means he sold $82 / $2.67 per sunflower = 30.71 sunflowers. Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, he sold 30 sunflowers.

"Hi! Let's see... Mason eats 4 carrots a day on weekdays, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 carrots. On the weekend he eats 5 carrots each day, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 carrots. In total, he eats 20 + 10 = 30 carrots a week!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. The second song is 60% longer than the first, which means it's 5 minutes + (5 minutes * 0.60) = 8 minutes long.  

So, the total time for the cassette is 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Linus's profit. 

He makes a $20 profit on each device since he sells them for twice what he buys them for.  He bought 2 devices on Monday for a profit of $20/device * 2 devices = $40. On Tuesday, he bought 4 devices for a profit of $20/device * 4 devices = $80.  

In total, Linus made $40 + $80 = $120 in profit.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than her, so Ned is 5 feet tall. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, making him 6 feet tall. Since Carl's cane is half his height, it's 3 feet long.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so Hortex makes 4200 bottles a day, and each bottle gives you 20% of your energy needs. That means they're currently covering 4200 * 0.20 = 840% of someone's daily energy needs.

We need to find out how much more they need to make to cover 100% for 2300 people. That's a total of 2300 * 100% = 230,000% of energy needed.

To find the difference, we subtract: 230,000% - 840% = 229,160%.

Since each bottle covers 20%, they need to make 229,160% / 20% = 7300 more bottles.

"Hmm, let's see...  

So, 3/4 of the octuplets wear purple, which is 6 babies. And 1/4 wear blue, which is 2 babies.  

If 1/3 of the purple wearers have bows, that's 2 more babies.  

That means there are 4 babies total wearing bows (2 blue + 2 purple).

Since 2 of those babies wearing bows are purple, there's a 50% chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

"
"Hmm, let me see... they got 1907 reports on Monday and Tuesday, and 2136 on Thursday and Friday. That's a total of 4043 reports for those four days.  If they got 5168 reports all week, then they must have gotten 1125 reports on Wednesday.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money Abraham made.

He started with 80 square meters and sold half for $50, so that's 40 square meters sold. Then he sold another 1/4 of what was left (which is 10 square meters) for $30.  That leaves him with 30 square meters. He sells those for $3 each, making $90.

Adding up all his sales: $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Abraham earned $170 from selling his land.

"Hi! Let's figure this out. Cole hid a lot of eggs!  

Lamar found 5, and Stacy found twice that, so she found 10. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he got 8. Mei found half as many as Charlie, which is 4.

That means they found a total of 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen, which is 36 eggs.  So there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hiding!

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much John makes. 

Okay, so he collects from two complexes with 200 apartments each, that's 200 * 2 = 400 apartments.

The third complex is 60% bigger than those two combined, so it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments.

That means the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

In total, he collects from 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

He goes to each place three times a week, so that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 collections.

And since he makes $0.40 per collection, he earns 4320 * $0.40 = $1728.00 each week.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many fruits that avocado tree can produce.

* A 6-year-old tree makes 3 times the fruits of a 5-year-old, so that's 50 * 3 = 150 fruits.
* A 7-year-old tree makes 7 times the fruits of a 5-year-old, so that's 50 * 7 = 350 fruits.
*  We know a 10-year-old tree makes 20 times the fruits of a 5-year-old, which is 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits.
* An 8-year-old tree makes 200 less fruits than a 10-year-old, so that's 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Adding up all the fruits for each year: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = 2350 fruits.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, and the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, we can use some clever math to find the red rope's length.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.  

If half the mural is yellow, that means 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints were yellow. That leaves 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints for the red, white, and purple. Since they're used in equal amounts, each color got 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

"Hi there! Let's figure out the total area of Tom's house. 

Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so that's 20 * 12 = 240 square feet per bedroom.  Since he has four bedrooms, that's 240 * 4 = 960 square feet for all the bedrooms.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, meaning it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding the bedrooms and living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

Finally, don't forget the rest of the house, which is 1000 square feet.  

The total area of Tom's house is 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.  

If the bigger box has 20% more pods, that's an extra 20 pods (20% of 100). So the new box has 120 pods total.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Thomas starts with $1000, which is 50 twenty-dollar bills. He loses 10, leaving him with 40. Then he uses 20 to pay a bill, leaving him with 20.  Tripling that gives him 60 twenty-dollar bills, which is $1200.  Finally, converting that to fives gives him 240 bills.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half because they scored 2 fewer than Team A's 4 goals.  In the second half, Team B scored 8 goals (4 times their first-half score). Team A scored 2 goals in the second half, which is a quarter of Team B's second-half score. That means Team A scored a total of 6 goals (4 in the first half + 2 in the second half) and Team B scored 10 goals (2 in the first half + 8 in the second half).  

Adding those together, there were a total of 16 goals in the match! 



"
"Hmm, let's see... the teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% of it, which is 2.25 inches (5 x 0.45 = 2.25). That means he has 2.75 inches left (5 - 2.25 = 2.75).

He uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 1 inch (5 x 0.20 = 1).  Since he can't use it when it's smaller than 2 inches, he can use it for 2 more full days.

"Hi there! Let's break this problem down. 

Let's say Wendy's age now is ""w"" and Colin's age now is ""c"".

We know:

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years:  w = 5(c + 7)
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Let's solve for ""c"", which is Colin's current age.

From the first equation, we can say w = 5c + 35.

Now, substitute this value of ""w"" into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for ""c"":

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
40/3 = (2/3)c
c = (40/3) * (3/2)
c = 20


Colin is currently 20 years old.

They ordered 100 more bandages (2 packs of 50) and used 25 on the third day, leaving them with 60 + 100 - 25 = 135. But we know they had 78 left over at the end of the third day.

Since he buys twice as many cognac bottles, that's 10 * 2 = 20 bottles.  His total cognac cost is 20 * $90 = $1800.  Adding that to the scotch cost, he spends a total of $1800 + $600 = $2400.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many trees Mr. Julius planted.

On the first day, he planted 20 White Oak trees and twice that many Lodgepole Pine, which is 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. That's a total of 20 + 40 = 60 trees for day one.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, bringing his total to 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine than the day before, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pine. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on day two. That's a total of 30 + 50 = 80 trees for day two.

"Hi! This sounds like a fun challenge. Let's see...

First, we need to figure out how many jelly beans could fit in the jar. It's a square jar, so the base is 6 inches by 6 inches, and it's 15 inches tall. That means it can hold 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches of jelly beans.

But jelly beans don't fit together perfectly, so we need to account for that.  They only fill about 80% of the space. So, the actual space for jelly beans is 540 * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so the jar can hold 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans.

Tim thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red, so he'd guess there are 2880 * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

But there are actually 900 red jelly beans! That means Tim was off by 900 - 864 = 36 jelly beans.

John made 4 tables at $20 each, so that's 4 * $20 = $80. He also made 2 roof frames at $10 each, which is 2 * $10 = $20.

In total, Ali needs to pay John $80 + $20 = $100.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If the longer piece is 4 times bigger than the shorter piece, we can think of the board as being split into 5 equal parts (1 part for the shorter piece and 4 parts for the longer piece).

Since the whole board is 40 feet long, each of those parts is 40 / 5 = 8 feet long.

The longer piece is made up of 4 of those parts, so it's 4 * 8 = 32 feet long.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Aiden needs 80 meatballs, and he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of beef. So, he'll need 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of beef.  Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of beef, he'll need 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Luke has five windows that are each 35 inches wide, that's a total of 5 * 35 = 175 inches. Since he needs twice that amount of fabric, he should buy 175 * 2 = 350 inches of fabric.

"
"Hmm, let's see...  

So the first 16 minutes cost $4.00, and the rest of the call costs $0.20 per minute. That means the last 20 minutes cost $4.00 too.  

In total, the call would cost $8.00. 



"
"Hi there! Let's see... it rained 2 inches on Monday, and Tuesday is supposed to get 1 more inch than twice that amount.  So twice Monday's rain is 2 * 2 = 4 inches.  Then add one more inch, and that's 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Carly needs enough treats for 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 treats total.

Let's say Carly makes 'c' cupcakes. She makes 3 times that many brownies minus 2, so that's 3c - 2 brownies.

All together, that's c + (3c - 2) = 10 treats.

Combining like terms, we get 4c - 2 = 10.

Adding 2 to both sides gives us 4c = 12.

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that c = 3.

So Carly made 3 cupcakes! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure out Karen's total cost. 

A manicure and pedicure together would normally cost $35 + $40 = $75.  But since she's getting both, she gets a 20% discount, which is $75 * 0.20 = $15 off. So the manicure and pedicure will cost $75 - $15 = $60.

Adding nail art to all 10 nails will cost $3/nail * 10 nails = $30.

In total, Karen will pay $60 + $30 = $90.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Susan gets 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

She also has one magazine that sends 6 issues a year.

Her last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine, so that's 6 * 4 = 24 issues.

Adding all those up, she gets 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 magazines a year! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. If Samantha has 27 paintings and that's 12 fewer than Shelley, then Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.  Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The toy went up by 80% in December, so that's an increase of $40 * 0.80 = $32. That means it cost $40 + $32 = $72 in December.

Then in January, it went down by 50%, which is a decrease of $72 * 0.50 = $36. So the final price was $72 - $36 = $36.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Charlie makes.

He earns $80 for each regular lesson, and he has 4 of those, so that's 4 * $80 = $320.

For veterans, he charges $80 - ($80 * 0.25) = $60 per lesson.  He has 2 veteran lessons, so he makes 2 * $60 = $120 from those.

Adding those together, Charlie makes $320 + $120 = $440 today.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. If 9 novels is three-quarters of the total, we need to find out what one whole is.  We can think of it like this: 

* Three-quarters is the same as 3/4.
* We know 3/4 of the total is 9 novels.

To find the whole, we can divide the number of novels (9) by the fraction (3/4).  

9 / (3/4) = 9 * (4/3) = 12

Regina wrote 12 novels this year!

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Michael travels 50 km every hour, and he drives for 3 days, which is 72 hours (24 hours/day * 3 days). That means he covers 3600 km in total (50 km/hr * 72 hours).

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km.  To find out what percentage of the distance he's covered, we divide the distance he traveled by the total distance and multiply by 100%: (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100% = 60%.

So, at the beginning, there were 36 + 48 = 84 grapes!

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Bud spends on his yummy mac and cheese. 

He spends $1.00 on pasta, $3.00 on cheddar, and $6.00 on gruyere (since that's twice the cheddar cost). That's a total of $10.00 per week.

Over a whole year, with 52 weeks, he spends $10.00/week * 52 weeks/year = $520.00.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so the custodian has to clean 80 classrooms and has 5 days to do it. Each classroom takes 15 minutes. That's a total of 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes of cleaning.

They work 8 hours a day, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day. Over 5 days, that's 480 * 5 = 2400 minutes of work.

To find the percentage of time spent cleaning, we do (1200 / 2400) * 100% = 50%.

So the answer is 50%. 



"
"Hi! Let's figure this out.  

Each middle shelf holds 10 books, and the bottom shelf holds twice that, so it holds 20 books. The top shelf holds 5 fewer books than the bottom, so it holds 15 books. That means each bookcase can hold 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she'll need 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Rose's profit. 

First, she spent 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00 on eggs.

She has 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs.

That means she can make 60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets of eggs to sell.

She'll earn 20 sets * $1.00/set = $20.00.

So, her profit is $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

If half of Skyler's hats are red, that's 100 / 2 = 50 red hats. That leaves 100 - 50 = 50 hats that are either blue or white.

Since 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, there are (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

That means there must be 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  Jason needs to sell 15 cars, and for every 25 calls he makes, one person visits the dealership. Then, for every two visitors, one buys a car.  

So, he needs 15 customers, which means 30 dealership visits (15 customers * 2 visitors per customer = 30 visits). To get 30 visits, he'll need to make 750 calls (30 visits * 25 calls per visit = 750 calls).

In total, they have 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Adding the candles and flashlights, they have 36 + 4 = 40 candles and flashlights.

And finally, her skirt costs $6.00 to clean.

So, her total weekly cost is $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00.

Over 5 weeks, that adds up to $47.00 * 5 = $235.00.

They make 5000 chocolate bars a day and sell each one for $2. That means they make $10,000 every day! Over a week, that's $70,000.  And for two weeks, it would be double that, so $140,000.


$140000

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Jake spent. 

Okay, so the T-shirts are buy one get one 50% off. That means the second T-shirt is $8 / 2 = $4.  

So the total for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is $40 * 0.40 = $16. That means the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Adding it all up, Jake spent $12 + $24 = $36 at the store.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Ryan earned $6 a week for 3 weeks, so that's $6 * 3 = $18.  He spent $1.25 on each of the 4 ice cream cones, for a total of $1.25 * 4 = $5.  That means he has $18 - $5 = $13 left. Since movie tickets cost $6.50 each, he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Ellen and Lani spent. 

Ellen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a frame, so that's $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani spent $30 on sunglasses and $100 on each of the two bathrobes, meaning she spent $30 + ($100 x 2) = $30 + $200 = $230.

Adding their spending together, they spent a total of $105 + $230 = $335.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Tim's profit. 

Okay, so each jar costs $12 for passion fruit, $12 for jackfruit, and $20 for honey, for a total of $44 per jar. Since he sells each jar for $50, he makes a profit of $6 per jar.  If he sells 10 jars, his total profit would be $60.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money Justin has. 

* He has 32 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, so those are worth 32 * $0.25 = $8.00.
* His 95 dimes are worth 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.
* The 120 nickels add up to 120 * $0.05 = $6.00.
* And finally, his 750 pennies are equal to 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Adding it all together, Justin has $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00 in his jar!

"Hi! Let's see... Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 x 2 = $15.00 on movie tickets, and $8.50 on a bracelet. That's a total of $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00. If her parents gave her $40.00, she has $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00 left.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Josh works 5 days a week and services 3 cars each day, so he works on 15 cars per week.  He makes $4 per car, so he earns $60 each week. Over two weeks, he'd make $120.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many cookies Randy has. 

He starts with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies, for a total of 18. Then he eats one of each kind for a snack, leaving him with 16. He eats 2 more oatmeal cookies for lunch, bringing his total down to 14.  He gives away 2 sugar cookies, leaving him with 12. Finally, he bakes 4 of each kind, adding 12 more cookies. That means he has 12 + 12 = 24 cookies!

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Matthew has 12 toys, so half of them is 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

He'd make 6 * $5 = $30 from the first half.

And 6 * $7 = $42 from the second half.

Adding those together, he'd earn a total of $30 + $42 = $72.

"Let's see... the dog digs a lot of holes!  

So, he digs 84 holes while Nate is gone.  Then every day, Nate fills 9 but the dog digs 6 more. That means Nate makes progress by 3 holes each day (9 - 6 = 3).

It will take him 28 days to fill all the holes (84 holes / 3 holes per day = 28 days).

That's 4 weeks!

"
"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. Butler High School enrolls 3/4 the number of students as Norman High School, which means they have (3/4) * 4000 = 3000 students.  

That means Norman High School has 4000 - 3000 = 1000 more students than Butler High School.


1000 

"
"Hmm, let's see... they made 7995 cookies total, and 2595 were rainbow and 3075 were oatmeal.  That means they made 2325 chocolate chip cookies!

"Let's break this down!

Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, but Igor only brought 16 / 2 = 8.

He was supposed to get 14 Petri dishes, but brought 14 + 2 = 16.

Igor got the right number of beakers, which means he lost 37 - 29 = 8 items total.

Since he only brought 8 test tubes instead of 16, and 16 Petri dishes instead of 14, he didn't lose any beakers!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

James needs 2 screws per leg, and each table has 4 legs, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 screws per table. Since he has 4 tables, he'll need 8 * 4 = 32 screws in total.

He starts with 40 screws and uses 32, leaving him with 40 - 32 = 8 screws.

"Hi there!  Let's see... if one basket has 10 eggs and the other has twice that amount, the second basket has 20 eggs.  That means together they have 30 eggs! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money the girls raised. 

Alexandra raised $430, and Kim raised $320 more than that, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total, we add up everyone's earnings: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, who ran 2 miles. Since Aaron finished in 16 minutes, that means he ran each mile in 8 minutes. Vanessa runs each mile in twice that time, so she runs each mile in 16 minutes. Because she ran 4 miles, her total time was 64 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  He needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and he has 200 feet of dock. That means he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line.  Since he already has 6 feet, he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 more feet of line.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Tom's restaurant makes $15 per reservation since each group gets 2 meals at $5 each plus a $5 bottle of wine. With 6 reservations a night, that's $90 per night. Since they're open 2 days a week, they make $180 a week.

"
"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. If the vendor wants to make a 25% profit on the $80 he spent, he needs to make an extra $20 (because 25% of 80 is 20).  That means he needs to sell all the watermelons for $100 total.  

To find out how much each watermelon costs, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons: $100 / 50 = $2.

So each watermelon should be sold for $2. 



"
"Let's break this down! Dora is turning 12 in three years, so she's currently 9. James is twice her age, making him 18.  John was 19 when James was born, so he's now 37. His youngest son was born when John was 32, meaning the son is currently 5. In three years, the youngest son will be 8 years old.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Mark paid. 

The radiator was originally $400, but he got a sweet deal at the junk shop for 80% off, so that's $400 * 0.80 = $320 saved! That means the radiator only cost him $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic charged $50 per hour for 3 hours of work, so that's $50 * 3 = $150.

Adding the radiator cost and the mechanic's fee, Mark paid a total of $80 + $150 = $230.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If we think about it, chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4.  We know there are 70 legs in total. Hmmm... that means there must be more chickens than cows!

Let me see... if we try a few numbers, we can find the right answer. 

* What if there were 10 chickens? That's 20 legs. That leaves 50 legs for the cows, which would be 12.5 cows. That doesn't work since we can't have half a cow!

* What if there were 5 chickens? That's 10 legs. That leaves 60 legs for the cows, which is 15 cows.  That adds up to 20 animals!

Yay!  

So the answer is **5**.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  They have 7 pizzas with 8 slices each, so that's 7 * 8 = 56 slices total.  Since there are 4 people sharing, each person gets 56 / 4 = 14 slices.
