"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So Josh spent $80,000 on the house and another $50,000 on repairs, for a total of $130,000 invested.  The repairs increased the value by 150%, meaning the house is now worth $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000 more than he bought it for. That brings the total value to $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

His profit is the difference between the final value and his total investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 40 cups. Since each chicken needs 3 cups a day, and she has 20 chickens, she needs a total of 60 cups.  That means she needs to give them 20 more cups in the final meal.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times that amount, then Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.

To find the total, we add up the sheep from all three cities: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Carla downloads 40% of the file, which is 80 GB, before the restart. That took her 40 minutes (80 GB / 2 GB/minute).  

After the 20-minute restart, she has 120 GB left to download. That will take another 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB/minute).

Adding it all up: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  John drives 180 miles out (3 hours * 60 mph). Then, he spends 2 hours stuck, so he's still 180 miles away. He then drives 15 more miles (0.5 hours * 30 mph), putting him 165 miles from home. Finally, he drives another 120 miles (1.5 hours * 80 mph), leaving him 45 miles from home (165 miles - 120 miles).

"Hi there! Let's figure out Eliza's earnings. 

She earns $10 an hour for her first 40 hours, so that's 40 * $10 = $400.

She worked 5 hours of overtime, and her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.  So her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

Adding her regular pay and overtime pay, Eliza earned a total of $400 + $60 = $460 this week.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

The program had 60 downloads the first month. In the second month, it got three times that amount, which is 60 * 3 = 180 downloads. But then in the third month, downloads went down by 30% from the second month. That's a reduction of 180 * 0.30 = 54 downloads. So, the third month had 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Adding up all three months, we get 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Carlos needs to make back the $90 it costs to plant the tree. He earns $10.50 each year from selling lemons (7 lemons x $1.50 each) but spends $3.00 on care. That means he makes a profit of $7.50 each year ($10.50 - $3.00).

To find out how many years it takes to make back the $90, we divide: $90 / $7.50 = 12 years.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that's after selling some, we need to work backwards. Think of it like this:

* **Before the orange house:** She had 5 + (the amount she sold at the orange house).
* **Before the red house:** She had that amount + 2 (since she sold 2 at the red house).
* **Before the green house:** She had that amount * 3 (since she sold 1/3 at the green house).

Let's say 'x' is the original number of vacuum cleaners.  We can set up an equation:

x = (5 + (x/2 - 1)) * 3 + 2

Solving for x:

x = (5 + x/2 - 1) * 3 + 2
x = (x/2 + 4) * 3 + 2
x = 3x/2 + 12 + 2
x = 3x/2 + 14
x - 3x/2 = 14
x/2 = 14
x = 28

Melanie started with 28 vacuum cleaners. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so 20% of the students like contemporary dance, which is 20 students * 0.20 = 4 students. That leaves 20 students - 4 students = 16 students.

Then, 25% of those remaining students like jazz, so that's 16 students * 0.25 = 4 students.

That means 16 students - 4 students = 12 students like hip-hop.

To find the percentage, we do (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%.

So, the merchant should buy the jewelry to maximize profit this month. 

The profit would be $125.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Jill's salary. 

She makes $20 an hour teaching and works 35 hours a week doing that, so she earns $20 * 35 = $700 each week from teaching.

As a cheerleading coach, she earns $30 an hour and works 15 hours a week, bringing in $30 * 15 = $450 per week.

In total, she makes $700 + $450 = $1150 every week.

"Hey there!  

If the book is 25% off, that means Kyle paid 75% of the original price. To find the original price, we can set up a proportion: 

75/100 = $19.50 / x

Cross-multiplying gives us:

75x = $1950

Dividing both sides by 75, we get:

x = $26.00

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how much Marie spent on the chicken, milk, and apples:

* Chicken: $12
* Milk: 5 packs * $3/pack = $15
* Apples: 4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6

That's a total of $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid $50 in total, she spent $50 - $33 = $17 on pizza.

If each pizza box costs $8.50, she bought $17 / $8.50/box = 2 boxes of pizza.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Mishka spent. 

She bought 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each, so that's 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.

Finally, she bought 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each, making it 3 * $42 = $126.00.

To find the total, we add up all the costs: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Cynthia eats ice cream every day for 60 days, so that's 60 servings. Each carton has 15 servings, so she'll need 4 cartons (60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons).  Since each carton costs $4.00, her total cost will be $16.00 (4 cartons * $4.00/carton).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice that, so they cost $33 * 2 = $66. Together, the heels cost $33 + $66 = $99. Since the boots cost $5 more than the heels, they must be $99 + $5 = $104.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Darrell and Allen's ages have a ratio of 7:11, and their combined age is 162.  This means their ages are like 7 parts and 11 parts of a whole.

First, we find the value of one ""part"" by dividing their total age by the total ratio parts: 162 / (7 + 11) = 162 / 18 = 9.

Darrell is 7 parts, so he's 7 * 9 = 63 years old.

Allen is 11 parts, making him 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, the first friend guesses 80 jelly beans. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of that, which is 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend, which is 80 * 0.25 = 20 more jelly beans, making their guess 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

To find the average, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Then we divide by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80 jelly beans.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can think of it like this:

* **Silver coins:**  Let's say Gretchen has 'x' silver coins.
* **Gold coins:** She'd have 'x + 30' gold coins.

Since she has 110 coins total, we can write an equation: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2: x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  

To find the number of gold coins, we add 30: 40 + 30 = 70


Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, and that's half her running speed, so she runs at 6 miles per hour. Since she runs four times faster than she walks, her walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends 2 hours running (one-third of 6 hours) and 4 hours walking (two-thirds of 6 hours).

In those 2 hours of running, she covers 12 miles (6 miles/hour * 2 hours).

During her 4 hours of walking, she covers 6 miles (1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours).

Adding those distances together, Dana travels a total of 18 miles.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Charlie's profit. 

He needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). That'll cost him $20.00 (2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00).

If he sells all 20 candles at $2.00 each, he'll make $40.00 (20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00).

That's a total of 120 + 60 = 180 students.

Since there are 5 students for every teacher, there must be 180 / 5 = 36 teachers.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. If Bailey has $100 after 8 weeks of getting $5 each week, that means her allowance adds up to $5 * 8 = $40.  

To find out how much she started with, we subtract her allowance from her total: $100 - $40 = $60.

So Bailey started with $60.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Judy makes. 

She teaches 25 classes during the week (5 classes a day for 5 days) and 8 on Saturday, for a total of 33 classes. With 15 students in each class, that's 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Since she charges $15 per student, she earns 495 * $15 = $7425.00 in a week.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money Tommy raises. He sells each brownie for $3 and he sells 43 of them, so that's 43 * $3 = $129 from brownies. He sells each cheesecake slice for $4 and sells 23 slices, meaning he makes 23 * $4 = $92 from cheesecake.  In total, Tommy raises $129 + $92 = $221.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

So Shiela bought 5 phones at $150 each, which means the phones cost her 5 * $150 = $750.  

There's also a 2% interest on each phone, so that's $150 * 0.02 = $3 interest per phone.

Since she bought 5 phones, the total interest is $3 * 5 = $15.

Adding the interest to the original price, Shiela needs to pay $750 + $15 = $765 in total.

Finally, she'll pay this over 3 months, so her monthly payment will be $765 / 3 = $255.


Let me know if you have any other questions!

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Artie makes. 

Since he's rounding to the nearest dollar, his prices are $3 for marigolds, $2 for petunias, and $2 for begonias.

* He sells 12 marigolds at $3 each, so that's 12 * $3 = $36.
* He sells 9 petunias at $2 each, so that's 9 * $2 = $18.
* He sells 17 begonias at $2 each, so that's 17 * $2 = $34.

Adding those up, Artie makes $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If the top level is 16 square feet and each level is half the size of the one below it, we can work our way down:

* The third level would be 16 * 2 = 32 square feet.
* The second level would be 32 * 2 = 64 square feet.
* The bottom level would be 64 * 2 = 128 square feet.

To find the average, we add up all the levels (16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240) and divide by the number of levels (240 / 4 = 60).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The puppy needs 1 cup a day for the first 180 days, so that's 180 cups. Then it needs 2 cups a day for the rest of the year, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. That's another 370 cups (2 x 185).

In total, Cecilia needs 550 cups (180 + 370) for the whole year. Since each bag has 110 cups, she'll need 5 bags (550 / 110).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and is 2 seconds faster than Gerald, that means Gerald originally ran it in 40 seconds.  

Since Gerald improved his time by 10%, we need to find 10% of 40 seconds: 40 * 0.10 = 4 seconds.

That means Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If there are two cats for every dog and 60 dogs, that means there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats.

That's a lot of cats!  

So, there are 120 cats + 60 dogs = 180 dogs and cats altogether.

The problem says there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Finally, to find the total number of pets, we add up all the animals: 168 rabbits + 180 dogs and cats = 348 pets.

If 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, then 80 girls are Girl Scouts (2/3 * 120 = 80).

That means 40 girls are not in the Girl Scouts (120 - 80 = 40).

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.

First, we need to find the space inside each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each outside measurement (one inch from each side).

That means each box is 3 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 2 inches tall on the inside.

To find the volume, we multiply those numbers together: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has three boxes, we multiply that volume by 3: 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches.

First, we need to figure out how far she rows in total. It takes her 64 seconds to get to shore, and she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. That means she rows 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Over 64 seconds, she rows 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.

Since she takes on 2 liters of water every 10 feet, over 80 feet she takes on 80 feet / 10 feet/intake * 2 liters/intake = 16 liters of water.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Sasha's profit. 

First, let's look at the 2x4s. She has 10 of them, and they originally cost $10 each, so that's 10 * $10 = $100. Since prices went up 50%, each 2x4 now costs $10 * 1.50 = $15. She'll make 10 * $15 = $150 selling those.

Now for the 4x4s. She has 5 of them at $16 each, for a total of 5 * $16 = $80. With the price increase, each 4x4 is now $16 * 1.50 = $24. She'll make 5 * $24 = $120 selling those.

Adding up her earnings, she'll make $150 + $120 = $270.

Her total costs were $100 + $80 = $180.

Think of it like this: the ratio 7:13 represents 20 total parts (7 + 13 = 20).  Each of those parts is worth 120 / 20 = 6.

Since the sugar part of the ratio is 7, Katy used 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Adrien earned 30% more than Lylah, meaning if Lylah earned $100, Adrien earned $130.  We know Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, so that means $40,000 represents 130% of Lylah's salary from four years ago.

To find Lylah's salary from four years ago, we can divide Adrien's salary by 1.30: $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

Now, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so four years later he earns $40,000 + (0.40 * $40,000) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased, and since it was originally $30,769.23, four years later she earns $30,769.23 + (0.30 * $30,769.23) = $40,000.

Finally, to find their combined salary four years later, we add their individual salaries: $56,000 + $40,000 = $96,000.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, meaning she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each night.  Since there are 4 more days in the week, that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Adding up all the hours, Sadie slept a total of 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

The doctors cost the hospital $150 per hour, so that's 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The hospital charges patients $200 per hour, bringing in 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

Okay, so two subs at $7.50 each is $15.00.  Two bags of chips at $1.50 each is $3.00, and two cookies at $1.00 each is $2.00. That brings her subtotal to $20.00.

Now, there's a 20% delivery fee, which is $4.00.  Adding that to the subtotal, it's $24.00.  Finally, she wants to add a $5.00 tip, making her total $29.00.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Mark didn't finish a lot of questions! On the first test, he only got 40 done, leaving 35 left over. On the second test, he only finished 30, leaving a whopping 70 incomplete.  

That means in total, he left 35 + 70 = 105 questions unfinished.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. If there are 12 blue gumballs, and there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs, we need to do a little math.  Four times the number of blue gumballs is 12 * 4 = 48. Then we add 22 to that: 48 + 22 = 70.

So there are 70 pink gumballs.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.  

If 12 cars are automatic and 4 are manual, that means there are 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 semi-automatic cars.

That means 4 out of 20 cars are semi-automatic, which is 20%.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens, we can think of it like this:

* Imagine the queens are 1 group.
* The babies are 2 groups (twice as many as the queens).
* The workers are 4 groups (twice as many as the babies).

That means there are 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 groups of bees in total.

Since there are 700 bees altogether, each group has 700 / 7 = 100 bees.

The worker bees are 4 groups, so there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much John spent. 

His food cost $2 + $3 = $5.

His non-food items cost $3 + $3 + $4 = $10.

There's a 10% tax on those, so that's $10 * 0.10 = $1 extra.

So, the non-food items cost $10 + $1 = $11.

In total, everything cost $5 + $11 = $16.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Kim's profit. 

He'll have 8 clients total (3 + 5).  Each client needs $4 worth of bleach (2 bottles x $2/bottle) and $5 worth of cloths, for a total of $9 per client.

That means his total expenses are 8 clients * $9/client = $72.

Since his income is $92, his profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. John has a lot of pineapples! 

Since he gets 100 pineapples per hectare and has 10 hectares, that's 1000 pineapples per harvest (100 x 10 = 1000).

He harvests every 3 months, so in a year (12 months) he'll harvest 4 times (12 / 3 = 4).

That means he'll have a total of 4000 pineapples in a year (1000 x 4 = 4000).

* First, 30 bees left the hive.
* Then, half that amount, or 30 / 2 = 15 bees, returned.
* Next, twice the original number, or 30 * 2 = 60 bees, flew out.
* That means a total of 30 + 60 = 90 bees left the hive during the day.
* Since all the bees that left eventually returned, 90 bees came back in the last 6 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we need to know how long it takes each of them to get home.  Steve has to go 3 miles, which is 15,840 feet (3 x 5280). He bikes at 440 feet per minute, so it takes him 15,840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim goes 2 miles, or 10,560 feet (2 x 5280). He skateboards at 264 feet per minute, so it takes him 10,560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

That means Steve gets home 4 minutes before Tim.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Shawnda made. 

She inflated 10 tires from bicycles (5 bikes * 2 tires each), 9 tires from tricycles (3 trikes * 3 tires each), and 1 tire from the unicycle. That's a total of 20 tires!

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, she made 20 * $0.25 = $5.00.

"Let's break this down!

* The seagull ate half of Dave's 14 fries, so it ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
* That means there were 14 + 7 = 21 fries left.
* The pigeons ate 3 fries each, for a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
* So, there were 21 - 9 = 12 fries left.
* The raccoon took two-thirds of those, which is (2/3) * 12 = 8 fries.
* That leaves 12 - 8 = 4 fries.
* Since only 5 fries were left at the end, there must have been 4 + 1 = 5 fries before the ants got to them.
*  Working backwards, there were 5 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 14 = 43 fries in the pack originally!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Kimo has a busy schedule! 

Okay, so he has 3 classes a day on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and each of those classes is an hour long. That's 3 classes * 1 hour/class = 3 hours per day. Since he has class three of those days a week, that's 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes that are each 2 hours long. So that's 2 classes * 2 hours/class = 4 hours per day.  And he has class two of those days, so that's 4 hours/day * 2 days/week = 8 hours.

In total, he has 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours of class per week.

Over a 16-week semester, that's 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours of class!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find the total length of each type of bread in inches.

* The rolls are 300 * 4 inches = 1200 inches long.
* The croissants are 120 * 6 inches = 720 inches long.
* The baguettes are 60 * 2 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches long.

Now, let's add up the total length in inches: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

Finally, we convert that to feet: 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field, so he runs 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, covering 80 yards each time (40 yards there and 40 yards back). That's 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. In total, Kelly runs 100 + 2720 = 2820 yards.

Kelly runs 2820 - 1500 = 1320 yards farther than Blake.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If the price goes up by 20% every two months, that means it increases by $4 each time ($20 x 0.20 = $4).

Over 36 months, there are 18 of these price increases (36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases).

So, the price goes up a total of $72 ($4 per increase x 18 increases).

Adding that to the original price, a bag of marbles would cost $92 after 36 months ($20 + $72 = $92).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can say Seth's age is 2 times Brooke's age.  In two years, they'll both be older, so we need to add 2 to each of their current ages.  

Let's say Brooke is ""b"" years old now. Seth is ""2b"" years old now. In two years, Brooke will be ""b + 2"" and Seth will be ""2b + 2"".  

We know that in two years, their ages added together will be 28. So:

(b + 2) + (2b + 2) = 28

Combining like terms: 3b + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides: 3b = 24

Dividing both sides by 3: b = 8

So Brooke is 8 years old now. Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is 16 years old.

"Hey there! Let's help Jessica figure this out.

Now, we add the extra amount to her total minimum payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500.

Finally, to find her yearly payment, we multiply her monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18000.

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, there are 15 rats in total (90 pieces / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats).

With the rats split evenly into 3 cages, there must be 5 rats in each cage (15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Elaine started with 20 cards. In the first month, she got three times that amount, so she got 20 * 3 = 60 more cards. That brings her total to 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer than the first month, meaning she got 60 - 20 = 40 cards. Now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

Finally, in the third month, she doubled the amount she collected in the first two months combined. That's 60 + 40 = 100 cards doubled, which is 100 * 2 = 200 cards.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Josie has 10 acres of grapes, and each acre gives her 5 tons of grapes. That's a total of 50 tons of grapes (10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons).  Since each ton makes 2 barrels of wine, she can make 100 barrels in total (50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels).

"Let's see... Carl eats 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, and he eats a sandwich every day for 7 days, so that's 2 * 7 = 14 slices. He also eats omelets with one more slice of cheese than his sandwiches, so that's 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. He had omelets 3 days this week, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 slices. Finally, he used 8 slices for his macaroni and cheese.  

Adding it all up: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Janet starts with 22 green + 10 yellow = 32 pens. Then she gets 6 bags * 9 pens/bag = 54 blue pens, and 2 bags * 6 pens/bag = 12 red pens. That's a total of 54 + 12 = 66 new pens.  Adding those to her starting amount, Janet has 32 + 66 = 98 pens now.

"Hey there! To figure this out, we need to think about how many points Brinley needs in total.  Since she wants a 93 average across six tests, she needs 93 * 6 = 558 points.

She's already earned 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 points.

That means she needs to score 558 - 438 = 120 on her last test! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how many kilometers Micheal biked. 

He biked 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time, so that's 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers every week. Over four weeks, he biked 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Then he biked 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time, meaning he biked 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers each week. For three weeks, that's 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

In total, Micheal biked 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

A chocolate bar weighs 40g, and a candied apple weighs half that, so 40g / 2 = 20g.

There are 25 chocolate bars, so they weigh a total of 25 * 40g = 1000g.

The 80 candied apples weigh 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Adding those together, the whole bag weighs 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Half a dozen plates cost $6000, so that's $3000. Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than that, meaning they cost $1800. Since there are 240 cups in twenty dozen, each cup costs $7.50.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Let's say Jerry has 'r' red chickens and 'w' white chickens. We know:

* White chickens lay 5 eggs a day, and red chickens lay 3.
* Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so w = r + 2.
* He collects 42 eggs every day.

So, the total eggs from red chickens are 3r, and the total eggs from white chickens are 5w.  That means:

3r + 5w = 42

We also know w = r + 2, so let's substitute that in:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Now we can solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4


Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"Hi there! To figure out how long Gary walks, we need to find the distance around the park and then divide that by his speed.

The park is a rectangle, so we add up all the sides: 1.5 miles + 6 miles + 1.5 miles + 6 miles = 15 miles.

Since he walks at 3 miles per hour, it takes him 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day and 150 on the second (100 + 50 = 150). That means in the first two days, she counted 250 customers (100 + 150 = 250).

Since the total for three days was 500, she must have counted 250 customers on the third day (500 - 250 = 250).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Think about it this way: the big pool is losing water at the same rate as the small pool, so the difference in their water levels is due to how much water they had to start with.

Since the big pool now has four times the water as the small pool, and it had twice as much 4 minutes ago, that means the big pool lost the equivalent of twice the small pool's current amount in those 4 minutes.

That means the small pool must have 8 gallons now.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Lori needs to save $320 for the shoes plus $32 for the belt, so that's a total of $352. If she makes $8 an hour, she'll need to work $352 / $8 = 44 hours.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we need to find out how much extra Janeth has to pay back on top of the original $2000. That's 10%, so it's $2000 * 0.10 = $200.

So, in total, she owes $2000 + $200 = $2200.

If she pays $165 each month for 12 months, she'll have paid a total of $165 * 12 = $1980.

That means she'll still owe $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Harriet is 21 now, and Adrian is three times her age, so Adrian is 21 * 3 = 63 years old. Zack is twice Harriet's age, making him 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

In three years, Harriet will be 24, Adrian will be 66, and Zack will be 45.  

Adding those up, their total age will be 24 + 66 + 45 = 135.  

Dividing that by 3, we get an average age of 45.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Jojo's score. 

First, we know Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, so Yuri scored (68 / 2) + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, meaning she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Together, Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since the total score for all four students was 251, Jojo must have scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

First, James has 32 water type cards left (40 - 8 = 32). Then, he has a total of 96 cards (30 + 34 + 32 = 96).

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100%: (32 / 96) * 100% = 33.33%.

Rounding to the nearest integer, the chance is 33%.

Adding the $3.00 meal upgrade for chips and a drink makes it $14.00.  

But wait! He has a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract that.

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but now he only has 3.  Each of those pen pals sends him 2 letters a week, and he writes 2 back, so that's 6 letters he writes and 6 letters he receives each week.

Each letter has 5 pages, so that's 6 letters * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages he writes and 30 pages he receives each week. That's a total of 60 pages!

If he writes a page every 6 minutes, then he spends 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes writing each week.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours writing each week.

She needs this done 4 times a week, so that's $1500 * 4 = $6000 per week.

The movie lasts for 5 weeks, making the total cost before any discounts $6000 * 5 = $30000.

But wait, there's a 10% discount! That means she saves $30000 * 0.10 = $3000.

On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies, for 26 * 200 = 5200 calories. Her sister had 13 cookies, which is 13 * 200 = 2600 calories.

In total, Sue ate 4000 + 5200 = 9200 calories, and her sister ate 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories.

First, we need to find out how many 10-foot sections are in the whole tree. Since the tree is 200 feet tall, there are 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

That means the redwood originally weighed 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

Those pesky termites ate 30% of the wood, which is 8000 pounds * 0.30 = 2400 pounds.

So, the redwood now weighs 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

* The brokerage fee is $350,000 * 0.05 = $17,500
* The transfer fee is $350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000

So, the total cost is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

"Hi there! Let's figure out Mr. Tan's net proceeds. 

First, we need to find out how much he paid in fees:

* Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = $12,000
* Brokerage fees: 5% of $400,000 = $20,000
* Total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

Now, let's add the remaining loan amount to his fees:

* Total expenses: $32,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

Finally, subtract his total expenses from the selling price to find his net proceeds:

* Net proceeds: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000


Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house are $118,000. 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  It takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees, and then it takes 40% longer to get to 400 degrees. That means it takes 20 * 0.40 = 8 more minutes. So, to get to 400 degrees, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Now, cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

In total, from starting the oil to finishing cooking, it takes 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Each house has 3 bedrooms * 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows in the bedrooms.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The collar takes 1/10th the stitches of the body, so that's 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches. The rosette takes twice the collar stitches, meaning it uses 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches.

Together, the body, collar, and rosette use 900 stitches + 90 stitches + 180 stitches = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, each sleeve must use (1800 stitches - 1170 stitches) / 2 = 315 stitches.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Sean has a lot to memorize! His song has 54 lines. Scene 1 has twice the lines of the song, which is 108 lines, but he only has to learn a third of those, so that's 36 lines. Scene 2 has 6 more lines than the song, making it 60 lines long. He needs to learn four-fifths of those, which is 48 lines.

Adding it all up: 36 lines + 48 lines + 54 lines = 138 lines.

Sean has to memorize 138 lines in total.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

First, Carly has 80 cards, and 2/5 of them have the letter A, so that's 32 cards (80 * 2/5 = 32).

That leaves 48 cards (80 - 32 = 48). Then, half of those have the letter B, which is 24 cards (48 / 2 = 24).

That means 24 cards are left (48 - 24 = 24).  Of those, 5/8 have the letter C, which is 15 cards (24 * 5/8 = 15).

Finally, 9 cards are left with the letter D (24 - 15 = 9).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Matthew needs 3 minutes for each small hole and he's digging 30 of those, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 minutes. For the large holes, it's 10 minutes each and he's doing 15, so that's 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.  

In total, that's 90 + 150 = 240 minutes of digging.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is equal to 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Ruby is 6 times older than Sam now, that means Ruby's age is 6 times Sam's age. In 9 years, Ruby will be even older, and 3 times Sam's age at that time.  

To solve this, we can think about it like this:

* Let's say Sam is ""s"" years old now.
* Ruby is 6 times Sam's age, so Ruby is 6s years old now.
* In 9 years, Sam will be s + 9 years old.
* In 9 years, Ruby will be 6s + 9 years old.

We know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times Sam's age then. So:

6s + 9 = 3(s + 9)

Let's solve for ""s"":

6s + 9 = 3s + 27
3s = 18
s = 6

So Sam is 6 years old now.

All the cobras have a total of 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots.

The mambas have 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots.

That means all the snakes have 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots together.

Half of that is 4900 spots / 2 = 2450 spots.

His flight ticket is a bit trickier: 5 times the cost of a suit is $500, and $700 more than that is $1200.

So far, he's spent $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

If he started with $6000 and wants to save $2000, he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left for expenses and gifts.

If we call the number of players on defense ""d"", we know the offense has twice that many, or 2*d* players. The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, which is *d*/2.

Since the total number of players is 105, we can write an equation: 2*d* + *d* + *d*/2 = 105

Combining the 'd' terms, we get 3.5*d* = 105.

Dividing both sides by 3.5 tells us that *d* = 30.

That's a total of 12 + 12 = 24 people invited.

But 8 people got sick and couldn't come, and 8 / 4 = 2 people had other plans.

* **Cows:** Let's say there are 'x' cows.
* **Chickens:** That means there are '2x' chickens.

Since he has 60 animals total, we can make an equation: x + 2x = 60

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 3x = 60.

To find out how many cows ('x') there are, we divide both sides by 3: x = 20

So, there are 20 cows.

Now, to find the chickens, we multiply the number of cows by 2: 20 * 2 = 40 chickens.

* Cows have 4 legs each, so they have a total of 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
* Chickens have 2 legs each, so they have a total of 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

Adding those together, all the animals have 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

"Let's see... Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 each week for four weeks, so that's 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 balls.  But then he drops 3!  Two get caught, so he's left with 6 - 3 + 2 = 5 balls.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

The pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and the other animals weigh:

* Blue beetle: 50 pounds (same as the frog)
* Green toad: 50 pounds (same as the frog)
* Yellow snake: 60 pounds (10 pounds more than the frog)
* Red bird: 30 pounds (20 pounds less than the frog)

Adding up the weight of all the animals: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

Don't forget the container weighs 20 pounds, so the total weight is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The tables with four legs have a total of 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Davos got a great deal! A 40% discount on each $30 shirt means he saved $12 per shirt ($30 x 0.40 = $12).  So each shirt cost him $18 ($30 - $12 = $18). For two shirts, he paid $36 ($18 x 2 = $36).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

They used to make $1000 a day selling tractors ($100 per tractor x 10 tractors). Now they make $1100 a day selling silos ($220 per silo x 5 silos). That's $100 more each day.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the extra money ($100) by the original amount ($1000) and multiply by 100%.  That gives us 10%.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Madeline spends on her furry friend. 

Food costs $25 a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so that's $25 * 4 = $100 per month on food.

Adding in the $20 for treats and $100 for medicine, her total monthly cost is $100 + $20 + $100 = $220.

Over a whole year, that's $220 * 12 = $2640.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Andrea started with $36, spent $11 on a sweater, and gave her brother $4.  To find out how much she saved, we need to subtract those amounts from her starting money: $36 - $11 - $4 = $21.

So Andrea saved $21. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so that's 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. He also watched 3 shows at 2 hours each, for a total of 3 * 2 = 6 hours of shows.

That means he spent 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours on those activities. We know that's 30% of his whole vacation. To find his total vacation time, we can divide: 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours.

Finally, he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so he spent 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours sightseeing.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much more money Annabelle needs. 

She wants a phone that costs $400 and already has $80 saved. That means she needs $400 - $80 = $320 more.

From her first job, she'll earn $10/hour * 20 hours = $200.

Her second job will pay her $5/hour * 15 hours = $75.

Adding up all her earnings, she'll have $200 + $75 + $80 = $355.

Since the phone costs $400, she still needs $400 - $355 = $45.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Billy spent half his change on gumballs, that means he had $4.00 left after buying candy (since 40 gumballs cost $2.00). This means he spent $4.00 on candy.

Since candy costs $1.50 a pound, he bought 2.67 pounds of candy.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. If Carver is 45 and that's 5 years less than twice his son's age, we can set up a little equation.  Twice his son's age would be 45 + 5 = 50.  So, his son is 50 / 2 = 25 years old.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The train travels 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles between the first two cities. Then it goes 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles back to the starting city. That means each full trip is 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles long.

Since the train does this three times a day, it travels 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles every day.

To find out how many days it can go between services, we divide the total service mileage by the daily mileage: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. A collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing (that's the middle amount between 8 pounds for a Rottweiler and 2 pounds for a chihuahua).  

So, for the chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds of stuffing.

For the collie beds, he needs 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds of stuffing.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how long John's trip took. 

First, going to his friend's house, he drove 210 miles (200 miles + a 10-mile detour) at 70 mph. That means it took him 3 hours (210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours).

On the way back, he drove 240 miles at 80 mph, which also took 3 hours (240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours).

Adding the two parts of the trip together, his total travel time was 6 hours (3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, 3 people got kicked out for not wearing masks. Then, 4 times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting, which is 3 * 4 - 5 = 7 people.  Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for fighting over sales, so that's 7 * 3 = 21 people.

In total, that's 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people kicked out for those reasons. Since 50 people were kicked out in total, that means 50 - 31 = 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

"
"Okay, let's figure out the total cost of the senior gifts. 

First, the picture frames will cost 44 seniors * $20/frame = $880.

Etching each frame adds an extra 20%, so that's $20 * 0.20 = $4 per frame.  The total etching cost is then 44 seniors * $4/frame = $176.

Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so that's 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10.

Since 1/4 of the seniors are officers, there are 44 seniors / 4 = 11 officers.  Each officer needs a cord that costs $12, so the total cord cost is 11 officers * $12/cord = $132.

Adding all the costs together: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Karan borrowed $3650 for five months at 10% interest, and she pays the same amount each month, here's how to find her monthly payment:

First, we need to figure out the total interest. That's calculated by multiplying the principal ($3650) by the interest rate (10%) and the time (5 months), then dividing by 100. That comes out to $1825.

Next, we add the interest to the original amount borrowed to find the total she needs to repay: $3650 + $1825 = $5475.

Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment: $5475 / 5 = $1095.


So, Karan has to pay $1095 each month.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Millie's profit. 

She makes 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, she'll earn $36 in total.

She sells 4 cups per hour, and she has enough lemonade for 36 cups, so her stand will be open for 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

That means her hourly profit is $18 / 9 hours = $2/hour.

Let's figure this out. If Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, that means the 12.8 hectares represent 2/5 of his original land.  To find the total land he started with, we can set up a proportion:

(2/5) * Original Land = 12.8 hectares

To solve for the Original Land, we can divide both sides by (2/5):

Original Land = 12.8 hectares / (2/5) = 32 hectares

So Betty has 5 groups * 15 popsicles/group = 75 popsicles.

Sam has 6 groups * 15 popsicles/group = 90 popsicles.

That means Sam has 90 popsicles - 75 popsicles = 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Mel saves 5 hours of AC use each day, and his AC uses 900 watts per hour. That means he saves 900 watts/hour * 5 hours/day = 4500 watt-hours every day.  

To convert that to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000: 4500 watt-hours / 1000 watts/kilowatt = 4.5 kilowatt-hours per day.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so that's 5 * $7.00 = $35.00.

The cheese is $3.00 per pound, so that's 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.

* At 300 words per minute, it will take him 9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes to read.
*  Adding the 10 minutes to get to the airport, he needs 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes total.
* Since he has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, he'll be 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes early.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

In May, the company paid each employee $15/hour * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = $2400 per month.  That means they paid out $2400/employee * 40 employees = $96,000 in May.

In June, they had 40 employees * (1/4) = 10 fewer employees, leaving 30. Their total June payroll was $2400/employee * 30 employees = $72,000.

Adding those together, the company paid a total of $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000 over the two months.

"Hi! Let's figure out how much money Sally has left.

Okay, so she spent $4.50 on taffy (because the second pound was half off!), $1.50 on seashells, and $1.00 on magnets.  That's a total of $7.00 spent.

Since she started with $10.00, she has $3.00 left.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Tim spent on fireworks. 

The second package cost twice as much as the first, so it was $400 * 2 = $800.

Together, the two packages cost $400 + $800 = $1200.

He got a 20% discount, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240 off.

After the discount, the packages cost $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, adding the finale firework, his total cost was $960 + $150 = $1110.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Shannon needs enough cookies for 30 days at 2 cookies a day, so that's 30 * 2 = 60 cookies. Since each batch makes a dozen, or 12 cookies, she'll need to make 60 / 12 = 5 batches.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Each blouse is $20, and they're 30% off. That means each blouse costs $20 - ($20 * 0.30) = $14.

"Let's break this down!

Joanne gets 30 apples from the tallest trees and half that from the shortest, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister gets twice the amount from the tallest trees (30 * 2 = 60 apples) and three times the amount from the shortest (15 * 3 = 45 apples).  

Together, they got 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

Since they got 500 apples total, Joanne must have gotten 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how far Tom traveled. 

He traveled 200 kilometers each day for the first four days, so that's 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance from the first four days, which is 800 * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.

He took a break for one day, so no kilometers there.

In the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for seven days, totaling 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Adding all that up: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Kenny wants to buy a $100 ticket and has $50 left over after buying it, meaning he made $50 from selling his cards.  Since he sells each card for $1.50, he sold $50 / $1.50 = 33.33 cards. Since he can't sell parts of cards, he sold 33 cards.

He kept 1/3 of his cards, meaning he sold 2/3. If 33 cards represent 2/3 of his collection, then 33 cards / (2/3) = 49.5 cards.  He must have started with 50 cards!

"Let's break this down!

The oven heats the house up by 5 degrees each hour for 3 hours, so that's a total of 15 degrees warmer.  That brings the temperature to 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

The window being open for 30 minutes is like half an hour, and the house cools down 2 degrees every 10 minutes. So in 30 minutes, it cools down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

That means the final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Jon takes 40 minutes to swim, 80 minutes to bike, and 50 minutes to run, for a total of 170 minutes. James swims 10% faster than Jon, so he takes 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes to swim.  James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.  

To find James's run time, we subtract his swim and bike times from his total time: 160 - 36 - 85 = 39 minutes.


James took 39 minutes to run.

After buying the hay, he'll have $30 - $24 = $6 left.

For a 3-day stay, the hotel will cost $1800 * 3 = $5400.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and since there are two of them, that's $5000 * 2 = $10000.

Adding the hotel and plane ticket costs, the total trip cost is $5400 + $10000 = $15400.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, who has 20. That means Luri has 20 * 3 = 60 songs.

Gabriel can fit 80 more songs on his player (100 - 20 = 80). Luri can fit 40 more songs (100 - 60 = 40).

That means Gabriel can add 40 more songs than Luri.

So Jillian's bag cost $220. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days, so that's 12 * 5 = 60 miles a week. Since he runs at 10 miles per hour, he runs for 60 / 10 = 6 hours a week.

"Let's figure this out!  

Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats twice a day, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 pounds per horse each day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, he needs 10 * 4 = 40 pounds of oats every day.

Over five days, he'll need 40 * 5 = 200 pounds of oats.

Each bag has 50 pounds, so he'll need 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Nine cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and one is 60 inches.  So the total height of the nine taller cheerleaders is 9 * 64 = 576 inches.  Adding the shortest cheerleader, the total height of everyone is 576 + 60 = 636 inches.

Now, to get the height in feet, we divide by 12 because there are 12 inches in a foot: 636 / 12 = 53 feet.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If we call the number of guests ""x"", we can set up an equation to see when the costs are the same.

Venue 1 costs $200 plus $5 per guest, so the total cost is $200 + $5x.

Venue 2 costs $25 per guest, so the total cost is $25x.

To find when they're equal, we set the two costs equal to each other: $200 + $5x = $25x

Subtracting $5x from both sides gives us: $200 = $20x

Finally, dividing both sides by $20 tells us x = 10.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, which means the zoo has 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.

That means the farm has a total of 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.

The zoo has a total of 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Adding those together, the farm and zoo have 40 animals + 80 animals = 120 animals.

"Hi there!  Let me see... the house cost three times as much as the lot, and together they cost $120,000.  

That means if we think of the lot's cost as one part, the house cost three parts.  That's a total of four parts making up the $120,000.

So, one part (the lot) is worth $120,000 / 4 = $30,000.

"Let's break this down!

We know Juan needs to get down to 4 cups of coffee a day.  He currently drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the recommended amount.  

That means to figure out how much Juan needs to cut back, we need to know the recommended amount first. Let's call that amount ""x"".

Octavia drinks x/2 cups, and Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

So, Juan needs to reduce his intake by 5x - 4 cups.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so she weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, meaning he weighs 130 * 2 = 260 pounds.

To find the average weight, we add up their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

Finally, we divide the total weight by 3: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon. 

The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00 for her first tooth. Then, she got $1.00 for each of the next three teeth, so that's 3 teeth * $1.00/tooth = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount she gave for the previous three, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth.  So for those two teeth, Sharon got 2 teeth * $0.50/tooth = $1.00.

* **Padding:** 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432
* **Removal:** 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864
* **Installation:** 216 square feet * $34/square foot = $7344

He saw 50 birds on the first two days, then none on the third day. On days four and five, he saw 120 birds, 20 on day six, and 90 on day seven.

To find the average, we add up all the birds he saw (50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280) and then divide by the number of days (7).

That means Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day.

"Hey there! This is a fun one. Let's see... if there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue ones, and 1% more green than blue, we can figure this out.  

Since there are 4500 jelly beans total, we need to think about what portion of them are blue.  If we let 'x' be the number of blue jelly beans, we can set up an equation:

x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500

That means 3x = 4500, so x = 1500 blue jelly beans.

That means there are 1485 red jelly beans (0.99 * 1500) and 1515 green jelly beans (1.01 * 1500).

So, there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans!

"Hi there! Let's break this triangle problem down.

We know all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Let's call the smallest angle ""x"".  

One angle is twice the smallest, so that's 2x.

Another angle is three times the smallest, making it 3x.

Now, let's add them all up: x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get 6x = 180.

To find x, we divide both sides by 6: x = 30

The largest angle is 3x, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

Now, let's find the sale prices. The shirt costs $25 - $7.50 = $17.50. The shorts cost $35 - $10.50 = $24.50.

Adding those together, the total cost is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00.

If one DVD can be played 1000 times and one has already been played 356 times, it has 644 plays left (1000 - 356 = 644). The other DVD has 865 plays left (1000 - 135 = 865).

Together, they can be played 1509 more times (644 + 865 = 1509).

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much John's physical therapy cost. 

He went twice a week for 6 weeks, and each session was 2 hours long. That means he had 2 sessions/week * 6 weeks = 12 sessions total.

Since each session was 2 hours, he had a total of 12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours of physical therapy.

If each hour costs $125, then the total cost was 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

"Okay, let's figure this out! Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. At school, he chews one piece every two hours, and school is 8 hours long, so he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces at school.  

He chews one more on the way home and one after dinner, for a total of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces chewed. That leaves him with 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.

Before bed, he gives half of his remaining gum to his sister, which is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

That means Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to know how many kilobytes (kb) are in a megabyte (Mb): there are 1000 kb in 1 Mb. So, Ashley's speed of 20 kb per second is equal to 0.02 Mb per second (20 / 1000 = 0.02).

Now, to find her speed in Mb per hour, we need to multiply her speed per second by the number of seconds in an hour: 0.02 Mb/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 72 Mb/hour.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The tow truck towed 10 cars a day for the first three days, so that's 10 * 3 = 30 cars.

Then it towed 4 fewer cars each day for the rest of the week, meaning it towed 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day.

There are 7 days in a week, and it already towed for 3, leaving 7 - 3 = 4 days.

So, for the rest of the week, it towed 6 * 4 = 24 cars.

In total, the tow truck towed 30 + 24 = 54 cars that week.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how much the company spent to buy all the cars: 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000. Then, we see how much they paid to get those cars: $250,000 * 0.30 = $75,000.

Next, we find the total money made from selling the cars: 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000.  Subtract the cost of buying the cars to find the profit: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, James gets 10% of that profit as his commission: $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The gold jewel costs 4/5 times the price of the diamond, so it costs (4/5) * $2000 = $1600.

The silver jewel is $400 less than the gold jewel, making it $1600 - $400 = $1200.

To find the total price, we add the cost of all three: $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800.

If four apples cost $5.20, then one apple costs $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

Three oranges cost $3.30, so one orange costs $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Five apples would cost $1.30 x 5 = $6.50, and five oranges would cost $1.10 x 5 = $5.50.

In total, Clyde would pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Tim's new yearly earnings. 

First, his raise is $20000 * 0.05 = $1000.

That means his new monthly salary is $20000 + $1000 = $21000.

His bonus is half his old salary, which is $20000 / 2 = $10000.

So, his total monthly earnings are $21000 + $10000 = $31000.

Finally, his yearly earnings are $31000 * 12 = $372000.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much James spent. 

Okay, so he bought 10 suits at $750 each, which is 10 * $750 = $7500.

The dress pants cost 1/5 the price of a suit, so they were $750 / 5 = $150 each. He bought 10 of those, for a total of 10 * $150 = $1500.

He also got 3 dress shirts for every suit, so that's 10 suits * 3 shirts/suit = 30 shirts. Each shirt cost $60, so those were 30 * $60 = $1800.

Adding it all up: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much it cost James to get and keep his plane for a year.

First, we know the plane itself cost $150,000.  Then, he spends $5000 each month on the hanger and double that, or $10,000, on fuel. That means his monthly costs are $5000 + $10000 = $15,000.

Over a whole year, that's $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Adding that to the initial cost of the plane, the total cost for the first year is $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If one twin is older than a triplet by 7 years, and all their ages add up to 44, we can solve for the twin's age.  

Let's think of it this way:

* The triplet's age is like a starting point.
* The older twin is 7 years ahead of that starting point.
* The other twin is the same age as the first triplet.

So, if we take away the extra 7 years from the total age (44), we have 37 left. That 37 is the combined age of the two triplets and the younger twin. Since the triplets and the younger twin are all the same age, we divide 37 by 3, which gives us 12.33. Since we can't have parts of a year, we'll round that down to 12.

Now, remember the older twin is 7 years older, so they are 12 + 7 = 19 years old.

Since he bought 4 candies, each candy costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, for 10 lollipops, it would be 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.

Neil saves 2/5 * 20 coins = 8 more coins than Rong each month. That means Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Over ten years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money John has left. 

The vaccines cost $20 each, so that's $20 * 2 = $40. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so before the check, his bill is $40.  The heartworm check costs $40 * 0.60 = $24.  

That means his total bill is $40 + $24 = $64.  If he brought $125, he'll have $125 - $64 = $61 left.

"Hi there! Let's figure out the price of that fruit crate. 

Okay, so we have 5 bananas, and each banana costs twice as much as an apple, which is $0.50. So each banana costs $1.00.  Then we have 12 apples at $0.50 each, and 7 oranges which cost three times as much as a banana, so each orange is $3.00.

Let's add it all up:

* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

Total cost: $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00


The crate costs $32.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Brittany has 14 red squares, 18 blue squares (because she has 4 more blue than red), 24 green squares (6 more than blue), and 12 white squares (12 fewer than green).

That means she has a total of 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, her comforter is 68 square feet.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many more points class 3B needs.

Okay, so Adam has 50 points. Betty did really well and got 30% more than Adam, which is 15 extra points! That means Betty has 65 points. Tom has 30 less points than Betty, so he has 35 points. Marta collected three times more points than Tom, giving her a total of 105 points.

Adding up all their points, the class has 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 points to go on the trip, so they still need 400 - 255 = 145 more points.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water and 80% of *that* water is for industry, then the rest must be for non-industrial use. That means 20% of the city's water is used for things other than industry.  Since the city uses 40% of the total river water, they use 20% of 40%, which is 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to see how much ice cream they make of each flavor per hour. They make 100 quarts of chocolate in 2 hours, so that's 50 quarts per hour. For vanilla, it's 50 quarts in 4 hours, which means they make 12.5 quarts per hour.

Together, they make 50 + 12.5 = 62.5 quarts per hour.

Now, in 48 hours, they'd make 62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts!

"Hi there! Let's figure out Marcus's bill. 

Okay, so he bought 5 croissants at $3 each, which is 5 * $3 = $15. Then he got 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, so that's 4 * $2.50 = $10.  He also got 3 mini quiches at $4 each, which is 3 * $4 = $12. And finally, 13 blueberry muffins at $1 each, so that's 13 * $1 = $13.

Adding all that up, his subtotal is $15 + $10 + $12 + $13 = $50.

But wait! He has a loyalty card for 10% off. So we take 10% of $50, which is $5.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much James saved.

It cost James $20 to get into the blueberry patch and then $1.50 for every pound he picked. Since he picked 30 pounds, the blueberries cost him $1.50 * 30 = $45.  

Adding the entry fee, his total cost was $45 + $20 = $65.

If he bought 30 pounds of blueberries at the store, it would have cost him $2.50 * 30 = $75.

When her arms are down, she taps 300 times per minute with her right foot and 250 times per minute with her left, for a total of 550 taps per minute.  That's a lot of tapping!

She dances with her arms down for 3 minutes, so that's 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.

With her arms up, she slows down to 200 taps per minute per foot, meaning she taps 400 times per minute total. She does this for 2 minutes, so that's 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

Adding those together, Helga taps a total of 1650 taps + 800 taps = 2450 times.

The other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each (3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices). That's 18 slices total for them (9 slices/person * 2 people = 18 slices).

In total, they ate 42 slices (24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to know how many inches are in Topher's shoe. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, his shoe is 8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 100 inches long.

The problem tells us Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  So, if we let 'x' be the length of Bobby's shoe, we can set up an equation: 100 = 9x + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us 90 = 9x.

Finally, dividing both sides by 9, we find that x = 10.

That means Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long.

If John has 20 playlists with 300 songs each, that's a total of 20 * 300 = 6000 songs.

Since each song is 10 hours long, all those songs together would last for 6000 * 10 = 60000 hours.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so 20 people think horse #2 will win. That leaves 30 people (50 total - 20).  Then 24 of those people think horse #7 will win (60% of 40). That means 6 people must think horse #12 will win (30 total - 24).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If 6 Pomeranian girls are one-third of all the Pomeranians, then there are 6 * 3 = 18 Pomeranians in total. Since Pomeranians make up two-thirds of all Jana's puppies, she has 18 * 3 / 2 = 27 puppies.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Jayden has $70 and Ava gives him $90 / 2 = $45. That means he has a total of $70 + $45 = $115. Since the camera costs $200, he still needs $200 - $115 = $85.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If the third house needs double the first, and all three houses need 250 cases total, we can think about it like this:

* Let's say the first house needs 'y' cases.
* The second house needs twice the first, so it needs 2y cases.
* The third house needs double the first, so it also needs 2y cases.

That means the total is y + 2y + 2y = 250 cases.

Combining the 'y's, we get 5y = 250.

Dividing both sides by 5, we find that y = 50.

Since the third house needs 2y cases, it needs 2 * 50 = 100 cases.

In total, George has 290 pears + 200 bananas = 490 fruits.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Tanya earned. 

On Monday, she earned $15 per hour for 5 hours, which is $15 * 5 = $75. Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5, bringing her Monday total to $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she earned $15 per hour for 2 hours, which is $15 * 2 = $30.  

Adding up both days, she earned $80 + $30 = $110.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Mike's digital movie collection will cost.

First, we need to find out how many movies are in series: 600 movies / 3 = 200 movies.

Since he gets a discount on series, those will cost 200 movies * ($10 * (1/3)) = $666.67.

That leaves 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies that aren't in a series.

Of those, 400 movies * 0.40 = 160 movies are older and cost $5 each, for a total of 160 movies * $5 = $800.

The rest, 400 movies - 160 movies = 240 movies, are newer and cost the full $10 each, so they'll be 240 movies * $10 = $2400.

Adding it all up: $666.67 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67.

Apricots are $3.00 a pound, and he got 6 pounds, so that's $3.00 * 6 = $18.00.

Chase and Rider ride 3 times a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the other two days, they ride twice as much, meaning 3 * 2 = 6 times each day.

Over those two days, they ride a total of 6 * 2 = 12 times.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.  He bought some more fish, and now he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  

Let's say he bought 'w' white fish. That means he has 4 + w white fish in total.

The orange fish he has now would be 3 plus the orange fish he bought (which is 17 - w since he bought 17 total).

We know the orange fish are double the white fish, so:

3 + (17 - w) = 2(4 + w)

Let's solve for 'w':

3 + 17 - w = 8 + 2w
20 - w = 8 + 2w
12 = 3w
w = 4

So Bob bought 4 white fish.

So, Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His two friends who aren't as good only get half that time, which is 10 minutes per quarter. His really good friend gets to play for 1.5 times longer, so that's 30 minutes per quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

* Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
* His two less-skilled friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, for a total of 48 quarters.
* His better friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

Adding it all up, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar. She uses twice as much salt as zest, and twice as much oil as salt.  

Since everything is measured in relation to the zest, let's say she uses 'x' ounces of zest. That means she also uses 'x' ounces of fragrance. Salt and sugar each equal '2x' ounces, and oil is '4x' ounces.

If we add all that up (x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10), we see that all the ingredients together equal 10 ounces.

Simplifying that equation (10x = 10), we find that x = 1.

Finally, to find out how much oil Tanya uses, we multiply the zest amount (x) by 4: 4 * 1 = 4 ounces.


So the answer is 4.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Let's say PJ has 'x' cards. Smendrick has three times that amount, so he has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

All together, they have 341 cards, so: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.  

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329.

Finally, dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 47.

Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 153 cards.

First, the shipping cost based on weight is $0.35 per pound times 4 pounds, which is $1.40. Then, the shipping cost per mile is $0.08 per mile times 20 miles, making it $1.60.  Adding those together, the total shipping cost is $3.00.

Amazon will give Milly back 75% of the $32 price, which is $24.00.

Finally, to find her total loss, we subtract the refund and shipping from the original price: $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.00.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Mulan starts with $40 and gets $100 from her dad, so she has $140.  The jeans cost $60 (2 pairs x $30), and the bag costs $20. That's a total of $80 spent.  If she started with $140 and spent $80, she has $60 left.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Boris makes 8000 bars in the first week and half that amount, or 4000 bars, in the second week. In the third week, he makes three times the amount from the first week, which is 8000 * 3 = 24000 bars.

That's a total of 8000 + 4000 + 24000 = 36000 bars for the first three weeks.

To reach his goal of 50,000 bars for the month, he needs to make 50000 - 36000 = 14000 bars in the fourth week.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Britany makes 18 videos a week, and each one is 4 minutes long, so that's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes on videos.

She also spends 2 hours, or 120 minutes, writing songs.

And her makeup takes 15 minutes a day for 6 days, so that's 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

In total, that's 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes per week on TikTok.

Over a month with 4 weeks, she spends 282 * 4 = 1128 minutes.

That's equal to 1128 / 60 = 18.8 hours.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Angela's installation cost. 

The base installation is $129.00.  She needs 2 extra mirrors at $15.00 each, so that's $30.00. She also has one extra chandelier for $15.00. And for the extra pictures, it's 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00.

Adding it all up: $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $324.00

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Anthony saved $10.00 more than Eva, who saved $20.00, so Anthony has $30.00. Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, which is $12.00.  That means Roy has a total of $42.00.

"Okay, let's break this down!

Pompei lifts a mountain 1 inch high. Saskay lifts 12 times that, so Saskay lifts 1 * 12 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami lifts 4 times higher than Saskay, meaning Kagiyami lifts 12 * 4 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto lifts 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto lifts 48 * 10 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.

"Hmm, this is a tricky one! Let me see... If three kangaroos take 18 hours, that means one kangaroo would take three times as long, which is 54 hours.  

Now, turtles are much slower. They only go half as fast as a kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours, a turtle would take twice as long, which is 108 hours.

But we have four turtles! That means their speeds add up.  Since each turtle takes 108 hours, four turtles together would take 108 hours / 4 = 27 hours.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

If each glue stick starts at 12 millimeters, we need to find out how much is left over from each one and then add those amounts together.

* The first glue stick has 5/6 left, so that's (5/6) * 12 mm = 10 mm unused.
* The second glue stick has 1/3 left, so that's (1/3) * 12 mm = 4 mm unused.
* The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so that's (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm unused.

Adding those together, we get 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Jack has 60 dishes, and that's twice the number of socks he has, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, meaning he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks. Peter also has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

In total, they have 60 socks + 30 socks = 90 socks and 30 dishes + 60 dishes = 90 dishes.  

That means they have a grand total of 90 + 90 = 180 socks and dishes together!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. If James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month and spends $2640 a year, we need to find out how much each pair costs.  

First, we know he buys 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs of shoes a year.

Then, we divide his total spending by the number of pairs: $2640 / 24 pairs = $110/pair.

So, James pays $110 on average for each pair of shoes.

"Let me see...  I'm three years younger than my brother, so if I'm *x* years old, he's *x + 3*. I'm two years older than my sister, so she's *x - 2*. Mom's age is tricky - it's one less than three times my brother's age, so that's *3(x + 3) - 1*.

If we add all our ages together, it equals 87. So, *x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87*.

Let's solve that!  *x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87*

Combining like terms, we get *6x + 9 = 87*.

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us *6x = 78*.

Finally, dividing both sides by 6, we find *x = 13*.

So, I'm 13 years old!

Adding those to the original 10 and the first day's infections, we have 10 + 60 + 360 = 430 people infected.

On the third day, those 430 people infect 6 others each, for a total of 430 * 6 = 2580 new infections.

If we let Fawn have 'F' books, Anne has F - 12 books, and Sofie has F - 12 + 25, which is F + 13 books.

That means 3F + 1 = 85.  

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives us 3F = 84.

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find that F = 28.

So Fawn has 28 books!

Christian is 8 kg heavier than Carl, meaning Christian weighs 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Finally, Harry is 5 kg lighter than Christian, so Harry weighs 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Jo needs 0.5 yards of material for each small mask (2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards/mask) and 0.75 yards for each large mask (2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards/mask).

That means for 20 small masks, she'll need 10 yards (20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards) and for 8 large masks, she'll need 6 yards (8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards).

In total, Jo will need 16 yards of material (10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards).

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many pets Larry has. 

He has 3 cats, and 3 times that many dogs, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, meaning he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Larry has three times as many fish as rabbits, so he has 7 * 3 = 21 fish.

Finally, he has a gerbil collection that's 1/3 the size of his fish collection, which is 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Adding all his pets together: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

Now, let's calculate the total calories for each type of pastry. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories worth of cinnamon rolls. He also baked 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories worth of muffins.

Finally, we add up the calories from both types: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Let's call Peter's age ""P"", Paul's age ""Pa"", and John's age ""J"".

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100 
* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

Since Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages, we can say:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, let's put everything together:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

That simplifies to:

4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:

J = 20

Now we know John is 20. Let's find Peter's age:

P = 2J + 10
P = 2(20) + 10
P = 40 + 10
P = 50


So, Peter is 50 years old.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45.  If they run 24/7 for a month (30 days), that's a lot of widgets!

The Widgeteer 3000 would make 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 would make 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Since each widget sells for $6, the Widgeteer 3000 would earn 43,200 * $6 = $259,200.

The WidgetMaster 9000 would earn 32,400 * $6 = $194,400.

That means Fern would make $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800 more with the Widgeteer 3000.

In total, Cameron pays 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.  A full 24-hour stay would have cost him 1600 pesos.

Over two weeks, 50 patients come in each day, so that's 50 * 14 = 700 new patients.

Adding those to the initial occupied beds, we get 200 + 700 = 900 occupied beds.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first.  That means there were 29 / 4 = 7.25 holes at the end of the first day.  Since ye can't have part of a hole, I reckon the map was a bit off.

Together they caught 339, so A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

Simplifying that equation, we get 9A - 21 = 339.  Adding 21 to both sides gives us 9A = 360. Dividing both sides by 9, we find that A = 40.

First, she flew south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so that's 10 * 30 = 300 miles.

Then she flew north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, which is 2 * 18 = 36 miles.

Finally, she flew south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, covering 5 * 22 = 110 miles.

To find the total distance between her homes, we need to add up the southward distances and subtract the northward distance: 300 - 36 + 110 = 374 miles.

"Hi! Let's figure out how many brownies Greta has left. 

She made 12, got 6 from her office, and her friends had 48, for a total of 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

They ate 18 brownies, so she has 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Nani's brother is 16 because he's twice Nani's age. Nani's sister is 6 because she's 2 years younger than Nani.  That means all together they are 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years old!

"Hi there! Let's figure out how long it takes Andy to string all those racquets. 

* He spends 15 minutes on each synthetic gut racquet, and he has 3 of those, so that's 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.
* For the polyester racquets, it's 22 minutes each, and he has 5, so that's 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.
* The hybrid ones take 18 minutes each, and he has 4, meaning 4 * 18 = 72 minutes for those.

Adding all that up: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

John buys two phones at full price, which is 2 * $600 = $1200. The other two phones are half price, so they cost $600 / 2 = $300 each. That means those two cost 2 * $300 = $600.

In total, John spends $1200 + $600 = $1800 on phones.

"
"Hi there! Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, which has 13 players. That means Zeke's team has 20 players (13 + 7 = 20).  

To find the total number of players on both teams, we add the number of players on each team: 20 + 13 = 33 players.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how long the fence is all the way around. Since it's a rectangle, we add up all the sides: 15 feet + 10 feet + 15 feet + 10 feet = 50 feet.

Robert needs 2 slats for every foot of fence, so he'll need 50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, and the USA has 50 states, then half the number of US states is 50 / 2 = 25.

Together, both countries have 29 + 50 = 79 states.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to know how much all the books cost together: $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Then, we see how much more money Tyler needs: $39 - $14 = $25.

Finally, we divide the amount he needs by how much he earns per hour: $25 / $5 = 5 hours.

Tyler needs to work for 5 hours. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Robert has 30 cherries, and Richard has 10 less than that, so Richard has 20 cherries. That means Richard and Robert have a total of 50 cherries.  Since they have 60 cherries altogether, Jerry must have 10. Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Sunny earned.

On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 6 boxes of apple pie (10 - 4 = 6). That's $60 from gingerbread (10 * $6) and $90 from apple pie (6 * $15).

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread (10 + 5 = 15) and 15 boxes of apple pie. That's $90 from gingerbread (15 * $6) and $225 from apple pie (15 * $15).

In total, Sunny made $150 on Saturday ($60 + $90) and $315 on Sunday ($90 + $225).  That means he earned a total of $465 over the two days ($150 + $315).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Emil is 24, his dad will be double his age, which is 48.  That means his dad is currently 43 (48 - 5). When Emil is 24, his brother will be half his age, meaning he'll be 12.  Right now, his brother is 7 (12 - 5).

Adding their current ages, we get 43 + 7 = 50.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money Pat will spend on plants.

First, we need to figure out how many plants will fit in her flower bed.  Her bed is 111 feet long, which is 1332 inches (111 x 12). Each plant needs 30 inches of space (12 inches wide plus 18 inches between plants). So, she can fit 44 plants (1332 / 30).

Since Pat already has 17 plants, she needs to buy 27 more (44 - 17).

Each plant costs $6, so she'll spend $162 in total (27 x 6).

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Katherine will spend.  

Each basket needs 3 petunias at $3.00 each, so that's 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.

She also wants 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so that's 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.

One basket will cost $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

Since she has 5 baskets, the total cost will be $14.00 * 5 = $70.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Emily needs to peel 90 shrimp, and she can do 6 per minute, so that's 90 / 6 = 15 minutes for peeling.

Then she needs to cook them. She cooks 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so for 90 shrimp it'll take her (90 / 30) * 10 = 30 minutes.

In total, it'll take her 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes to peel and cook all the shrimp.

"Let's break this down!

The air conditioner cooled the room 6 degrees on low (2 degrees/hour * 3 hours) and then another 12 degrees on high (3 degrees/hour * 4 hours). That's a total of 18 degrees cooler.

But then the room warmed up 4 degrees while the AC was off (2 degrees/hour * 2 hours).

So, the final temperature was 14 degrees cooler than the starting temperature (18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Comet Halley comes around every 75 years. Bill's dad saw it when he was 30. Bill saw it again when he was three times his dad's age at that time.  That means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Since the comet comes every 75 years, and Bill was 90 when he saw it, that means one full cycle (75 years) had passed, and then another 15 years.

So, Bill was 75 years old when he first saw the comet!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The second plane takes 44 trips, which is half the number the first plane takes. So the first plane takes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

It flies to Greece for three-quarters of those, which is 88 * (3/4) = 66 flights. That leaves 88 - 66 = 22 flights for France and Germany.

Since those are split equally, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France each day.

We know Helene is twice the average age of the group, and the total age of all four children is 20. Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4, so let's add those together: 3 + 4 = 7.

That means Helene and Wilfred's ages combined must equal 20 - 7 = 13. Since Helene is twice the average age (and the average age is 20 / 4 = 5), Helene is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Okay, so half of the 3000 students are over 16, which is 1500 students. A quarter of those older students are boys, meaning 375 are boys over 16. That leaves 1125 girls over 16.

The other half of the students are under 16, so that's another 1500 students. Half of them are boys, which is 750 boys. That means there are 750 girls under 16.

Adding the girls from both age groups, we get 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls in total.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is (1/4) * 18000 gallons = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she pumped (3/4) * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.

Together on day one, they pumped 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons.

On day two, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her day one amount, which is (2/3) * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her day one amount, which is (1/3) * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons.

On day two, they pumped a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons.

In total, they pumped 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

"Let's see... this is a bit tricky!  

Okay, so the power bank lost 9% of its charge every hour for 5 hours, that's a total of 45% lost. Then it lost another 21% over the next 3 hours. That means it lost a total of 66% of its charge before it got down to 28%.

Hmm... so if 28% is what's left after losing 66%, that means 34% was left *before* her friends started using it (100% - 66% = 34%).

And since her friends used 6% of the power bank's charge, that means the power bank was at 40% when Maria left for the park (34% + 6% = 40%).

"Hey there! Let's figure out how many plums Jamaar can buy. 

First, we need to find out how much he spent already.  

* Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50

* Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
* Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

That's a total of $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25 spent.

Jamaar started with $10.00 and spent $9.25, leaving him with $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, he can buy $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums.


He can buy 3 plums!

There are 60 questions total, and 40% are easy, so that's 60 * 0.40 = 24 easy questions.  The rest, 60 - 24 = 36 questions, are split evenly between average and difficult, meaning there are 36 / 2 = 18 of each.

Aries gets 75% of the easy questions right, so that's 24 * 0.75 = 18 easy questions correct. She gets half of the average and difficult ones right, so that's 18 * 0.50 = 9 correct for each type.

In total, she's sure to get 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, and each small one costs $4, a large one costs $12.

She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Her earnings from the large stuffed animals would be 12x dollars, and from the small ones, it would be 8x dollars (since 2x small stuffed animals * $4 each = 8x dollars).

In total, she made $120, so 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find that x = 6.

Since she sold 2x small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"Let's see... a dwarf with just his hands mines 12 pounds a day. With an iron pickaxe, that's double, so 24 pounds a day. A steel pickaxe is 50% better than iron, so that's another 12 pounds on top of the 24, making it 36 pounds a day.

So one dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds a day times 30 days in a month, which is 1080 pounds.  

Now, with 40 dwarves, that's 1080 pounds per dwarf times 40 dwarves, giving us a grand total of 43200 pounds!

Then 40% of the red balloons pop, which is 25 * 0.40 = 10 balloons.  That leaves her with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

She loses half her yellow balloons, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons gone. She has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then she finds 8 blue balloons and keeps 75% of them, which is 8 * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons.

Finally, she has 15 red + 6 yellow + 6 blue = 27 balloons when she gets to school.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

There are a few ways Marcus could avoid doing his homework:

* **Lucky Break:** If a substitute teacher comes, he's off the hook! That's a 50% chance.
* **Extension:** Even with his regular teacher, there's a 40% chance the whole class gets more time.
* **Dog Ate It:** If the teacher doesn't give everyone an extension, Marcus could try the classic ""dog ate my homework"" excuse. That has a 20% chance of working.

So, to find the chance he *actually* has to turn it in, we need to look at the opposite:

* **No Substitute:** That's a 50% chance.
* **No Class Extension:** That's 60% of the time the regular teacher is there (100% - 40% extension chance).
* **No Dog Excuse:** That's 80% of the time he doesn't get an extension (100% - 20% dog excuse chance).

To get the final chance he has to turn it in, we multiply those probabilities together: 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.24 or 24%.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If there are 6000 seats and 950 are for graduates and 300 for faculty, that leaves 4750 seats for guests.  Since there are 950 graduates, each one would get 4750 / 950 = 5 tickets.

"Let's figure this out! Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, so that's 75 * 2 = 150 medium beans.  And since 3 small beans are like 1 medium bean, he can eat 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so that's 6 * 3 = 18 hours total. She earns $15 per day, so for 3 days she makes $15 * 3 = $45.  But remember, she spends $3 on parking each day, so that's $3 * 3 = $9 for parking.  

So, her total earnings after parking are $45 - $9 = $36.  To find her hourly rate, we divide her earnings by the number of hours: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, Jim takes out $50,000 in loans each year for four years, which means he has a total of $200,000 in loans. He was making $25,000 a year before college, and his degree triples his income to $75,000 a year.  While he's in school, he misses out on earning $25,000 a year for four years, so that's another $100,000.

In total, Jim needs to earn back $300,000 ($200,000 in loans + $100,000 in lost wages).  At his new salary of $75,000 a year, it will take him 4 years to earn that back.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Jim needs his fabric to be bigger than the bed on all sides, so we need to add 2 feet to both the length and width. That means each piece of fabric will be 10 feet long (6 + 2 + 2) and 12 feet wide (8 + 2 + 2). To find the total area, we multiply the length and width: 10 feet * 12 feet = 120 square feet.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Okay, so on Monday they delivered 425 letters. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's amount.  That means they delivered 425 / 5 = 85 letters on Monday, plus 17 more, for a total of 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice the amount from Tuesday. So that's 102 * 2 = 204 letters, plus 5 more, for a total of 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Finally, to find the total for all three days, we add up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday's deliveries: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to make sure we're comparing apples to apples, so let's change Xavier's height to inches too. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Xavier started at 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, Xavier grew 3 inches, so he's 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches tall.

Cole started at 50 inches and grew 2 inches, making him 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches tall.

Finally, the difference between their heights is 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

"Hi there! Let me see... they divided $1920, the second person got $80 more than the first, and the third got twice the second person's share.  

To figure out the first person's share, let's think of it like this:

*  Let's say the first person got 'x' dollars.
* The second person got 'x + $80'.
* The third person got '2 * (x + $80)' which is '2x + $160'.

If we add all that up, it should equal $1920: x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Combining the 'x's and the dollar amounts, we get: 4x + $240 = $1920

Now, let's subtract $240 from both sides: 4x = $1680

Finally, divide both sides by 4 to find out what 'x' is: x = $420


So the first person's share was $420.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If we let Donovan's cooking time be ""x"", Betsy's time would be ""x + 18"". Since they cooked for a total of 98 minutes, we can write the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 18 = 98.  

Subtracting 18 from both sides gives us 2x = 80.

Finally, dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 40. This means Donovan cooked for 40 minutes.

Betsy cooked for x + 18 minutes, so she cooked for 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Hi! Let's figure out how much Kayla's party will cost. 

First, we need to know how many people are coming. She invited 25 classmates + 7 dance friends + 13 family members = 45 people. But, 4 people can't make it, so 45 - 4 = 41 guests will be there.

The theater costs $125 for the first 20 people, and then $6 for each extra person. Since 41 guests are coming and 20 are included in the base price, that means 41 - 20 = 21 extra people.

So, the extra guests will cost 21 * $6 = $126.

First, we know he sold 150 Trekking bikes (half of 300), 45 BMX bikes (15% of 300), and the rest were MTB bikes, which is 105 bikes (300 - 150 - 45).

A BMX bike costs $250 (half the price of an MTB), and a Trekking bike costs $450.

So, his earnings from Trekking bikes are 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500.

Earnings from BMX bikes are 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250.

And earnings from MTB bikes are 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500.

Let's see... if the Allosaurus ate 270 kg, and that was half of what was left after the velociraptors had their fill, then there must have been 270 kg * 2 = 540 kg before the velociraptors got to it.  And since that 540 kg was only half of what the T-Rex left behind, the triceratops must have started with 540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg of meat!

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much it will cost to paint Tony's room. 

First, we need to find the total area of all the walls. The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so they each have an area of 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, that's 160 square feet total.

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, giving us 40 square feet each. With two of those walls, that's another 80 square feet.

Adding those together, the total area of all the walls is 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so Tony will need 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons of paint.

If each gallon costs $12, then the total cost will be 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Ellen left 3 shaken sodas. Her brother took one, so there are 2 left. There are 8 sodas total now. That means there's a 2 out of 8 chance her friend will get a shaken one.  

That's a 25% chance!

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.  

If one train goes 60 miles an hour and the other goes half that, the slower train is going 30 miles an hour.  

After 3 hours, the faster train will have gone 180 miles (60 x 3) and the slower train will have gone 90 miles (30 x 3).

That means they'll be a total of 270 miles apart!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Okay, so Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day, meaning he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people each day.

There are 31 days in March and 19 in April, for a total of 31 + 19 = 50 days.

He takes 20% of those days off, which is 50 * 0.20 = 10 days.

That means he works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

In total, he helps 40 * 6 = 240 people.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The biggest slide takes 300 feet / 60 feet per minute = 5 minutes to ride.

The second biggest slide takes 240 feet / 80 feet per minute = 3 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Lauren wants to live on 40% of her $100,000 salary during retirement, which is $40,000 per year.  Since she wants to retire comfortably for 20 years, she'll need a total of $40,000 * 20 = $800,000 saved up.

She's saving 20% of her salary each year, which is $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000. To reach her goal of $800,000, she'll need to save for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

She needs to hike 1800 more miles (9300 miles - 7500 miles). To do that in 30 days, she needs to add 60 miles to her daily hikes (1800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day).

"Let's figure this out!  

The first two workers make 6 toys an hour each, so together they make 12 toys an hour.  The other two workers make 4 toys an hour each, for a total of 8 toys an hour. That means those four workers make 20 toys an hour together (12 + 8 = 20).

Over 10 hours, they make 200 toys (20 toys/hour * 10 hours). Since they needed 400 toys and still need 20 more, they made 380 toys (400 - 20 = 380).

That means the fifth worker made 180 toys (380 - 200 = 180) over the 10-hour shift.  

So, the fifth worker makes 18 toys an hour (180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour).

Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together they painted 26 eggs (56 total eggs - 30 = 26). So, Arnold painted 13 eggs (26 / 2 = 13).

* The boxes themselves weigh 200 ounces too (25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces).
* That means everything together weighs 400 ounces (200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces).

That means he has 50 + 420 = 470 cows and 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

In total, he has 470 + 230 = 700 animals on his farm.

If the ratio of men to women is 5:9, that means for every 5 men, there are 9 women.  

We know there are 84 passengers total, and that represents 14 parts (5 + 9). So each ""part"" of the ratio is equal to 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers.

That means there were initially 9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women on the bus.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 women - 20 women = 34 women left on the bus.

Over 3 days, he makes $2.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

He earned a total of $26 from individual sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over 3 days.

Okay, so Hortex makes 4200 bottles a day, and each bottle gives you 20% of your energy needs. That means they're currently covering 4200 * 0.20 = 840% of someone's daily energy needs.

We need to find out how much more they need to make to cover 100% for 2300 people. That's a total of 2300 * 100% = 230,000% of energy needed.

To find the difference, we subtract: 230,000% - 840% = 229,160%.

"Let's see... Tyrion uses 2 masks each time he goes out, and he goes out 3 times a day. That means he uses 2 * 3 = 6 masks every day.  Over two days, he'd use 6 * 2 = 12 masks.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 36 eggs. Lamar found 5, Stacy found twice that amount (5 x 2 = 10 eggs), Charlie found 2 less than Stacy (10 - 2 = 8 eggs), and Mei found half as many as Charlie (8 / 2 = 4 eggs).  

That means they found a total of 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

If they found 27 eggs, there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hidden.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much John makes. 

Okay, so he collects from two complexes with 200 apartments each, that's 200 * 2 = 400 apartments.

The third complex is 60% bigger than those two combined, so it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments than each of the first two.

That means the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

In total, he collects from 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

He collects from each place 3 times a week, so that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 collections.

Since he earns $0.40 per collection, he makes 4320 * $0.40 = $1728.00 each week.


$1728.00

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many fruits that avocado tree can produce.

* A 6-year-old tree makes three times the fruits of a 5-year-old, so that's 50 fruits * 3 = 150 fruits.
* A 7-year-old tree makes seven times the fruits of a 5-year-old, so that's 50 fruits * 7 = 350 fruits.
*  We know a 10-year-old tree makes 20 times the fruits of a 5-year-old, which is 50 fruits * 20 = 1000 fruits.
* An 8-year-old tree makes 200 less fruits than a 10-year-old, so that's 1000 fruits - 200 fruits = 800 fruits.

Adding up all the fruits from each year: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = 2350 fruits.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, and the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, we can use some clever math to find the red rope's length.

Since all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long, we need to think about how much each rope contributes to that total.  

Let me see... *thinks hard* ...Aha! The red rope is the longest, so let's start there.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If half the mural is yellow, that means 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints were yellow.  That leaves 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints for the red, white, and purple. Since they're used in equal amounts, each of those colors used 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

"Hi there! Let's figure out the total area of Tom's house. 

Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so each one is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.  Since he has four bedrooms, that's 240 * 4 = 960 square feet for all the bedrooms.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, meaning it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding up the bedrooms and living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

Finally, don't forget the rest of the house, which is 1000 square feet.  The total area is 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half because they scored 2 fewer than Team A's 4 goals.  In the second half, Team B scored 8 goals (4 times their first-half score). Team A scored 2 goals in the second half, which is a quarter of Team B's second-half score. That means Team A scored a total of 6 goals (4 in the first half + 2 in the second half) and Team B scored 10 goals (2 in the first half + 8 in the second half).  

Adding those together, there were a total of 16 goals in the match.

"Hi there! Let's break this problem down.

Let's say Wendy's current age is ""w"" and Colin's current age is ""c"".

We know:

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years:  w = 5(c + 7)
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Let's solve for ""c"", Colin's current age.

From the first equation, we can say w = 5c + 35.

Now, substitute this value of ""w"" into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for ""c"":

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
40/3 = (2/3)c
c = (40/3) * (3/2)
c = 20


Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Let's figure this out!

They used 38 bandages the first day and ordered 50 more, so they had 38 + 50 = 88 bandages.

On the second day, they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

The third day they used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

They also ordered two packs that day, so they got 2 * 50 = 100 more bandages.

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.  

So, working backwards, before the third day they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages.

Before the second day, they had 103 + 28 = 131 bandages.

That means they started with 131 - 38 = 93 bandages.

Over two weeks, he emptied the dishwasher 6 times, did laundry once, took out the trash twice, and cleaned his room once.

So, here's the breakdown:

* Dishwasher: 6 times * $0.50/time = $3.00
* Laundry: 1 time * $3.00/time = $3.00
* Trash: 2 times * $0.75/time = $1.50
* Room: 1 time * $1.50/time = $1.50

"Hi there! Let's break this down. 

John spends $600 on 10 bottles of scotch, meaning each bottle costs $60. Cognac bottles cost 50% more, so each one is $60 + ($60 * 0.50) = $90. Since he buys twice as many cognac bottles, that's 10 * 2 = 20 bottles.  His total cognac cost is 20 * $90 = $1800.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many trees Mr. Julius planted.

On the first day, he planted 20 White Oak trees and twice that many Lodgepole Pines, which is 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pines. That's a total of 20 + 40 = 60 trees for day one.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oaks, bringing his total to 20 + 10 = 30 White Oaks. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pines than the day before, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pines. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pines on day two. That's a total of 30 + 50 = 80 trees for day two.

Adding up both days, Mr. Julius planted a grand total of 60 + 80 = 140 trees!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to find out how many jelly beans fit in the jar. The jar is like a box, so we multiply the length, width, and height: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

But jelly beans don't fit perfectly together, so we need to account for that 80% efficiency. That means only 80% of the jar's space is actually filled with jelly beans: 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we know each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches. So, we divide the usable space by the size of each jelly bean: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

Tim thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red, so he'd guess: 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

The real number of red jelly beans is 900.  To see how far off Tim was, we find the difference: |864 - 900| = 36.


Tim was off by 36 jelly beans.

Carly needs enough treats for 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats, so she needs 5 * 2 = 10 treats total.

Let's say Carly makes 'c' cupcakes. She makes 3c - 2 brownies.

So, the total number of treats is c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combining like terms, we get 4c - 2 = 10

Adding 2 to both sides, we have 4c = 12

Dividing both sides by 4, we find c = 3.


Carly made **3** cupcakes.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Karen's total cost. 

A manicure and pedicure together would normally cost $35 + $40 = $75.  But since she's getting both, she gets a 20% discount, which is $75 * 0.20 = $15 off. So, the manicure and pedicure will cost $75 - $15 = $60.

Adding nail art to all 10 nails will cost $3/nail * 10 nails = $30.

In total, Karen will pay $60 + $30 = $90.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Susan gets 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

She also has one magazine that sends 6 issues a year.

Her last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine, so that's 6 * 4 = 24 issues.

Adding all those up, she gets 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 magazines a year!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The toy cost $72 in December after the increase. A 50% decrease means the price goes down by half of $72, which is $36. So, the price in January would be $72 - $36 = $36.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Charlie makes.

He earns $80 for each regular lesson, and he has 4 of those, so that's 4 * $80 = $320.

For veterans, he charges $80 - ($80 * 0.25) = $60 per lesson. He has 2 veteran lessons, so he makes 2 * $60 = $120 from those.

Adding it all up, Charlie makes $320 + $120 = $440 today.

"Hi there! To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her quiz scores and then divide by the total number of quizzes.  

Let's add them up: 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Now, divide the sum by 9 (the number of quizzes): 630 / 9 = 70

Sally's mean score is 70.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. If 9 novels is three-quarters of the total she wrote this year, we can think of it like this: 9 novels represent 3 out of 4 equal parts.  To find the whole (all 4 parts), we divide the number of novels she wrote this year by 3, and then multiply by 4.

So, 9 novels / 3 = 3 novels per part.

Then, 3 novels/part * 4 parts = 12 novels.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Michael travels 50 km every hour, and he drives for 3 days, which is 72 hours (24 hours/day * 3 days). That means he covers 3600 km in total (50 km/hr * 72 hours).

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find out what percentage of the distance he's covered, we divide the distance he traveled by the total distance and multiply by 100%: (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100% = 60%.

"
"Let's see... Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times that amount, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.  That means they used a total of 6 + 30 = 36 grapes for the juice.

Their mom used 48 grapes for the pies because she needed 12 grapes per pie and made 4 pies.

So, at the beginning, they had 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

He spends $1.00 on pasta, $3.00 on cheddar, and $6.00 on gruyere (since that's twice the cheddar cost). That's a total of $10.00 per week.

Over a whole year, with 52 weeks, he spends $10.00/week * 52 weeks/year = $520.00 on his macaroni and cheese.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, the custodian has to clean 80 classrooms, and each one takes 15 minutes. That's a total of 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes of cleaning.

They work 8 hours a day, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes. Over 5 days, that's 480 * 5 = 2400 minutes of work.

To find the percentage of time spent cleaning, we do (1200 / 2400) * 100% = 50%.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Each middle shelf holds 10 books, and the bottom shelf holds twice that, so it holds 20 books. The top shelf holds 5 fewer books than the bottom, meaning it holds 15 books. That's a total of 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books per bookcase.

Since Elly has 110 books, she'll need 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.

She can sell those in 60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets.

That means she'll make 20 sets * $1.00/set = $20.00.

Her profit is $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

"Hi there! Let me see... Mary makes some strawberry cubes, and then blueberry cubes which are 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  If she makes 116 total, let's figure out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

If we say 's' is the number of strawberry cubes, then the blueberry cubes are 5s - 4.  

All together, that's s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combining the 's' terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides gives us 6s = 120

Dividing both sides by 6, we find s = 20 strawberry cubes.

Finally, to find the blueberry cubes, we do 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 blueberry cubes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Jason needs 15 customers to buy cars. Since he gets one customer for every 25 calls, that means he needs to make 15 customers * 25 calls/customer = 375 calls.

But wait! He only gets a customer for every two dealership visits. So he needs to have 15 customers * 2 dealership visits/customer = 30 dealership visits.

To get those 30 dealership visits, he needs to make 30 dealership visits * 25 calls/dealership visit = 750 calls.

"Let's see... they have 4 flashlights, one for each person.  They also have 2 flashlights per room, so that's 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights.  

For candles, half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 candles. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 candles.

In total, they have 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Adding the candles and flashlights, they have 36 + 4 = 40 candles and flashlights.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Gary's boat is worth.

After the first year, the boat loses 30% of its value, which is $9000 * 0.30 = $2700.  That means it's worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

The second year, it loses another 30%, or $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.  So now it's worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

Finally, in the third year, it loses 20%, which is $4410 * 0.20 = $882.  That leaves the boat worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

If they make 5000 bars a day and sell each for $2, they make $10,000 every day. Over a week, that's $70,000.  So in two weeks, they'd make $140,000.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Jake spent. 

Okay, so the T-shirts are buy one get one 50% off. That means the second T-shirt is $8 / 2 = $4.  

So the total for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is $40 * 0.40 = $16. That means the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Adding it all up, Jake spent $12 + $24 = $36 at the store.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Ryan earned $6 a week for 3 weeks, so that's $6 * 3 = $18.  He spent $1.25 on each of the 4 ice cream cones, for a total of $1.25 * 4 = $5.  That means he has $18 - $5 = $13 left. Since movie tickets cost $6.50 each, he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Ellen and Lani spent. 

Ellen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a frame, so that's $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani spent $30 on sunglasses and $100 on each of the two bathrobes, meaning she spent $30 + ($100 x 2) = $30 + $200 = $230.

Adding their spending together, they spent a total of $105 + $230 = $335.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Tim's profit. 

Okay, so each jar costs $12 for passion fruit, $12 for jackfruit, and $20 for honey, for a total of $44 per jar. Since he sells each jar for $50, he makes a profit of $6 per jar.  If he sells 10 jars, his total profit would be $60.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money Justin has. 

* He has 32 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, so those are worth 32 * $0.25 = $8.00.
* His 95 dimes are worth 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.
* The 120 nickels add up to 120 * $0.05 = $6.00.
* And finally, his 750 pennies are equal to 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Adding all that up, Justin has $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00 in his jar.

"Hi! Let's figure out how much money Janet has left. 

First, her movie tickets cost $7.50 each, and she bought two, so that's $7.50 x 2 = $15.00.

Then, we add up all her spending: $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00.

Finally, we subtract her spending from the money her parents gave her: $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00.

Janet has $13.00 left.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Josh works 5 days a week and services 3 cars each day, so he works on 15 cars per week.  He makes $4 for each car, so he earns $60 each week. Over two weeks, he'd make $120.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many cookies Randy has. 

He starts with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies, for a total of 18. Then he eats one of each kind for a snack, leaving him with 16. He eats 2 more oatmeal cookies for lunch, bringing his total down to 14.  He gives away 2 sugar cookies, leaving him with 12. Finally, he bakes 4 of each kind, adding 12 more cookies. That means he has 12 + 12 = 24 cookies!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Matthew has 12 toys, and he's selling half for $5 each and the other half for $7 each. That means he's selling 6 toys for $5 each, which is 6 * $5 = $30.  Then he's selling another 6 toys for $7 each, which is 6 * $7 = $42.

If he sells them all, he'll make $30 + $42 = $72.

"Let's figure this out! The dog digs a whopping 84 holes while Nate is gone (6 holes/day * 14 days).  Every day, Nate fills 9 holes but the dog digs 6 more, so he's making progress by 3 holes each day (9 - 6 = 3).  To fill all 84 holes, it will take him 28 days (84 holes / 3 holes/day). That's equal to 4 weeks (28 days / 7 days/week).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Butler High School enrolls 3/4 the number of students as Norman High School, which means they have (3/4) * 4000 = 3000 students.  

Norman High School has 4000 - 3000 = 1000 more students than Butler High School.

"Hi there! Let's see... they made 7995 cookies total, and 2595 were rainbow and 3075 were oatmeal.  That means they made 2325 chocolate chip cookies!

"Let's break this down!

Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, but Igor only brought 16 / 2 = 8.

Igor brought 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

That's 8 + 16 + 7 = 31 items in total, but Igor only put 29 on the bench.

That means Igor lost 31 - 29 = 2 items.

Since he brought the right number of beakers, he must have lost 2 Petri dishes.

Igor didn't lose any beakers!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

James needs 2 screws per leg, and each table has 4 legs, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 screws per table. Since he has 4 tables, he'll need 8 * 4 = 32 screws in total.  

He starts with 40 screws and uses 32, leaving him with 40 - 32 = 8 screws.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money they raised. 

Alexandra raised $430, and Kim raised $320 more than that, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total, we add up everyone's earnings: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, who ran 2 miles. That means Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since Aaron is twice as fast as Vanessa, he runs each mile in half the time it takes her. If Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, that means he runs each mile in 8 minutes. Vanessa takes twice as long, so she runs each mile in 16 minutes.  

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, it took her 4 miles * 16 minutes/mile = 64 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  He needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and he has 200 feet of dock. That means he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line.  Since he already has 6 feet, he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 more feet of line.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Tom's restaurant makes $15 per reservation since each group gets 2 meals at $5 each plus a $5 bottle of wine. With 6 reservations a night, they make $90 each night. Since they're open 2 days a week, they make $180 a week.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If the vendor wants to make a 25% profit on the $80 he spent, he needs to make an extra $20 (because 25% of 80 is 20). That means he needs to sell all the watermelons for $100 total.

To find out how much each watermelon costs, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons: $100 / 50 watermelons = $2 per watermelon.

"Let's break this down!

Dora is turning 12 in 3 years, so she's currently 9 years old.  James is twice her age, making him 18.  John was 19 when James was born, so he's now 37. His youngest son was born when John was 32, meaning the son is currently 5. In three years, the youngest son will be 8 years old.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Ana peels oranges faster than Jane. In an hour, Ana can peel 20 oranges (60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges). Jane can peel 15 oranges in an hour (60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges).

That means Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Mark paid. 

The radiator was originally $400, but he got a sweet deal at the junk shop – 80% off! That means he saved $400 * 0.80 = $320.  So, the radiator only cost him $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic charged $50 per hour and it took 3 hours, so that's $50 * 3 = $150.

Adding the radiator cost and the mechanic's fee, Mark paid a total of $80 + $150 = $230.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If we think about it, chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4.  We know there are 20 animals total and 70 legs.  

Hmm, let me see... if we try a few numbers, we can see that 5 chickens would have 10 legs (5 x 2 = 10), and that leaves 60 legs for the cows. Since cows have 4 legs each, that means there would be 15 cows (60 / 4 = 15).

Let's check: 5 chickens + 15 cows = 20 animals. That works!

So the answer is **5**.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  They have 7 pizzas with 8 slices each, so that's 7 * 8 = 56 slices total.  Since there are 4 people sharing, each person gets 56 / 4 = 14 slices.
