"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

First, we figure out how much the house value increased: $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.

Then, we add that increase to the original price to find the total value: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Next, we add the repair cost to the original price to see his total investment: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

Finally, we subtract his investment from the final value to find his profit: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

Josh made a profit of $70,000.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 40 cups. Since each chicken needs 3 cups a day, and she has 20 chickens, she needs a total of 60 cups.  That means she needs to give them 20 more cups in the final meal.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

If Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times that amount, then Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.

Adding them all up, Seattle's 20 + Charleston's 80 + Toulouse's 160 equals a total of 260 sheep.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Carla downloads 40% of the file (which is 80 GB) before the restart. That took her 40 minutes (80 GB / 2 GB/minute).  

Then there's a 20-minute restart delay.

She has 120 GB left to download, which will take another 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB/minute).

Adding it all up: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

John drives 180 miles initially (3 hours * 60 mph).  Then, he's stuck for 2 hours, so he doesn't cover any more ground.  He then drives 15 miles (0.5 hours * 30 mph) before hitting the open road.  In the remaining 1.5 hours, he covers 120 miles (1.5 hours * 80 mph).

That means he covers a total of 135 miles on his way back (15 miles + 120 miles).

Since he drove 180 miles out and 135 miles back, he's 45 miles from home.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Eliza's earnings. 

She makes $10 an hour for her first 40 hours, so that's 40 * $10 = $400.

She worked 5 hours of overtime, and her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.  So her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

Adding her regular pay and overtime pay, Eliza earned a total of $400 + $60 = $460 this week.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

The program had 60 downloads the first month. In the second month, it got three times that amount, which is 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.  But then in the third month, downloads dropped by 30% from the second month. That's a reduction of 180 * 0.30 = 54 downloads. So, the third month had 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Adding up all three months, we get 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that's after selling some, we need to work backwards. Think of it like this:

* **Before the orange house:** She had 5 + (the amount she sold at the orange house).
* **Before the red house:** She had that amount + 2 (since she sold 2 at the red house).
* **Before the green house:** She had that amount * 3 (since she sold 1/3 at the green house).

Let's say 'x' is the original number of vacuum cleaners.  We can set up an equation:

x = (5 + (x/2 - 1)) * 3 + 2

Solving for x:

x = (5 + x/2 - 1) * 3 + 2
x = (x/2 + 4) * 3 + 2
x = 3x/2 + 12 + 2
x = 3x/2 + 14
x - 3x/2 = 14
x/2 = 14
x = 28

Melanie started with 28 vacuum cleaners.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

If 20% of the 20 students are doing contemporary, that's 4 students. That leaves 16 students. Then, 25% of those 16 students are into jazz, which is another 4 students.  That means 12 students are left for hip-hop.

So, 12 out of 20 students like hip-hop, which is 60%!

"Hey there! Let's break down Jill's earnings. 

She makes $20 an hour teaching and works 35 hours a week, so that's $20 * 35 = $700 per week from teaching.

As a cheerleading coach, she earns $30 an hour for 15 hours a week, totaling $30 * 15 = $450 per week.

Adding those together, she makes $700 + $450 = $1150 each week.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. If $19.50 is 75% of the original price (because of that 25% discount), we can set up a simple equation: 0.75 * original price = $19.50.

To find the original price, we divide both sides by 0.75:

original price = $19.50 / 0.75 = $26.00

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we need to find out how much Marie spent on the chicken, milk, and apples:

* Chicken: $12
* Milk: 5 packs * $3/pack = $15
* Apples: 4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6

That's a total of $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid $50 in total, she spent $50 - $33 = $17 on pizza.

If each pizza box costs $8.50, she bought $17 / $8.50/box = 2 boxes of pizza.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Mishka spent. 

She bought 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each, so that's 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.

Then she got 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each, which is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

Finally, she bought 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each, making it 3 * $42 = $126.00.

Adding it all up: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00


Mishka spent $243.00 on all the clothes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Cynthia eats ice cream every day for 60 days, so that's 60 servings. Each carton has 15 servings, so she'll need 4 cartons (60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons).  Since each carton costs $4.00, her total cost will be $16.00 (4 cartons * $4.00/carton).

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Darrell and Allen's ages have a ratio of 7:11, meaning for every 7 years Darrell is, Allen is 11.  Their combined age is 162.

First, we figure out the value of one ""part"" of the ratio: 162 / (7 + 11) = 9.

This means Darrell is 7 * 9 = 63 years old, and Allen is 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, the first friend guesses 80 jelly beans. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of that, which is 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend, which is 80 * 0.25 = 20 more jelly beans, making their guess 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

To find the average, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Then, we divide by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

If Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can think of it like this:

*  Let's say she has 'x' silver coins.
*  She'd have 'x + 30' gold coins.

Together, that's x + (x + 30) = 110 coins.

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us 2x = 80.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 40.  That means she has 40 silver coins.

Since she has 30 more gold coins, she has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

John made 13 sets * $15/set = $195 from his Legos. He spent $20/game * 8 games = $160 on video games, and had $5 leftover. That means he had $160 + $5 = $165 before buying games.

He sold enough Legos to make $165, so he sold $165 / $15/set = 11 Lego sets.

Since he started with 13 and sold 11, he has 13 - 11 = 2 Lego sets left.

John runs 3 hours the first day and half that, or 1.5 hours, on the other two days. That's a total of 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours of running per week.

Since he runs 60 miles in those 6 hours, he must be running at a speed of 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, and that's half her running speed. So, she runs at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

She walks four times slower than she runs, meaning she walks at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends one-third of her time, or 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours, running. That means she covers 6 * 2 = 12 miles running.

She spends two-thirds of her time, or 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours, walking.  In that time, she covers 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles walking.

Adding those distances together, Dana travels a total of 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). That'll cost him $20.00 (2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00).

If he sells all 20 candles at $2.00 each, he'll make $40.00 (20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00).

So, his profit is $20.00 ($40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00).

John bought 5 blue ties since he spent $200 and each blue tie costs $40. He bought twice as many red ties, meaning he got 10 red ties.

Red ties are 50% more expensive, so each one costs $60 ($40 + $20). That means he spent $600 on red ties (10 ties * $60/tie).

In total, he spent $800 on ties ($200 + $600).

Aleena pays $140 a month for the first six months, so that's $140 * 6 = $840.

For the next six months, she gets a 10% discount, which is $140 * 0.10 = $14 off her monthly bill.

That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the last six months, totaling $126 * 6 = $756.

Adding both halves together, her total cost for the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Judy teaches a lot of dance classes!  

* She teaches 5 classes each weekday, so that's 5 classes/day * 5 weekdays = 25 classes.
* Add in her 8 Saturday classes, and she teaches a total of 25 + 8 = 33 classes in a week.
* With 15 students in each class, she has 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.
*  If each student pays $15.00, she earns 495 students * $15.00/student = $7425.00 in a week.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Shiela's buying five phones at $150 each, so that's 5 * $150 = $750.  

Now, there's a 2% interest on each phone, meaning an extra $150 * 0.02 = $3 per phone.

Since she's buying five phones, the total interest is $3 * 5 = $15.

Adding the interest to the original price, she'll pay a total of $750 + $15 = $765.

Finally, spread over three months, her monthly payment will be $765 / 3 = $255.


Let me know if you have any other questions!

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Artie makes.

* He sells marigolds for $3 a pot (rounded to the nearest dollar), and he sells 12 of those. That's 12 * $3 = $36.
* Petunias are $2 a pot, and he sells 9. So that's 9 * $2 = $18.
* Begonias are also $2 a pot, and he sells 17. That's 17 * $2 = $34.

Adding it all up, Artie makes $36 + $18 + $34 = $88 today.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If the top level is 16 square feet and each level is half the size of the one below it, we can work our way down:

* Level 3: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
* Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
* Level 1: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, add up all the levels: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet

Finally, divide the total by the number of levels to find the average: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, the puppy needs 1 cup a day for 180 days, so that's 180 cups right there.

Then, for the rest of the year (365 days - 180 days = 185 days), the puppy eats 2 cups a day, meaning it'll need 370 cups (2 cups/day * 185 days).

In total, that's 550 cups of food for the whole year (180 cups + 370 cups).

Since each bag has 110 cups, Cecilia will need 5 bags (550 cups / 110 cups/bag).

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half that amount, he does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.

Now, Sarah does 4 times the amount of laundry as David, meaning David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.

The difference between Raymond and David's laundry is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, so they each got 4 liters (24 / 6 = 4). That's 8 liters total for both girls (4 x 2 = 8).

Then the boy got 6 liters.  

So, in total, they used 14 liters (8 + 6 = 14).

That means there were 10 liters left (24 - 14 = 10).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald, so Gerald originally took 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.

Gerald's diet improved his time by 10%, which is 40 seconds * 0.10 = 4 seconds.

That means Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If there are two cats for every dog and 60 dogs, that means there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats.

That's a lot of cats!  

So, there are 120 cats + 60 dogs = 180 dogs and cats in total.

The problem says there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Finally, to find the total number of pets, we add up all the animals: 168 rabbits + 180 dogs and cats = 348 pets.

If 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scouts, then 80 girls are scouts (2/3 * 120 = 80).

That means 40 girls aren't in the girl scouts (120 - 80 = 40).

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down.  Each box has walls that are 1 inch thick, so we need to figure out the space inside.  

* The inside length is 5 inches (outer) - 2 inches (walls) = 3 inches.
* The inside width is 6 inches (outer) - 2 inches (walls) = 4 inches.
* The inside height is 4 inches (outer) - 2 inches (walls) = 2 inches.

That means each box has an inner volume of 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume is 24 cubic inches/box * 3 boxes = 72 cubic inches.

If Henry has 110 cookies left after dropping 5, that means he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies before the mishap. Since he baked 15 extra, he originally planned to make 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.  Because he wanted to double the amount from last year, he baked twice the amount he made last year. That means he baked 100 / 2 = 50 cookies last year.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Sasha's profit.

First, let's look at the 2x4s. She bought 10 at $10 each, so that's $100. Since prices went up 50%, she can now sell them for $15 each, making $150.

For the 4x4s, she spent 5 * $16 = $80. With the price increase, she can sell them for $24 each, bringing in $120.

In total, she'll make $150 + $120 = $270.  

Since her total cost was $100 + $80 = $180, her profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

Think of it like this: the ratio 7:13 represents 20 total parts (7 + 13 = 20).  Each of those parts is worth 120 / 20 = 6.

Since the sugar part of the ratio is 7, Katy used 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Adrien's salary was 30% more than Lylah's, meaning if Lylah made 'x' dollars, Adrien made 1.3x. We know Adrien made $40,000 four years ago, so 1.3x = $40,000.  Solving for x, we find Lylah made about $30,769.23 four years ago.

Fast forward four years, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, bringing his total to $40,000 + (0.40 * $40,000) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased, so four years later she's making $30,769.23 + (0.30 * $30,769.23) = $40,000.

Dillon's buying 4 watermelons at $45 each, so that's 4 * $45 = $180.

He's also getting 20 peppers at $15 each, which is 20 * $15 = $300.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we need to find the total time the doctors spend seeing patients: 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.

Then, let's convert that to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

The doctors cost the hospital $150 per hour, so that's 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The hospital charges patients $200 per hour, bringing in 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

Finally, the profit is the revenue minus the cost: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens, we can think of it like this:

* **Queens:**  Let's say there are 'x' queen bees.
* **Babies:** There would be 2x baby bees.
* **Workers:** There would be 2 * (2x) = 4x worker bees.

All together, that's x + 2x + 4x = 7x bees. We know there are 700 bees total, so 7x = 700.

To find out how many worker bees there are, we need to solve for x:

* x = 700 / 7 
* x = 100

Since there are 4x worker bees, there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.

"Hey there! Let's figure out John's total cost. 

His food (milk and eggs) costs $2 + $3 = $5.

The non-food stuff (light bulbs, cups, and roach traps) adds up to $3 + $3 + $4 = $10.

There's a 10% tax on those non-food items, so that's $10 * 0.10 = $1 extra.

So, the non-food items cost $10 + $1 = $11 in total.

Finally, adding the food and non-food costs, John spent $5 + $11 = $16.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Kim's profit. 

He's got 8 clients total (3 + 5).  Each client needs $4 worth of bleach (2 bottles x $2) and $5 worth of cloths, for a total of $9 per client.

That means his total expenses are 8 clients * $9/client = $72.

Since his income is $92, his profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, and each hectare gives him 100 pineapples. That means he gets 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples per harvest.

Since he harvests every 3 months, he gets 12 months / 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests in a year.

So, in a year, he can harvest a total of 1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples.

* First, 30 bees flew out.
* Then, half that amount, 30 / 2 = 15 bees, flew back.
* Next, twice the original amount, 30 * 2 = 60 bees, flew out.
* That means a total of 30 + 60 = 90 bees flew out during the day.
* Since all the bees that left eventually came back, 90 bees returned in the last 6 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to know how long it takes each of them to get home. Steve has to go 3 miles, which is 15840 feet (3 * 5280).  He bikes at 440 feet per minute, so it takes him 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim goes 2 miles, or 10560 feet (2 * 5280). He skateboards at 264 feet per minute, so it takes him 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

That means Steve gets home 4 minutes before Tim.

She inflated 10 tires from bicycles (5 bikes * 2 tires each), 9 tires from tricycles (3 trikes * 3 tires each), and 1 tire from the unicycle. That's a total of 20 tires!

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, she made 20 * $0.25 = $5.00.

"
"Hey there! This sounds like a tricky situation for Dave. Let's break it down:

* The seagull ate half of Dave's 14 fries, so that's 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
* That means there were 14 + 7 = 21 fries left.
* The pigeons ate 3 fries each, for a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
* So, there were 21 - 9 = 12 fries left.
* The raccoon took two-thirds of those, which is (2/3) * 12 = 8 fries.
* That leaves 12 - 8 = 4 fries.
* Since only 5 fries were left at the end, the ants must have taken 1 fry.
* Working backwards, there were 4 + 1 = 5 fries before the ants got to them.
* Adding up all the fries eaten, we get 5 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 14 = 43 fries.

So, Dave started with a pack of 43 fries!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to find the total length of each type of baked good in inches.

* Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
* Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
* Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette * 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Now, let's add up the total length in inches: 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches.

Finally, we convert inches to feet: 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field, so he covers 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once for 100 yards, then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. That's 34 * 80 = 2720 yards.  Adding her first run, Kelly covers a total of 100 + 2720 = 2820 yards.

Kelly runs 2820 - 1500 = 1320 yards farther than Blake.

Locsin caught a few less starfish than Anakin (5 starfish), a few less seahorses (3 seahorses), and a couple more clownfish (5 clownfish). That makes 13 sea creatures for Locsin (5 + 3 + 5 = 13).

Together, they caught 32 sea creatures (19 + 13 = 32).

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

Let's say Brooke is 'b' years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth is '2b' years old.

In two years, Brooke will be 'b + 2' years old, and Seth will be '2b + 2' years old.  We know that in two years, their ages will add up to 28.

So, (b + 2) + (2b + 2) = 28

Combining like terms, we get 3b + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we have 3b = 24

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that b = 8.

Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Now, we add the extra amount to her total minimum payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500 per month.

Finally, to find her yearly payment, we multiply her monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18000.

Team 1 is super consistent, each runner doing the 400 meters in 55 seconds flat. That's a total of 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

Team 2 is a bit more interesting. Their first runner takes 60 seconds. The next runner is 3 seconds faster, so they take 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than that, at 54 seconds. And the final runner is another 3 seconds faster, finishing in 51 seconds.  Adding those up, Team 2's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Let's break this down.  There are three numbers on a standard die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6), so the chance of rolling one of those is 3 out of 6, or 50%.

To get two even numbers in a row, we need an even number on the first roll (3 out of 6 chance) AND another even number on the second roll (also a 3 out of 6 chance). Multiply those probabilities together: (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36, which simplifies to 1/4 or 25%.

The difference between these probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

He biked 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time for four weeks. That's 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers per week, and over four weeks, he biked 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Then he switched it up, biking 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time for three weeks. That's 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers per week, and over three weeks, he biked 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

In total, Micheal biked 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

A chocolate bar weighs 40g, and a candied apple weighs half that, so 20g.  There are 25 chocolate bars, which weigh a total of 25 * 40g = 1000g. The candied apples weigh 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Adding those together, the whole bag weighs 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Rose bought a bunch of cakes! On Monday, she got 4. Then on Tuesday, she bought three times that amount, so that's 4 * 3 = 12 cakes.  On Wednesday, she went even bigger and bought 5 times the amount from Tuesday, which is 12 * 5 = 60 cakes.

To find the total, we add up all the cakes: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Half a dozen plates cost $6000, so that's $3000 for a full dozen.  Since twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than that, they cost $1800.  

With 20 dozen cups, that's 240 cups total.  So each cup costs $1800 / 240 = $7.50.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Sara needs $30 for the jacket and $40 for the shoes, so that's $70 in total. She already has $30 from babysitting and savings. That means she needs to earn another $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, she needs to mow 10 times ($40 / $4 = 10).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Let's say Jerry has 'r' red chickens and 'w' white chickens. We know:

* White chickens lay 5 eggs a day, and red chickens lay 3.
* Jerry gets 42 eggs every day.
* He has 2 more white chickens than red chickens.

This means we can write these equations:

* w = r + 2 
* 3r + 5w = 42

Let's substitute the first equation into the second one:

* 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplifying that:

* 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
* 8r + 10 = 42
* 8r = 32
* r = 4


Jerry has **4** red chickens.

"Hey there! To figure out how long Gary walks, we need to find the distance around the park (the perimeter) and then divide that by his speed.

The park is a rectangle, so the perimeter is twice the length plus twice the width: 2 * (1.5 miles + 6 miles) = 15 miles.

Since he walks at 3 miles per hour, it takes him 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Sloane saw 100 customers on the first day and 50 more on the second, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers for the first two days.

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

Think about it this way: the big pool is losing water at the same rate as the small pool, but it started with more water.  Since the big pool now has four times the water as the small pool, and it was losing water at the same rate, the small pool must have lost a significant amount of water in those 4 minutes.

If we think about it, the small pool must have lost enough water for the big pool to catch up and have four times the amount.  

Let's say the small pool has 'x' gallons now. That means the big pool has 4x gallons. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the amount of the small pool, which means it had 2x gallons.

Since both pools lose 4 gallons per minute, the small pool lost 16 gallons (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes).

So, the small pool had x + 16 gallons four minutes ago.  

Since the big pool had twice that amount four minutes ago, it had 2(x + 16) gallons.

We know that 2(x + 16) is equal to 2x.

Let's solve for x:

2x + 32 = 2x

32 = 0 

This doesn't make sense! It seems like there's an error in the problem setup. It's impossible for the big pool to have four times the water as the small pool now if it only had twice the water four minutes ago, and both are losing water at the same rate.

Harriet is 21 now, and Adrian is three times her age, making him 21 * 3 = 63 years old. Zack is twice Harriet's age, so he's 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

In three years, Harriet will be 24, Adrian will be 66, and Zack will be 45.  

Adding those up, their total age will be 24 + 66 + 45 = 135.

In total, Sue ate 4000 + 5200 = 9200 calories, and her sister ate 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories.

She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 each, so that's 20 * $40 = $800.

She also got 80 packets of celery seeds at $30 each, which is 80 * $30 = $2400.

Adding those together, she spent a total of $800 + $2400 = $3200 on seeds.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Sean's song has 54 lines. His first scene has twice that many lines, which is 108 lines, but he only has to memorize a third of those, so that's 36 lines. His second scene has 6 more lines than his song, making it 60 lines long. He has to memorize four-fifths of those lines, which is 48 lines.

Adding up all his lines, Sean has to memorize 36 + 48 + 54 = 138 lines.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

First, Carly has 80 cards, and 2/5 of them have the letter A, so that's 32 cards (80 * (2/5) = 32).

That leaves 48 cards (80 - 32 = 48).  Half of those have the letter B, which is 24 cards (48 * (1/2) = 24).

Now we're down to 24 cards.  Five-eighths of those have the letter C, which is 15 cards (24 * (5/8) = 15).

Finally, that means 9 cards have the letter D (24 - 15 = 9).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Matthew needs 3 minutes per small hole and he's digging 30 of those, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 minutes. For the large holes, it's 10 minutes each and he's doing 15, meaning 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.  

In total, that's 90 + 150 = 240 minutes of digging.  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he'll be digging for 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

Let's say Sam's current age is ""s"". Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, Ruby's current age is 6s.

In 9 years, Sam will be s + 9 years old, and Ruby will be 6s + 9 years old.  We're told that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so:

6s + 9 = 3(s + 9)

Let's solve for ""s"":

6s + 9 = 3s + 27
3s = 18
s = 6

So Sam is currently 6 years old.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

A cobra has 70 spots, and that's twice the number a mamba has, so a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras with 70 spots each, so they have a total of 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

The 60 mambas have 35 spots each, for a total of 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

All together, that's 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Half of that is 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, Maddy needs to feed 12 team members, 3 coaches, and each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests. In total, there are 12 + 24 + 3 = 39 people.

Since each pizza feeds 3 people, Maddy needs 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

If each pizza costs $15, the total cost will be 13 * $15 = $195.

Each necklace has 8 topaz stones that are each 1 inch long, so that's 8 inches total for the topaz.  The whole necklace is 25 inches, so the silver beads take up 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each bead is 0.25 inches long, Katerina uses 17 / 0.25 = 68 silver beads per necklace.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40, and Margot wrote 60 in the first week. That's a total of 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories.

In the second week, they each doubled their stories. So Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories. That's another 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories.

Adding both weeks together, they wrote a total of 120 + 240 = 360 stories.

If there are 24 stars in the 8-star rows and 12 stars in the 6-star rows, that's a total of 36 stars. That leaves 40 stars for the 5-star rows (76 total stars - 36 stars = 40 stars).

Since each row has 5 stars, there must be 8 rows of 5 stars (40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows).

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

Each truck can carry 2000 pounds, and each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. That means one truck can carry 2000 / 75 = 26.67 flagstones. Since we can't have parts of a flagstone, each truck can carry 26 flagstones.

They need to deliver 80 flagstones, so they'll need 80 / 26 = 3.08 trucks.  Since you can't have part of a truck, they'll need 4 trucks to get all the flagstones there in one trip.

Let's break this down. The car in the fast lane is zooming along at 60 miles per hour, while the car in the slow lane is cruising at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.  Since they both travel the same distance (480 miles), we can figure out how long the slowpoke took by using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles per hour = 16 hours


The slow lane car took **16 hours**.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal and they eat twice a day, that's 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg of rice per person each day.

With 5 people, that's a total of 0.4 kg/person * 5 people = 2 kg of rice eaten every day.

A 42 kg bag will last 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days.

That's 21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks.

At $2 per mile, that's $30,000 just for mileage. Plus, he gives his driver a $1,800 bonus each year ($150/month * 12 months/year).

Finally, her earnings for the second year are 65 * $20 = $1300.

Theo's suits cost him 6 * $100 = $600. His suitcases cost 3 * $50 = $150. His flight ticket is a bit trickier: 5 times the cost of a suit is 5 * $100 = $500, and $700 more than that is $500 + $700 = $1200.

So far, he's spent $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.  

He started with $6000 and wants to save $2000, leaving him with $6000 - $2000 = $4050 for other expenses.

If we call the number of players on defense ""d"", we know the offense has twice that many, or 2*d* players. The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, which is *d*/2.

Since the total number of players is 105, we can set up an equation: 2*d* + *d* + *d*/2 = 105

Combining the 'd' terms, we get 3.5*d* = 105.

Dividing both sides by 3.5 gives us *d* = 30.


So there are **30** players on the defense.

But, 8 people got sick and couldn't make it, and another 8 / 4 = 2 people had other plans. So, in total, 8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't come.

Okay, I think I got it!  If we call the size of the bigger groups ""x"", the smallest group would be ""x - 10"".  

Since there are three groups total, we know: x + x + (x - 10) = 200

That simplifies to 3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides gives us 3x = 210

And finally, dividing by 3, we find x = 70.

So the smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

If Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can think of it like this:

*  Let's say he has 'x' cows.
* He'd have 2x chickens.

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 3x = 60.

Since he has twice as many chickens, he has 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, let's count the legs!

* Cows: 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs
* Chickens: 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs

Tyson runs 5000 meters a day, and his coach wants him to run 1/5 more, which is 1000 meters extra (5000 * (1/5) = 1000). So, he'll be running 6000 meters each day (5000 + 1000 = 6000).

In June, with 30 days, he'll cover a total of 180,000 meters (6000 * 30 = 180000).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

The tables with 4 legs have a total of 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs.

The tables with 3 legs have a total of 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs.

Adding those together, we get 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, meaning he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

Together, they eat 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, Jenny eats 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

So Davos got a 40% discount on each $30 shirt, which means he saved $30 * 0.40 = $12 on each one.  That makes each shirt cost $30 - $12 = $18.

Since he bought two shirts, he paid $18 * 2 = $36 in total.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

They used to make $1000 a day selling tractors (10 tractors * $100/tractor). Now they make $1100 a day selling silos (5 silos * $220/silo). That's $100 more each day.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the extra money ($100) by the original amount ($1000) and multiply by 100%.  That gives us 10%.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Madeline spends on her furry friend.

* Food for her dog costs $25 a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so that's $25 * 4 = $100 per month on food.
* Treats are $20 a month, and medicine is $100 a month.
*  Adding those up, Madeline spends $100 + $20 + $100 = $220 each month on her dog.
* Over a whole year, that's $220 * 12 = $2640.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Peyton's yoga class is an hour long. The cooking class is three times that, so it's 3 hours. The cheese tasting is a quick 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The museum tour is half the length of the cooking class, making it 1.5 hours. And finally, the errands take 2 hours.

Adding all that up: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Andrea started with $36, spent $11 on a sweater, and gave her brother $4.  To find out how much she saved, we need to subtract those expenses from her starting amount: $36 - $11 - $4 = $21.

So Andrea saved $21. 



"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. He also watched 3 shows at 2 hours each, totaling 3 * 2 = 6 hours of shows.

That's 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours already. We know this is 30% of his total vacation time.  To find the total time, we can divide: 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours.

Finally, he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so that's 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Billy spent half his change on gumballs, that means he had $4.00 left after buying candy (since 40 gumballs cost $2.00). This means he spent $4.00 on candy.

Since candy costs $1.50 per pound, he bought 2.67 pounds of candy.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

The train travels 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles between the first and third city. Then it goes back 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

So, a full round trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since it does this three times a day, that's 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles per day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so it can go 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days before needing service.

So, 3 people got kicked out for not wearing masks. Then, four times that many, minus 5, were kicked out for shoplifting. That's 3 * 4 - 5 = 7 shoplifters.

Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for fighting over deals, so that's 7 * 3 = 21 people.

In total, that's 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people kicked out for those reasons.

"Hey there! Let's figure out the cost of these senior gifts.

First, the picture frames will cost 44 seniors * $20/frame = $880.

Etching adds 20% to each frame, so that's $20 * 0.20 = $4 extra per frame.  That means etching will cost 44 seniors * $4/frame = $176.

Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so those are 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10.

Since 1/4 of the seniors are officers, there are 44 seniors / 4 = 11 officers.  Cords for them will cost 11 officers * $12/cord = $132.

Adding it all up: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

If Karan borrowed $3650 for five months at 10% interest, and she pays the same amount each month, here's how to find out her monthly payment:

First, we need to calculate the total interest. That's (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100. So, it's ($3650 * 10 * 5) / 100 = $1825.

Next, we add the interest to the original amount to find the total she needs to repay: $3650 + $1825 = $5475.

Finally, divide the total amount by the number of months to get the monthly payment: $5475 / 5 = $1095.


Karan has to pay $1095 each month.

"Hey there!  

If Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, that means the 12.8 hectares represent 2/5 of his original land. To find out how much land he started with, we can set up a proportion:

(2/5) * Original Land = 12.8 hectares

To solve for the Original Land, we can divide both sides by (2/5):

Original Land = 12.8 hectares / (2/5) = 32 hectares

Meat costs $7 per pound, so that's $35 total (5 * $7 = $35).

Cheese is $3 per pound, making the cheese cost $15 (5 * $3 = $15).

Joanne gets 30 apples from the tall trees and half that from the short ones, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister grabs twice the amount from the tall trees (30 * 2 = 60 apples) and three times the amount from the short trees (15 * 3 = 45 apples).  

They got a total of 500 apples together, and we know they got 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tall and short trees combined. That means Joanne got 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

If we think about it, each camel has two humps, and each dromedary has one.  We know the total number of heads and humps, so we can use that to find the number of dromedaries.

Let me do some calculations...

There are **56** dromedaries.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how far Tom traveled.

In the first four days, he covered 200 kilometers each day, so that's 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

The next two days, he traveled 30% of the first four days' distance, which is 800 * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.

He took a break on the seventh day, so no kilometers there.

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for seven days, totaling 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Adding it all up: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, and that's 1/4 the size of Zack's. So Zack's locker is 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.

Now, Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's, meaning Timothy's locker is twice as big. That makes Timothy's locker 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

The second bank loaned Mr. Josue twice the amount of the first bank, which is $4000 * 2 = $8000.

In total, he got $4000 + $8000 = $12000 from the banks.

Adding that to his initial $5000, he now has a total of $5000 + $12000 = $17000.


$17000

"Hey there! Let me see... 

So, 4 boats took away 20 cats (4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats). That leaves 30 cats on the rock (50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats). Then, 18 of those cats ran off (30 cats * (3/5) = 18 cats).  

That means there are 12 cats left on the rock (30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats).

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Bill paid for his streaming service.

* The first 6 months cost him 6 * $8 = $48.
* The next 8 months cost him 8 * $12 = $96.

Adding those up, the total cost for 2 years is $48 + $96 + $112 = $256. 



"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Cole got a deal on both types of jeans.  Since the jogger jeans were $6 less than the tattered jeans, and the tattered jeans were $28, the jogger jeans were $22.  

But wait, there's more! He saved a total of $6, which means the jogger jeans were originally $28 as well.

So, the jogger jeans originally cost the same as the tattered jeans.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

They have 4 big buses that each hold 60 people, so that's 4 * 60 = 240 employees. Then there are 6 minibuses holding 30 each, so that's 6 * 30 = 180 more. And finally, 10 minivans with 15 people each, which is 10 * 15 = 150 employees.

Adding it all up: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees can go on the trip!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Lillian's homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

That's 3 homemade feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Aleksandra's dinner bill.

The soup cost 25% more than the $4 bagel, meaning it was $4 + ($4 * 0.25) = $5. The cake was half the price of the bagel, so it cost $4 / 2 = $2.

Adding it all up, her dinner cost $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down. Kenny wants to buy a $100 ticket and has $50 left over after buying it, meaning he made $50 from selling his cards.  Since he sells each card for $1.50, he sold $50 / $1.50 = 33.33 cards. Since he can't sell parts of cards, he sold 33 cards.

He kept 1/3 of his cards and sold 2/3, so those 33 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection. To find the total, we divide the number of cards sold by 2/3: 33 cards / (2/3) = 49.5 cards.  He can't have half a card, so he must have started with 50 cards.

"
"Hey there! Let me see... the caterer had enough for 18 people to have two hot dogs, which is 36 hot dogs total.  Since he made 18 more, that's 54 hot dogs in all.  With 40 guests wanting seconds, only 27 could actually get them. That means 13 guests missed out.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Indras has 6 letters in her name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, which is 6 / 2 = 3 letters. So her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.  

Together, their names have 6 + 7 = 13 letters.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Charlotte's total. 

First, the utensils cost 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

That means her total before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

A 20% discount on that is $165.00 * 0.20 = $33.00 off.

So, her final cost is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.


$132.00

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Prince Arthur took down three-quarters the number of dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slayed 100. That's 100 * (3/4) = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter, with his rusty axe, doubled Prince Arthur's count, so he slayed 75 * 2 = 150 dragons.

Finally, Prince Bruce, using just a nail file, got one-fifth of Prince Walter's total, meaning he slayed 150 * (1/5) = 30 dragons. 

So the answer is 30. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If 15 gallons of gas are split evenly into 5 containers, each container gets 3 gallons (15 / 5 = 3). Josey needs a quarter of a container, which is 0.75 gallons (3 x 0.25 = 0.75).  Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, Josey needs 6 pints of gas (0.75 x 8 = 6).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

George had $5 and 1% left over, which is $0.05. That means he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

He spent $1.20 on chips (3 bags * $0.40 per bag).  That leaves $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 for candy bars.

Since each candy bar costs $0.75, he bought $3.75 / $0.75 = 5 candy bars.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out the cost per serving of Antoine's soup.

First, he doubles the onions, so that's 2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

Those onions will cost him 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00.

The beef stock costs 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00.

In total, his ingredients cost $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, each serving costs $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00.

"
"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. We know the area of Billie's room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, which is 9 feet. To find the perimeter, we need the width.  

Since area is length times width, we can find the width by dividing the area by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now, the perimeter is twice the length plus twice the width: 2 * 9 feet + 2 * 40 feet = 18 feet + 80 feet = 98 feet.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, we need to figure out how long James took for the whole triathlon. Jon finished in 170 minutes, and he beat James by 10 minutes, so James took 180 minutes.

We know James swam in 36 minutes (10% faster than Jon's 40 minutes) and biked in 85 minutes (5 minutes slower than Jon's 80 minutes).

That means his run time was 180 minutes (total time) - 36 minutes (swim) - 85 minutes (bike) = 59 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Movie C is 1.25 hours long, which is the same as 75 minutes. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than that, so it's 80 minutes long. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, meaning it's 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes long.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, we need to figure out how far the horse runs. It goes 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, the horse runs 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats half a bale of hay per mile, it'll eat 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is 8 bales * $3/bale = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, meaning he has 6 bills * $5/bill = $30.

Finally, his change is $30 - $24 = $6. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs, which is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Plus the 2 extra eggs, she has a total of 50 eggs. Since each glass needs 5 eggs, she can make 50 / 5 = 10 glasses of eggnog.  With each tray holding 5 glasses, she can put out 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to find out how much each balloon cost originally. Since 20 balloons cost $900, each balloon cost $900 / 20 = $45.

Then, the price went up by $20, so each balloon now costs $45 + $20 = $65.

Finally, to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons, we multiply the new price by 170: $65 * 170 = $11050.


So the answer is $11050. 

"
"Hey there! To find the average speed, we need to think about the total distance traveled and the total time it took.  

The car went 60 mph for 2 hours, so that's 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then it went 30 mph for 1 hour, adding another 30 miles. That's a total of 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The whole trip took 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

So, the average speed is 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

Since he has 10 beds, the total volume needed is 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag holds 2 cubic feet, so he'll need 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Finally, at $12 per bag, the total cost will be 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, there are 15 red cards, and there are 60% more green cards than that. That means there are 15 * 0.60 = 9 more green cards.

That gives us a total of 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Now, the yellow cards are the same amount as the red and green cards combined, so there are 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add up all the colors: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.

That means she has 150 + 200 = 350 cards altogether.

She keeps 50 for herself, leaving 350 - 50 = 300 cards for her students.

If each student gets 10 cards, she has 300 / 10 = 30 students.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out the cost of Tom's anniversary trip.

First, the hotel is 20% more expensive than its usual $1500 per day because it's a busy weekend. That means the markup is $1500 * 0.20 = $300 per day.

So, the hotel costs $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

For a 3-day stay, the total hotel cost is $1800 * 3 = $5400.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and since there are two of them, that's $5000 * 2 = $10000.

Adding the hotel and plane ticket costs, the total trip cost is $5400 + $10000 = $15400.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Jillian's shoes cost $80, and her bag cost $20 less than three times that amount, here's how to find the price:

* Three times the shoe price is 3 * $80 = $240
*  Subtract $20: $240 - $20 = $220

So, Jillian's bag cost $220. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days, so that's 12 * 5 = 60 miles a week. Since he runs at 10 miles per hour, he runs for 60 / 10 = 6 hours a week.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal, and Uncle Ben feeds them twice a day, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 pounds per horse each day.

With four horses, that's a total of 10 * 4 = 40 pounds of oats needed every day.

Over five days, he'll need 40 * 5 = 200 pounds of oats.

Since each bag has 50 pounds, he'll need 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Jana has 27 puppies and two-thirds are Pomeranians, that means she has 18 Pomeranians (27 / 3 * 2 = 18).  Since one-third of those Pomeranians are girls, she has 6 girl Pomeranians (18 / 3 = 6).

"
"Hey there! To find the average, we add up the highest temperatures and then divide by the number of countries.  

(-48) + 21 + (-3) = -30

-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature is -10 degrees Fahrenheit. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. The toy car costs $12, and he already has $4. That means he needs $8 more. If he saves $2 each day, it will take him 4 days to save enough.

"
"Hey there! Let's see... Jaime can fit 24 eggs per tray and has 2 trays, so that's 24 * 2 = 48 eggs.  Since he has 64 eggs, he won't be able to fit 64 - 48 = 16 eggs on the trays.


16 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. The family-size pizza costs three times the small pizza, so it's $8 * 3 = $24.  In total, Sally spends $8 + $24 = $32.


$32 

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Heather's getting a great deal! Since the razors are buy one get one free, two packs will only cost her $4.00. After using her $2.00 coupon, she'll only pay $2.00 for 8 razors. That means each razor costs $0.25, or 25 cents. 


25 

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

So, 9 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and one is 60 inches. That means the base of the pyramid is made up of the taller cheerleaders.  

Let's see... 9 cheerleaders * 64 inches/cheerleader = 576 inches. Add the shortest cheerleader's height, and we get 576 inches + 60 inches = 636 inches total for the base.

Now, we need to convert that to feet: 636 inches / 12 inches/foot = 53 feet.

So the pyramid is 53 feet tall! 


53 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works 8 hours a day. That means she walks 5 minutes/hour * 8 hours/day = 40 minutes each day. Over 5 days, she'd walk a total of 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes. 


200 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Angela will be three times Brett's age in four years, that means she'll be 14 * 3 = 42 years old then. Since that's in four years, she's currently 42 - 4 = 38 years old. 

38 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, so that's 14 days * 2 trips/day = 28 trips total.

Each trip costs him $6 + $2 = $8.

So, he spends 28 trips * $8/trip = $224 on driving.


224 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Ashley brought 5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges. Brianne brought 50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges. Together they have 50 oranges + 70 oranges = 120 oranges. Since each pie needs 3 oranges, they can make 120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie = 40 pies. 


40 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Let's say 'x' is the number of guests.

Venue 1 costs $200 plus $5 per guest for food, so the total cost is $200 + $5x.

Venue 2 costs $25 per guest, so the total cost is $25x.

To find out when the costs are the same, we set the two costs equal to each other: $200 + $5x = $25x

Subtracting $5x from both sides gives us $200 = $20x

Dividing both sides by $20, we find that x = 10.


10 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Let's say Bodhi found 'B' insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found B/2 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, meaning she found (B/2) + 7 insects.

Together they found 43 insects, so:

B + (B/2) + (B/2) + 7 = 43

Combining like terms:

B + B + 7 = 43

2B + 7 = 43

2B = 36

B = 18

So Bodhi found 18 insects.

David found half of that, so he found 18 / 2 = 9 insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so she found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Mariah used a quarter of the skein, which is 364 yards / 4 = 91 yards. Grandma used half, so that's 364 yards / 2 = 182 yards.  Together they used 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

So, two of Cherrie's friends want 5 gifts each, which is 2 * 5 = 10 gifts.

The other three friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 gifts.

In total, that's 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

But wait, she buys 10 more surprise gifts!

That brings the grand total to 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

The rug is 5 feet wider than the 3-foot chair, so it's 8 feet wide. Twice the width of the rug is 16 feet. The couch is 2 feet longer than that, making it 18 feet long.


18 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, and the rest of her gum cost $3 total. That means the strawberry gum cost $7 - $3 = $4.  Since she got two packs, each pack cost $4 / 2 = $2. 


$2 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

It's cheaper to get sticks from the 2x8 wood because you get more sticks per dollar. He can buy 4 of those with his $24. Since each 2x8 gives him 400 sticks, he can make a total of 1600 popsicle sticks. 


1600 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Each of Mario's dogs needs 4 snowshoes, and he has 6 dogs. That means he needs a total of 6 * 4 = 24 snowshoes.

Since each pair costs $12.00, the total cost will be 24 * $12.00 = $288.00.


$288.00 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Janet spends $4.40 each day on bus fare (2 trips * $2.20/trip). Over a week, that's $22.00 ( $4.40/day * 5 days).  Since the weekly pass is $20.00, she'd save $2.00.


$2.00 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, which means the zoo has 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.

That means the farm has a total of 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.

The zoo has a total of 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Adding those together, the farm and zoo have 40 animals + 80 animals = 120 animals.


120 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Rose bought 12 onions and that's 4 times what Sophia bought, so Sophia bought 12 / 4 = 3 onions.  Rose also bought 4 potatoes, which is 4 times what Sophia bought, meaning Sophia bought 4 / 4 = 1 potato. In total, Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items.

"
"Hey there! To figure this out, we need to know how many days are between December 31st and July 19th.  That's about 200 days.

To lose a pound, Andy needs to burn 3500 calories. Since he wants to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find out how many calories he needs to cut each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories per day.


525 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Gerald makes $30 a day and worked for 7 days, so he earned $30 * 7 = $210. After spending $100, he has $210 - $100 = $110 left. 


$110
"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Hannah runs 8 laps at 0.25 km each, so that's a total of 8 * 0.25 = 2 kilometers.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes, which is $100. That leaves her with $400. Then she spends 25% of that $400 on CDs, which is another $100.  So, Julie has $300 left.


$300 

"
"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. If the house cost three times the lot, think of it like this: the lot is one part, and the house is three parts. That makes a total of four parts.

Since the whole thing costs $120,000, one part (the lot) is worth $120,000 / 4 = $30,000.

The house, being three parts, costs 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.


$90,000 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Tara bought 8 packs of bags, and each pack had 5 bags, so that's 8 * 5 = 40 bags in total. She spent $4 on each pack, meaning she spent 8 * $4 = $32 on all the bags.

She sold each bag for $8, so she made 40 * $8 = $320.  

To find her profit, we subtract her costs from her earnings: $320 - $32 = $288.


$288 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Joe throws 25 punches every minute, and each round is 3 minutes long. So in one round, he throws 25 * 3 = 75 punches.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Jackson has enough red tulips for 6 rows (36 tulips / 6 tulips per row = 6 rows) and enough blue tulips for 3 rows (24 tulips / 8 tulips per row = 3 rows).  That means he'll have a total of 9 rows of flowers (6 rows + 3 rows = 9 rows).


9 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Heather splits the raisins evenly, she'll have 27 cups / 3 = 9 cups for the cookies. Since each batch needs 3/4 cup, she can make 9 cups / (3/4 cup/batch) = 12 batches.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means they paint 1/10 of the house each day.  With five people, they'd paint 5 times faster, so they'd paint 1/2 the house each day.  That means it would take them 2 days to paint the whole house, which is 48 hours. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she must have 22 chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 66 chairs.  Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 64 sofas.

In total, they have 84 sofas (20 + 64) and 88 chairs (22 + 66), making a grand total of 172 sofas and chairs.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

So, we start with 48 people on the bus. At the first stop, 8 get off, and 40 get on (since 5 times 8 is 40). That means there are 80 people on the bus now.

Then, at the second stop, 21 people get off, and only 2 get on (because 8 divided by 3 is about 2.67, so we round down).  That leaves us with 61 people on the bus.



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Jame is turning 27 in 5 years, so he's currently 22.  In 8 years, he'll be 30. His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age then, meaning the cousin will be 55.  That means the cousin is currently 47.  The difference in their ages is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

The computer cost $1100, and the printer cost $400 less, so the printer cost $700. Together, the computer and printer cost $1800.  That means the two monitors cost $600 ($2400 - $1800 = $600).

Since there are two monitors, one monitor costs $300 ($600 / 2 = $300).


$300 

"
"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. Since there are two equal groups of boys and girls, there are 20 kids / 2 = 10 girls. The boys found 60 shells each, so they brought back a total of 10 boys * 60 shells/boy = 600 shells.

The girls found 600 shells + (4 * 600 shells) = 600 + 2400 = 3000 shells.

That means each girl found 3000 shells / 10 girls = 300 shells.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

When the water is warm, Ray takes twice the cold water time plus 2 minutes, so that's 16 minutes * 2 + 2 minutes = 34 minutes per mile.

For 3 miles in cold water, it takes him 16 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes him 34 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 102 minutes.

Judy read for 15 minutes a night for 7 nights, so that's 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since she reads 2 pages every 1.5 minutes, she read 105 / 1.5 = 70 pages in the first week.

In total, she read 70 + 100 = 170 pages in two weeks.

"Hey there! Let's break down this grilled cheese business. 

They spend $3.00 on bread for 10 sandwiches, which is $0.30 per sandwich.  Adding the $3.00 for cheese and stuff per 10 sandwiches (or $0.30 per sandwich), each sandwich costs them $0.60 to make.

They sell each sandwich for $7.00, so their profit per sandwich is $6.40.

Selling 10 sandwiches means a total profit of $64.00.

* **Padding:** 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432
* **Removal:** 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864

If the oven is 18 degrees hotter than it should be at 450, that means it's consistently 4% too high.  To get the right temperature for a recipe needing 520 degrees, we need to figure out what number is 4% less than 520.

4% of 520 is 20.8.  So, Maggie should set her oven to 499.2 degrees.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, Pete gets 90 contacts per box, and that lasts him 45 days. That means each pair of contacts lasts him 45 days / 45 pairs = 1 day.

Each box costs $100, but it's 10% off, so that's $100 * 0.10 = $10 off.  

That makes each box $100 - $10 = $90.

He's buying two boxes, so that's $90 * 2 = $180 total.

With 90 contacts per box and two boxes, he has 90 * 2 = 180 pairs of contacts.

Finally, each pair costs $180 / 180 pairs = $1.00.

In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 1600 / 200 = 800 ml of water.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Think of it like this:

*  If the blue jelly beans are 100%, the red ones are 99% of that, and the green ones are 101%.

* That means the total percentage of all the jelly beans is 100% + 99% + 101% = 300%

*  Since 300% represents 4500 jelly beans, 1% is equal to 4500 / 300 = 15 jelly beans.

*  So, there are 99% * 15 = 1485 red jelly beans and 101% * 15 = 1515 green jelly beans.

* That's a difference of 1515 - 1485 = 30 jelly beans!



There are **30** more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Hey there!  

Let's break this triangle problem down.  We know all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  If we call the smallest angle ""x"", the other angles are 2x and 3x.  

So, x + 2x + 3x = 180. That means 6x = 180.  

Dividing both sides by 6, we find x = 30.

The largest angle is 3x, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

* He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * $0.05 = $0.70
* He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add it all up: $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs $0.05, Colby can buy $3.45 / $0.05 = 69 gumballs.

If the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that means his tires rotate 145,000 times each month (400 miles * 725 rotations/2 miles).

Each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement. So, the tires will last for 72 months (10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month).

Now, let's find the sale prices. The shirt costs $25 - $7.50 = $17.50. The shorts cost $35 - $10.50 = $24.50.

Adding those together, the total cost is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much John's research cost.

His initial funding was enough for 5 months, so that's 5 months * $100,000/month = $500,000.

The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, meaning it lasted for 5 months * 10 = 50 months total.

That means the increased funding period was 50 months - 5 months = 45 months.

Each of those months cost 50% more than the initial $100,000, so that's $100,000 * 0.50 = $50,000 extra per month.

So, the increased funding per month was $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000.

The total cost of the increased funding period was 45 months * $150,000/month = $6,750,000.

Finally, to get the total research cost, we add the initial funding and the increased funding: $500,000 + $6,750,000 = $7,250,000.

Next, we need to convert Mb/s to Mb/hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

Next, calculate the total money made from selling all the cars: 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000. Subtract the cost of buying the cars to find the profit: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, calculate James' commission: $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500.

If 25% of the 100 surfers can handle the big wave, that's 100 * 0.25 = 25 surfers.

If 60% of those 25 are women, then there are 25 * 0.60 = 15 women who stay up.

That means 25 - 15 = 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

The gold jewel costs 4/5 times the price of the diamond, which is (4/5) * $2000 = $1600.

The silver jewel is $400 cheaper than the gold jewel, so it costs $1600 - $400 = $1200.

To find the total price, we add up the cost of all three: $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Max got 16 snowflake stamps. He got 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so that's 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. He got 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, meaning he got 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.  

In total, Max bought 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps.

To figure this out, we need to think about how fast Tom is gaining on Bob. Tom is driving 15 miles per hour faster than Bob (70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph).

Since Tom needs to close a 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by Tom's speed advantage: 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours.

If four apples cost $5.20, then one apple costs $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

Three oranges cost $3.30, so one orange costs $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Five apples would cost $1.30 x 5 = $6.50, and five oranges would cost $1.10 x 5 = $5.50.

In total, Clyde would pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure out the cost of Bill's truck. 

The base price is $30,000.

* Leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
* Running boards are $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
* The light package is $1,500.

Adding all the extras: $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, Tim's raise is $20000 * 0.05 = $1000.

That means his new monthly salary is $20000 + $1000 = $21000.

His bonus is half his old salary, which is $20000 / 2 = $10000.

So, his total monthly earnings are $21000 + $10000 = $31000.

Finally, his yearly earnings are $31000 * 12 = $372000.

The plane itself costs $150,000.  He spends $5000 a month on the hanger and double that, or $10,000, on fuel. That's a total of $15,000 per month to keep the plane going.

Over a year, that's $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

If the rice took 30 minutes, and the pork took 20 minutes longer, that means the pork took 50 minutes (30 + 20 = 50).

The beans took half the time it took to cook the rice and pork combined, so that's 80 minutes total (30 + 50 = 80) and then half of that is 40 minutes for the beans (80 / 2 = 40).

Finally, to find the total cooking time, we add up the time for each food: 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

If the dress is 140cm long after adding 20cm of lace and extending the original length by 50%, we need to work backwards.

Think of it like this:

* The 140cm length includes the 20cm lace, so the dress itself is 140cm - 20cm = 120cm long after the extension.
* Since the extension was 50%, the original length is 2/3 of the length after the extension.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

We know one twin is older than a triplet by 7 years.  If all their ages add up to 44, we can figure out the twin's age.

Let's think of it like this:

*  The triplets are all the same age, let's call that age ""r"".
* One twin is ""r + 7"" years old.
* The other twin is also ""r + 7"" years old.

So, the total age is: r + r + r + (r + 7) + (r + 7) = 44

That simplifies to 5r + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides: 5r = 30

Divide both sides by 5: r = 6

So, one triplet is 6 years old.

Since one twin is 7 years older than a triplet, that twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

Each candy costs $0.30 ($1.20 / 4 = $0.30).

So, 10 lollipops would cost $4.00 (10 x $0.40 = $4.00) and 10 candies would cost $3.00 (10 x $0.30 = $3.00).

In total, 10 lollipops and 10 candies would cost $7.00 ($4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00).

The vaccines cost $20 each, so that's 2 * $20 = $40. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total yet.  Let's call the total cost ""x"". We know 0.60x = the cost of the heartworm check.

Since the total bill is the cost of the vaccines plus the heartworm check, we have the equation: x = $40 + 0.60x

Solving for x, we get: 0.40x = $40, so x = $100.

John's total bill is $100, and he brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

Now, let's calculate the totals:

* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

The city will set off 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks.

Hannah sees 40% of those, so that's 300 fireworks * 0.40 = 120 fireworks.

She'll also see her own 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks.

In total, Hannah will see 120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, there are 20 people in total going to the movies. Each person gets 2 drinks and 3 snacks, meaning they need 40 drinks and 60 snacks altogether. That's a total of 100 drinks and snacks. Since each one costs $2, the group spent $200 on snacks and drinks.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's 4000-pound truck, so Gordy can haul 4800 pounds. Together, Gissela and Gordy can haul 8800 pounds.  That means Gary's truck must be able to haul 11600 - 8800 = 2800 pounds.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If each of the 6 females ate 3 dumplings, they ate a total of 18 dumplings (6 * 3 = 18).

The 8 guys each ate 1 more dumpling than the girls, so they each ate 4 dumplings (3 + 1 = 4).  That means they ate a total of 32 dumplings (8 * 4 = 32).

Adding those together, Larry cooked 50 dumplings in total (18 + 32 = 50).

"Hey there! Let's break this down. If Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water and 80% of *that* water goes to industry, then the remaining 20% must be for non-industrial use.  Since they're using 40% of the total river water, that means 20% of 40% is used for non-industrial stuff.  

That works out to 8%!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to see how much ice cream they make per hour for each flavor.  Chocolate is 100 quarts every 2 hours, so that's 50 quarts per hour. Vanilla is 50 quarts every 4 hours, which is 12.5 quarts per hour.

Together, they make 50 + 12.5 = 62.5 quarts per hour.

Over 48 hours, they'd make 62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts!

"Hey there! Let's figure out Marcus' bill. 

First, we need to find the cost of each type of pastry:

* Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00/croissant = $15.00
* Cinnamon Rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50/roll = $10.00
* Mini Quiches: 3 quiches * $4.00/quiche = $12.00
* Blueberry Muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00/muffin = $13.00

Now, let's add those up to find the subtotal: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Don't forget his loyalty card discount! 10% of $50.00 is $5.00.

Finally, subtract the discount from the subtotal: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Marcus' total bill is $45.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day for 14 days, so she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day for 14 days, so she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

That means Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

Amy has 58 - 44 = 14 more pieces than Ginger.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, James spent $20 to get in and then $1.50 for each of the 30 pounds of blueberries he picked. That means the blueberries alone cost him $1.50 * 30 = $45.  

Adding the entry fee, his total cost was $45 + $20 = $65.

If he bought the same amount of blueberries at the store for $2.50 a pound, it would have cost him $2.50 * 30 = $75.

He saved $75 - $65 = $10 by picking his own blueberries.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

So, the company thought each computer would cost $700, but the price went up by 10%. That means each computer actually cost $700 + ($700 * 0.10) = $770.

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

First, we need to figure out how long Topher's shoe is in inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, his shoe is 8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 100 inches long.

The problem tells us Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  So, if we let 'x' be the length of Bobby's shoe, we can set up an equation: 100 = 9x + 10.

Solving for x, we get:

90 = 9x
x = 10

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Hannah smashes windows on a quarter of the students' cars, so that's 1/4 * 64 cars = 16 cars. Since each student car has 4 windows, she breaks 16 cars * 4 windows/car = 64 windows on students' cars.

She also smashes windows on 3/4 of the teachers' cars, which is 3/4 * 32 cars = 24 cars. With 2 windows per teacher car, she breaks 24 cars * 2 windows/car = 48 windows on teachers' cars.

In total, Hannah smashes 64 windows + 48 windows = 112 windows.

On weekends, she rents out 100 chairs per day for 2 days, totaling 100 * 2 = 200 chairs.

So, each week she rents out 300 + 200 = 500 chairs.

Lorraine starts with a lot of stickers!  She's got 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.  

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers, which is 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers. Since each small sticker gets her one small button, she gets 27 small buttons. She can then trade those 27 small buttons for 9 large buttons (27 / 3 = 9).

Next, she trades half of her large stickers, which is 0.50 * 40 = 20 large stickers. Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.

She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. She trades these for small buttons, getting 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Adding up all her buttons, she has 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If the third house needs double the first, and all three houses need 250 cases total, we can break it down:

* Let's say the first house needs 'y' cases.
* The second house needs twice the first, so it needs 2y cases.
* The third house needs double the first, so it also needs 2y cases.

That means the total is y + 2y + 2y = 250 cases.

Combining like terms, we get 5y = 250.

Dividing both sides by 5, we find that y = 50.

Since the third house needs 2y cases, it needs 2 * 50 = 100 cases.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Bennet makes $60 from his eggplants (20 eggplants * $3/eggplant).  That means he needs to make $75 from his corn ($135 - $60 = $75). To make $75 from 25 ears of corn, he should sell each ear for $3 ($75 / 25 ears = $3/ear).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 on Sunday, giving her a total of 12 hours. After reading for 3 hours, she has 9 hours left. She spends a third of that time, or 3 hours, on video games. That leaves 6 hours for soccer.  

Since she has 12 hours total and spends 6 on soccer, she spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Anthony starts with 50 pencils. He gives half, which is 25 pencils, to Brandon. That leaves him with 25 pencils. Then he gives Charlie 3/5 of those, which is 15 pencils.  So Anthony keeps 25 - 15 = 10 pencils.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Jack drives 150 miles each way, so that's 300 miles total. At 75 mph, that takes 4 hours (300 miles / 75 mph = 4 hours).  

Add in the 6 hours at the museum, and he's gone for a total of 10 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Henry needs 4 wheels for each of his 57 cars, so that's 57 * 4 = 228 wheels.

For his 73 motorcycles, he'll need 73 * 2 = 146 wheels.

In total, he needs 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

If he starts with 650 wheels, he'll have 650 - 374 = 276 wheels left over.

"Hey there!  A 20% discount on a $1000 laptop means you save $200 (20/100 * $1000 = $200). So, you'd pay $800. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, Mike has 600 movies, and a third of them are in series, so that's 600 / 3 = 200 series movies. Since he gets a deal on those, they'll cost him 200 * ($10 * (1/3)) = $666.67.

That leaves 600 - 200 = 400 movies that aren't in a series.  Of those, 40% are older movies, which is 400 * 0.40 = 160 movies. Those will cost him 160 * $5 = $800.

The rest of the movies, 400 - 160 = 240, are newer and cost the full $10 each, so that's 240 * $10 = $2400.

Adding it all up, Mike will spend $666.67 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67 to replace his movie collection. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Winston spent.

Peaches cost $2.00 a pound and he got 6 pounds, so that's $2.00 * 6 = $12.00.

Plums are $1.00 a pound, and he picked 8 pounds, making it $1.00 * 8 = $8.00.

Apricots are $3.00 a pound, and he got 6 pounds, so that's $3.00 * 6 = $18.00.

Adding it all up: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00


Winston spent $38.00 on fruit.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

They drove for 4.5 hours (6 hours total - 1.5 hours hiking) at 50 miles per hour, so they covered 225 miles (4.5 hours * 50 miles/hour).

While hiking, they went 20 miles per hour (half their driving speed minus 5 miles per hour) for 1.5 hours, covering 30 miles (20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours).

Adding those distances together, their vacation spot is 255 miles away (225 miles + 30 miles).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Chase and Rider ride 3 times a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 rides.

On the other two days, they ride twice as much, meaning 3 * 2 = 6 rides each day.

Over those two days, they ride a total of 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Adding it all up, they ride 15 + 12 = 27 times in a week.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.  He bought some more, and now he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  

Let's say he bought 'w' white fish. That means he has 4 + w white fish total.

The orange fish he has now would be 3 plus however many weren't white (17 - w).

We know the orange fish number is double the white fish number, so:

3 + (17 - w) = 2(4 + w)

Let's solve for 'w':

3 + 17 - w = 8 + 2w
20 - w = 8 + 2w
12 = 3w
w = 4

So Bob bought 4 white fish. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Andy drives 10 miles a day to work and back (5 miles each way). That's 50 miles a week (10 miles/day * 5 days).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Jamie makes $20 an hour for her first 8 hours. That's $20 * 8 = $160.

Since she worked 11 hours, she has 3 hours of overtime. Her overtime rate is 150% of her regular pay, so she makes $20 * 1.50 = $30 per overtime hour.

For her overtime, she earned $30 * 3 = $90.

Adding her regular pay and overtime pay, Jamie made $160 + $90 = $250 for the day.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

The company starts with 200 employees and adds 20 more each month for three months, so that's 20 * 3 = 60 new employees.

In total, they'll have 200 + 60 = 260 employees.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we need to find out how many fifth graders passed. Since their pass rate was double the fourth grade's, that means 40/100 * 2 = 80/100 or 80% of fifth graders passed.  So, 400 fifth graders * 0.80 = 320 fifth graders passed.

Now, let's add up all the students who passed: 340 third graders + 40 fourth graders + 320 fifth graders = 700 students.

Finally, to get the overall pass rate, we divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students: 700 / (500 + 100 + 400) = 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

So, 4 students drank 1.5 quarts each, which is a total of 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Then, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, for a total of 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

That means they drank a total of 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, they must have started with 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

And since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, they started with 48 / 4 = 12 gallons of tea.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Rose picks a bunch of flowers, right?  

* First, she gets 3 flowers with 5 petals each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 petals.

* Next, she adds 5 flowers with 4 petals each, for a total of 5 * 4 = 20 petals.
* Finally, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each, giving us 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

That's a lot of petals! In total, before she drops any, she has 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

But oh no, she drops one of each kind of flower! That means she loses 5 petals.

So, in the vase, there are 101 - 5 = 96 petals.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His two friends who aren't as good only get half that time, which is 10 minutes per quarter. His really good friend gets to play 1.5 times longer, so that's 30 minutes per quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

* Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
* His two weaker friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, for a total of 48 quarters.
* His better friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

Adding it all up, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, they spend a total of 68 * $0.25 = $17.00.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

Think of it like this:

* **Zest and Fragrance:** They're buddies, using the same amount, let's call it 'x'.
* **Salt and Sugar:** They're also a team, each using twice the amount of zest, so that's '2x' for each.
* **Oil:** The big spender, using twice the amount of salt, making it '4x'.

Now, add it all up: x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10 ounces (that's the size of the jar).

Combining like terms, we get 10x = 10.

So, x = 1.

Finally, oil is 4x, which means Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Joe has twice the number of cars Robert has, and Robert has 20. So Joe starts with 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

He sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.

Then, he gives his mom twice the number he sold, meaning he gives her 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Kimberly bought a lot of pet food! 

She got 8 packages of cat food with 11 tins each, so that's 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

For dog food, she bought 6 packages with 6 tins each, meaning she has 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

To find the difference, we subtract: 88 - 36 = 52 tins.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Let's say PJ has 'x' cards. Smendrick has three times that amount, so he has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

All together, they have 341 cards, so: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.  

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329.

Finally, dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 47.

Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 153 cards.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Cindy had 5 green eggs, and twice that many blue ones, so she had 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs. She had one less pink egg than blue eggs, meaning she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.  

Adding them all up, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Milly loses. 

First, the shipping cost based on weight is $0.35/pound * 4 pounds = $1.40.

Then, the shipping cost based on distance is $0.08/mile * 20 miles = $1.60.

So, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Amazon will give her back 75% of the book's price, which is $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.

Finally, Milly's total loss is $32 (original price) - $24 (refund) - $3 (shipping) = $5.00.

That's a total of 8000 + 4000 + 24000 = 36000 bars for the first three weeks.

To reach his goal of 50000 bars for the month, he needs to make 50000 - 36000 = 14000 bars in the fourth week.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

First, Britany spends 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes making TikToks.

Then, she spends 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes writing songs.

She also spends 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes on makeup.

That means she spends a total of 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes on TikTok each week.

Over a month, that's 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 1128 minutes.

Finally, 1128 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 18.8 hours on TikTok per month.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Pompei lifts a mountain 1 inch high. Saskay lifts 12 times that, so Saskay lifts 1 * 12 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami lifts 4 times higher than Saskay, meaning Kagiyami lifts 12 * 4 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto lifts 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto lifts 48 * 10 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.

If a turtle is half as fast as a kangaroo, it would take twice as long, right? So, one turtle would take 108 hours. But we have four turtles, so they'd be four times faster than one turtle. That means it would take them 108 hours / 4 = 27 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory made 20 more than that, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. Jada made twice as many as Rory, meaning she made 40 * 2 = 80 dishes.

To find the total, we add up the number of dishes each person made: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

The laptop costs $400 after the trade-in. Erika has $150 from her job and $80 from her mom, plus she needs another $50. That means she has $150 + $80 = $230.  Since she needs $50 more, she must have $230 - $50 = $180 in her purse.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

If each glue stick starts at 12 millimeters, we need to find out how much is left over from each one and then add those amounts together.

* Glue stick 1 has 5/6 left, so that's (5/6) * 12 mm = 10 mm unused.
* Glue stick 2 has 1/3 left, so that's (1/3) * 12 mm = 4 mm unused.
* Glue stick 3 has 1/2 left, so that's (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm unused.

Adding those up, we get 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Gabriel needs $10,000 for the car and $800 for the phone, so that's a total of $10,800. He already has $5000 from his job and $200 from his brother, giving him $5200.

To find out how much more he needs, we subtract: $10,800 - $5200 = $5600.

Looks like Gabriel still needs $5600.

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

Jack has 60 dishes, and that's twice the number of socks he has, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, meaning he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Peter also has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

In total, they have 60 + 30 = 90 socks and 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.

Adding those together, they have 90 + 90 = 180 socks and dishes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month and spends $2640 a year, we need to find out how much each pair costs. 

First, he buys 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs of shoes a year.

Then, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs: $2640 / 24 pairs = $110/pair.

So, James pays $110 on average for each pair of shoes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Three baskets of green food would cost 3 * $25 = $75.  

Three baskets of red food would normally cost 3 * $18 = $54, but with the $2 discount on each, they'll only be $54 - $6 = $48.

Adding those together, the total cost is $75 + $48 = $123.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If they need to clean half the rooms, that's 90 rooms / 2 = 45 rooms.

Each room takes 20 minutes, so 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes total.

"Hey there! This is a fun problem. Let me see...

Let's say my age is ""x"". My brother is 3 years older than me, so he's ""x + 3"". My sister is 2 years younger than me, so she's ""x - 2"".  Mom's age is a bit trickier - it's one less than three times my brother's age, so that's ""3(x + 3) - 1"".

If we add all our ages together, it equals 87. So,  x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

Let's solve for x:

* x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
* 6x + 9 = 87
* 6x = 78
* x = 13

So, I'm 13 years old!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Claire gets 1 badge a month. Amber takes twice as long, so she gets 1 badge every 2 months, meaning she gets 6 badges in a year (12 months / 2 months/badge = 6 badges). Wendy gets 3 times as many badges as Claire, so she earns 3 badges a month and 36 in a year (3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges).

That means Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year (36 badges - 6 badges = 30 badges).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

They have 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars, so that's 12 - 2 = 10 green cars. They have 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, meaning they have 10 * 3 = 30 blue cars.

In total, that's 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 red, green, and blue cars. Since they have 75 cars total, they must have 75 - 52 = 23 yellow cars.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

Let's say Fawn has 'F' books. Anne has 12 fewer than Fawn, so Anne has F - 12 books. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, meaning Sofie has (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 books.

All together, they have 85 books, so F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85.

Combining like terms, we get 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we have 3F = 84.

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find that F = 28.


So Fawn has 28 books.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much money Kelly has left. 

First, each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each chicken pack costs $10 / 5 * 2 = $4.

Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so they cost $4 / 2 = $2 each.

Seven packs of apples cost $2 * 7 = $14.

Three packs of strawberries cost $4 * 3 = $12.

Adding up all the costs, Kelly spends $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60 in total.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, Mrs. Smith has 100 plants. A quarter of them are indoors, which is 25 plants (100 / 4 = 25). That leaves 75 plants (100 - 25 = 75).

Two-thirds of those are outdoor plants, so that's 50 plants (75 * (2/3) = 50).

That means the rest, 25 plants, must be flowering plants (75 - 50 = 25).

To find the percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Colby completes 40 packages an hour (50 - 10 = 40).  That means he makes $8.00 each hour (40 packages * $0.20/package = $8.00). Over an 8-hour day, he earns $64.00 ( $8.00/hour * 8 hours = $64.00).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

An extreme Sudoku takes John 45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since he drinks a bottle every 30 minutes, that's 180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Benny used 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon and he had 20 red balloons, so that's 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna.

That leaves 58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna for the yellow balloons.

Since each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna, there must be 18 / 3 = 6 yellow balloons.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so that's 100 * 30 = 3000 miles in a month. Since he needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, he'll need 3000 / 1000 = 3 tune-ups.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday, then 5 * 2 = 10 hours on Wednesday. On Thursday, he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we need to find out how much the balloons cost. A dozen balloons is 12, and they're sold in groups of 2 for $0.50, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 groups of balloons.  The balloons cost 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

Then, the ice cream cost 2 * $7 = $14.00.

Adding everything up, the total cost of the gifts is $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.00.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, each girl got $28 / 2 = $14.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

They sold 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

That's a total of 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240 earned.

But they spent 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150 to buy them.

So their profit is $240 - $150 = $90.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how many pets Larry has.

He's got 3 cats, and 3 times that many dogs, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, meaning he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

His fish tank has 3 times the number of rabbits, so he has 7 * 3 = 21 fish.

Finally, his gerbil collection is 1/3 the size of his fish collection, which is 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Adding them all up: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

The tank starts with half the pool's water, which is 10000 gallons / 2 = 5000 gallons.

They use 500 gallons each day for 6 days, totaling 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons.

That means they'll have 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons left in the tank.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Colby's already spent some money this month, so we need to see how much he has left.  

He spent $50 on Friday/Saturday movies, $56 on other day movies, $16 on popcorn, and $8 on candy. That's a total of $130.

He started with $150, so he has $20 left.  A Friday movie, popcorn, and candy will cost him $20 exactly.

That means he can see **1** more movie tonight. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to find out how many calories are in each mini pastry. A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a regular one, so that's 600 calories / 3 = 200 calories. A mini blueberry muffin has 450 calories / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories for each type of pastry. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so that's 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories. He baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, which is 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we add up the calories from both types: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

* Friday: 57

Adding those all up: 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs total.

Since there are 5 days, the average is 300 / 5 = 60 Junebugs per day.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

We know Peter, Paul, and Jean's ages add up to 100.  Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is the same as Paul's age plus John's age.

To find Peter's age, we can think like this:

* Let's say John is ""J"" years old.
* Paul is 10 years older, so Paul is ""J + 10"" years old.
* Peter's age is Paul's age plus John's age, so Peter is (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 years old.

Now, we know all their ages add up to 100: J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100

Let's solve for J:

* 4J + 20 = 100
* 4J = 80
* J = 20

So John is 20 years old.

Now we can find Peter's age:

* Peter = 2J + 10 = (2 * 20) + 10 = 50

Peter is 50 years old.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Maria gave her 4 friends 2 balloons each, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 balloons. She had 1 balloon too, making it 8 + 1 = 9 balloons total at first. Then her mom gave everyone 3 more balloons, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 more balloons.

Adding those to the starting amount, they had 9 + 15 = 24 balloons in all!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Zoey spits 40 seeds * 10 feet each = 400 feet total.

Sydney spits 35 seeds * 12 feet each = 420 feet total.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in a day it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. Over a month, that's 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in a day it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. Over a month, that's 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 43200 - 32400 = 10800 more widgets per month.

Since each widget sells for $6, Fern will make 10800 * $6 = $64800 more with the Widgeteer 3000.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Cameron stays for 17 hours total. The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos, and the extra 5 hours cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. So, his total cost is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.  A 24-hour stay would have cost him 1600 pesos. That means he saves 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Each sheep needs 2 * 5 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds of hay.

That means Nate needs 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds of hay for the goats.

In total, Nate needs 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds of hay.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, James spent 10 CDs * $15/CD = $150 on the CDs.

Then, he got a sweet 40% discount, so he saved $150 * 0.40 = $60.

That means he paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He sold 5 of them for $40 each, making him $5 * $40 = $200.

So, in the end, James had $200 - $90 = $110.

"Hey there! Let's break down Cayley's commission. 

For the New York Times, he earns 10% of $5 per copy, which is $0.50.  Since he sells 6 copies, his commission from those is $3.00 (6 * $0.50).

For the Wall Street Journal, he earns 8% of $15 per copy, which is $1.20. With 10 copies sold, his commission is $12.00 (10 * $1.20).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

If Bahati scored the most and had 20 more points than Azibo, and 10 more than Dinar, we can use some algebra. Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points. That means Bahati scored x + 20 points, and Dinar scored x + 10 points.

Since their total score is 45, we can write the equation: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms, we get 3x + 30 = 45.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us 3x = 15.

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 5.


So Azibo scored 5 points.

Over two weeks, they get 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 new patients.

So, after two weeks, there are 200 beds + 700 patients = 900 occupied beds.

Finally,  1000 beds - 900 beds = 100 unoccupied beds left.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. So, they must have had 29 / 4 = 7.25 holes at the end of the first day.  Since you can't have part of a hole, let's say they had 7 holes at the end of the first day.

That means they dug 29 - 7 = 22 holes on the fourth day.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'A' Pokemon. Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's amount, so Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokemon. Alex caught 5 more than Stan, meaning he caught (4A - 13) + 5 Pokemon.

Together they caught 339, so A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339.

Simplifying that equation, we get 9A - 21 = 339.  Adding 21 to both sides gives us 9A = 360. Dividing both sides by 9, we find that A = 40.

Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokemon, so he caught 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokemon.

Together, both cars cost $100 + $60 = $160.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

When Emil is 24, his dad will be double his age, meaning his dad will be 48.  Since Emil is currently 19, his dad is currently 43.

When Emil is 24, his brother will be half his age, meaning his brother will be 12. Since Emil is currently 19, his brother is currently 7.

Adding their ages together, we get 43 + 7 = 50.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Joe caught 3 pounds on Thursday, then 3 * 4 = 12 pounds on Friday. On Saturday, he caught 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, 20% of the 30 students are football players, which is 30 * 0.20 = 6 students. That leaves 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, 25% of those remaining students are cheerleaders or in band, so that's 24 * 0.25 = 6 students.

In total, 6 football players + 6 cheerleaders/band members = 12 students are leaving early.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. If Charlie's boots are five times bigger than Sophie's size 5 boots, that means Charlie wears a size 25.  To find the average, we add their sizes together (5 + 25 = 30) and then divide by 2 (30 / 2 = 15).

So the average shoe size is 15. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to figure out how many plants will fit in Pat's flower bed.  Since each plant needs 12 inches and there's 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between each plant, each plant takes up 30 inches total.

Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long, which is 1332 inches. So, she can fit 1332 inches / 30 inches per plant = 44.4 plants. Since Pat can't buy parts of plants, she can fit 44 plants.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 44 plants - 17 plants = 27 more plants.

Each plant costs $6, so she'll spend 27 plants * $6/plant = $162 at the store.



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Edgar's brother eats half the amount Edgar does, so he eats 18 pretzels / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.  In a week, that's 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Katherine needs 3 petunias at $3.00 each, so that's 3 * $3.00 = $9.00 per basket for petunias.

She also wants 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so that's 2 * $2.50 = $5.00 per basket for vines.

In total, each basket will cost $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

Since she has 5 baskets, the total cost will be $14.00/basket * 5 baskets = $70.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to see how long it takes Emily to peel all the shrimp. She peels 6 shrimp per minute, so for 90 shrimp, that's 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes.

Next, we need to figure out the cooking time. She cooks 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so for 90 shrimp, it would take her (90 shrimp / 30 shrimp) * 10 minutes = 30 minutes.

Finally, we add the peeling and cooking times together: 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

The AC cooled the room 6 degrees on low (2 degrees/hour * 3 hours) and then another 12 degrees on high (3 degrees/hour * 4 hours). That's a total of 18 degrees cooler.

But then it warmed up 4 degrees while it was off (2 degrees/hour * 2 hours).

So, the final temperature was 14 degrees cooler than it started (18 degrees - 4 degrees).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Comet Halley comes around every 75 years. Bill's dad saw it when he was 30. Bill saw it again when he was three times his dad's age at that time, meaning Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Since the comet appears every 75 years, and Bill was 90 when he saw it, that means 90 / 75 = 1.2 comet cycles have passed.  This means Bill was 75 years old when he first saw the comet.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

The second plane takes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane takes. So, the first plane takes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

It flies to Greece for three-quarters of those trips, meaning 88 * (3/4) = 66 flights are to Greece.

That leaves 88 - 66 = 22 flights for France and Germany. Since those are split equally, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice that, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for the combined time of the other two, meaning he howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  

In total, they howl for 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.  Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, their total howl time is 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

We know the total age of all four kids is 20. Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4, and Helene is twice the average age of the group.  That means Helene is 10 years old (since the average age is 20 / 4 = 5, and she's twice that).

So, Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene together are 3 + 4 + 10 = 17 years old.

That means Wilfred must be 3 years old (20 - 17 = 3).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, 100 guests brought 15 cookies each, which means there were 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies in total.

The bride gave half of them to the church, so that's 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

If each person at the church got 15 cookies, then there were 750 / 15 = 50 people at the church.

"Hey there! This is a fun one.  

Think of it like this: if each kid gets one ""share,"" each adult gets two ""shares."" That means the adults get a total of four ""shares"" (2 adults * 2 shares each).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Doctor Jones spends 20 minutes per inpatient on rounds, and he has 9 inpatients, so that's 20 * 9 = 180 minutes for rounds.  That's equal to 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

His appointments take 30 minutes each, and he has 10, so that's 30 * 10 = 300 minutes, or 300 / 60 = 5 hours.

In total, he spends 3 + 5 = 8 hours on rounds and appointments.

Since he works a 9-hour day, he has 9 - 8 = 1 hour left for records.

"Hey there! Let's figure out those dance studio earnings. 

So, they charge $25 to rent the space and $1.50 per student. With 10 students, that's $25 + ($1.50 * 10) = $40 per session.

They have classes 3 days a week, so that's $40/session * 3 sessions/week = $120 per week.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how many female porcupines there are. Since they make up 3/5 of the population, there are (3/5) * 50 = 30 female porcupines.

Each female has 4 babies a month, so that's 30 * 4 = 120 babies born each month.

Over a whole year, that's 120 * 12 = 1440 babies!

Finally, add the babies to the original population: 1440 + 50 = 1490 porcupines.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 gallons * (1/4) = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she pumped 4500 gallons * (3/4) = 3375 gallons.

On day one, they pumped a total of 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons.

On day two, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her day one amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her day one amount, which is 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

On day two, they pumped a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons.

Over both days, they pumped 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

"Hey there! This problem needs a bit of thinking. Let's break it down.

First, we know the power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours, then 7% per hour for another 3 hours. That's a total loss of 45% + 21% = 66% of its charge.

This means 34% of the charge remained after those losses.  But we also know that the final charge was 28%. That 6% difference represents the charge used by Maria's friends.

Since that 6% was part of the 34% remaining after the initial losses, we can figure out the original charge. Think of it like this: 6% is to 34% as  'x' is to 100%.

Solving that proportion, we find that the original charge (x) was about 17.65%.

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

Teresa makes a profit of $12 on each large stuffed animal and $4 on each small one. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and made $120 in total, we can figure out how many small ones she sold.

Think of it this way: for every $12 she made from a large stuffed animal, she made $8 from small ones. That means for every $20 earned, $8 came from small stuffed animals.

Since she made $120, that means she earned $8 * 6 = $48 from small stuffed animals.

If she earned $48 from small stuffed animals at $4 each, she sold 48 / 4 = 12 small stuffed animals.

So, one dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds a day * 30 days = 1080 pounds in a month.

"Let's figure this out.  There are a few ways this could go down for Marcus:

* **Best Case:** He gets a substitute, and no homework is collected. That's a 50% chance.

* **Next Best:** His regular teacher is there, but gives the whole class an extension. That's a 40% chance of happening, but only if the substitute doesn't show up, so we're at 50% * 40% = 20%.

* **Even Better:** His teacher is there, no extension for the class, but Marcus pulls off the ""dog ate my homework"" excuse. That's a 20% chance of working, but again, only if the substitute doesn't show up AND the class doesn't get an extension. So that's 50% * (1-40%) * 20% = 6%.

* **Worst Case:**  His teacher is there, no extension, and no dog excuse. That's the only scenario left, so it's 100% - 50% - 20% - 6% = 24%.

So, there's a 24% chance Marcus actually has to turn in his homework.

So, Jim takes out $50,000 in loans each year for four years, which means he's got a total of $200,000 in loans.  He was making $25,000 a year before college, and his degree triples that to $75,000.  

While he's in school, he misses out on earning $25,000 a year for four years, so that's another $100,000.

In total, he needs to earn back $300,000 ($200,000 in loans + $100,000 in lost wages).

* The bed is 8 feet wide, so the fabric needs to be 8 + 2 + 2 = 12 feet wide.

Adding those together, the total cost is $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00.


$101.00

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

So, Johnny's dad lost $5 on the first race. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost on the first race, which is $10 + $1 = $11.  

Then, on the third race, he lost 1.5 times what he won on the second race, meaning he lost $11 * 1.5 = $16.50.

In total, he lost $5 + $16.50 = $21.50 that day.  To find the average loss, we divide that by the number of races: $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to make sure we're comparing apples to apples, so let's convert Xavier's height to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, add his growth: 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Cole's new height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Finally, find the difference: 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

"
"Hey there! Let me see... they split $1920, the second person got $80 more than the first, and the third got double the second person's share.  

To figure out the first person's share, let's think of it like this:

*  Let the first person's share be ""x"".
* The second person got ""x + $80"".
* The third person got ""2 * (x + $80)"" which is ""2x + $160"".

Adding all that up, we get x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Combining the 'x' terms and the dollar amounts, we have 4x + $240 = $1920

Subtracting $240 from both sides gives us 4x = $1680

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that x = $420.

So the first person's share was $420. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

They worked 3/8 of a day, which is 9 hours (3/8 * 24 hours). Over 3 weeks, that's 21 days of work. So each painter put in 189 hours (21 days * 9 hours/day).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Let's say Rory got 'x' balls in the second set.  That means he got x + 4 in the first set and x / 2 in the third.

All together, that's x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19 balls.

To solve for x, let's combine the 'x' terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6

So, Rory got 6 balls in the second set.  That means he got 6 + 4 = 10 balls in the first set.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

The car loses 21% of its value each year.  

* In 2008, it would be worth 20000 * (1 - 0.21) = $15800
* In 2009, it would be worth 15800 * (1 - 0.21) = $12478
* In 2010, it would be worth 12478 * (1 - 0.21) = $9860.62


So the price of the car in 2010 would be $9860.62.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Half the books are in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books.

10% are in German, which is 50 * 0.10 = 5 books.

That means there are 25 + 5 = 30 books in English and German combined.

So, there must be 50 - 30 = 20 Spanish books.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

If Betsy took longer than Donovan, and their times add up to 98 minutes, we can think of it like this:

* Let's say Donovan took 'x' minutes.
* Betsy took 'x + 18' minutes.

So, x + (x + 18) = 98

That means 2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

Donovan took 40 minutes, and Betsy took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

The first train takes 20 minutes to arrive and then stays for another 20 minutes.  The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first one leaves, so that's 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train only stays for 5 minutes (20 / 4 = 5). The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, so that's 60 + 5 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves right away, and the fourth train arrives 20 minutes later, at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

So Paul waits for 145 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Mr. Rogers got the watch for 75% of $2000, which is $1500. Then he sold it for 120% of that price, meaning he sold it for $1800.  That's a $200 discount from the original $2000 price.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%

So the answer is 10%.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Marcel's earnings.

First, we know he sold 150 Trekking bikes (half of 300), 45 BMX bikes (15% of 300), and the rest were MTB bikes, which is 105 bikes (300 - 150 - 45).

A BMX bike costs $250 (half the price of an MTB), and a Trekking bike costs $450.

So, his earnings from Trekking bikes are 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500.

Earnings from BMX bikes are 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250.

And earnings from MTB bikes are 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much it'll cost to paint this room. 

First, we need to find the total area of all the walls. The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so that's 80 square feet per wall. Since there are two of them, that's 160 square feet total.

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, making them 40 square feet each. With two of those, we have another 80 square feet.

Adding those together, the total area we need to paint is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so we'll need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Finally, at $12 per gallon, the total cost will be 12 * $12 = $144.

Now, he helps 2 people per hour and works 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people each day.

Finally, over 40 days, he helps a total of 40 * 6 = 240 people.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Soledad wants to hike a whopping 9300 miles in June. If she hikes 125 miles twice a day, that's 250 miles per day. Over 30 days, that's 7500 miles (250 miles/day * 30 days).  

She needs to hike 1800 more miles (9300 miles - 7500 miles). To do that in June, she'd need to hike an extra 60 miles each day (1800 miles / 30 days).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we need to count all the female fish Tate has: 7 female guppies + 5 female goldfish = 12 female fish.

Then, count all the male fish: 4 male guppies + 3 male goldfish = 7 male fish.

Finally, subtract the number of male fish from the number of female fish: 12 - 7 = 5.

Tate has 5 more female fish than male fish.



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Amalia spent 4 hours mowing. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so she spent 4 + 2 = 6 hours walking the dog. Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia mowing, meaning she spent 4 + 4 = 8 hours doing laundry.

To find the total time, we add up their individual times: 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

John drives 2 hours each way at 70 mph, so that's 70 * 2 = 140 miles one way.  Since it's a round trip, he drives 140 * 2 = 280 miles each visit.

He visits twice a month, so he drives 280 * 2 = 560 miles in total.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, the first two workers make 6 toys an hour each, and there are two of them, so they make 6 * 2 = 12 toys per hour. Over 10 hours, that's 12 * 10 = 120 toys.

The other two workers make 4 toys an hour each, so together they make 4 * 2 = 8 toys per hour. In 10 hours, they make 8 * 10 = 80 toys.

That means the first four workers made a total of 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

They needed to make 400 toys, but they still need 20 more, so they made 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

That means the fifth worker made 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

Since they worked for 10 hours, the fifth worker made 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Elijah's first dog weighs 60 pounds / 4 = 15 pounds. His second dog weighs 60 pounds / 2 = 30 pounds.  That means Elijah's dogs weigh a total of 15 pounds + 30 pounds = 45 pounds.

Adding that to Kory's dog's weight, we get 45 pounds + 60 pounds = 105 pounds.

"Hey there! Let's crack this egg-painting problem.

Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30.  That means Sarah painted 9 eggs (30 - 12) / 2 = 9), and Camden painted 21 (9 + 12).

Arnold and Madeline painted the same amount, and together they painted 26 eggs (56 total eggs - 30). So, each of them painted 13 eggs.

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold (21 - 13).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Nik has 200 crayons, and each box holds 8 crayons. That means he'll need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, all the crayons weigh 200 ounces. The boxes also weigh 8 ounces each, so all the boxes together weigh 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

In total, that's 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.  We know she spends 40 minutes on the beach, and since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, that part takes her 10 minutes (1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hour = 10 minutes).

So, her total walking time is 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

So, Melanie's dad starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.  

Over three weeks, he gets 20 cows a day from Milkie Cows Limited, that's 20 * 7 * 3 = 420 cows!

And from Broilers Limited, he gets 10 chickens a day, so that's 10 * 7 * 3 = 210 chickens.

That means he has 50 + 420 = 470 cows and 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

In total, he has 470 + 230 = 700 animals on the farm.

First, figure out how many potatoes make one scoop of mashed potatoes: 6 potatoes - 3 potatoes = 3 potatoes. Then, 3 scoops - 1 scoop = 2 scoops. So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

That means each scoop needs 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes.

Gomer ate 23 scoops - 5 scoops = 18 scoops.

Finally, multiply the scoops Gomer ate by the potatoes per scoop: 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, meaning for every 5 men, there are 9 women.  That makes a total of 14 parts.

If there are 84 passengers in total, each ""part"" of the ratio represents 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers.

Initially, there were 9 parts of women, so there were 9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women on the bus.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 women - 20 women = 34 women left on the bus.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Faraday makes $2 per sunflower and $8 per bouquet. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, that means he makes $8 / 12 = $0.67 per sunflower in a bouquet.

So, he makes a total of $2 + $0.67 = $2.67 per sunflower each day.

Over 3 days, he'd make $2.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

He earned $26 from individual sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over 3 days.

That means he sold $82 / $2.67 per sunflower = 30.7 sunflowers. Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, he sold 30 sunflowers.

Then, we see how many he sells: 20 rocks * 60% = 12 rocks.

His earnings are: 12 rocks * $7 per rock = $84.

Finally, to find his loss, we subtract his earnings from his initial investment: $100 - $84 = $16.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to see how much energy 2300 people need in total. That's 2300 people * 100% = 230,000% of daily energy.

Right now, Hortex can cover 4200 bottles * 20% = 84,000% of daily energy needs.

To find the difference, we subtract: 230,000% - 84,000% = 146,000%.

Since each bottle covers 20% of the daily need, they'd need to produce 146,000% / 20% = 7300 more bottles.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

First, the first two complexes have a total of 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The third complex is 60% bigger than that, meaning it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments than the first two combined.

So, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

That means John collects from a total of 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

Since he collects from each place 3 times a week, that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 collections.

And at $0.40 per collection, he makes 4320 * $0.40 = $1728.00 each week.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how many fruits that avocado tree can produce.

* A 6-year-old tree makes 3 times the initial 50 fruits, so that's 150 fruits.

* An 8-year-old tree makes 200 less fruits than a 10-year-old tree.
* A 10-year-old tree makes 20 times the initial amount, meaning it produces 1000 fruits!
* So, the 8-year-old tree makes 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Adding up the fruits from each year: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 (no fruits in year 9) = 2350 fruits.

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope.  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, and all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long.

To find the red rope's length, we need to figure out the length of each rope.  

Think of it like this:

* If the blue rope is 'b' centimeters long, the red rope is '4b' centimeters long.
* The yellow rope is 'b + 7' centimeters long.

Now, let's add up the lengths:  b + 4b + (b + 7) = 37

Combining like terms, we get 6b + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides: 6b = 30

Divide both sides by 6: b = 5

So, the blue rope is 5 centimeters long.

Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, the red rope is 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so that's 20 * 12 = 240 square feet per bedroom.  Since there are four bedrooms, that's 240 * 4 = 960 square feet total for the bedrooms.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, meaning it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding the bedrooms and living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

"Hey there! Let's break down this soccer match.

Team B scored 2 fewer goals than Team A in the first half, so they scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, Team B went on a scoring spree, netting 4 times their first-half total, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals.

Team A only managed to score 1/4 of Team B's second-half goals, meaning they scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Adding up all the goals, Team A scored a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals, and Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

That means a total of 6 + 10 = 16 goals were scored in the match.

So, he can use the chalk for 2.75 inches / (0.20 * 5 inches/day) = 2.75 days. Since he can't use it when it's less than 2 inches, he has **2** more full days of chalk.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

There are 12 boys and 12 girls, making a total of 24 students. One-third of the girls (12 / 3 = 4) and one-fourth of the boys (12 / 4 = 3) are on varsity. That means 4 + 3 = 7 students are on varsity.

So, 24 - 7 = 17 students are not on varsity.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Johnny bought 2 more than three times the number of masks Mike bought. So, three times the number of masks Mike bought is 5 * 3 = 15.  Then, 2 more than that is 15 + 2 = 17.

Johnny bought 17 face masks.

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

Let's say Wendy's current age is ""w"" and Colin's current age is ""c"".

We know:

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years:  w = 5(c + 7)
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Let's solve for ""c"" (Colin's current age):

1. From the first equation, we get: w = 5c + 35

2. Substitute this value of ""w"" into the second equation: c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

3. Simplify and solve for ""c"":
   c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
   (3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
   75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
   40/3 = (2/3)c
   c = (40/3) * (3/2)
   c = 20


Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Newton starts with 2 apples. One falls on his head, so he has 2. He throws one back up, making 5 more fall. That's 2 + 5 = 7 apples. He pockets 6 and throws the last one, making 6 more fall. Now he has 6 + 1 + 6 = 13 apples.

So the answer is 13.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

They used 38 bandages the first day, then 28 the second (10 fewer). On the third day, they used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. That's a total of 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages used.

They got 50 bandages on the first day and 100 more (two packs) on the third day, for a total of 150 new bandages.

Since they had 78 left at the end, they must have started with 78 + 91 = 169 bandages.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Jen's earnings. 

She works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week, so that's 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours a week.

Her hourly rate is $1.50, so she earns 45 * $1.50 = $67.50 per week.

Since April has 4 weeks, her monthly earnings are $67.50 * 4 = $270.00.

Don't forget her perfect attendance bonus of $10!

That brings her total to $270.00 + $10 = $280.00 for April.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

So, 50 people came in the morning, then 40 more at 10:00. That's 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Then twice the 10:00 group came in, so that's 40 * 2 = 80 more people. Now we have 90 + 80 = 170 people.

Finally, three times the first group came in the evening, meaning 50 * 3 = 150 more people.

Adding everyone up, we get 170 + 150 = 320 people in total.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

John spends $600 on 10 bottles of scotch, meaning each bottle costs $60. Cognac bottles cost 50% more, so each one is $60 + ($60 * 0.50) = $90. Since he buys twice as many cognac bottles, that's 10 * 2 = 20 bottles.  His total cognac cost is 20 * $90 = $1800.

Adding that to his scotch cost, he spends a total of $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day and twice that many Lodgepole Pine, which is 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. That's a total of 20 + 40 = 60 trees on the first day.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, bringing the total to 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine than the first day, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. That's a total of 30 + 50 = 80 trees on the second day.

In total, Mr. Julius planted 60 + 80 = 140 trees over the two days.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

So, one-third of the fish have red stripes, which is (1/3) * 66 fish = 22 fish. That leaves 66 fish - 22 fish = 44 fish without red stripes.

Of those, 5/11 have blue stripes, so that's (5/11) * 44 fish = 20 fish.

In total, there are 22 fish + 20 fish = 42 fish with either red or blue stripes.

"Let's break it down:

Amy starts with 2 palettes * 4 colors/palette = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also has 3 sets * 6 colors/set = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

That's a total of 8 colors + 18 colors = 26 colors.

Her sister takes one palette, which is 4 colors, so Amy has 26 colors - 4 colors = 22 colors left.

Then she uses half the colors from one makeup set, which is 6 colors / 2 = 3 colors.

So, Amy has 22 colors - 3 colors = 19 colors left.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Mattison's house is 7 times his height, so it's 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches tall.

The first floor is 3 times Mattison's height, meaning it's 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches high.

That means Mattison and the first floor together are 60 inches + 180 inches = 240 inches.

To find the height of the second floor, we subtract that from the total house height: 420 inches - 240 inches = 180 inches.

So the roof is 180 inches above the second floor.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to find the jar's volume: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Since they only pack the jelly beans at 80% efficiency, the usable space is 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, so they can fit 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

If 30% are red, that's 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

The actual number is 900, so Tim was off by |864 - 900| = 36 jelly beans.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year for 5 years, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 visits.

Each visit costs $2, so those first 15 visits cost 15 * $2 = $30.

After 5 years, the price jumps up by 150%, which means it increases by $2 * 1.5 = $3.

The new price per visit is $2 + $3 = $5.

For the next 3 years, she goes 3 visits/year * 3 years = 9 times.

Those visits cost 9 * $5 = $45.

In total, Pauline spends $30 + $45 = $75 on museum visits.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Charlie makes.

He earns $80 per hour normally, but gives a 25% discount to veterans, which is $80 * 0.25 = $20 off. That means he charges veterans $80 - $20 = $60 per hour.

So, his standard lessons today will earn him 4 lessons * $80/lesson = $320.

Half of Skyler's hats are red, so that's 100 / 2 = 50 red hats. That leaves 100 - 50 = 50 hats that are either blue or white.

Three-fifths of those remaining hats are blue, meaning there are (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

The rest must be white, so Skyler has 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions right, which means she needs to answer 77 questions correctly (110 total questions * 0.70 = 77).

She already got 42 questions right on the first test (70 questions * 0.60 = 42).

That means she needs to get 35 questions right on the second test (77 - 42 = 35).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Mary makes 's' strawberry cubes, she makes 5s - 4 blueberry cubes.  Since she makes 116 total, we have the equation: s + (5s - 4) = 116.

Combining like terms gives us 6s - 4 = 116.  Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120.  Dividing by 6, we find s = 20 strawberry cubes.

Finally, she makes 5(20) - 4 = 96 blueberry cubes.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Brendan started with 10 marbles, dropped half (which is 5), and found 3 of them. That means he lost 5 - 3 = 2 marbles.  So he had 3 left. But then he found out one wasn't even a marble! That leaves him with 3 - 1 = 2 marbles.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Jason needs 15 customers to buy cars. Since he gets one customer for every 25 calls, that means he needs to make 15 customers * 25 calls/customer = 375 calls.

But wait, there's more! For every 2 customers who visit, only 1 buys a car. So, he actually needs 15 cars * 2 customers/car = 30 customers to visit the dealership.

To get those 30 customers, he needs to make 30 customers * 25 calls/customer = 750 calls.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  They have 4 flashlights for the people and then 2 flashlights per room, so that's 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights.  

They have small candles in half the rooms, which is 8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms. That's 4 rooms * 4 small candles/room = 16 small candles.

The other half of the rooms have medium candles, so that's another 4 rooms * 5 medium candles/room = 20 medium candles.

In total, they have 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Adding those to the flashlights, they have 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40 candles and flashlights.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

So, the first side takes 5 minutes. The second and third sides each take twice as long, which is 10 minutes each. The last two sides take half the time of the first, so they each take 2.5 minutes.

Adding all that up: 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes.


It takes 30 minutes to solve the Rubik's cube.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. If there were 20 helmets, and there were half as many robots, that means there were 20 / 2 = 10 robots.  There were also twice as many footballs as helmets, so there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

Adding them all up, Dominick saw 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 items.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Tim works 6 hours a day, which is 360 minutes (6 * 60).  Since each call takes 15 minutes, he handles 24 calls each day (360 / 15). Over a 5-day work week, that's a total of 120 calls (24 * 5).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

The old varnish takes 7 minutes per painting, so for 6 paintings, that's 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes per painting, so for 6 paintings, it's 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

The difference is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much water Crista needs. 

Okay, so 4 plants need half a cup each, that's 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

Then 8 plants need a full cup, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

The rest of her plants, 8 of them, need a quarter cup each, which is 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Adding it all up, Crista needs 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water.

"Hey there! Let's help Phineas get home.  

Since half the distance is on land and half is in water, he'll travel 100 yards hopping and 100 yards swimming.

Hopping takes him 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.

Swimming takes him 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

In total, it'll take Phineas 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes to get home.

* $6.00 on her skirt

That's a total of $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00 per week.

Over 5 weeks, that adds up to $47.00/week * 5 weeks = $235.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Conor saw 50 people on the first day, then 50 + 20 = 70 people on the second day. On the third day, there were 70 * 2 = 140 people. For the rest of the week, he saw 60 people each day for 4 days, so that's 60 * 4 = 240 people.

In total, Conor saw 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 people at the beach that week.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

So, in the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. Then, they pop three times faster, meaning 20 * 3 = 60 kernels pop in the next 30 seconds.

The popping gets even faster! Four times the initial rate means 20 * 4 = 80 kernels pop in the next 30 seconds.

But then it slows down to half the previous rate, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels pop in the last 30 seconds while the pan is on the heat.

Even after taking the pan off, some kernels keep popping! A quarter of the last batch pops, so that's 40 / 4 = 10 more kernels.

Adding all those up: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 pieces of popcorn.

Garrett has 210 pieces to munch on!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon of lemonade, and 6 lemons make 1 cup of juice.  So for 4 gallons, he'll need 4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon * 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons.

Now, the extra gallon needs to be twice as tart, meaning he'll need twice the lemon juice, or 2 cups. That's 2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons.

In total, Tim will need 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Gary's boat is worth.

After the first year, the boat loses 30% of its value, which is $9000 * 0.30 = $2700. That means it's worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

The second year, it loses another 30%, or $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.  So now it's worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

Finally, in the third year, it depreciates by 20%, which is $4410 * 0.20 = $882.  The boat's final value is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

So, there are 54 red candies, and twice that amount of orange, which is 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies. There are half as many yellow candies as red, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

That means there are 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 red, orange, and yellow candies in total.

Since there are 232 candies total, there must be 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies.

Tom's restaurant gets 6 groups of people each night, and each group spends $15 (2 meals at $5 each plus a $5 bottle of wine). That means they make $90 each night. Since they're open 2 days a week, they make $180 a week.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. If the vendor made a 25% profit on 50 watermelons he bought for $80, that means he made an extra $20 ($80 x 0.25 = $20).

So, he sold all the watermelons for $100 ($80 + $20 = $100).  To find out how much each watermelon cost, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons: $100 / 50 = $2.

Each watermelon was sold for $2.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Dora is turning 12 in 3 years, so she's currently 9. James is twice her age, making him 18.  John was 19 when James was born, so he's now 37. His youngest son was born when John was 32, meaning the son is currently 5. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 8.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes, and Jane takes 4 minutes.  In an hour (60 minutes), Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges. Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

That means Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Mark paid.

The radiator was originally $400, but he got a sweet deal at the junk shop – 80% off! That means he saved $400 * 0.80 = $320.

So, the radiator only cost him $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic charged $50 per hour for 3 hours of work, so that's $50 * 3 = $150.

Adding the radiator cost and the mechanic's fee, Mark paid a total of $80 + $150 = $230.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

If we think about it, chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4.  We know there are 20 animals total and 70 legs.  

Let's try some guessing and checking. If we had all chickens, that would be 40 legs (20 animals * 2 legs each). That's not enough.  

What if we had mostly cows? If we had 15 cows, that's 60 legs (15 cows * 4 legs each). That leaves 5 animals to be chickens, which would be 10 more legs (5 chickens * 2 legs each).  

That adds up to 70 legs! So there must be **5** chickens.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. They have 7 pizzas with 8 slices each, so that's 7 * 8 = 56 slices total.  Since there are 4 people sharing, each person gets 56 / 4 = 14 slices.
