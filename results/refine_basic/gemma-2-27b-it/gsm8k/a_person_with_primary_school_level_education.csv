"Janet has 16 eggs. She uses 3 for breakfast and 4 for muffins, so that's 3 + 4 = 7 eggs gone.  That leaves 16 - 7 = 9 eggs to sell. She sells each egg for $2, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 at the market.

"
"You need 2 bolts of blue fiber and half of that for white fiber, so that's 1 bolt of white.  That means you need 2 + 1 = 3 bolts in total!

"
"Okay, so Josh bought a house for $80,000 and fixed it up for $50,000. That means he spent a total of $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

Fixing it up made the house worth 150% more, which is like saying it's worth 1 and a half times more! So, it's worth $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000 more than before.

Now the house is worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000!

Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000!


$70,000 

"
"Okay, so James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week.  And each sprint is 60 meters.  Hmm... let's see... 3 sprints times 3 days is 9 sprints! And 9 sprints times 60 meters is... 540 meters! 

540 

"
"Okay, so Wendi gives her chickens 3 cups of food each, every day.  She gives them some in the morning and some in the afternoon.  Let's see... she gives them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's 15 + 25 = 40 cups already!

She has 20 chickens, and each one needs 3 cups, so that's 20 x 3 = 60 cups in total.

Hmmm, so she needs to give them 60 - 40 = 20 more cups in the last meal!


20 

"
"Okay, so Kylar wants lots of glasses!  He buys one for five dollars. Then, every other one is cheaper, only three dollars!  

He wants sixteen glasses, so that's eight pairs.  Each pair costs five dollars plus three dollars, which is eight dollars.

Eight pairs times eight dollars each... hmm... that's sixty-four dollars!


$64 

"
"Okay, so Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has four times that, so they have 20 x 4 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so they have 80 x 2 = 160 sheep.

To find the total, we add them all up: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep! 



"
"Okay, so Carla is downloading a big file, like a super long movie! It's 200 GB big.  She usually downloads 2 GB every minute, which is pretty fast!

But then, her computer has to restart for an update, like when your tablet needs to get new stuff to work better. That takes 20 minutes, and she has to start the download all over again!

Hmm, let's see... she downloaded 40% of the movie before the restart. That's like if she had almost half of it!  

So, she had to download the whole thing again, which takes a long time.  I think it takes her 120 minutes in total. 



"
"Okay, so John drove far away for a while, then had to turn around and go back home.  He got stuck in traffic for a bit, which is no fun!  

Let's see... he drove 60 miles every hour for 3 hours, so that's 60 x 3 = 180 miles.

Then he was stuck for 2 hours, so he didn't go anywhere.

He drove slow for a little bit, then really fast to try and get home quicker.

Hmm, I think he's still 45 miles away from home. 



"
"Eliza works 40 hours for $10 each hour, so that's 40 times 10, which is $400.

She worked 5 extra hours, and those hours pay more! They pay $12 each. So that's 5 times 12, which is $60.

Now we add the regular pay and the extra pay: $400 plus $60 is $460.


$460 

"
"Okay, so the program got 60 downloads the first month. Then it got three times that much the next month, so that's 60 times 3 which is 180 downloads! But then the third month it went down by 30%, which is kinda like taking away a third of the downloads.  So 180 divided by 3 is 60, and then we take that away from 180, leaving us with 120 downloads.

Now we add up all the downloads: 60 + 180 + 120 = 360 downloads!


366 

"
"Okay, let's see... Toula bought lots of yummy treats!

* She got 3 groups of 12 donuts, and each group cost $68. So that's 3 times $68, which is $204.
* Then she got 2 groups of 12 mini cupcakes, and each group cost $80. So that's 2 times $80, which is $160.
* And she got 6 groups of 12 mini cheesecakes, and each group cost $55. So that's 6 times $55, which is $330.

Now, to find the total, we add up all the prices: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694



"
"Okay, so Carlos spends $90 to plant the tree.  Every year he gets 7 lemons and sells them for $1.50 each. That's 7 times $1.50, which is $10.50. But he also has to spend $3 to take care of the tree. So he makes $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 each year.

To know when he starts making money, we gotta see how many times $7.50 goes into $90.  It goes in 12 times!


12 

"
"Okay, so Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.  

She sold some at the green house, then a couple more at the red house, and then some more at the orange house.  

To figure out how many she started with, we gotta work backwards!

Hmmm... let's see...  If she has 5 left, and she sold half at the orange house, that means she had 5 x 2 = 10 before the orange house.

Then she sold 2 at the red house, so she had 10 + 2 = 12 before the red house.

And at the green house, she sold a third of them, so she must have had 12 x 3 = 36 to start with!


**Answer:** 36 

"
"Okay, so there are 20 kids in the class.  Some like dancing to slow music, that's 20% of them, so that's 4 kids. Then some like dancing to jazzy music, and that's 25% of the kids who are left. So that's 4 more kids.  That means 12 kids like dancing to hip-hop music!  

If there are 20 kids in total, and 12 like hip-hop, then 12 out of 20 like hip-hop. That's 60%!


60 

"
"The jewelry will make more money! It goes up by 2.5%, and the gadgets only go up by 1.2%.  That means the jewelry will be worth more at the end of the month. 

125 

"
"Hmm, let's see... they go 80 miles one day and then 150 miles the next.  If we add those together, it's 80 plus 150... that's 230 miles!


230 

"
"Okay, so Jill makes $20 for every hour she teaches and $30 for every hour she coaches. She teaches a lot, 35 hours every week! And she coaches for 15 hours.  

That means she makes $20 times 35, which is $700, just from teaching each week. Then she makes $30 times 15, which is $450 from coaching each week.

So every week she makes $700 plus $450, which is $1150!

She works for 50 weeks in a year, so we gotta multiply $1150 by 50. That's $57,500!

That's how much money Jill makes in a whole year. 


57500 

"
"Okay, so Claire eats 3 eggs every day.  That's like 3 times 7, which is 21 eggs in a whole week!  

If she eats that many for 4 weeks, it's like 21 times 4, which is 84 eggs!

Now, a dozen has 12 eggs, so we gotta see how many times 12 goes into 84.  Hmm, 12 goes into 84 seven times!


7 

"
"Okay, so Marissa wants to walk 12 miles. She already walked 6 miles, and it took her 2 hours.  She wants to go 4 miles every hour, so she needs to walk the rest of the way really fast! She has 6 miles left and only 1 hour to do it.  That means she needs to walk 6 miles in 1 hour.

So the answer is 6 miles per hour! 



"
"Okay, so we have orange drink and pineapple drink. The orange drink has lots of water, two-thirds of it! That's like if you cut a pizza into three slices, the orange drink is made of two of those slices being water.  

The pineapple drink has less water, only three-fifths, like if you cut a pizza into five slices, the pineapple drink is made of three of those slices being water.

Oops, I spilled some orange drink!  

Let's see... we have 9 liters of orange drink left and 15 liters of pineapple drink. That's 24 liters all together.  

Hmm, how much water is in all that?  

The orange drink had 6.67 liters of water, and the pineapple drink had 9 liters of water.  

So, 6.67 plus 9 is... 15.67 liters of water!



"
"Okay, so Samantha is 31, and Raymond is older by 6 years, so he's 37.  Raymond had his son when he was 23, so his son is 37 - 23 = 14 years old. That means Raymond's son was born 14 years ago! 


14 

"
"Billy sold 3 DVDs to his first few customers. Then he sold 4 more DVDs.  That's 3 plus 4, which is 7 DVDs!


7 

"
"The candle burns for four hours. It gets shorter by 2 centimeters every hour. So, it will be 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 centimeters shorter! 

8 

"
"Hmm, so the book cost $19.50, but that's 'cause it was on sale!  It was 25% off, which means it was cheaper than the real price.

If it was 25% off, that means it was 75% of the real price.  

Let's see... if 75% is $19.50, then 100% would be a bit more.  

I think the real price was $26.00! 



"
"Okay, let's see... Marie spent $12 on chicken, $15 on milk, and $6 on apples. That's $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.  

She paid $50 in total, so the pizza cost $50 - $33 = $17.

Each pizza box costs $8.50, so she bought $17 / $8.50 = 2 boxes of pizza.


2 

"
"Okay, so Mishka bought three of each thing. Shorts cost $16.50, pants cost $22.50, and shoes cost $42.  

Let's see... three shorts cost 3 times $16.50, which is $49.50.

Three pants cost 3 times $22.50, which is $67.50.

Three shoes cost 3 times $42, which is $126.00.

Now we add it all up: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00


$243.00 

"
"Cynthia eats ice cream every day, so in 60 days, she'll eat 60 ice creams!

Each box has 15 ice creams, so she needs 4 boxes (60 / 15 = 4).

Each box costs $4.00, so 4 boxes cost $16.00 (4 x $4.00 = $16.00).


16.00 

"
"Henry biked 20 miles then stopped.  He stopped again 15 miles before the very end, which is at mile 45.  That means he biked 45 - 20 = 25 miles between his stops! 


25
"
"Okay, so the fancy shoes cost $33 and the other ones are double that, so they cost $33 times 2 which is $66.  Together they cost $33 plus $66 which is $99.  But the boots cost $5 more than that, so they are $99 plus $5 which is $104!


$104 

"
"Okay, so Darrell and Allen's ages are like parts of a cake cut into 18 slices. Darrell gets 7 slices, and Allen gets 11.  

If all the slices together make 162 years, then one slice is 162 divided by 18, which is 9 years.

Darrell is 7 slices, so he's 7 times 9, which is 63 years old.

Allen is 11 slices, so he's 11 times 9, which is 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 plus 10, which is 109 years old!


109 

"
"Okay, so Gunter's first friend says 80 jelly beans. The second friend says 20 more than half of 80, so that's 80 divided by 2 which is 40, then plus 20, so 60 jelly beans. The last friend says 25% more than 80, so that's like a quarter more. A quarter of 80 is 20, so that's 80 plus 20, which is 100 jelly beans.

To find the average, we add all the guesses together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Then we divide by 3 because there are three friends: 240 divided by 3 is 80.


80 

"
"Hmm, let's see... John has 10 doggies, and each one takes half an hour every day. So that's 10 times half an hour, which is 5 hours a day!  

And there are 7 days in a week, so he spends 5 times 7 hours, which is 35 hours a week taking care of all those pups!


35 

"
"Okay, so Gretchen has lots of coins!  She has 110 in total.  We know she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Hmm... that's tricky.

Let's see... if we take away 30 from the total, that's like taking away all the extra gold coins.  So 110 - 30 = 80. That means there are 80 silver and gold coins that are the same amount.

Since they're the same amount, we split that in half: 80 / 2 = 40. So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the gold coins, we add back those extra 30: 40 + 30 = 70.

Gretchen has 70 gold coins! 



"
"Okay, so Raymond has 40 jewels. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.  Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 divided by 2, which is 20.  So Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.


23 

"
"Mike played for a long time!  He got 4 points at first. Then he got even more points, 1 more than before. So that's 5 more points!  

In total, he got 4 + 5 = 9 points! 


9 

"
"Okay, so Terry eats 2 yogurts every day.  That's like 2 times 30, which is 60 yogurts for the whole month!

The yogurts are a good deal, 4 for $5.00.  So we gotta see how many times 4 goes into 60. That's 15 times!

So he buys 15 sets of yogurts, and each set costs $5.00.  

15 times $5.00 is... $75.00!


$75.00 

"
"John sold his Lego sets for money to buy video games. He had 13 Lego sets and sold them for $15 each. That's a lot of money! He bought 8 video games for $20 each and had $5 left over.  

Hmm... let's see. He had some money left, so he must have had more than enough to buy the video games.  He sold enough Lego sets to make $165 because $160 for the games plus $5 left over is $165.

If each Lego set costs $15, he sold 11 Lego sets because $165 divided by $15 is 11.

That means he has 2 Lego sets left because he started with 13 and sold 11.


2 

"
"Okay, so John runs a lot! He runs 60 miles every week. He runs three days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.  The other two days, he runs for half as long, so that's 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

That means he runs for 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 3 hours on the other two days.

So, in total, he runs for 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours every week.

To find out how fast he runs, we divide the total miles by the total hours: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

John runs 10 miles per hour! 


10
"
"Okay, so Dana skips at 3 miles per hour.  That means she runs twice as fast, so she runs at 6 miles per hour!  And she walks four times slower than she runs, so she walks at 1.5 miles per hour.

She runs for 2 hours and walks for 4 hours.  

When she runs, she goes 6 miles per hour times 2 hours, which is 12 miles.

When she walks, she goes 1.5 miles per hour times 4 hours, which is 6 miles.

So in total, she goes 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles! 


18
"
"Okay, so Suzy's phone is 1 year old. Ben's phone is twice as old as Suzy's, so it's 1 times 2 which is 2 years old. Brandon's phone is four times as old as Ben's, so it's 2 times 4 which is 8 years old! 

8 

"
"Okay, so Polly can throw the javelin super far with the shiny blue gem! She can throw it three times farther than normal, which is like throwing it 400 feet times 3, that's 1200 feet!  The dragon's fire only goes 1000 feet, so Polly can stand 200 feet away and still hit it! 


200 

"
"Grandma made a lot of pie! She had 5 pies and each one had 8 slices. That's 5 times 8, which is 40 slices in total.  

If there were 14 slices left, then the guests ate 40 minus 14, which is 26 slices.


26 

"
"Okay, so the chips have 250 calories in each serving, and there are 5 servings in the whole bag. That means the whole bag has 250 x 5 = 1250 calories.

You can only have 200 more calories today, and you've already had 1800.  

Each serving is 300 grams / 5 servings = 60 grams.

Hmm, let's see... if you can only have 200 calories, and each serving is 250 calories, you can only have a little bit of a serving.  

So, you can probably eat about 48 grams of chips. 



"
"Okay, so Charlie makes 10 candles from one pound of stuff. He needs enough stuff to make 20 candles, so that's two pounds of stuff.  The stuff costs $10 for each pound, so two pounds costs $20. He sells each candle for $2, and he's making 20 candles, so he makes $40. If he makes $40 and the stuff costs $20, then he makes a profit of $20!


$20.00 

"
"Okay, so Meredith writes lots of articles about being healthy!

Each article takes her 4 hours. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. On Tuesday, she wrote more, like 2 extra than Monday, so that's 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

Then on Wednesday, she wrote double the amount from Tuesday, so that's 7 x 2 = 14 articles.

In total, she wrote 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 26 x 4 = 104 hours writing! 


104 

"
"Candice had 80 Post-it notes, and she used 220 at work.  That's 80 plus 220, which is 300. She had 23 left over, so she must have bought 300 - 23 = 277 Post-it notes!


277 

"
"John buys lots of ties! He gets twice as many red ones as blue ones. The red ones cost more, like 50 cents extra for every dollar.  He spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.  

Let's see... he bought 200 divided by 40, which is 5 blue ties. That means he got 5 times 2, which is 10 red ties.

The red ties cost $40 plus 50 cents for every dollar, so they cost $60 each.  

Ten red ties at $60 each is 10 times 60, which is $600.

So, all together he spent $200 on blue ties plus $600 on red ties, which is $800! 


$800
"
"Hmm, let's see... Tracy had a wire that was 4 feet long.  That's like 48 inches because there are 12 inches in every foot. She cut the wire into little pieces that were 6 inches long.  So, if we count by sixes, we can see how many pieces she got: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48.

She got 8 pieces! 



"
"Okay, so there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 apartments. That's 15 times 8, which is 120 apartments in total. But only three-quarters of them have people living in them.  That means 120 divided by 4 is 30, and then 30 times 3 is 90 apartments with people.  So, 120 minus 90 is 30 apartments that are empty.


30 

"
"Okay, so Lloyd has lots of chickens that lay eggs! They lay 252 eggs every day.  He sells them for $2 for every group of 12 eggs.  

Let's see... there are 7 days in a week, so that's 252 times 7, which is 1764 eggs every week!

Now, how many groups of 12 are in 1764? Hmm, that's a bit tricky.  Let me count by twelves... 12, 24, 36...  Oh, it's 147 groups of 12!

Since each group sells for $2, he makes 147 times 2, which is $294 every week!


294 

"
"Okay, so Tom goes 10 miles every hour for 3 hours. That's 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 miles!

Then he goes back slower, only 6 miles every hour.  

To go 30 miles at 6 miles an hour, it takes him 30 / 6 = 5 hours.


5 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Uriah needs to take out 15 pounds. His comic books are light, only a quarter pound each. He's taking out 30 of those, so that's 30 times a quarter... which is 7 and a half pounds!  That means he still needs to take out 7 and a half more pounds. His toys are heavier, half a pound each. So, he needs to take out 7 and a half divided by half... that's 15 toys! 


15 

"
"Okay, so the mechanic fixes truck tires for $60 each and car tires for $40 each.

On Thursday, he fixes 6 truck tires, so that's 6 times $60, which is $360. He also fixes 4 car tires, so that's 4 times $40, which is $160.  If we add those together, he made $360 + $160 = $520 on Thursday.

On Friday, he only fixes car tires, 12 of them! That's 12 times $40, which is $480.

To see how much more he made on the busier day, we do $520 - $480 = $40.


So the answer is $40. 

"
"Let's see... they brought home 7 kittens.  Patchy had 7 times 3 kittens, so that's 21 kittens! Trixie had 12 kittens.  So all together, that's 21 plus 12 plus the 7 they brought home... that's 40 kittens! 


40 

"
"Jean has 30 lollipops, but she eats 2. That means she has 28 left.  If she puts 2 lollipops in each bag, she can make 14 bags! 


14
"
"Hmm, let's see... Peter needs $7 for a ticket and $7 for popcorn, so that's $7 + $7 = $14 for each movie.

He has $42, so he can go to the movies $42 / $14 = 3 times! 


3 

"
"Okay, so the truck can carry 5000 pounds, but it already has 3755 pounds in it. That means it can carry 5000 - 3755 = 1245 more pounds.

Each box weighs 15 pounds, so we can fit 1245 / 15 = 83 boxes on the truck!


83 

"
"Okay, so Stephen's groceries cost $40.00. Then they added a fee, which is like extra money, because it was delivered. That fee was 25% of $40.00, and that's $10.00.  

Then they added $3.00 for bringing it to his house. So now it's $40.00 + $10.00 + $3.00 = $53.00.

But wait, Stephen was nice and gave a $4.00 tip! So the final price is $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.


$57.00 

"
"Let's see... six groups of raspberries with twenty in each group is...  6 times 20 is 120 raspberries!  And then there are 67 more raspberries just hanging out.  So, 120 plus 67 is... 187 raspberries! 


187 

"
"Let's see... there are 25 oranges in total. One is bad, 5 are unripe, and 2 are sour.  That's 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges that aren't good.

So, 25 - 8 = 17 oranges are good! 


17 

"
"Okay, so Janet spent $500 on stuff for the brooch and then $800 for someone to make it. That's $500 + $800 = $1300.

Then she had to pay extra for insurance, which was 10% of $1300.  10% is like one tenth, so that's $1300 / 10 = $130.

So in total, she paid $1300 + $130 = $1430.


$1430 

"
"Okay, so Marcy works for a long time, 40 years!  If she stays that long, she gets $50,000 every year. But she gets extra money after 20 years. It's like a bonus! It's 5% of the $50,000 every year.  She leaves after 30 years, so she gets the bonus for 10 years.  

That means she gets $50,000 plus the bonus every year.  The bonus is $50,000 times 0.05, which is $2,500. So, her total is $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500 every year!


$52,500 

"
"Okay, so Aleena pays $140 every month. That's like, a lot of money! For half the year, she pays that much, so that's $140 times 6 months, which is $840.

Then, the price goes down by 10%, which is like a little discount.  So, she pays $140 minus $14, which is $126 every month for the other half of the year.

That means for the other six months, she pays $126 times 6, which is $756.

To find out how much she paid all year, we add the two amounts: $840 plus $756, which is $1596.



"
"Sophia drove 100 miles and needed 4 gallons to fill her tank back up.  That means her car goes 25 miles for every gallon! Her tank holds 12 gallons, so she can drive 25 times 12, which is 300 miles!


300 

"
"Okay, so Jim watches TV for 2 hours. Then he reads for 1 hour because that's half the time of watching TV.  So that's 2 + 1 = 3 hours every day.

He does this 3 times a week, so that's 3 hours/day * 3 days = 9 hours a week.

Over 4 weeks, it's 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours!

"Okay, so each school has 2 teams with 5 players each, so that's 10 players. And they also have 2 coaches, so that's 12 people from each school.  There are 4 schools, so 12 times 4 is 48! 

48 

"
"Okay, so there were 175 sparkly diamonds!  There were 35 less rubies than diamonds, so that's 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.  Then there were twice as many emeralds as rubies, so that's 140 x 2 = 280 emeralds.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 gems! 


595 

"
"There are 120 boys 'cause there's twice as many boys as girls.  That's 120 boys plus 60 girls, which is 180 kids in total.  If there are 5 kids for every teacher, there must be 36 teachers! 



"
"Bailey got $5 every week for 8 weeks, so that's $5 x 8 = $40.

If she has $100 now, and $40 was from her allowance, she must have started with $100 - $40 = $60.


$60 

"
"Okay, so Judy teaches a lot of dance!  

She teaches 5 classes each day from Monday to Friday, that's like 5 times 5, which is 25 classes! Then she teaches 8 more on Saturday. So that's 25 plus 8, which is 33 classes in a whole week.

Each class has 15 kids, so that's 33 times 15, which is 495 kids in total.

Each kid pays $15, so Judy makes 495 times 15 dollars, which is... hmm... let me count that up... $7425.00! 


$7425.00
"
"The second recipe has 20 * 2 = 40 instructions.

That means Kelian has to read 20 + 40 = 60 instructions in total!

"
"Okay, so Tommy sells brownies for $3 each and he sells 43 of them. That's 43 times 3, which is... hmm... let me count... 129 dollars!

Then he sells cheesecake for $4 a slice and he sells 23 slices. So that's 23 times 4...  let's see... that's 92 dollars!

Now we add the brownie money and the cheesecake money: 129 plus 92 is... 221 dollars!

Tommy raises $221! 



"
"Okay, so Shiela buys five phones, and each one costs $150. That's like 150, 150, 150, 150, 150... so that's 5 times 150, which is 750 dollars.

But wait, there's interest! It's 2% for each phone.  Hmm, 2% of 150... that's like 2 out of every 100, so it's 3 dollars more for each phone.

Since she buys five phones, that's 3 dollars extra for each one, times 5 phones, so that's 15 dollars more in total.

So, the phones cost 750 dollars, and she has to pay 15 dollars extra, making it 765 dollars in all.

Now, she pays for it over 3 months, so we divide 765 dollars by 3 months. That's 255 dollars each month!


Answer: 255 

"
"Okay, so Artie sells marigolds for $3, petunias for $2, and begonias for $2.

He sells 12 marigolds, so that's 12 times $3, which is $36.

He sells 9 petunias, so that's 9 times $2, which is $18.

He sells 17 begonias, so that's 17 times $2, which is $34.

Now we add it all up: $36 + $18 + $34 = $88


88 

"
"Okay, so Luke's sandcastle gets smaller on top. The top is 16 squares. Then the one under it is double that, so it's 32!  The next one is double 32, so that's 64. And the bottom one is double 64, which is 128.

If we add all those up, it's 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 squares in total.

Since there are 4 levels, we divide the total squares by 4: 240 / 4 = 60.

So each level has an average of 60 squares. 


60 

"
"Okay, so Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 1 cup of food a day for 180 days. That's a lot of days! Then she needs to feed it 2 cups a day for the rest of the year.  

Let's see... there are 365 days in a year, so that's 365 minus 180 days, which is 185 days left.  

So, for those 185 days, she needs 2 cups a day, so that's 185 times 2, which is 370 cups!

In total, she needs 180 cups plus 370 cups, which is 550 cups.

Each bag has 110 cups, so she needs 550 divided by 110, which is 5 bags!


5 

"
"Okay, so Sarah washes a lot of clothes, 400 pounds! Raymond washes half as much as Sarah, so he washes 400 divided by 2, which is 200 pounds. David washes way less, only a fourth of what Sarah washes. That means he washes 400 divided by 4, which is 100 pounds.  

So, Raymond washes 200 pounds and David washes 100 pounds. That means Raymond washes 200 minus 100, which is 100 more pounds than David.


100 

"
"Okay, so Vincent wants to buy lots of flowers!  

He can get 3 flowers for $2.50, or 2 flowers for $1.  Hmm, let's see... if he buys the packs of 3, that's 6 packs for 18 flowers, and that costs $15.  But if he buys the packs of 2, that's 9 packs for 18 flowers, and that only costs $9.

Wow, he saves $6 if he buys the packs of 2!


$6.00 

"
"Okay, so the groomer costs a hundred dollars, but John gets a discount 'cause he's new!  It's 30% off, so that's like 30 out of every 100 dollars.  Hmm... 30 dollars off means he pays 70 dollars!


$70 

"
"Okay, so they started with 24 liters of water.  The girls each got 1/6 of it, so that's like splitting the water into 6 parts and each girl gets one part.  That's 24 divided by 6, which is 4 liters each.  So they used 4 liters times 2 girls, which is 8 liters.

Then the boy got 6 liters.  So in total, they used 8 liters plus 6 liters, which is 14 liters.

That means there's 24 liters minus 14 liters left, which is 10 liters!

"
"Okay, so Charlie starts with 10 stickers. Then he gets lots more! 21 from the store and 23 for his birthday.  Wow, that's 21 + 23 = 44 stickers!

Now he has 10 + 44 = 54 stickers.

Uh oh, he gives 9 to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

He uses some for a card, 28 of them. That leaves him with 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.


17 

"
"Okay, so Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs a little less than four times that.  Let's see... four times Grace's weight is 125 times 4, which is 500 pounds. But Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so he weighs 498 pounds.

To find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.


623 

"
"Hmm, let's see... 3 bushes with 25 roses on each... that's a lot of roses!  And each rose has 8 pointy thorns.  

So, we gotta do some counting! 3 times 25 is 75 roses.  Then 75 times 8 is... 600!

There are 600 thorns in total. 



"
"Hmm, let's see... They played 22 games, and won more than they lost.  If they won 8 more games than they lost, that means they won a lot!  

Let me count it out...  

They won 15 games! 



"
"Gene goes on four trips every year and he's been doing that since he was 23. Now he's 34, so that's 34 - 23 = 11 years of trips!

He goes on four trips each year, so that's 11 years * 4 trips/year = 44 trips in total.

That means he has 44 t-shirts to make quilt blocks!


44 

"
"Okay, so Greg's alarm rings a lot! First, it rings 4 times. Then it rings 3 times longer, so that's 4 times times 3, which is 12 times!  The last time it rings for half as long as the second time, so that's 12 times divided by 2, which is 6 times.  

Let's add it all up: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times!


22 

"
"Okay, so Sylvie gets $600 every month.  

After five years, she gets a raise of 10% of $600, which is like 10 cents for every dollar. So that's $60 more! Now she makes $660 a month.

The next year, she gets another raise of 10% of $660, which is $66 more. Now she makes $726 a month.

And the year after that, she gets another raise of 10% of $726, which is $72.60 more. Now she makes $798.60 a month!

So after three more years, Sylvie makes $798.60 every month. 



"
"Hmm, let's see... Marilyn sold way more than Harald.  If they sold 88,000 all together, and Marilyn sold 10 times more than Harald, Harald must have sold a smaller number.  

I think Harald sold 8,000 copies. 



"
"Okay, so Christina invited 16 friends, but some might not come. She needs enough for 3/4 of them, which is like 12 friends.  She needs 3/4 of a bag for each friend, so that's like 9 bags. Each bag costs $2, so she'll spend 9 times 2, which is $18.


$18 

"
"Okay, so the grown-up dinosaurs eat a whole lotta potato salad, 10 pounds each!  And the little dinos eat half of that, so they eat 5 pounds.  There are 20 big dinos, so that's 20 times 10 pounds, which is 200 pounds of potato salad!  And for the 5 little dinos, it's 5 times 5 pounds, which is 25 pounds.  

So, Ted needs 200 plus 25 pounds, which is 225 pounds of potato salad! 


225 

"
"Okay, so Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, so Jan has 6 x 3 = 18 pets.  

To find the total, we add up all the pets: 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.

"
"Lee is super fast! He runs the hurdles in 38 seconds. Gerald is a little slower, but he started eating healthy food and got better. Now he runs 10% faster.  

If Lee runs in 38 seconds, and Gerald was 2 seconds slower, that means Gerald used to take 40 seconds.  

10% of 40 seconds is 4 seconds faster, so now Gerald can run in 36 seconds! 


36 

"
"Okay, so there are 60 doggies.  And for every doggy, there are 2 kitties, so that's 60 times 2, which is 120 kitties!

That means there are 60 doggies plus 120 kitties, which is 180 doggies and kitties all together.

But there are 12 less bunnies than doggies and kitties, so there are 180 minus 12, which is 168 bunnies.

To find the total number of pets, we add up all the animals: 168 bunnies plus 180 doggies and kitties equals 348 pets!


348 

"
"Okay, so there are 200 kids in total.  Two-fifths of them are boys, so that's 80 boys. That means there are 120 girls.  Two-thirds of the girls are in girl scouts, so that's 80 girls.  That leaves 40 girls who aren't in girl scouts.


40 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Harry slept for 9 hours. James slept for two-thirds of that, so that's like cutting Harry's sleep into three parts and taking two of them.  Two-thirds of 9 is 6.  So James slept for 6 hours.

That means Harry slept 3 more hours than James! 


3 

"
"Okay, so Freda makes sauce and it gets smaller when she cooks it.  She used 32 ounces of sauce, and each can makes 8 ounces. That means she used 32 / 8 = 4 cans.

Each can has 3 tomatoes, so she used 4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes!


12 

"
"There were 30 cars at first, and 5 went a different way. That leaves 25 cars. Then 20 cars went through the jam later, so 5 cars must have gone through first!

"
"Mary starts with 2 plants on each of her 40 window ledges, so that's 2 x 40 = 80 plants.

She gives away 1 plant from each ledge, so she gives away 40 plants.

That means she has 80 - 40 = 40 plants left.

Then she gets 18 more plants, so she has 40 + 18 = 58 plants.


58 

"
"Okay, let's count the doorbell rings!

* The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times.
* The second friend rang it 5 more times than the first friend, so that's 20 + 5 = 25 times.
* The third friend rang it 10 more times than the fourth friend, who rang it 60 times. So the third friend rang it 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now let's add up all the rings: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 rings! 


175 

"
"Okay, so Solo has to read lots of pages! Let's see... 4 plus 20 plus 7 plus 8 is 39 pages. He already read 15, so he has 24 more to go.  He has 4 more days, so he needs to read 24 divided by 4... that's 6 pages each day!

"
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. That's 3 glasses a day! And he has one more before bed, so that's 4 glasses a day.

He does this from Monday to Friday, so that's 4 glasses a day times 5 days, which is 20 glasses!

On the weekend, he has soda with dinner, so he only drinks 3 glasses of water each day. That's 3 glasses a day times 2 days, which is 6 glasses.

Let's add it all up: 20 glasses from the week plus 6 glasses from the weekend is 26 glasses!

"
"Hmm, let's see... the fog goes 3 miles every 10 minutes.  The city is 42 miles wide.  

So, it's like the fog has to go 3 miles, then another 3 miles, and so on until it covers the whole city.

That's 42 miles divided by 3 miles... which is 14 times!

And since each 3 miles takes 10 minutes, it'll take 14 times 10 minutes...

That's 140 minutes! 


140 

"
"Okay, so Poppy puts down 250 pieces because 1000 divided by 4 is 250.  Then there are 750 left. Mommy puts down 250 more, so now there are 500 pieces left to put in!

"Cody eats a lot of cookies! If Amir eats 5, and Cody eats three times that, then Cody eats 15 cookies.  That means they eat 15 + 5 = 20 cookies together!


20 

"
"Okay, so John has three boxes. Each box is 5 by 6 by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. That means the inside is smaller.  

If we take away 1 inch from each side, the inside is 3 by 4 by 2 inches.

To find how much space is inside one box, we multiply: 3 times 4 times 2 is 24.

Since he has three boxes, we multiply that by 3: 24 times 3 is 72.

"
"Okay, let's see... Frankie watched TV for a long time!

He watched 1 hour of TV on Monday and Tuesday, so that's 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

On Thursday, he watched 1 hour plus a half hour show, so that's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched 2 hours of TV.

That's 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours in total.

He watched 7 hours all together, so he must have watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours on Wednesday.

Each show on Wednesday was 30 minutes long, so he watched 1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per show = 3 shows on Wednesday.

"
"Okay, so Henry has 110 cookies now, but he dropped 5.  That means he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies before he dropped them.

He baked 15 extra cookies, so before that he had 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Last year he baked half that amount, so he baked 100 / 2 = 50 cookies last year.


50 

"
"Okay, so the gas costs $3.00 for each gallon, and they buy 10 gallons. That's 3 times 10, which is 30 dollars.  But they get 20 cents back for each gallon, and they got 10 gallons, so that's 20 cents times 10, which is 2 dollars back! So the gas costs 30 dollars minus 2 dollars, which is 28 dollars.


$28.00 

"
"Let's see... Beatrice ate 2 times 24 roll-ups, which is 48 roll-ups! Marcell ate 3 times 14 roll-ups, which is 42 roll-ups.  

If we add them together, they ate 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups!

Since there are two of them, they ate an average of 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups each.


45 

"
"Okay, so Julia's boat is leaking.  For every 10 feet she rows, 2 liters of water come in.  It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, and it takes 64 seconds to get to shore.

Let's see... if it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, then it takes her 32 seconds to row 40 feet, and 48 seconds to row 60 feet.  That means it takes her 64 seconds to row 80 feet to shore.

So, she rows 80 feet, and every 10 feet is 2 liters of water.  That's 8 groups of 10 feet, so the boat takes on 8 times 2 liters, which is 16 liters of water.


16 

"
"Hmm, let's see...  Each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times a day, and they clean it 3 times each time they use it. So that's 2 times 3, which is 6 times for each teacher.  And there are 4 teachers, so 6 times 4 is... 24!

"Okay, so Jamal's phone holds lots of pictures, 1800! That's way more than Brittany's phone. Brittany's phone can only hold 300 pictures.  

And those 300 pictures are like, 50 times more than the ducks in Jamal's picture. So, Jamal must have taken a picture of 6 ducks!

"
"Okay, so Sasha has some leftover wood she wants to sell.  

The 2x4s cost her $10 each, and she has ten of them. That's 10 times 10, which is $100.

The 4x4s cost $16 each, and she has five of them. That's 16 times 5, which is $80.

So all together, the wood cost her $100 + $80, which is $180.

Now, the wood is worth more because prices went up. The 2x4s are now worth $15 each, so she can sell them for 10 times 15, which is $150.

The 4x4s are now worth $24 each, so she can sell them for 5 times 24, which is $120.

That means she can sell all the wood for $150 + $120, which is $270.

If she sells it all, she makes $270 - $180, which is $90!


$90 

"
"Okay, so Katy uses 7 teaspoons of sugar for every 13 cups of water.  If she used 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water all together,  I think we need to figure out how many times 20 (7+13) fits into 120.  That's 6!  

So, she used 6 groups of 7 teaspoons of sugar, which is 42 teaspoons!


Answer: 42 

"
"Okay, so John has 3 kids, and he buys each kid 2 shoes. That's 3 times 2, which is 6 shoes!

Each shoe costs $60, so 6 shoes cost 6 times $60.  

Hmm... 6 times 6 is 36, and then we add another zero... so it's $360! 


$360
"
"Hmm, let's see...

They had 10 cars at first, right?  'Cause 2 containers times 5 cars in each is 10.

Then they had 30 cars all together. So that means they got 20 more cars.

If each container has 5 cars, then they got 4 more containers! 



"
"Okay, so Adrien made $40000 four years ago. His salary went up by 40%, so now he makes $40000 plus 40% of $40000.  That's like adding another $16000 to his old salary, so now he makes $56000.

Lylah made less than Adrien, but we don't know how much.  We know Adrien made 30% more than her, so if we figure out what 30% of Lylah's salary is, we can add it to her salary to get Adrien's old salary.

Since Adrien made $40000 four years ago, and that's 30% more than Lylah, we can figure out Lylah's salary.

Let's see... if Adrien's salary is 130% of Lylah's, then Lylah's salary is 100%.  We know 130% is equal to $40000, so 100% is a little less.

If we divide $40000 by 1.3, we get Lylah's salary, which is about $30769.

Now, Lylah's salary also went up by 30% over four years. So, we add 30% of $30769 to her old salary. That's like adding another $9230.

So, Lylah now makes $30769 + $9230 = $40000.

Finally, to find the total salary, we add Adrien's new salary and Lylah's new salary: $56000 + $40000 = $96000.



$96000
"
"Miguel uses 2 pads a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So that's 2 times 30, which is 60 sheets every week.

In a month, there are 4 weeks, so he uses 60 times 4 sheets.  That's 240 sheets! 


240 

"
"Morisette has 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael has twice the apples, so that's 5 times 2 which is 10 apples! He has half the oranges, so that's 8 divided by 2 which is 4 oranges.

Let's add all the apples: 5 + 10 = 15 apples.

Now the oranges: 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Finally, all the fruits together: 15 + 12 = 27 fruits!


27 

"
"Okay, so Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. Then she slept 2 hours less each night for the next two days, so that's 8 - 2 = 6 hours each night.  That's 6 + 6 = 12 hours for those two days.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so that's 6 + 1 = 7 hours each night.  There are 4 more days in the week, so that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now let's add up all the hours: 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

So Sadie slept for 48 hours in total! 



"
"Rosie runs super fast for the first 3 hours! That's 10 miles every hour, so she runs 30 miles. Then she slows down a bit, but still runs 5 miles every hour for the rest of the time.  That's 4 more hours, so she runs another 20 miles.  

If you add them up, she runs a total of 50 miles! 



"
"Jennie put stamps on some letters. Now there are 30 letters with stamps. She stamped 20 of them herself. That means there were 30 - 20 = 10 letters with stamps before.

"
"Julia had 12 spoons at the end. Her husband gave her 5 spoons, so before that she had 12 - 5 = 7 spoons.  She used 3 spoons for tasting, so she started with 7 + 3 = 10 spoons.

"
"Dylan bought lots of sausages! He got 38 chicken sausages. Then he got 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so that's 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.  

To find out how many sausages he has in total, we add the chicken and fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82 sausages!


82 

"
"Amy has 20 more friends than Lily, who has 50. So Amy has 20 + 50 = 70 friends.

Together they have 70 + 50 = 120 friends!

"
"Okay, so Dillon buys lots of stuff!

* Watermelons cost $45 each, and he gets 4, so that's 4 times $45, which is $180.
* Peppers are $15 each, and he gets 20, so that's 20 times $15, which is $300.
* Oranges are $40 each, and he gets 10, so that's 10 times $40, which is $400.

Now we add it all up: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

So Dillon spends $880 at the store. 



"
"Okay, so the hospital sees lots of people every day, right?  They see 500 people! And each person spends 24 minutes with the doctor.  

The doctors get paid $150 every hour, and the hospital charges people $200 every hour.  

Hmm, let's see... if we add up all the time the doctors spend with people, it's a lot of minutes!  Then we gotta figure out how much money the doctors make and how much the hospital makes.  

After doing all that math, the hospital makes $10,000! 



"
"Okay, so Nissa starts with 60 elves. Then some quit 'cause kids were yucky.  That's 60 divided by 3, which is 20 elves gone.  

So now she has 60 minus 20, which is 40 elves.

But then more elves quit 'cause kids kicked them! That's 10 more elves gone.

So 40 minus 10 is 30 elves left.


30 

"
"Okay, so Joseph spent $500 in May. Then in June, he spent $60 less, so that's $500 - $60 = $440.

To find the total, we add up what he spent both months: $500 + $440 = $940.

"Let's see... Pam rode the roller coaster twice and each ride costs 6 tickets, so that's 2 times 6 which is 12 tickets. Fred rode it 4 times, so that's 4 times 6 which is 24 tickets.  They both rode the luge twice, so that's 2 times 6 which is 12 tickets each.  So Pam used 12 + 12 = 24 tickets and Fred used 24 + 12 = 36 tickets. Together they used 24 + 36 = 60 tickets!

"Hmm, let's see... Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and then 4 times 6 is 24 miles on Tuesday. That's 4 + 24 = 28 miles!  If he walked 41 miles in total, then he walked 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday.


13 

"
"Okay, so Tom washes his car 4 times every month, and each time it costs $15.  

Let's see... there are 12 months in a year, so that's 4 times 12... which is 48 car washes in a whole year!

Now, if each car wash is $15, we gotta do 48 times 15...  

Hmm, that's a lot of counting!  

... It's $720! 



"
"Okay, so Brian had 20 games but lost some. That means he has 15 games now. Bobby has three times that many, but 5 less.  So, three times 15 is 45, and then we take away 5... that's 40!

40 

"
"Okay, so there are 27 unicorns, and one third are in Scotland. That's 27 divided by 3, which is 9 unicorns.  Then, two thirds of those are girls. So that's 9 divided by 3, which is 3, and then times 2, which is 6!

There are 6 girl unicorns in Scotland. 

"
"Okay, let's see...

Two subs cost 2 times $7.50, which is $15.00.

Two bags of chips cost 2 times $1.50, which is $3.00.

Two cookies cost 2 times $1.00, which is $2.00.

So, the food costs $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

Delivery is 20% of $20.00, so that's $4.00.

Now we add the tip, which is $5.00.

That makes the total $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00!


$29.00
"
"Mark took a long time on the first test! He only finished 40 questions, and there were 75.  On the second test, he only finished 30 out of 100.  That means he didn't finish 35 + 70 = 105 questions in total.


105 

"
"Okay, so there are 12 blue gumballs.  Four times that is 12 times 4, which is 48.  Then we add 22 more, so that's 48 plus 22, which is 70. There are 70 pink gumballs! 


70
"
"Hmm, let's see... There are 20 cars in total. 12 are automatic and 4 are manual.  That means 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 cars are semi-automatic.

So, 4 out of 20 cars are semi-automatic. That's like 20%! 


20 

"
"Okay, so there are lots of bees!  

We know there are 700 bees in total. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees. Hmm... that's tricky!

Let's see... if we think about it like groups, there's one group of queen bees, then a bigger group of baby bees that's twice as big, and then an even bigger group of worker bees that's twice as big as the baby bees.

I think there are 400 worker bees! 



"
"If Jordan worked instead of playing video games, he'd make $10 for each hour. He plays for 2 hours, so that's $10 x 2 = $20 a day.  In a week, that's $20 x 7 = $140!


140 

"
"Okay, so John buys some stuff. Milk and eggs are food, right?  Those cost 2 dollars and 3 dollars, so that's 5 dollars.  The other things are not food.  Those cost 3 dollars plus 3 dollars plus 4 dollars, so that's 10 dollars.  But wait, there's tax on those!  Ten percent of 10 dollars is 1 dollar. So those things really cost 11 dollars.  

Now we add it all up: 5 dollars plus 11 dollars is 16 dollars.


$16 

"
"Okay, so Kim has 8 clients in total.  Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach that cost $2 each, so that's $4 for bleach per client.  He also needs cloths that cost $5 per client. So for each client, it costs him $4 + $5 = $9.

For all 8 clients, it costs him $9 x 8 = $72.

He makes $92 each week, and it costs him $72, so his profit is $92 - $72 = $20.


$20 

"
"Okay, so John has a big field with lots of pineapples! He gets 100 pineapples from each part of his field, and he has 10 parts. That's 100 times 10, which is 1000 pineapples each time he picks them!

He picks them every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year. So he picks them 12 divided by 3 times, which is 4 times a year.

If he gets 1000 pineapples each time and picks them 4 times, he gets 1000 times 4 pineapples in a whole year. That's 4000 pineapples!


4000 

"
"Okay, so Johnny has one box with 500 Legos. Another box has three times that, so that's 500 times 3 which is 1500 Legos!  The last box has a quarter of the Legos from the first box, so that's 500 divided by 4, which is 125 Legos.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 Legos!

2125 

"
"Okay, so Debra saw 30 bees fly out at first. Then 15 bees came back.  Then a bunch more flew out, twice as many as the first time, so that's 30 bees times 2, which is 60 bees!  That means 90 bees flew out in total.  But all the bees came back home at the end, so 90 bees came back.


90 

"
"Brittany's mom paid for one big person ticket and one kid ticket. The big person ticket costs $12 and the kid ticket costs $10. That's $12 + $10 = $22.  

If she got $8 back, she must have given the cashier $22 + $8 = $30.


$30 

"
"Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. That's three times more than Dorothy.  So Dorothy has 12 / 3 = 4 friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so he has 4 * 4 = 16 friends.


16 

"
"Okay, so Steve bikes 3 miles and Tim goes 2 miles. Steve goes faster, but Tim gets to start first 'cause he's closer.  Steve bikes 440 feet every minute, and Tim goes 264 feet every minute.

Hmm... let's see... Steve has to go farther, so it'll take him longer. Tim will probably get home first, but by how much?

I think Tim will be waiting for Steve for 4 minutes! 



"
"Okay, so Shawnda charges 25 cents for each tire.  

Let's see... 5 bikes have 2 tires each, so that's 5 times 2 which is 10 tires.

Then there were 3 tricycles, and they have 3 tires each, so that's 3 times 3 which is 9 tires.

And one unicycle has 1 tire.

So that's 10 plus 9 plus 1, which is 20 tires in total!

She makes 25 cents for each tire, so she made 20 times 25 cents... hmm... that's 5 dollars!


$5.00 

"
"Carl has 60 cookies because 10 packs times 6 cookies in each pack is 60.  

That's 60 cookies times 10 cents each, so the cookies cost $6.00.

If Carl gives the cashier $10.00, he gets $4.00 back! 


$4.00
"
"Okay, so Dave had some fries, right? He ate 14, then a seagull took some. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so that's 14 divided by 2, which is 7 fries.  

Then there were some pigeons who ate fries too, 3 pigeons times 3 fries each is 9 fries gone.

A raccoon came and took a bunch too, like two-thirds of what was left.  That's tricky, but we can figure it out.

Then there was just one fry left for the ants!  

Let's see... if there were 5 fries left at the end, and the ants took one, there were 6 before that. Then add back the raccoon's fries... and the pigeons'... and the seagull's...  

Whew! I think there were 43 fries to start! 



"
"Okay, so Kimo has class three times a day on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.  That's like 3 times 1 hour, which is 3 hours each day.  And he has class two times a day on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but each class is 2 hours long. So that's 2 times 2, which is 4 hours each day.

Let's see... 3 hours plus 3 hours plus 3 hours is 9 hours for Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Then 4 hours plus 4 hours is 8 hours for Tuesdays and Thursdays.

That means he has 9 plus 8, which is 17 hours of class each week.

There are 16 weeks in a semester, so we do 17 times 16, which is 272 hours!


272 

"
"Okay, so Bill makes a lot of yummy stuff! Let's see... he makes 300 rolls, and each one is 4 inches long.  That's 300 times 4, which is 1200 inches!

Then he makes 120 croissants, and they're 6 inches each. So that's 120 times 6, which is 720 inches.

And he makes 60 baguettes, but those are tricky 'cause they're two feet long.  Two feet is the same as 2 times 12, which is 24 inches! So 60 baguettes is 60 times 24, which is 1440 inches.

Now we gotta add all those inches up: 1200 plus 720 plus 1440 is 3360 inches.

But the question wants to know how long it is in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we gotta divide 3360 by 12. That's 280 feet! 


280 

"
"Okay, so the monkeys eat 200 bananas each month, the gorillas eat 400, and the baboons eat 100. That's 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas every month!

But the zookeeper needs enough for two months, so he needs 700 x 2 = 1400 bananas. 


1400 

"
"Okay, so Blake runs back and forth a bunch of times, that's 15 times times 100 yards, so he runs 1500 yards! Kelly runs once back and forth, so that's 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back a lot, like 34 times!  That's 34 times 80 yards, which is 2720 yards.  So she runs 100 yards plus 2720 yards, which is 2820 yards total.

Kelly runs way farther than Blake! She runs 2820 yards and he runs 1500 yards, so she runs 1320 yards more than him!


1320 

"
"Let's see... he bought 4 pens at $1.50 each, so that's 4 times 1.50... which is 6 dollars.  Then he got 2 notebooks at $4 each, so that's 2 times 4... which is 8 dollars. And the paper was 20 dollars.  So all together, it's 6 plus 8 plus 20... that's 34 dollars!


34 

"
"Okay, so Finn starts with 11 tadpoles. Then he sees 6 more, so that's 11 plus 6... which is 17! But then 2 tadpoles hide, so we take away 2 from 17.  That means Finn can see 15 tadpoles now. 


15 

"
"Okay, so on Monday there's 17 feet of water. Then on Tuesday, they add more water, so now there's 17 + 7 = 24 feet of water!

But on Wednesday, some water goes away, and there's only two-thirds of the water left from Tuesday.  

Hmm, two-thirds of 24... that's like cutting the water into three equal parts and taking two of them.  

So, 24 divided by 3 is 8, and 8 times 2 is 16!


16 

"
"Let's count the fish!

Anakin caught 10 starfish + 6 seahorses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish

Locsin caught 5 starfish + 3 seahorses + 5 clownfish = 13 fish

Together they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish! 


32
"
"Okay, so the marbles start at $20. Then they go up by $4 every two months.  

Let's see... 36 months is a long time! That's like 18 times two months. So the price goes up $4 eighteen times.

That's $4 x 18 = $72 more!

So the marbles would cost $20 + $72 = $92! 


$92
"
"Okay, let's see...

There are 5 red cars and each costs $4, so that's 5 times 4 which is $20.

The doll costs the same as 3 action figures, and each action figure is $5. So 3 action figures cost 3 times 5 which is $15.

The doll also costs $15.

Now, let's add up everything: $20 for the cars + $15 for the doll + $15 for the action figures = $50!


50 

"
"If Jackie loses $35 for every hour she doesn't work, and she loses 3 hours, that's $35 x 3 = $105.  

The accountant costs $90.  

So, if she hires the accountant, she'll have $105 - $90 = $15 more. 


$15 

"
"Let's see... Elvira has €1500 and the computer stuff costs €1090 plus €157 plus €74 plus €102.  That's €1423 in total.

If we take €1500 and take away €1423, that leaves €77 for clothes! 


€77
"
"Hmmm... let's see. She needs 3 eggs for each flan, and she's making 15 flans. So that's 3 times 15... which is 45 eggs!

She gets 9 eggs each time she babysits. So, she needs to babysit 45 divided by 9...  That's 5 times!


5 

"
"Okay, so Seth is twice as old as Brooke.  That means if Brooke is 1 year old, Seth is 2 years old.

In two years, Brooke will be 3 and Seth will be 4.  

But we know that in two years, their ages added together will be 28.  Hmm, let's try bigger numbers.

If Brooke is 8, Seth is 16. In two years, Brooke will be 10 and Seth will be 18.  

10 plus 18 is 28! So Seth is 16 years old. 


16
"
"Ethel has $8. Jimmy has twice that amount plus $2 more. So, twice Ethel's money is $8 x 2 = $16.  Then we add $2, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.


$18 

"
"Pancho walks a lot!  He walks 20 miles each day, but on the weekend he only walks 10 miles each day.  So, let's see... 20 miles a day for 5 days is 100 miles. Then he walks 10 miles each day on Saturday and Sunday, so that's 20 more miles.  

100 plus 20 is 120!  Pancho walks 120 miles in a week. 



"
"Okay, so the hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times that, so it's $25 times 3 which is $75.  The pants cost the same as the middle number between the hat and jacket, so they cost $50.  If you add up the hat, jacket, and pants, it's $25 + $75 + $50 which equals $150.


$150 

"
"Let's count the legs!

The spiders have 8 legs each, and there are 80 of them, so that's 8 times 80, which is 640 legs!

The insects have 6 legs each, and there are 90 of them, so that's 6 times 90, which is 540 legs!

The mutant bugs have 10 legs each, and there are 3 of them, so that's 10 times 3, which is 30 legs!

Now let's add them all up: 640 plus 540 plus 30 equals 1210 legs!


1210 

"
"Okay, let's see...

Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age, so Sally Four is also 8. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so she's 8 times 2 which is 16. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so she's 16 plus 3, which is 19.

To find the total age, we add up all their ages: 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51


51 

"
"Okay, so Jessica has to pay $300 for school, $200 for her card, and $500 for her house, that's $1000 every month.

She wants to pay extra, like half again as much, so that's $500 more.

So every month she pays $1000 + $500 = $1500.

In a whole year, that's $1500 times 12 months, which is $18000! 



"
"Okay, so Billy has lots of potatoes! 60 of them!  Peeling each one takes a minute and a half, so that's like, 90 minutes just for peeling. Then he has to cut them, and that's only 5 seconds each.  Hmm, 5 seconds times 60 potatoes... that's 300 seconds!  But that's a lot of seconds, so let's see how many minutes that is... 300 divided by 60 is 5 minutes. So peeling takes 90 minutes and cutting takes 5 minutes.  That means it takes him 95 minutes to get all the potatoes ready! 


95 

"
"Lemons cost $3 for each big jug of lemonade. They made 5 jugs 'cause they made $25 and each jug makes them $5.  So they spent $3 x 5 = $15 on lemons!


$15 

"
"Hmm, let's see... There were 160 Chinese runners, and 60 of them were boys.  That means there were 100 girls on the Chinese team! 


100 

"
"Okay, so Zaid has $6000. He spends $1500 on his house and $2000 on his car. That's $3500 already gone.

Then he gives $1250 to charity.  So now he has $6000 - $3500 - $1250 = $1250 left.

He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700. That's $900 total.

So Zaid has $1250 - $900 = $350 left! 



"
"Okay, so Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 less than Bo, so Monic has 36 crabs. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 46 crabs.  

If you add them all up, 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs! 



"
"Okay, so Lloyd makes $10 for every hour he helps with math.  He helped for 5 hours the first week, so that's 10 times 5, which is 50 dollars!  The second week he helped for 8 hours, so that's 10 times 8, which is 80 dollars.  To find out how much he made in total, we add those together: 50 plus 80 is 130 dollars!


$130 

"
"The winner got lots of votes, 3 out of every 4!  If 80 kids voted, that means the winner got 60 votes.  So the loser got 20 votes.

"
"Okay, so Jan is 30 years old.  Jean is older than Mark, and Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age two years ago.  Hmm... let's see. Two years ago, Jan was 28. Half of 28 is 14.  Mark was 19 two years ago, so now he's 21.  Jean is two years older than Mark, so she's 23!


23 

"
"Okay, so one team is super fast and runs each part in 55 seconds. That's 55, 55, 55, 55, for a total of 220 seconds.

The other team is a little slower. The first person takes 60 seconds. Then they get faster by 3 seconds each time. So the second person takes 57, the third takes 54, and the last one takes 51.  If you add those up, it's 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

That means the faster team wins by 2 seconds! 


2 

"
"Okay, so Jerry has a die with six sides.  

If he wants a number bigger than 3, that's like getting a 4, 5, or 6. That's three numbers!

Getting two even numbers in a row is harder.  He needs to get an even number first, like a 2, 4, or 6. Then he needs to get another even number! That's trickier.

It seems like getting a number bigger than 3 is more likely.  I think it's 25% more likely! 



"
"Jenna's mommy picked 20 apples. Jenna picked half of that, so she got 10 apples.  If you add them together, they picked 30 apples! 


30 

"
"Okay, so there are 160 pieces of straw. The hamsters got 50 pieces and the bunnies got 20. That means the rats got 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw.

Each rat gets 6 pieces, so there are 90 / 6 = 15 rats.

The rats are in 3 cages, so there are 15 / 3 = 5 rats in each cage.

"
"Okay, so Mandy borrowed money from Benedict.  Every month, she has to pay a little extra, like a thank you for letting her borrow.

After three months, she has to pay back the money plus the extra thank yous. Let's see...

* First month: $100 + $2 = $102
* Second month: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04
* Third month: $104.04 + $2.08 = $106.12


Mandy should give Benedict $106.12. 

"
"Okay, so the trader buys the wheat for $20 a bag and it costs $2 more to move it. That means each bag costs him $22. He sells them for $30 each, so he makes $8 on every bag.  He made $400 profit, so he must have sold 50 bags! 



"
"Okay, so they spent $20.25 on tickets. Then they spent $4.50 less on food, so that's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

The rides cost $33 each, and they went on two, so that's $33 x 2 = $66.

To find out the total, we add up all the costs: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since there are three friends, they each pay $102 / 3 = $34. 


$34
"
"Hmm, let's see... John collects peaches for 3 whole hours.  And he gets 2 peaches every minute!  That's a lot of peaches!

So, 3 hours is like 3 times 60 minutes, which is 180 minutes.  

If he gets 2 peaches every minute, then he gets 2 peaches times 180 minutes...  

That's 360 peaches! Wow!


360 

"
"Okay, so the ducks need 3.5 pounds of bugs each week.  And there are ten ducks, so that's 3.5 times 10, which is 35 pounds of bugs for all of them!

But we need to know how much they need each day. There are 7 days in a week, so we do 35 divided by 7. That's 5 pounds of bugs every day!


5 

"
"Okay, so Tom starts with 50 trees. Every year he plants 10 more, but he chops down 2. So that's like adding 8 trees each year.

After 10 years, he planted 10 trees a year times 10 years, that's 100 trees! But he also chopped down 2 trees a year for 10 years, so that's 20 trees gone.

So he has 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees!

But wait, 30% of them die.  That's like 30 out of every 100 trees.  So 130 times 0.30 is 39 trees that die.

That means he has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.


91 

"
"Okay, so Sue starts with 18 pink flamingos. Then the neighbors take some away and paint them white. They take away 18 divided by 3, which is 6 flamingos.  That leaves 18 minus 6, which is 12 pink ones.  They add 6 white ones. Then on Sunday they add more pink ones! 18 more! So now there are 12 plus 18, which is 30 pink ones.  That means there are 30 minus 6, which is 24 more pink ones than white ones.


24 

"
"Violetta needs 5 crayons and each one costs $2. So, all the crayons will cost 5 times $2, which is $10.  She has $20, so she'll get $10 back!


$10 

"
"A pen costs the same as a pencil and an eraser together. The pencil costs a dollar twenty, and the eraser costs thirty cents. So a pen costs a dollar fifty.  If we want to buy eight pens, that's a dollar fifty times eight, which is twelve dollars! 


$12.00 

"
"If each restaurant gets 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants, that's 40 times 2, which is 80 pounds.  We start with 200 pounds, so 200 minus 80 is 120.

120 

"
"Hmm, let's see... there are lots of people in Soda!  

If there are 8417 men and 9092 women, that's a lot of grown-ups!  Let's add those together: 8417 + 9092 = 17509 grown-ups.

Now, we need to see how many people are left over.  We take the total number of people, 23786, and take away the grown-ups: 23786 - 17509 = 6277.

So there are 6277 kids in Soda! 



"
"Okay, so Elaine started with 20 cards. Then she got three times that, which is like 20 times 3, so that's 60 more!  

Then the next month she got 20 less than the 60, so that's 40 cards.

The third month she got double the amount from the first two months, so double 60 plus 40, which is 100. Double 100 is 200 cards!

So, she has all her starting cards plus all the new ones: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards! 


320
"
"Okay, so Mark edits 1000 sentences every week. He does half for Publisher A and half for Publisher B, so that's 500 sentences for each.

Publisher A gives him 5 cents for each sentence, so he makes 500 times 5 cents, which is 2500 cents.

Publisher B pays him double, so he gets 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, that's 500 times 10 cents, which is 5000 cents.

To find out how much he makes in total, we add the money from both publishers: 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.


7500 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Baldur gets 5 pails in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon. That's 5 + 6 = 11 pails a day!

Each pail has 5 liters, so he gets 11 x 5 = 55 liters of water every day.


55 

"
"Okay, so John got a big prize of $5000! That's awesome!

He also gets an extra $100 each week 'cause he's so good at his job.

If he makes $2000 each week, and now gets an extra $100, that's $2100 every week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so he makes $2100 times 52, which is $109,200.

Don't forget the prize money! So, all together he made $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200 that year.

"Okay, so Josie has 10 acres of grapes. Each acre gives her 5 big piles of grapes.  That's 10 times 5, which is 50 big piles!

Then, each big pile makes 2 barrels of yummy wine. So 50 piles times 2 barrels each is... 100 barrels! 


100 

"
"Okay, let's see... Carl eats 2 pieces of cheese on his sandwich every day, and he eats a sandwich every day for a whole week. So that's 2 times 7, which is 14 pieces of cheese!

He also eats omelets with cheese 3 times this week. Each omelet has one more piece of cheese than his sandwich, so that's 3 pieces of cheese.  

And then he used 8 pieces of cheese for his macaroni and cheese.

Let me add all those up: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 pieces of cheese! 


31 

"
"Okay, so Janet starts with 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. That's 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Then she buys lots of blue pens! Six bags with 9 pens in each bag is 6 times 9, which is 54 blue pens.

She also gets red pens, 2 bags with 6 pens in each, so that's 2 times 6, which is 12 red pens.

Now we add up all the pens: 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens!


98 

"
"Okay, so Brinley wants a 93 average, and she's already taken five tests.  To get 93, she needs 558 points total (93 times 6).  She already has 438 points (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86).  

So, she needs 120 more points on her last test! 



"
"Okay, so Micheal rides his bike a lot! 

First, he rides 5 times a week, and each time he goes 25 kilometers.  He does that for 4 weeks.  So that's 5 times 25, which is 125 kilometers every week. Then he does that for 4 weeks, so it's 125 times 4, which is 500 kilometers!

Then he changes things up and rides only 2 times a week, but goes farther each time, 60 kilometers! He does that for 3 weeks. So that's 2 times 60, which is 120 kilometers every week. And for 3 weeks, that's 120 times 3, which is 360 kilometers.

To find the total, we add up the kilometers from both parts: 500 plus 360 is 860 kilometers!


860 

"
"Okay, so Joe has lots of candy!  He has 25 chocolate bars and each one weighs 40 grams. That's like, a whole bunch of chocolate! He also has 80 candied apples, but those are lighter. Each chocolate bar is twice as heavy as an apple, so each apple weighs 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams.

So all the chocolate weighs 25 bars * 40 grams/bar = 1000 grams.

And all the apples weigh 80 apples * 20 grams/apple = 1600 grams.

To find the total weight, we add them together: 1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams.

That's a lot of candy!


2600 

"
"Okay, so Rose bought 4 cakes on Monday. Then on Tuesday, she bought 3 times that, so that's 4 times 3 which is 12 cakes!  Wow, that's a lot of cake! On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the amount from Tuesday, so that's 12 times 5 which is 60 cakes!  

To find out how many cakes she bought in total, we add them all up: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes! 


76 

"
"Okay, so twenty dozen cups cost less than some plates. The plates cost a lot, six thousand dollars for just half a dozen!  The cups cost twelve hundred dollars less than that, so they cost eighteen hundred dollars.  

That's a lot of cups! Twenty dozen is two hundred and forty cups.  If we split eighteen hundred dollars by two hundred and forty cups, each cup costs seven dollars and fifty cents.


$7.50 

"
"Okay, so Sara wants a jacket for $30 and two pairs of shoes that cost $20 each. That's $20 + $20 = $40 for the shoes.

So all together, everything costs $30 + $40 = $70.

She already has $10 and made $20 babysitting, so that's $10 + $20 = $30.

She needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

If she gets $4 for each lawn she mows, she needs to mow $40 / $4 = 10 lawns.


**Answer:** 10 

"
"Okay, so Jerry has some chickens that lay eggs. The red ones lay 3 eggs each day, and the white ones lay 5 eggs each day. He gets 42 eggs every day.  He also has two more white chickens than red chickens.  Hmm... let me think...

If we try starting with, like, 2 red chickens, that's only 6 eggs.  That's not enough.  What if we try 4 red chickens? That's 12 eggs.  Okay, so we need more eggs from the white chickens.  Since he has two more white chickens than red chickens, that means he has 6 white chickens.  

Let's see, 6 white chickens lay 30 eggs (6 times 5).  And 4 red chickens lay 12 eggs.  That's 42 eggs total!

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. 



"
"Okay, so Gary walks around a park that's like a big rectangle. It's 1.5 miles wide and 6 miles long.  He walks pretty fast, 3 miles every hour!

To figure out how long he walks, we gotta find out how far around the whole park is. That's like walking all the way around the edge.  

It's 1.5 miles plus 6 miles, and then we do that twice 'cause it's a rectangle. So, 1.5 + 6 = 7.5, and then 7.5 times 2 is 15 miles!

Now, he walks 3 miles every hour, and the park is 15 miles around. So, it takes him 15 divided by 3, which is 5 hours!


5 

"
"Okay, so Sloane saw 100 people on the first day. Then she saw 50 more on the second day, so that's 100 plus 50, which is 150 people!  

If she saw 500 people in total by the third day, and she already saw 100 plus 150, that means she saw 250 people on the third day! 


250 

"
"Okay, so the big pool is losing water just like the small pool, right?  They both lose 4 gallons every minute.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now it has four times as much. That means the big pool is losing water faster, even though they both lose the same amount each minute.

Hmm... that's tricky.  Let me think...

If the small pool has 'x' amount of water now, the big pool has 4 times that, so it has 4x.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much as the small pool, so it had 2x.

But wait, they both lost water!  The small pool lost 16 gallons (4 gallons a minute for 4 minutes), and the big pool lost 16 gallons too.

So, four minutes ago, the big pool had 2x + 16 gallons, and now it has 4x gallons.

That means 2x + 16 must be the same as 4x.

Let's see... if we take away 2x from both sides, we get 16 = 2x.

And if we divide both sides by 2, we get x = 8!

So the small pool has 8 gallons now. 



"
"Okay, so Lori needs $320 for the shoes and $32 for the belt. That's $320 plus $32, which is $352.

She makes $8 every hour.  To know how many hours she needs to work, we gotta see how many times $8 fits into $352.

Hmm... let's see... 8 goes into 35 four times, and 4 times 8 is 32.  Then we have 22 left over. 8 goes into 22 two times.

So, Lori needs to work 42 hours! 



"
"Okay, so Janeth borrowed money and has to pay some extra.  She pays a little bit each month.  Let's see... she pays $165 every month for a whole year, that's like 12 months. So she pays $165 times 12, which is $1980.  But she borrowed $2000 plus extra, so that's $2200 in total.  If she pays $1980, she still owes $220.


$220 

"
"There are 4 roses, and there are 7 more dahlias, so that's 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.  

That means there are 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers in total! 


15 

"
"Okay, so Harriet is 21 now.  Adrian is three times older than her, so he's 21 times 3 which is 63! Zack is twice as old as Harriet, so he's 21 times 2 which is 42.

In three years, Harriet will be 24, Adrian will be 66, and Zack will be 45.  

If you add those ages up, it's 24 plus 66 plus 45 which is 135.  Then you divide that by 3 because there are three people, and that's 45!


45 

"
"Okay, let's see...

Naomi got 68 points. Yuri got 10 more than half of Naomi's points, so that's 68 divided by 2, which is 34, plus 10 more, so Yuri got 44 points. Brianna got 17 more points than Naomi, so she got 68 plus 17, which is 85 points.

If we add up Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna's points, we get 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

That means Jojo got 251 - 197 = 54 points!


54 

"
"Let's see... she does crosswords for 10 minutes each and she did 3 of them, so that's 10 times 3 which is 30 minutes.  Then she does sudokus for 5 minutes each and she did 8 of those, so that's 5 times 8 which is 40 minutes.  

If we add those together, 30 plus 40 is 70 minutes.


70 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Celine had 120 liters of water, and she used 90 liters. That means she has 30 liters left.  Then she got 60 more liters of rainwater! So, 30 plus 60 is... 90 liters!


90 

"
"Andy has 90 geraniums. He plants 40 less petunias than geraniums, so he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.  

That means he plants 90 + 50 = 140 flowers in total! 


140 

"
"Okay, so they spent fifteen thousand dollars the first year. Then they spent one-third of that the next year, which is like splitting it into three groups and taking one.  One-third of fifteen thousand is five thousand dollars.  So, all together they spent fifteen thousand plus five thousand, which is twenty thousand dollars! 


$20000
"
"Okay, so Carlos pays 30 dollars for each hour with the canoe, and he uses it for 3 hours. That's 30 times 3, which is 90 dollars.

Benji pays 18 dollars each hour for the raft, and he uses it for 5 hours. So that's 18 times 5, which is also 90 dollars.

To find out how much they pay together, we add 90 and 90.  90 plus 90 is 180 dollars.


180 

"
"It takes 6 days on the bus. The car is faster, so it only takes 3 days.  Going there and back is 6 + 3 = 9 days! 


9 

"
"Okay, so James has lots of Pokemon cards!  

He starts with 30 fire, 20 grass, and 40 water.  Then he loses some water ones, 8 of them.  That means he has 32 water cards left.

He also gets more grass cards, 14 more! So now he has 34 grass cards.

To find out the chance of picking a water card, we need to know how many cards he has in total.  That's 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards!

So, out of 96 cards, 32 are water. That's like 32 out of every 100, which is about 33%!


33 

"
"Okay, let's see...

The burrito starts at $6.50. Then he adds stuff, so that's more money. Meat is $2.00, cheese is $1.00, avocado is $1.00, and two sauces are 25 cents each, so that's 50 cents.  

That's $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Oh, and he gets chips and a drink for $3.00 more! So now it's $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

But he has a gift card for $5.00!  So he takes that off... $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00


He still owes $9.00. 

"
"Kalinda puts in 4 pieces every minute. Her mom is slower and puts in 2 pieces every minute. Together, they put in 6 pieces every minute.  

The puzzle has 360 pieces, so it will take them 60 minutes to finish. That's one whole hour!


1 

"
"Okay, so there were 120 watermelons. Ashlyn took 30 of them, so there were 120 - 30 = 90 left. Then she took 3/4 of those, which is like taking 3 groups of 20, so that's 60 more.  That means 90 - 60 = 30 watermelons weren't ready yet.


**Answer:** 30 

"
"Okay, so Mark buys twelve cars, and each one costs twenty thousand dollars. That's a lot of money!  

So, twelve times twenty thousand is two hundred forty thousand dollars. But wait, there's more! He has to pay ten percent tax on that. Ten percent of two hundred forty thousand is twenty-four thousand dollars.

So now it's two hundred forty thousand plus twenty-four thousand, which is two hundred sixty-four thousand dollars.

But hold on, there's even more! He has to pay a thousand dollars to register each car.  Twelve times a thousand is twelve thousand dollars.

So, all together, it's two hundred sixty-four thousand plus twelve thousand, which is two hundred seventy-six thousand dollars! 


$276,000
"
"Kylie got 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, she got twice as many as Monday, so she got 25 x 2 = 50 shells!


50 

"
"There were 50 ants and half that many bugs, so there were 50 / 2 = 25 bugs.  That means there were 50 + 25 = 75 insects in all!


75 

"
"Okay, so there were 36 penguins, and some went swimming and some went to eat.  

One-third went swimming, so that's 36 divided by 3, which is 12 penguins.

Another one-third went to eat, so that's 12 more penguins gone.

That means 12 penguins plus 12 penguins is 24 penguins who aren't sunbathing anymore.

If 24 penguins left, and there were 36 to start, then 36 minus 24 is 12 penguins still sunbathing! 


12 

"
"Okay, so Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes every day. His girlfriend eats half as many, so she eats 3. That's 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes a day for both of them.

A vine grows 3 tomatoes each week.  They need enough tomatoes for a whole week, so that's 9 tomatoes a day times 7 days, which is 63 tomatoes.

To get 63 tomatoes, they need 63 / 3 = 21 vines.


21 

"
"Hmm, let's see... 20 friends want 4 slices each, so that's 20 times 4... which is 80 slices!  Each pizza has 8 slices, so John needs to buy 80 divided by 8... that's 10 pizzas!


10 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Ram has 25 pens.  He can use 5 empty pens to make a new one. So, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens!

That means he has 25 + 5 = 30 pens in total!


30

"Okay, so Jessa is 20. Joan is 5 years older, so she's 25. Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so she's 23.  If you add them all up, 20 + 25 + 23 = 68. 


68 

"
"Okay, so there were 1000 kids in the hall.  First, 300 kids left from door A. That leaves 700 kids. Then, 420 kids left from door B.  That means 280 kids left from door C! 



"
"John has 54 candies, and that's twice as many as Robert. So Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so he has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James. 


21
"
"Dolly has two books and Pandora has one. If they share, Dolly gets to read three books (her two plus Pandora's one). Pandora also gets to read three books (her one plus Dolly's two).  So together they read six books!

"
"Okay, so Mike had 5 friends he wrote to, but he stopped writing to 2 of them. That means he writes to 3 friends now.

Each friend sends 2 letters a week, and each letter has 5 pages. So that's 2 letters * 5 pages = 10 pages from each friend.

He has 3 friends, so that's 10 pages/friend * 3 friends = 30 pages he gets.

He writes the same amount back, so that's another 30 pages.

In total, that's 30 pages + 30 pages = 60 pages he writes and gets every week.

He writes one page every 6 minutes, so 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes of writing.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he writes for 360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours every week. 


6 

"
"Okay, so Jason talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day, and that's 15 times 30 days, which is 450 minutes. He also talked for another 300 minutes.  That's a lot of talking!  So, 450 plus 300 is 750 minutes.  He started with 1000 minutes, so he has 1000 minus 750 minutes left.  That's 250 minutes!


250 

"
"Okay, so Griffin started with 24 fries. Kyle took 5, and Billy took 10 because that's twice as many as Kyle.  That's 15 fries gone!

So Griffin had 9 fries left. Then Colby took 2 fries, so Griffin had 7 fries.

To get to 27 fries, Ginger must have given him 20 fries! 



"
"Okay, so there's lots of snails! One tank has 4 and the other has 32. That's a difference of 28 snails!  The problem says that difference is the same as double the number of fish in each tank.  So if we split those 28 snails in half, that tells us there are 14 fish in each tank. 


14 

"
"Okay, so the makeup lady charges a lot! Two hundred and fifty dollars every hour! And it takes six hours each day to do Jean's makeup.  That's two hundred and fifty times six, which is fifteen hundred dollars a day!

She needs it done four times a week, so that's fifteen hundred times four, which is six thousand dollars every week!

The movie takes five weeks, so it's six thousand times five, which is thirty thousand dollars!

But the makeup lady gives Jean a discount because it's a lot of makeup. Ten percent off means three thousand dollars off!

So Jean pays thirty thousand minus three thousand, which is twenty-seven thousand dollars! 


$27000
"
"Okay, so Isabelle spent money on lots of things for the party.  Let's see... cake stuff cost $12, presents were $43, decorations were $15, invitations were $4, and goodie bags were $22.  

To find out how much everyone pays, we add all that up: $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Then we split that between Isabelle and her two parents, so that's three people: $96 / 3 = $32


Each person pays $32. 

"
"Okay, so the chef has 4 bags of onions, and each bag is super heavy, like 50 pounds!  Onions cost $1.50 for each pound.  Hmm, let's see... 4 bags times 50 pounds is 200 pounds of onions!  That's a lot of onions!  

So, 200 pounds times $1.50...  That's $300.00!


$300.00 

"
"Okay, so Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday. That's 5 + 13 = 18 cookies total.

Sue ate 4 times more than her sister on Monday, so she ate 5 x 4 = 20 cookies!

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many as her sister, so she ate 13 x 2 = 26 cookies.

That means Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies in total.

Each cookie has 200 calories, so Sue ate 46 x 200 = 9200 calories.

Her sister ate 18 x 200 = 3600 calories.

Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister.


5600 

"
"Okay, so there are 60 kids in the whole school.  Half are boys and half are girls, so that's 30 boys and 30 girls.  The first two classes have 15 + 12 = 27 girls.  That means there are 3 girls in the last class.  If there are 20 kids in each class, and 3 are girls, then there must be 17 boys! 


17 

"
"Okay, so Travis started with 61 apps. He got rid of 9, so now he has 61 - 9 = 52 apps. Then he got 18 more, so now he has 52 + 18 = 70 apps!


70 

"
"Okay, so Rick killed lots of animals!  

Last night he got 10 wolves and 15 cougars. That's a lot! Today he got three times more wolves than cougars, which is like, if you have 3 cookies and get 3 more groups of 3 cookies, that's a lot of cookies! He also got 3 less cougars today than yesterday.

Hmm, let me count them up on my fingers...  

He killed 73 animals in all! 



"
"Okay, so Bill starts on the 3rd floor. He goes up a bunch of floors. It's like 4 times the floor he started on, so 3 times 4 is 12. Then he goes up 6 more floors.  So 12 plus 6 is 18!

Bill is on the 18th floor now. 



"
"Okay, so Mitchel went down 30 times. Anne went down less than him, 30% less.  That's like taking away 9 slides, so Anne went down 21 times. Robert went down way more than Anne, 4 times as much! So Robert went down 21 times times 4, which is 84 times!


84 

"
"Okay, so there are ten stalls with twenty cows in each, that's a lot of cows!  Mr. Sylas gets forty more cows, and puts them in all the stalls so they're even.  

If we want to know how many cows are in eight stalls, we gotta figure out how many cows are in each stall first.  

Hmm... let me see... 200 cows plus 40 more is 240 cows.  And he puts them in 20 stalls, so that's 240 divided by 20... which is 12 cows in each stall!

So, eight stalls would have 8 times 12 cows, which is 96 cows!


96 

"
"Let's see... he has a hundred pennies, which is a dollar!  Then he has forty nickels, and each nickel is worth five cents, so that's two dollars!  The dimes are worth two dollars too, 'cause twenty dimes is two dollars. And he has forty dollar bills, so that's forty dollars!  

If we add it all up, it's one plus two plus two plus forty, which is forty-five dollars!


45.00 

"
"Okay, so the tree is super tall, 200 feet! And each part of the tree that's 10 feet long weighs 400 pounds.  

That means there are 20 parts to the tree, right?  'Cause 200 divided by 10 is 20.

So the whole tree weighs 8000 pounds 'cause 20 times 400 is 8000.

But those pesky termites ate some of it! They ate 30%, which is like 3 out of every 10 parts.

Hmm, so they ate 2400 pounds of wood.

That means the tree now weighs 5600 pounds. 



"
"Nancy has to pay 50 cents for each of her 8 books, so that's 50 times 8 which is 400 cents.  That's the same as $4.00.  Then she has to pay another $2.00 because some books were really late. So in total, she has to pay $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.


$6.00 

"
"Okay, so Andrea has 52 apples. Jamal has 8 less apples than Andrea, so he has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Let's add up all the fruits: Andrea's apples and bananas is 52 + 24 = 76. Jamal's apples and bananas is 44 + 48 = 92.

Together they have 76 + 92 = 168 fruits!


168 

"
"Okay, so Carla needs two cups of flour for every twelve cookies.  She's making 36 today and 30 tomorrow, so that's 36 plus 30 which is 66 cookies.  Hmm, 66 cookies is like 5 and a half dozens.  So she needs 5 and a half times 2 cups of flour... that's 11 cups! 


11 

"
"Okay, so we have a big cup with 9300 pennies!  We wanna know how much money is in two-thirds of those pennies.

Hmm, two-thirds... that's like cutting the pennies into three groups and taking two of them.

Let's see... 9300 divided by 3 is 3100.  And two groups of 3100 is 6200 pennies.

Now, there are 100 pennies in a dollar, so 6200 pennies is the same as 62 dollars!


$62.00 

"
"Maddison has lots of marbles! She has 5 boxes, and each box has 50 marbles. That's 5 times 50, which is 250 marbles! Then her friend gives her 20 more. So, she has 250 plus 20, which is 270 marbles! 


270 

"
"Okay, so Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half of that, so he has 3 trees. Harry has twice the number of trees Ferdinand has, which is 6 trees, plus 5 more, so he has 11 trees! That means Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 


8
"
"Okay, let's see... Carmen has $100. Samantha has $25 more than that, so she has $100 + $25 = $125. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so she has $125 + $50 = $175.  

To find out how much they have together, we add up all their money: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.


400 

"
"Okay, so the house costs $350,000. But there's extra money to pay too!

The helper person gets 5% of the house price, so that's like 5 out of every 100 dollars.  That's $17,500 more.

Then there's a transfer fee, which is 12% of the house price. That's like 12 out of every 100 dollars, which is $42,000 more.

So, all together, the house costs $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Mrs. Cruz only has $400,000.  That means the house is $9,500 more than she can spend. 



"
"Okay, so Mr. Tan sold his house for a lot of money, $400,000! But he had to pay some money to sell it, like fees and stuff.  He paid 3% for transfer fees, which is like 3 out of every 100 dollars. That's $12,000! And then he paid 5% to the person who helped him sell it, which is $20,000.

He also had to pay back the rest of the money he borrowed to buy the house, which was $250,000.

So, to find out how much money he has left, we add up all the money he spent: $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

Then we take that away from the money he got from selling the house: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

Mr. Tan has $118,000 left!


$118,000
"
"Okay, so the oil takes 20 minutes to get to 300 degrees. Then it takes longer to get to 400 degrees, like 40% longer.  That's like adding a little bit more time, right?  

So, 20 minutes plus a little more is 28 minutes.

Then it takes a little less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil.  It takes 5 minutes less, so that's 23 minutes.

So, all together, it takes 28 minutes to heat up plus 23 minutes to cook, which is 51 minutes! 


51 

"
"Okay, so he bought lots of newspaper ads, 50 of them! And each one cost $5.  That's 50 times 5, which is... hmm... let me count... 250 dollars!

Then he got TV ads too, 15 of them. Each one was $75, so that's 15 times 75...  That's a lot!  1125 dollars!

Now we gotta add those together. 250 plus 1125...  That's 1375 dollars! Whew!


$1375 

"
"Hmm, let's see...  The juggler has 16 balls, and half are golf balls, so that's 16 divided by 2 which is 8 golf balls.  Then, half of those golf balls are blue, so that's 8 divided by 2... which is 4! 

There are 4 blue golf balls. 

"
"Okay, so Mary has three bags of M&Ms. The first one has 300, that's a lot! The second one has 12 more than that, so that's 300 plus 12... which is 312!  The third bag is sad because it has a hole, so it only has half the M&Ms of the first bag. Half of 300 is 150.  

Let's add them all up: 300 plus 312 plus 150... that's 762 M&Ms!


762 

"
"Let's see... two houses with three bedrooms each... that's six bedrooms! And each bedroom has two windows, so that's twelve windows.  But wait, there are four more windows in each house, so that's eight more windows!  

Twelve plus eight is twenty! There are twenty windows in total.

"
"Let's see... she spent $4.20 plus $9.45 plus $1.35, that's $15.00 in total.  She gave the cashier $20.00, so she gets $5.00 back!


$5.00 

"
"Okay, so Terri's sweater needs 1800 stitches in total.  The body needs 900, the collar needs 90 (because that's a tenth of the body), and the rosette needs 180 (because that's double the collar).

If we add those up, that's 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

That means both sleeves together need 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

So each sleeve needs 630 / 2 = 315 stitches! 


315 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Rylan bought lots of seeds!  She got 20 packs of tomato seeds and each one costs $40. That's 20 times 40, which is $800.  

Then she got 80 packs of celery seeds, and each of those costs $30. So that's 80 times 30, which is $2400.

To find out how much she spent in total, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds: $800 plus $2400 is $3200.


$3200 

"
"Okay, so Sean has to learn a lot of words! His song has 54 lines.  The first part of the play is like the song but twice as long, so that's 54 times 2 which is 108 lines. But he only says one-third of those, so that's 108 divided by 3 which is 36 lines.

The second part of the play has 6 more lines than the song, so that's 54 plus 6 which is 60 lines. He says most of those, four-fifths, so that's 60 times 4 divided by 5 which is 48 lines.

Let's add it all up: 36 lines plus 48 lines plus 54 lines is 138 lines! Wow, that's a lot to remember!


138 

"
"Okay, so Carly starts with 80 cards.  

First, we gotta find out how many have the letter A. That's 2 out of every 5 cards, so it's like cutting the cards into 5 groups and taking 2. That's 32 cards with A.

Now she has 80 - 32 = 48 cards left.

Half of those have B, so that's 48 / 2 = 24 cards with B.

Now she has 48 - 24 = 24 cards left.

5 out of 8 of those have C, so that's 24 * (5/8) = 15 cards with C.

That means 24 - 15 = 9 cards have D! 


9 

"
"Okay, so Matthew takes 3 minutes for each little hole and 10 minutes for each big hole.  He's digging 30 little holes, so that's 30 times 3, which is 90 minutes.  Then he's digging 15 big holes, so that's 15 times 10, which is 150 minutes.  

Now we add those together: 90 plus 150 is 240 minutes.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is 4 hours.

"
"If they are 20 years old now, in 10 years they will be 30 years old! 

20 + 10 = 30

"
"Okay, so Ruby is way older than Sam right now.  In nine years, Ruby will be three times as old as Sam.  Hmm... that means Sam will be a lot older too!

Let me see... if Ruby is three times as old as Sam in nine years, Sam must be six now! 



"
"Let's see... Peter bought 20 popsicles and each one cost 25 cents. So that's 20 times 25 cents... hmm... that's 5 dollars!

He also got 4 ice cream bars at 50 cents each. So that's 4 times 50 cents... which is 2 dollars!

If we add the popsicle money and the ice cream money, it's 5 dollars plus 2 dollars... that makes 7 dollars!


$7.00 

"
"Okay, so a cobra has 70 spots, and that's twice as many as a mamba. So a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras, so they have a total of 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

There are 60 mambas, so they have 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

All together, that's 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Half of that is 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.


2450 

"
"Okay, so Maddy needs pizza for her cousin's soccer team. There are 12 players and they each bring 2 friends, so that's 12 times 2 which is 24 friends.  

Then there are 3 coaches too, so in total there are 12 + 24 + 3 = 39 people.

Each pizza has enough for 3 people, so Maddy needs 39 divided by 3 which is 13 pizzas.

If each pizza costs $15, then 13 pizzas will cost 13 times 15 which is $195. 


$195 

"
"Okay, so Katerina uses 8 topaz stones, and each one is 1 inch long. That's 8 inches of topaz in total. Her necklaces are 25 inches long, so that means the silver beads take up 17 inches (25 - 8 = 17).

Each little silver bead is a quarter of an inch long.  So, to find out how many beads she uses, we gotta see how many quarters are in 17.  

Hmm... 17 divided by 0.25 is... 68! 


68 

"
"Okay, so Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40, and Margot wrote 60. That's 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories in the first week.

Then they all wrote double the stories in the second week! So Alani wrote 20 x 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 x 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 x 2 = 120 stories.

That's 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories in the second week.

Altogether, they wrote 120 + 240 = 360 stories! 


360 

"
"Ann's brother is 9 times 2 which is 18.  In three years he will be 18 plus 3 which is 21!

"
"Okay, so Kelly has five quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. That's 5 times 25, which is 125 cents!  She also has two dimes, and each dime is 10 cents. So that's 2 times 10, which is 20 cents.

Let's add that up: 125 cents plus 20 cents is 145 cents.

The pop costs 55 cents, so we need to take that away from her total. 145 minus 55 is 90.


90 

"
"Okay, so there are 76 stars in total.  Three rows have 8 stars each, so that's 3 times 8, which is 24 stars. Then there are two rows with 6 stars each, so that's 2 times 6, which is 12 stars.  

That means 24 plus 12 is 36 stars used up.  

If we take 36 away from the total of 76, we get 40 stars left.  

Since each row with 5 stars has 5 stars, we can fit 40 stars into 8 rows of 5.

"
"Hmm, let's see... each truck can carry 2000 pounds, and each stone is 75 pounds.  So, 80 stones weigh a lot!  

If we have 80 stones times 75 pounds each, that's 6000 pounds!  

We need 3 trucks because 2000 pounds times 3 trucks is 6000 pounds.

"
"The fast car goes 60 miles every hour. The slow car goes 30 miles every hour 'cause it's half as fast.  If the fast car goes 480 miles, that means it drove for a long time!  

To know how long the slow car takes, we gotta think: if it goes 30 miles every hour, how many hours to get to 480?  

Hmm... 30 miles is like, half of 60, so it'll take twice as long!  The fast car took... let me see... 480 miles divided by 60 miles per hour... that's 8 hours.

So the slow car takes twice that, which is 16 hours!


**Answer:** 16 

"
"Ali has lots of medals, 22! Izzy has 5 less, so Izzy has 17.  Together they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

But that's 10 times less than all the medals out there! So there are 39 x 10 = 390 medals in total. 


390 

"
"Okay, so there are 40 chocolate bars in total. The grown-ups get 24 bars, so that leaves 16 bars for the kids.  If there are 8 kids, each kid gets 2 bars! 



"
"Okay, so Susan works for three hours, but she takes a break for half an hour. That means she really works for two and a half hours.  

Two and a half hours is the same as two hours and thirty minutes.  

She makes $5 every ten minutes, so let's see... two hours is 120 minutes, plus thirty minutes is 150 minutes.

If she makes $5 every ten minutes, we gotta divide 150 by 10, which is 15. Then we multiply that by $5, so 15 times $5 is... $75!


$75 

"
"Okay, let's see... Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 less than Mike, so he has 18 points. Tony has twice as many points as Mike, so he has 42 points.

After the extra points, Mike and Tony get one more point each because they have more than 20 points.

So, let's add up all their points: 21 + 18 + 42 + 1 + 1 = 83 points! 



"
"Will has 15 oranges. His oldest son washes 8 oranges and his youngest son washes 4 oranges. That's 8 + 4 = 12 oranges washed.  

So there are 15 - 12 = 3 oranges left.

"
"Okay, so Darren does lots of exercises!

Day one he does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. That's a lot!

Day two he does even more pushups, 20 more than day one. So that's 100 + 20 = 120 pushups!

He does 10 less squats than day one, so that's 50 - 10 = 40 squats.

And he doubles his dumbbell presses, so that's 20 x 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

Let's add up all the exercises for both days:

Day one: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170 exercises

Day two: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200 exercises

Now let's add those together: 170 + 200 = 370 exercises!

Wow, Darren is strong! 


370 

"
"Okay, so they eat rice for lunch and dinner, that's two times a day.  Each person eats a little bit, 0.2 kg each time. So that's 0.2 times 2, which is 0.4 kg a day for each person.

There are 5 people eating, so that's 0.4 times 5, which is 2 kg of rice gone every day!

They have a big bag with 42 kg of rice.  If they eat 2 kg a day, it will last 42 divided by 2, which is 21 days.

That's 3 weeks! 



"
"Okay, so Sam wanted to sell 120 crates of bread. He couldn't sell any on Monday or Friday, so that's two days less.  He sold some bread on the weekend and a few more crates on the other days. Let's see... 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 is 65 crates.  

Hmm, 120 minus 65 is 55.

Sam was 55 crates off from his target. 



"
"Okay, so Carmen starts at $200. Then three other people bid, and each time the price goes up by $50.  So that's $50 more, then $50 more, then $50 more, which is $150 more in total.  

So the desk costs Carmen $200 + $150 = $350!


$350 

"
"Okay, so John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home, that's 60 miles a day. He works 5 days a week, so that's 60 times 5, which is 300 miles every week.  

He works for 50 weeks a year, so that's 300 times 50, which is 15,000 miles a year!

Each mile costs $2, so that's 15,000 times 2, which is $30,000.

He also gives his driver $150 extra every month, and there are 12 months in a year, so that's 150 times 12, which is $1,800.

To find the total, we add the mileage cost and the bonus: $30,000 plus $1,800 is $31,800.


$31,800 

"
"Okay, so Peter exercised for 23 minutes on Sunday and 16 minutes on Monday.  That's 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.

He wants to exercise twice that long on Tuesday, so he needs to exercise for 39 x 2 = 78 minutes.

"You fold a big piece of paper in half to make a tabloid! So you only need one piece of paper. 



"
"Annika started with $50. She spent $25 on yummy food and snacks. Then she spent another $10 on rides.  That's $25 + $10 = $35 spent in total.

If she started with $50 and spent $35, she has $50 - $35 = $15 left.


$15 

"
"Okay, so Elise sold lots of books!  

She sold 45 books this year, and twice that many last year, so that's 45 x 2 = 90 books.

That means she sold 90 + 45 = 135 books in total, and she has 50 left.

So, she sold 135 - 50 = 85 books in the second year.

Each book costs $20, so she made 85 x $20 = $1700 in the second year.


$1700 

"
"Okay, so Watson works a lot! Ten hours a day is a long time. He makes ten dollars for every hour, so that's a hundred dollars each day. He works five days a week, so that's five hundred dollars! Plus, his company is doing good, so he gets an extra three hundred dollars every week. That means he makes eight hundred dollars every week!  

April has four weeks, so he makes eight hundred dollars times four, which is... three thousand two hundred dollars! 


$3200
"
"Hmm, John wins most of his matches! If he wins 80% of the time, that means he lost to 20 people - 16 wins = 4 people.

"
"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds each week. Sandy takes 4 weeks to lose the same amount as Joey loses in one week. So it takes Sandy 4 weeks.

"
"Okay, so the ice cream is cheaper now, yay! It's $2 cheaper each.  If we buy two tubs, that's $2 times 2, which is $4 saved on ice cream.

The milk is also cheaper by 50 cents each. If we buy four packets, we save 50 cents times 4, which is $2 on milk.

So, in total, we save $4 + $2 = $6! 



"
"Hmm, let's see...

If they get an extra arm every three days, in fifteen days they'd get 5 extra arms!  And if they get a leg every five days, they'd get 3 extra legs.

That's a lot of extra limbs!  5 arms plus 3 legs is 8 new limbs! 


8 

"
"Okay, let's see... Theo has $6000.

He buys 6 suits for $100 each, so that's 6 times 100, which is $600.

He gets 3 suitcases for $50 each, so that's 3 times 50, which is $150.

His plane ticket is tricky. It's 5 times the price of a suit, so that's 5 times $100, which is $500. But it's also $700 more than that, so we add $700 to $500, which is $1200 for the ticket.

Now, let's add up all the things he bought: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

He wants to save $2000, and he already spent $1950, so he has $6000 - $1950 = $4050 left.

That means he has $4050 - $2000 = $2050 for gifts! 



"
"Okay, so three people eat three eggs each, that's 3 times 3 which is 9 eggs.  Then two people eat two eggs each, so that's 2 times 2 which is 4 eggs.  

That means they eat 9 plus 4, which is 13 eggs every day.

In a week, there are 7 days, so they eat 13 times 7 which is 91 eggs!

"
"Okay, so Quinn is 30. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 27. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 32!

"
"Okay, so Cera is 46 now, so six years ago she was 40. Noah was half her age then, so he was 20.  

The people in Chile were 3000 times Noah's age back then, so that's 3000 times 20, which is 60,000 people!

But that was just half the number of people there are now, so now there are 60,000 times 2, which is 120,000 people in Chile!


120000 

"
"Okay, so there are lots of players on the team!  Twice as many on offense as defense means the defense is smaller. And special teams is even smaller, half the size of the defense.  Hmmm... if we add up all the players, it has to be 105.  

Let me see... I think there are 30 players on defense. 



"
"Okay, so Martha invited lots of people! Two families have six people each, so that's 2 times 6, which is 12 people. Then three families have four people each, so that's 3 times 4, which is 12 more people. That's 12 plus 12, which is 24 people!

But some people got sick, 8 of them. And 2 more couldn't come because they were busy. So, 8 plus 2 is 10 people who couldn't come.

That means 24 minus 10 is 14 people came to the party! 


14
"
"Okay, so Solomon starts with 50 marbles. Then he gets 20 more from Johanna. That's 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.

His dad gives him some too! It's 2/5 of the marbles he got from Johanna, so that's 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now he has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles!

Each marble weighs 2 kgs, so all his marbles weigh 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.


156 

"
"Okay, so the pool is like a big box, right?  It's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep.  To find out how much water it holds, we gotta multiply those numbers together: 6 times 4 times 5 is 120. So it holds 120 boxes of water, but each box is only 1 foot big!

Filling it up costs 10 cents for every little box of water.  So we gotta multiply 120 by 10 cents, which is like 120 dimes.  That's the same as $12.00!


$12.00 

"
"Okay, so there are 30 boys.  There are 3 times as many girls, so that's 30 times 3 which is 90 girls.  And there are 3 kids who aren't boys or girls.  So, 30 plus 90 plus 3 is... 123 kids! 



"
"If there are 3 wires for every pole, and they need 45 wires, then they need 15 poles!

"
"Okay, so there were 25 men and 15 women at the party.  That's 40 people in total. Then some people left, and 22 men stayed.  That means 40 - 22 = 18 people stayed in total.  

If 22 men stayed, then 18 - 22 = 8 women stayed.

"
"The book costs four dollars, and the magazine costs half that, so the magazine costs two dollars.  The pen costs one dollar less than the magazine, so it costs one dollar! 


$1
"
"Jam has lots of pencils! She has three boxes of them and two extra pencils. That's 26 pencils in total. Her sister Meg has 46 pencils.  

If we add all the pencils together, that's 26 + 46 = 70 pencils!

To fit all those pencils, they'd need a lot of boxes. Hmm... maybe nine boxes would be enough?

"
"Okay, so Shannon wants her coffee cold.  Each ice cube makes it colder but also makes it a little bit weaker.  She wants it 65 degrees colder, and each ice cube makes it 13 degrees colder.  So she needs 65 divided by 13, which is 5 ice cubes.

Each ice cube makes it 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make it 5 times 12, which is 60 milliliters weaker.

But she also adds cream, which makes it 15 milliliters weaker.

So in total, her coffee is 60 plus 15, which is 75 milliliters weaker. 


75 

"
"Hmm, let me see... They got 7 new records, and you need 2 old ones to get a new one. So that's 7 times 2...  

7 times 2 is 14! They brought in 14 old records. 


14
"
"Okay, so there are 100 people working at the company.  

Some are junior programmers and some are senior programmers. Junior programmers get $2000 each month. Senior programmers get $400 more than that, so they get $2400 each month.

There are 40 junior programmers because 2 out of every 5 people are junior programmers. That means there are 60 senior programmers.

To find out how much the company pays all the junior programmers, we do 40 times $2000, which is $80,000.

For the senior programmers, we do 60 times $2400, which is $144,000.

Finally, we add those two numbers together: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

So the company pays $224,000 to all the programmers each month. 



"
"Hmm, let's see... 

They had 20 people on the bus going to the third stop.  Then 7 people got off, so there were 20 + 7 = 27 people before that stop.

Then 8 people got on, so before that there were 27 - 8 = 19 people.

And 5 people got on at the first stop, so there were 19 - 5 = 14 people at the start!


14 

"
"Okay, so Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2, so he has 22 left. Then he gives 14 to his friends, so he has 8 left.  On the way home, he buys 28 more lollipops! Wow, that's a lot! Now he has 36. He eats 3 more, so he has 33. Then he eats 2 more, so he has 31 lollipops left. 


31 

"
"Hmm, let's see... the phone is at 60% and needs to get to 100%. That means it needs 40% more.

It charges 1% every 3 minutes, so to get 40%, it'll take 40 times 3 minutes, which is 120 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 120 minutes is the same as 2 hours! 


2 

"
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Then she gets 10 more, so she has 17!  But then she gives 3 to Ella.  That means she has 14 left. 


14 

"
"Okay, so they spent $80 last time and get $1 off for every $20, so that's $80 / $20 = 4 dollars off!

This time they spent $43, and they get to use that $4 off.  

But wait, there's a coupon too! The coupon takes off twice the amount of their reward, so that's $4 * 2 = $8 more off!

So, all together they saved $4 + $8 = $12.

That means they paid $43 - $12 = $31 this time.


$31 

"
"Okay, so Job A pays $15 every hour, and he works a lot of hours, 2000! That's 15 times 2000, which is 30,000 dollars. But then they take out 20% for taxes, so that's 30,000 times 0.20, which is 6,000 dollars less. So Job A is 30,000 minus 6,000, which is 24,000 dollars.

Job B is trickier. It's just 42,000 dollars straight up, but then they take out 6,000 dollars for something called property tax. That leaves 36,000 dollars. Then they take out 10% for more taxes, so that's 36,000 times 0.10, which is 3,600 dollars. So Job B is 36,000 minus 3,600, which is 32,400 dollars.

32,400 is bigger than 24,000, so Job B pays more.  32,400 minus 24,000 is 8,400 dollars more.

"Okay, so there are lots of castles in Scotland, 220!  Some are broken down, like 40 of them.  And then half of those broken ones don't have anyone looking after them.  So, ummm... let's see... 40 divided by 2 is 20. 


20 

"
"Okay, so Furniture United wants $1350 first and then $350 every month for 6 months. That's like 6 times $350, which is $2100.  So that's $2100 plus the $1350, which is $3450 in total.

Cozy Homes wants $1100 first and then $250 every month for 9 months.  That's 9 times $250, which is $2250. So that's $2250 plus $1100, which is $3350.

Hmm, $3450 minus $3350 is $100. 


100 

"
"Let's see... they have 8 plus 10 plus 1 plus 5... that's 24 guns!  

If they share, that's 24 split into 4 groups, so each person gets 6 guns!

"
"Okay, so Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for each batch of suckers, and he's making 8 batches. That's 30 times 8, which is 240 ounces.  Then he needs 70 ounces for the fudge.  So in total, he needs 240 plus 70 ounces, which is 310 ounces!


310 

"
"Okay, so Maria starts with 8 shares and each one costs $8. That's 8 times 8, which is $64.

The first year, the price goes up by half of $8, which is $4. So now each share costs $8 + $4 = $12.

The next year, the price goes down by a quarter of $12, which is $3. So each share costs $12 - $3 = $9.

Since she has 8 shares, they're worth $9 times 8, which is $72.


$72 

"
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate a lot more, like three times more! That's 2 times 3 which is 6 hot dogs. John ate half of what Thomas ate, so he ate 6 divided by 2 which is 3 hot dogs.  That means John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. 


1 

"
"Okay, so there are 200 kids in total.  Two groups are the same size, and the other group is 10 kids smaller.  Hmm... let's see. If we take 10 away from 200, that's 190.  Then if we split 190 in half, that's 95.  So each of the bigger groups has 95 kids!

That means the smallest group has 95 - 10 kids, which is 85 kids. 



"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 60 animals, right? Some are cows and some are chickens. He has double the amount of chickens than cows.  

Let's see... if we think about it, if we take away some chickens, we can make groups of cows and chickens that are the same size.  Since he has double the chickens, we know there must be 20 cows and 40 chickens.

Cows have 4 legs, so that's 20 times 4, which is 80 legs. Chickens have 2 legs, so that's 40 times 2, which is also 80 legs.

If we add those together, all the animals have 80 plus 80, which is 160 legs!


160 

"
"Josh starts with 3 balls. Then he adds one more each week for four weeks, so that's 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 balls!

But then he drops 3! Uh oh! Two come back, so he has 6 - 3 + 2 = 5 balls left. 


5 

"
"Okay, so the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. The blue beetle and green toad weigh the same as the frog, so they also weigh 50 pounds. The yellow snake is 10 pounds heavier than the frog, so it weighs 60 pounds. The red bird is 20 pounds lighter than the frog, so it weighs 30 pounds.

If we add up all the animals' weights, we get 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

But don't forget the container weighs 20 pounds too! So, the total weight is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.


210 

"
"Laurel got 24 outfits from her friend. Then she got 24 x 2 = 48 outfits at her baby shower! That's a lot of clothes! Her mommy gave her 15 more. So, Laurel has 24 + 48 + 15 = 87 outfits for her baby. 

87 

"
"Okay, so Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1000 meters more each day. That means he'll run 6000 meters every day!

If he runs 6000 meters every day for a whole month, which has 30 days, we gotta multiply: 6000 times 30.  That's 180000 meters!

180000 

"
"Juice Box B costs $4 + $5 = $9. Juice Box C costs $4 + $7 = $11.  That means Juice Box C is $11 - $9 = $2 more than Juice Box B.


$2 

"
"Okay, so there are lots of tables! Forty tables have four legs each. That's like, forty times four... hmm... that's one hundred and sixty legs!  Then there are fifty tables with three legs each.  So that's fifty times three... which is one hundred and fifty legs.  

If we add those together, one hundred sixty plus one hundred fifty... that makes three hundred and ten legs!


310 

"
"Okay, so Jenny gets 36 cookies. Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so that's 4 times 5 which is 20 cookies. Her husband eats 1 cookie every day for a whole week, so that's 7 cookies.  

That means they eat 20 plus 7, which is 27 cookies together.  

If they eat 27 cookies, Jenny gets to eat the rest, so 36 minus 27 is 9 cookies! 


9 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Two shirts cost $30 each, so that's $30 + $30 = $60. But they were on sale for 40% off!  That means he saved a lot of money.  

40% of $30 is... hmm... that's tricky.  Let's see, 10% of $30 is $3, so 40% is like four of those, which is $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 = $12.

So each shirt cost $30 - $12 = $18.

Two shirts at $18 each is $18 + $18 = $36.


$36 

"
"Okay, so they used to make $1000 a day from tractors. Now they make $1100 a day from silos.  That's $100 more each day!

To figure out the percentage, I think of it like this: they're making 100 extra dollars out of every 1000 dollars they used to make.  So that's 10 percent more! 


10 

"
"Okay, so Madeline spends $25 each week on food for her dog. That's like $25 x 4 = $100 every month on food.

Then she spends $20 on treats each month and $100 on medicine each month.

So, all together it's $100 + $20 + $100 = $220 every month.

Now, there are 12 months in a year, so she spends $220 x 12 = $2640 on her dog every year! 


2640
"
"Let's see...

Yoga is one hour. Cooking class is three times that, so that's 1 times 3, which is 3 hours. Cheese tasting is half an hour. The museum is half the cooking class, so that's 3 divided by 2, which is 1 and a half hours. And errands are 2 hours.

So, 1 plus 3 plus 0.5 plus 1.5 plus 2... hmm... that's 8 hours! 



"
"April needs 30 pots for the daisies and 30 x 2 = 60 pots for the roses. That's 30 + 60 = 90 pots in total.

She had 100 pots, and she needs 90, so she has 100 - 90 = 10 pots left over.

"
"Andrea had $36. She bought a sweater for $11 and gave her brother $4.  

To find out how much she saved, we need to add the cost of the sweater and the money she gave her brother, then subtract that from the money she started with.

$11 + $4 = $15

$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21. 



"
"Okay, so John did lots of fun stuff on vacation! He boated for 6 hours, and then swam for half that time, which is 3 hours.  He also watched 3 shows, and each show was 2 hours long, so that's 6 hours of shows.

That's 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours already!

We know that's only 30% of his whole vacation.  To find out how long his whole vacation was, we can think of it like this: if 30% is 15 hours, then 10% is 15 hours / 3 = 5 hours.

That means his whole vacation was 5 hours * 10 = 50 hours long!

He spent 40% of that time sightseeing.  So, 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours were spent sightseeing.


20 

"
"Okay, so Annabelle wants a phone that costs $400. She already has $80.  

She makes $10 an hour at her first job and worked 20 hours, so that's $10 x 20 = $200.

At her second job, she makes $5 an hour and worked 15 hours, so that's $5 x 15 = $75.

Let's add up all her money: $200 + $75 + $80 = $355

She needs $400 and has $355, so she still needs $400 - $355 = $45.


$45 

"
"Okay, so the shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The next tree is 5 feet bigger, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.  

Now we add those two trees together: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice that size, so it's 17 x 2 = 34 feet tall!


34 

"
"Dean had $28. He spent $12 on cars and $5 on teddy bears. That's $17 spent.  So he had $11 left. Then his mom gave him $10 more! That means he has $21 now.


$21 

"
"Okay, so Morgan has $90. She needs $5 for mini-golf, $5 for tokens, and $20 for go-karts. That's $30 for her.  So she has $60 left for her friends.  If each friend costs $30, she can invite 2 friends! 


2 

"
"Marisa gets $5 every day. Lollipops cost 25 cents each, and she buys 4, so that's 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = $1.00 for lollipops.  

That means she saves $5 - $1 = $4 every day.

If she saves for 5 days, she saves $4 + $4 + $4 + $4 + $4 = $20.00! 


$20.00 

"
"Okay, so Billy had $10 and spent some on candy.  Candy costs $1.50 per pound. Then he bought gumballs with half his leftover money. Gumballs cost 5 cents each and he got 40 of them.

Hmm... let's see. If he spent $2 on gumballs (40 gumballs x $0.05 each), that means he had $8 left after buying candy ($10 - $2 = $8).

He spent half of that on candy, so he spent $4 on candy ($8 / 2 = $4).

That means he bought 2.67 pounds of candy ($4 / $1.50 per pound = 2.67 pounds).


2.67 

"
"Carver is 45, and that's 5 years less than double his son's age.  Hmm... so double his son's age would be 45 + 5, which is 50.  That means his son is 50 divided by 2, which is 25 years old! 


25
"
"Okay, so the train goes 75 miles, then 100 miles, and then 50 less than that, so 175 - 50 is 125 miles.  That's 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles for one whole trip.

It does that three times a day, so that's 300 x 3 = 900 miles a day!

The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so it can go 18,000 / 900 = 20 days before needing service.


20 

"
"Okay, so a Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds. A collie bed needs the middle amount, so that's 5 pounds.

If he makes 4 chihuahua beds, that's 4 times 2 pounds, which is 8 pounds.

For 3 collie beds, he needs 3 times 5 pounds, which is 15 pounds.

All together, that's 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds of stuffing! 


23
"
"Okay, so John drives to his friend's house, which is far away, 200 miles! But then he has to go a little extra, 10 more miles.  That's 210 miles total. He drives fast, 70 miles every hour!

Then he goes home a different way, 240 miles, and he goes even faster, 80 miles every hour!

Let's see... 210 miles at 70 miles per hour... hmm... that's 3 hours to his friend's house. And 240 miles at 80 miles per hour... that's also 3 hours to go home.

So, the whole trip took 3 hours plus 3 hours, which is 6 hours! 



"
"There are 96 kids in fourth grade. 43 are girls. That means there are 96 - 43 = 53 boys.  But 4 boys were absent, so there were 53 - 4 = 49 boys at school.


49 

"
"There are 6 girls and twice that many boys, so there are 6 x 2 = 12 boys.  

That means there are 6 + 12 = 18 kids in the park! 


18
"
"Jane needs 42 points to pass. She got 15 on the first test and 18 on the second, so that's 15 + 18 = 33 points.  She needs 42 - 33 = 9 more points! 


9 

"
"Okay, so three people got kicked out for not wearing masks. Then, four times that many, minus five, got kicked out for stealing. That's 3 times 4 minus 5, which is 7 people.  Then, three times those shoplifters got kicked out for fighting over stuff on sale. So that's 7 times 3, which is 21 people.

If 50 people got kicked out in total, and we add up the mask people, the shoplifters, and the fighters, that's 3 plus 7 plus 21, which is 31 people.

So, 50 minus 31 is 19 people who got kicked out for other reasons. 


19 

"
"Sara has 8 points. Erin has 14 points now, and that's three times more than Sara.  So Erin had 24 points before.  If she has 14 now, she had 24 - 14 = 10 points before.

"
"Okay, so we got 44 seniors gettin' awards. Each one gets a picture frame that costs 20 dollars.  And they gotta put a special thingy on each frame, which costs 20% more.  Two seniors get special pins for 5 dollars each. And a quarter of the seniors are officers, so they get cords for 12 dollars each.

Let's see... that's a lot of numbers!  

Hmm...  I think it's gonna cost a lot of money!  I'm not so good at adding all that up in my head. 


$1198

"If Ethan makes the wallpaper himself, he saves $80.  That means it will cost him $320 to make it himself.


$320 

"
"Okay, so they sold 14 shoes on Friday. Then on Saturday, they sold twice as many, so that's 14 times 2 which is 28 shoes!  On Sunday, they sold half as many as Saturday, so that's 28 divided by 2 which is 14 shoes. But then 6 people brought shoes back, so they sold 14 minus 6 which is 8 shoes on Sunday.

To find the total, we add up all the shoes sold each day: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 shoes!


50 

"
"Okay, so Hallie dances for one hour on Tuesdays and two hours on Thursdays.  On Saturdays, she dances for two hours 'cause that's twice as long as Tuesday.  

Let's see... one plus two plus two is five!

"
"Okay, so they bought lots of stuff for $400,000, but some of it was broken.  40% of it was broken, which is like 4 out of every 10.  So, they had to give the broken stuff back. That means they only paid for the stuff that worked.  

Let's see... if 40% was broken, then 60% was good.  

60% of $400,000 is... hmm... that's like 6 out of every 10.  So, they paid $240,000 for the good stuff.


$240,000 

"
"Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them give 1 big jug of milk, and the other half give 2 big jugs of milk.  So that's 15 sheep giving 1 jug each, which is 15 jugs. And 15 sheep giving 2 jugs each, which is 30 jugs.  

If you add them together, that's 15 + 30 = 45 jugs of milk!


45 

"
"Mrs. Sherman had 12 rolls and gave 6 to her kids. That leaves 6 rolls. She cut each of those rolls into 8 pieces, so that's 6 times 8... hmm... 6 times 8 is 48! 

She gave the chickens 48 pieces. 



"
"Okay, so there are 40 kids in the class. Half like blue, so that's 20 kids.  That leaves 20 kids who like other colors.  If one-fourth of them like green, that's 5 kids.  So the rest, 15 kids, must like yellow! 


15 

"
"Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday 'cause she got $56 and each apple costs $4. Then she picked 12 apples on Tuesday and double that on Wednesday, so that's 24 apples!  

In total, she picked 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples!


50 

"
"Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks, that's 20 socks!  And she washed 15 more socks that were by themselves.  So she washed 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

She started with 50 socks, and she washed 35, so she missed 50 - 35 = 15 socks.


15 

"
"Rachel had 23 cookies, and then got 42 more! That's a lot of cookies!  But then her brother ate 44.  Hmm, let me count... 23 plus 42 is 65. Then take away 44...  That leaves 21 cookies for Rachel. 


21
"
"Okay, so Karan borrowed some money, right? She has to pay it back a little bit each month.  

Let's see... she borrowed $3650 and has to pay for 5 months.  And the extra money she pays is 10% of what she borrowed.

Hmm, that means she has to pay back more than $3650 because of the extra money.

If we add 10% of $3650 to $3650, that's $3650 + $365 = $4015.

Now we divide that by 5 months: $4015 / 5 = $803.


So Karan has to pay $803 each month. 

"
"Cho hiked for a long time! He went 14 kilometers every hour for 8 hours. That's a lot of walking! Chloe hiked slower, only 9 kilometers each hour, and she stopped after 5 hours.  

To find out how much farther Cho hiked, we need to figure out how far each of them went. Cho went 14 times 8, which is 112 kilometers. Chloe went 9 times 5, which is 45 kilometers.  

Now we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance: 112 minus 45 equals 67.

Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe. 


67
"
"Let's see... Axel has 50 silver and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has double his silver pesos, so that's 50 times 2 which is 100 silver pesos. And she has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 plus 40 which is 120 gold pesos.

Okay, so all together they have 50 plus 100 silver pesos, that's 150 silver pesos. And 80 plus 120 gold pesos, that's 200 gold pesos.

So, 150 silver pesos plus 200 gold pesos is 350 pesos in total!


350 

"
"Okay, so Millie makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher has 12 cups. That's 3 times 12, which is 36 cups of lemonade!

She sells each cup for $1, so if she sells all of it, she makes $36. But she spent $18 on stuff to make the lemonade.

So, she makes $36 and spends $18, which means she makes a profit of $18.

She sells 4 cups every hour, and she has 36 cups, so she'll sell all her lemonade in 9 hours (36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours).

That means she makes $18 every 9 hours.  To find out how much she makes each hour, we do $18 divided by 9, which is $2.

So Millie makes $2 every hour! 


$2
"
"If he has 12.8 hectares left after selling some, and that's 2 out of 5 parts of his land, then to find the whole land, we need to figure out what 5 parts would be.  

It's like having 2 slices of a cake and knowing that's half the cake. To get the whole cake, you double the 2 slices.

So, we take the 12.8 hectares and divide it by 2, which gives us 6.4 hectares for one part. Then we multiply that by 5 to get all 5 parts: 6.4 hectares * 5 = 32 hectares.


32 

"
"There are 52 people in the choir, and half are girls, so there are 52 / 2 = 26 girls.  But then half of them can't come, so that's 26 / 2 = 13 girls.  The teachers sing too, so there are 13 + 3 = 16 people singing!


16 

"
"Okay, so Wilson took five math tests. He got a 65, a 94, an 81, an 86, and a 74. To find his grade, we gotta add them all up and then split that number by 5.

65 plus 94 plus 81 plus 86 plus 74 is 400.  

Then 400 split by 5 is 80! 

So his math grade is 80. 



"
"Let's see... 6 erasers cost 6 times $2, so that's $12.  And 8 pencils cost 8 times $3, so that's $24.  If we add those together, $12 plus $24 is $36.


36 

"
"Hmm, let's see... James gives Ms. Thompson lots of messages, 66!  And Mr. Yu gets less, only one-third of that. So that's 66 split into three groups... which is 22 messages for Mr. Yu.  

Altogether, that's 66 plus 22...  

88 messages! 



"
"David gets a bracelet for $30 and can ride all the rides. Dasha needs to buy tickets for each ride.  Each ride costs 2 tickets and each ticket costs $2. So Dasha needs 9 rides * 2 tickets/ride = 18 tickets. That's 18 tickets * $2/ticket = $36!

David saved $36 - $30 = $6. 


6
"
"Monica has lots of gifts to wrap!  She has 6 for family, 4 for friends, and 2 for teachers. That's 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts in total.

She has 144 inches of ribbon, and wants to use the same amount for each bow. So, she can use 144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches of ribbon for each bow.


12 

"
"Okay, so Betty and Sam have popsicles.  They share them in a special way, like 5 for Betty and 6 for Sam.  If they have 165 popsicles all together, that means Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty!

"
"Okay, so Tim doesn't want cable anymore. He wants Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus. Netflix costs $10. Hulu and Disney Plus together cost $20, but he gets a deal and saves $4! So, those two cost $16.  

That means all his streaming costs $16 + $10 = $26.

Cable costs $60, and streaming costs $26.  So he saves $60 - $26 = $34!


$34 

"
"Okay, so Carol writes for 4 hours, then records for 2 hours (that's half of 4).  Then she spends 1 and a half hours editing.  

That's 4 + 2 + 1 and a half = 7 and a half hours total.

Editing took 1 and a half hours out of 7 and a half, so it's like 1 and a half out of 7 and a half times 100.  Hmm, that's 20%!


20 

"
"Okay, so Wendy has 6 rows and 6 columns for her books. That's like 6 times 6, which is 36 spaces for books!  She wants double that, so that's 36 times 2, which is 72 books. But wait, she wants 20 more than that! So 72 plus 20 is 92 books. 


92 

"
"Okay, so Erica made 20 cards. Her dad gave her 2 boxes with 15 cards in each box, so that's 2 times 15, which is 30 cards!  

That means she had 20 plus 30, which is 50 cards. Then she gave 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away 24 plus 5, which is 29 cards.

That means she had 50 minus 29, which is 21 cards left. But then she got 17 more from her family and friends! So she has 21 plus 17, which is 38 cards now.


38 

"
"Okay, so Jenny starts with 12 slices. She gives Bill 4 slices and Mark 3 slices. That's 4 + 3 = 7 slices gone.  Then she eats 2 more, so that's 7 + 2 = 9 slices gone in total.  

If 9 slices are gone, there are 12 - 9 = 3 slices left!

"
"Mark needs to save $250 more. He earns $10 each day. So, he needs to work for 25 days! 


25 

"
"Okay, so Nancy saw lots of bugs! She saw 90 spiders. Then she saw 90 spiders divided by 3, which is 30 millipedes.  

Then she saw twice the number of millipedes, so that's 30 times 2 which is 60. But then she saw 12 less stink bugs than that, so 60 minus 12 is 48 stink bugs.

Let's add them all up: 90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 168 bugs! 


168 

"
"Okay, so Erica is 30. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth is 35. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 42.  That means Alice is 12 years older than Erica. 


12
"
"John drank 2 glasses of milk and each glass has 8 ounces. So he drank 2 times 8 which is 16 ounces of milk.  

Milk has 3 calories in every ounce. So 16 ounces of milk has 16 times 3 which is 48 calories.


48 

"
"Okay, so he works 4 weeks each month, and each week has 6 days, so that's 4 times 6 which is 24 days every month.

There are 12 months in a year, so he works 24 times 12 which is 288 days a year.

He gets $50 for each day, so he makes 288 times 50 which is $14,400 in a whole year!

"Okay, so Mark needs lots of flour! He needs 3 cups for one batch, but he's making four batches. That's 3 times 4, which is 12 cups of flour. Flour comes in bags with 2 cups each, so he needs 12 divided by 2, which is 6 bags of flour.

He needs 1 cup of milk for each batch, and he's making four, so that's 1 times 4, which is 4 cups of milk. Milk comes in bottles with 2 cups, so he needs 4 divided by 2, which is 2 bottles of milk.

He needs 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk, so he needs 6 minus 2, which is 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"
"Okay, so Mel saves 5 hours of AC time each day.  That's like turning it off for 5 whole hours!

The AC uses 900 watts each hour, so he saves 900 watts times 5 hours, which is 4500 watts every day.

But we need to know how many kilowatts that is.  A kilowatt is like a bigger watt, 1000 watts make a kilowatt. So 4500 watts is the same as 4.5 kilowatts.

He saves 4.5 kilowatts every day, and there are 30 days in a month, so he saves 4.5 times 30, which is 135 kilowatts in a month!

"
"Okay, so there are two zebras with 17 stripes each, that's 17 + 17 = 34 stripes. Then there's one with 36 stripes, and another with half of that, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.  

So all together, that's 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

Now we gotta share those stripes between the four zebras: 88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra!


22 

"
"Okay, so Tyson needs to feed 20 people. Each sandwich feeds 4 people, so he needs 20 divided by 4, which is 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So that's 5 sandwiches times 1 pound of meat, which is 5 pounds of meat. And 5 sandwiches times 1 pound of cheese, which is 5 pounds of cheese.

Meat costs $7.00 a pound, so 5 pounds of meat costs 5 times $7.00, which is $35.00. Cheese costs $3.00 a pound, so 5 pounds of cheese costs 5 times $3.00, which is $15.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and cheese: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00


$50.00 

"
"Okay, so Allan has 40 cannolis, and that's like the same as having 80 corns 'cause he has twice as many corns. Then he gets 60 more cannolis, so now he has 100 cannolis! But he only gets 60 more corns, so now he has 140 corns.  

If you add all the cannolis and corns together, it's 100 + 140 = 240!


240 

"
"Elliott walked 5,000 steps to and from school. Then he walked 1,000 more with his friend. That's 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

He needed to walk 10,000 steps, and he only had 2,000 left to go. So he must have walked 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps on his jog.

 
2,000 

"
"Okay, so Toby has a book with lots of words!  

He reads super fast, like a race car!

It takes him 30 minutes to read the whole book.

Then he needs 10 minutes to get to the airport.

That's 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.

He has a whole hour before he needs to be there, so he'll be 60 - 40 = 20 minutes early!


20 

"
"Okay, so they hired 40 people and paid them $15 each hour. They worked 40 hours a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so that's 160 hours a month.  

So each person made $15 times 160, which is $2400 a month.

That means in May they paid 40 people times $2400, so that's $96,000.

Then in June, some people left. A quarter of them left, so 40 divided by 4 is 10 people. That means 30 people were left.

So in June they paid 30 people times $2400, which is $72,000.

To find the total, we add the money from May and June: $96,000 plus $72,000 is $168,000.


$168,000 

"
"Okay, so Sally had $10.00. The taffy was a good deal! Two pounds cost $4.50. The seashells were $1.50 and the magnets were $1.00.  

Let's see... $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

That means she spent $7.00.  If she started with $10.00 and spent $7.00, she has $3.00 left.


$3.00 

"
"Okay, so Tim buys fireworks for $400, then another pack for $800 'cause that's twice as much.  That's $400 + $800 = $1200!

But wait, he gets a discount! 20% off means he saves $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

So the fireworks cost $1200 - $240 = $960.

And don't forget the big finale firework for $150!

That means he spent $960 + $150 = $1110 in total.


$1110 

"
"Okay, so Shannon eats 2 cookies every night, and she wants them to last a whole month, which is 30 days.  

Her recipe makes 12 cookies at a time, that's a dozen.  

Hmm... let's see, 2 cookies a day for 30 days is 2 times 30, which is 60 cookies.

Now, how many dozens are in 60 cookies?  A dozen is 12, so 60 divided by 12 is 5.

She needs to make 5 dozens of cookies! 


5 

"
"Okay, so Marcy makes lots of candles, right?  But some are bad and explode!  Only 1% are bad though, so that's 500 candles.  And only some of those stinky ones explode, like 5 out of every 100. So that's 25 candles that are stinky AND explode. 


25
"
"Okay, so each blouse costs $20, but they're 30% off.  That means each one is cheaper by $6.  So each blouse costs $14 now.  If Misha buys 4, that's $14 + $14 + $14 + $14 which is $56.


$56 

"
"Okay, so Joanne got 30 apples from the big trees and half that from the small trees, which is 15.  Her sister got double the apples from the big trees, so that's 30 times 2 which is 60 apples! And she got three times the apples from the small trees, so that's 15 times 3 which is 45 apples.

They got 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the big and small trees together.

That means Joanne got 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the trees that are just the right size!


350 

"
"Okay, so we got camels and dromedaries, right? Camels have two humps, and dromedaries have one.  We know there are 180 heads in total and 304 humps.

Hmm, let me think... If we take away one hump for each dromedary, that's like taking away some humps from the total.  

Let's see... 304 humps minus 180 heads equals 124 humps. That means those 124 humps are from the camels!

Since each camel has two humps, there are 124 humps / 2 humps per camel = 62 camels.

Now, if there are 180 heads total and 62 are camels, then there must be 180 heads - 62 camels = 118 dromedaries!


**Answer:** 118 

"
"Okay, so Tom traveled a lot!

He went 200 kilometers every day for four days, so that's 200 + 200 + 200 + 200 = 800 kilometers.

Then he traveled less for two days, only 30% of the first four days.  That's like 800 times 0.30 which is 240 kilometers.

He took a rest day, so no kilometers there.

Then he traveled 300 kilometers every day for a whole week, so that's 300 times 7 which is 2100 kilometers.

To find the total, we add it all up: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers!


3140 

"
"Okay, so Peter has a small locker, right? It's 5 inches big. Zack's locker is way bigger, like four times bigger than Peter's! That means Zack's locker is 5 times 4, which is 20 inches.  

Timothy has the biggest locker of all! Zack's locker is only half the size of Timothy's. So Timothy's locker is 20 times 2, which is 40 inches!


40 

"
"Okay, so Stanley's comb fell from way up high, 4,000 feet down! That means it landed at 6,000 feet because he was at 10,000 feet to start.  Oliver is at 3,000 feet, so he needs to climb 3,000 feet to get to the comb. 


3000 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Josue had $5000. Then he got $4000 from one bank and $8000 from another bank because that's twice the first one.  So, all together he has $5000 + $4000 + $8000 = $17000!


$17000 

"
"Okay, so there were 50 kitties on a rock. Then some boats came and took 20 kitties away. That leaves 30 kitties.  Then, some kitties saw a mouse and ran off. That was 18 kitties. So, there were 12 kitties left on the rock.


12 

"
"Okay, so Bill pays $8 every month for the first six months. That's like six groups of eight, which is 48 dollars.

Then it goes up to $12 a month for eight months.  That's eight groups of twelve, which is 96 dollars.

Then it goes up again to $14 a month for another eight months. That's eight groups of fourteen, which is 112 dollars.

To find out how much it costs for the whole two years, we add all those numbers together: 48 + 96 + 112 = 256 dollars.


256 

"
"Okay, so Cole got both jeans on sale, right? The ripped ones cost $28. The jogger ones were $6 cheaper, so they were $22.  

But the question wants to know how much MORE the jogger jeans cost *originally*.  Since they were the same price to start, the answer is $0. 


0 

"
"Let's see... they have 4 big buses that can fit lots of people, 60 people on each! That's 4 times 60... hmm... that's 240 people!

Then there are 6 smaller buses, they fit 30 people each. So that's 6 times 30...  that's 180 people!

And lastly, there are 10 tiny vans, each holding 15 people. So that's 10 times 15... which is 150 people!

Now, let's add them all up: 240 plus 180 plus 150...  that's 570 people!

570 

"
"Lillian made 3 bird feeders and bought 3 more.  The ones she bought each have 20 birdies come to them. But the ones she made are super cool, and 10 more birdies come to each one!

So, the store-bought ones have 3 times 20 birdies, which is 60 birdies.

Her homemade ones have 3 times 30 birdies, which is 90 birdies!

That's a lot of birdies! 60 plus 90 is 150 birdies in total!


150 

"
"Okay, so the bagel costs $4. The soup is more expensive, like 25 cents more for every dollar, so that's $1 extra, making it $5. The cake is half the price of the bagel, so it's $2.  

If you add them all up, it's $4 + $5 + $2 = $11. 


11
"
"Kenny wants to go to the amusement park. The ticket costs $100, and he has $50 left over after buying it. That means he made $50 from selling his Pokemon cards.

He sells each card for $1.50, so he sold $50 / $1.50 = 33 cards.

He kept some cards for himself, though.  If 33 cards are 2 out of 3 of all his cards, then he started with 33 cards / (2/3) = 50 cards!


50 

"
"The caterer made enough hot dogs for 18 people to have two each, that's 36 hot dogs. He also made 18 more hot dogs, so that's 54 in total.

But 40 people came!  That means only 27 people could have two hot dogs.

So 40 - 27 = 13 people didn't get a second hot dog. 


13
"
"Let's see... Indras has 6 letters in her name. Her sister has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name.  So half of Indras' name is 6 divided by 2, which is 3. Then we add 4, so her sister's name has 7 letters.  

That means together they have 6 + 7 = 13 letters! 


13
"
"Okay, so Charlotte wants to buy some stuff for her kitchen.  The pots and pans cost $120, the bowls cost $20, and the five little tools cost $5 each.  That's 5 times $5, which is $25.  So all that stuff together costs $120 + $20 + $25 = $165.

But wait! There's a sale! Everything is 20% off.  That means she saves 20 cents for every dollar she spends.  So she saves $165 times 0.20, which is $33.

That means her stuff now costs $165 - $33 = $132.


$132.00 

"
"Let's see... the skipping rope costs 6 dollars, the game costs 11 dollars, and the ball costs 2 dollars.  That's 6 plus 11 plus 2, which is 19 dollars in total. Dora has 2 dollars saved and her mom gave her 16 dollars, so she has 2 plus 16, which is 18 dollars.  

Dora needs 1 more dollar! 



"
"Okay, so Thaddeus killed a hundred dragons. Arthur killed three-quarters of that, which is like three out of four, so he killed 75 dragons. Walter used a rusty axe and killed twice as many as Arthur, so he killed 150 dragons.  Bruce forgot his sword and only had a nail file! He killed one-fifth as many as Walter, so he killed 30 dragons. 


30 

"
"Okay, so we have 15 gallons of gas and 5 containers. That means each container gets 3 gallons (15 divided by 5 is 3).

Josey needs a quarter of a container, so that's 3 divided by 4, which is 0.75 gallons.

Now, there are 8 pints in every gallon, so Josey needs 0.75 times 8 pints, which is 6 pints!


6 

"
"Okay, so George had $5. He bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. That's 3 times 40 cents, which is $1.20.  

He had $5 and spent $1.20, so he had $5 - $1.20 = $3.80 left for candy bars.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents.  So he bought $3.80 / $0.75 = 5 candy bars!


5 

"
"Ray had lots of lollipops! He kept some for himself, and then gave the rest to his friends.  If he gave 20 lollipops to his 4 friends, they each got 5 lollipops. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Rory had a big cake that weighed 20 ounces. She cut it into 8 pieces, and she and her mom each ate one.  That means 2 pieces are gone.  So there are 6 pieces left.  Each piece weighs the same, so if the whole cake was 20 ounces, and there are 8 pieces, each piece weighs 20 divided by 8, which is 2.5 ounces.  

If there are 6 pieces left, and each piece weighs 2.5 ounces, then the rest of the cake weighs 6 times 2.5, which is 15 ounces!


15 

"
"Let's see... Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22. That's a lot of oranges!  If they share with their 6 friends, that's 8 people in total.  

If we give everyone the same amount, we need to divide all the oranges by 8.  Hmm... 56 divided by 8 is 7.

So everyone gets 7 oranges! 



"
"Okay, so Antoine needs lots of onions for his soup! He uses 2 pounds, but he wants to use twice that, so that's 2 times 2, which is 4 pounds of onions.  

Those onions cost $2 a pound, so 4 pounds cost 4 times $2, which is $8. He also needs 2 boxes of beef stuff, and each box costs $2, so that's 2 times $2, which is $4.

All together, the onions and beef stuff cost $8 + $4 = $12.

He makes enough soup for 6 people, so each person's soup costs $12 divided by 6, which is $2. 



"
"Bernadette's drive is four times longer than Wayne's drive, which takes 4 minutes. So Bernadette's drive takes 4 times 4, which is 16 minutes.

She also wants to get there 5 minutes before Wayne. So she needs to leave 16 minutes + 5 minutes = 21 minutes before Wayne.


21 

"
"Okay, so Billie's room is 360 squares feet.  And it's 3 yards long.  Hmm, there are 3 feet in a yard, so that's 9 feet long!

To find how wide it is, we gotta do some dividing. 360 divided by 9 is 40. So it's 40 feet wide.

Now, to find the perimeter, we add up all the sides.  It's like walking all the way around the room.  So 9 feet plus 40 feet plus 9 feet plus 40 feet... that's 98 feet!


98 

"
"Let's see... Elizabeth has one pack of red beads and two packs of clear beads. That's 20 beads plus 40 beads, so she has 60 beads. Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. That's 60 beads plus 80 beads, so she has 140 beads.

Hmmm, 140 minus 60 is 80.

So Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth! 



"
"Okay, so Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.  His oven makes it hotter by 5 degrees every hour, and he bakes for 3 hours. So that's 5 + 5 + 5 more degrees, which is 15 degrees hotter!

Now the house is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

But then he opens a window, and it gets a little colder. It gets 2 degrees colder every 10 minutes, and the window is open for 30 minutes. That's like 3 sets of 10 minutes, so it gets 2 + 2 + 2 degrees colder, which is 6 degrees.

So the house ends up at 55 - 6 = 49 degrees. 



"
"Okay, so Jon takes 40 minutes to swim, 80 minutes to bike, and 50 minutes to run. That's 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes total.

James swims faster, so he takes 40 x 0.90 = 36 minutes to swim. But he's slower on the bike, so that takes him 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.

To find out how long James took to run, we do 160 - 36 - 85 = 39 minutes.


So James took 39 minutes to run. 

"
"Okay, so Movie C is 1 hour and 15 minutes long. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than that, so it's 1 hour and 20 minutes. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it's like cutting Movie B into four pieces and taking one piece.  That would be 20 minutes!


20 

"
"Okay, so the horsie runs really fast!  It eats half a bale of hay for every mile it runs.  

It runs for half an hour, which is like, not very long, right?  If it goes 32 miles in an hour, then in half an hour it goes 16 miles.

So it eats 16 miles times half a bale, which is 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so 8 bales cost $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, so he has $30.

If the hay costs $24 and he has $30, he gets $6 back! 



"
"Okay, so Rozanne has lots of eggs! Four dozens is like having 4 times 12 eggs, which is 48 eggs. Then she has 2 more, so that's 50 eggs in total.  Each glass needs 5 eggs, so she can make 50 divided by 5, which is 10 glasses.  If each tray holds 5 glasses, she can put out 10 divided by 5, which is 2 trays.


2 

"
"Okay, so Joey starts with 214 points and gets 26 more. That's 214 plus 26, which is 240! Marcy has 225 and gets 10 more, so she has 235.  To see how much more Joey has, we do 240 minus 235... and that's 5!

Joey is winning by 5 points. 



"
"Okay, so the salesman bought sneakers for $576. He sold some for $20 each, and the rest for $25 each.  

Let's see... he sold 17 for $20, so that's 17 times 20, which is $340.

Then he had 48 sneakers minus 17, which is 31 sneakers left. He sold those for $25 each, so that's 31 times 25, which is $775.

Now we add the money from both sales: $340 plus $775 is $1115.

Finally, we take away the money he spent on the sneakers: $1115 minus $576 is $539.


So his profit was $539! 

"
"Let's see... six packets have eight crayons, so that's 6 times 8, which is 48 crayons.  Then four packets have sixteen crayons, so that's 4 times 16, which is 64 crayons.  

If we add those together, 48 plus 64 is 112 crayons!


112 

"
"Okay, so the super ticket is like a deal, right? It costs $20, but you get popcorn and a soda too.  If you just buy a regular ticket, it's $12.  You saved $2 by getting the deal, so that means the regular ticket, popcorn, and soda together cost $21.  

The soda costs $3, and the ticket is $12, so the popcorn must cost $6. 


$6 

"
"Okay, so the balloons cost more now. They went up by $20 each!  

If each balloon costs $65 now, and Bentley wants 170 balloons, we gotta multiply: 65 times 170.

That's a lot of multiplying!  

...

65 times 170 is 11050.


11050 

"
"Okay, so the car goes fast for a while, then slower.  To find the average, we gotta think about how far it went in total and how long it took.

It went 60 miles an hour for 2 hours, so that's 60 x 2 = 120 miles.

Then it went 30 miles an hour for 1 hour, so that's 30 x 1 = 30 miles.

In total, it went 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

It took 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

So, to find the average speed, we do 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.


50 

"
"Okay, so Jenna starts with 8 shiny sapphires. She trades 3 of them for 2 rubies.  Sapphires are worth a lot, $800 each! Rubies are even more, $1200 each.

Let's see... she has 5 sapphires left, so those are worth 5 times $800, which is $4000.  And her 2 rubies are worth 2 times $1200, which is $2400.

If we add those together, $4000 plus $2400, she has jewels worth $6400! 


$6400

"
"Okay, so Bob has ten garden beds. Each one is like a big box, two feet wide, eight feet long, and two feet tall.  That's a lot of dirt!

Each bag of dirt has enough to fill two boxes, and each bag costs twelve dollars.

Let's see... ten beds times thirty-two boxes of dirt each... that's a lot of dirt!  

Hmm, I think he needs 160 bags of dirt.  

And if each bag costs twelve dollars, then 160 bags times twelve dollars... that's gonna be a lot of money!

$1920 



"
"Okay, so there are 15 red cards.  There are lots more green cards, 60% more! That's like if you had 10 candies and got 6 more!  

So, there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

That means there are 15 + 24 = 39 red and green cards together.

There are the same amount of yellow cards as red and green together, so there are 39 yellow cards too!

Let's add them all up: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards! 


78 

"
"Okay, so there were 50 fairies at first. Then 25 more came!  That's 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. But then 30 flew away.  So 75 - 30 = 45 fairies are left.


45 

"
"Okay, so Jennifer's dog had 8 puppies and 3 have spots. Brandon's dog had 12 puppies and 4 have spots.  That means there are 3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.

There are 8 + 12 = 20 puppies in total.

So, 7 out of 20 puppies have spots.  That's like 35%!


35 

"
"Okay, let's see... the farmer has a lot of feed!  He's got two little boxes of sugar cubes, four big bags of carrots, a whole bunch of hay bales, and lots of sacks of oats.  His truck can only carry so much at once, so he'll need to make more than one trip.

Hmm... I think he'll need to make two trips to get all that food to his horses! 



"
"Okay, so Grayson drinks 3 cans a week and each can is worth 2 cents, so that's 3 times 2 which is 6 cents.  She also drinks 5 bottles a week and each bottle is worth 3 cents, so that's 5 times 3 which is 15 cents.  

That means she makes 6 plus 15 cents every week, which is 21 cents.  

If there are 4 weeks in a month, she makes 21 times 4 cents, which is 84 cents! 


84 

"
"Toni has lots of plants! She has 60 more plants than Frederick, who has 10. That means Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants.

Shondra has 7 less plants than Toni, so she has 16 - 7 = 9 plants. 


9

"Leila gave Ali $50 because half of $100 is $50.  

So Ali has $21 + $50 = $71 now!

"Hmm, Ashley's pizza is $15.  If she wants to give a tip that's one-fifth of the price, that's like splitting the price into five groups.  One group would be $3. So, she needs to give the delivery man $3 extra.

That means she should give him $15 + $3 = $18! 


$18

"Okay, so Finley starts in first place. Then she goes back a little, then up a little, then back again.  Finally, she moves up one spot.  Hmm... I think she finished in 6th place! 



"
"Miss Maria has lots of cards! She has six groups of basketball cards with 25 in each group. That's 6 times 25, which is 150 cards!  She also has five boxes of baseball cards with 40 in each box. That's 5 times 40, which is 200 cards!

She keeps 50 for herself, so she gives 150 plus 200 minus 50, which is 300 cards to her students. If each student gets 10 cards, she has 300 divided by 10, which is 30 students!

"Becky's apples cost 20 times 45 cents, which is 9 dollars. But she got a dollar off, so she paid 8 dollars.

Kelly's apples cost 20 times 50 cents, which is 10 dollars. She got 10 percent off, which is 1 dollar. So she paid 9 dollars.

Kelly paid 1 dollar more than Becky.

"
"Okay, so each room has two sheets, one big blanket, and then four pillowcases 'cause it's two times the sheets. And then there's eight towels 'cause that's two times the pillowcases!

So that's two plus one plus four plus eight, which is fifteen things to wash in each room.

If there are eighty rooms, we gotta do fifteen times eighty...  

That's a lot of laundry! It's 1200 pieces! 



"
"Okay, so Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. Then he gets more shoes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday!  

Let's see... 5 pairs on Monday is 10 more shoes (5 times 2).

Then he gets 15 pairs on Wednesday, that's 30 more shoes (15 times 2).

And on Friday, he gets 30 pairs, which is 60 more shoes (30 times 2).

So now he has 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes!

But wait, he gets rid of some on Saturday. He loses 180 shoes.

That means he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes left.

"
"Mary has lots of sprinkles! She can make 8 cupcakes with each jar, and she has 6 jars. That's a lot of cupcakes!  If each pan holds 12 cupcakes, she'll need 4 pans to use up all her sprinkles.

"
"Okay, so Theo bought a pen for $2. The paper cost $5 because it was $1 less than three times the price of the pen.  That means everything cost $7 in total.  She gave the cashier $10, so she got $3 back. 


$3
"
"Okay, so there were 30 kids in Marissa's class and they each had 10 pencils. That's a lot of pencils!  So that's 30 times 10, which is 300 pencils.

Then they used some pencils, 1 out of every 5 pencils were gone.  So 300 divided by 5 is 60 pencils gone.

That means they had 300 minus 60, which is 240 pencils left.

But then they used even more!  They only had 1 out of every 3 pencils left. So 240 divided by 3 is 80 pencils.


So the answer is 80. 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Matt wants 5 cookies. He gets 2 extra for cleaning his room, so he must get 5 - 2 = 3 cookies from eating carrots.

If he gets half the number of carrots as cookies, he needs to eat 3 x 2 = 6 carrots!

"
"Okay, so the shark is super big, 10 feet long!  And the little remoras are 6 inches each.  That's like, teeny tiny compared to the shark.  

Let's see... two remoras are 6 + 6 = 12 inches.

The shark is way bigger, 10 feet is like a whole bunch of inches!  Hmm, 10 times 12 is 120 inches.

So the remoras are 12 out of 120 inches of the shark.  That's like, 10%!

"
"If 20 kids don't have computers, and that's one-fourth of the class, then there must be 20 times 4 kids in the whole class!

That's 80 kids! 



"
"Okay, so Jason has three weeks to break in his shoes. That's like, um, 21 days!  He walks four days a week, so that's 21 times 4, which is 84 days.  He needs to walk for 240 minutes total.  So, if we split that up over 84 days, it's 240 divided by 84... hmm... that's a little tricky.  It's a little less than 3 minutes each day.

"
"Sarah bought 20 books.  If she gives them to her 4 kids the same amount, each kid gets 5 books!

"
"Okay, so there are 32 kids in Gina's class.  Some have allergies. 9 kids have dairy allergies, 6 have peanut allergies, and 3 have both.  

To find out how many don't have any allergies, we gotta do some subtracting!

Let's see... 32 kids total, minus the 12 kids with allergies (9 dairy + 6 peanut - 3 both) equals 20 kids!


20 

"
"Let's see... they have 3 groups with 200 people in each group. So that's 3 times 200, which is 600 people!  And then there are 7 helpers for each group, so that's 3 times 7, which is 21 helpers.  

If we add all the people together, it's 600 plus 21, which is 621 people going on the tour! 


621 

"
"Okay, so the plane tickets cost a lot, $5000 each! That's $5000 times 2, which is $10,000.

The hotel is more expensive because it's a busy weekend. It's normally $1500 a day, but it costs extra, 20% more.  That's like adding a little bit more money on top.

20% of $1500 is $300, so each day costs $1500 + $300 = $1800.

They stay for 3 days, so the hotel costs $1800 times 3, which is $5400.

Now, let's add the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

Wow, that's a lot of money for a trip!


$15400 

"
"Ben has lots of paint! Jasper has less blue paint than Ben, only half as much. But Jasper has lots of yellow paint, three times more than Ben!  Let's see... if Ben has 4 blue and Jasper has half, that's 2 blue for Jasper. And if Ben has 3 yellow and Jasper has three times that, that's 9 yellow for Jasper!  So Jasper has 2 blue plus 9 yellow, which is 11 tubes of paint!

"
"The 1959 penny is the bigger one, and the 2010 penny is a little smaller.  If the big one weighs 48 grains, and the little one is three-quarters of that, it weighs 36 grains (because 48 divided by 4 is 12, and 12 times 3 is 36).

So, if you add them together, 36 plus 48 is 84.

"
"Okay, so Stetson ate a bunch of oranges, right?  They picked 60 oranges, and he ate 2 out of every 5.  That means he ate 24 oranges!

He had to give up $10 for each orange, so he gave up 24 times $10.  That's $240!


$240 

"
"Okay, so Jillian's shoes cost $80. Her bag cost three times that much, but then $20 less.  Hmmm... so three times $80 is $240.  Then we take away $20, which makes it $220.

$220 

"
"Okay, so James runs a lot! He runs 12 miles every day, and he does that for 5 days.  That's a lot of miles!  

If he runs 10 miles every hour, let's see... hmm...  

He runs 60 miles a week, so that means he runs for 6 hours every week.

"
"Okay, so Uncle Ben has four horsies, and each one eats five pounds of oats for each meal. He feeds them two times a day, so that's ten pounds a day for each horsie!  

Since he has four horses, that's 40 pounds of oats every day!  

If he needs to feed them for five days, he'll need 200 pounds of oats (40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds).

Each bag has 50 pounds of oats, so he needs four bags!

"
"Okay, so Jana has lots of puppies!  Two thirds of them are Pomeranians, which are super fluffy. That's like, 18 Pomeranians! And one third of those are girls.  So, hmm... one third of 18 is 6.

Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians. 

"
"Okay, so we gotta find the middle temperature. Southlandia is super cold at -48, Northlandia is warmer at 21, and Midlandia is in between at -3.  

If we add them all up, it's like having -48 toys, then getting 21 more toys, and then losing 3.  

Let's see... -48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

Now we gotta split those -30 toys between the three countries.  -30 split by 3 is -10.


-10 

"
"Okay, so the toy car costs $12 and he has $4. That means he needs $8 more.  If he saves $2 each day, it will take him 4 days to save enough money.

"
"Jaime can put 24 eggs on each tray, and he has two trays, so that's 24 + 24 = 48 eggs.  He has 64 eggs, and 48 can fit on the trays, so he has 64 - 48 = 16 eggs left over.

"
"The big pizza costs $8 times 3, which is $24.  So the big pizza is $24 and the small pizza is $8.  If you add those together, it's $24 + $8 = $32.

"
"Okay, so Heather gets two packs of razors, and each pack has four razors. That's eight razors in total!  

The razors cost four dollars a pack, so two packs cost eight dollars. But they're buy one get one free, so she only pays four dollars! Then she has a coupon for two dollars off, so the razors only cost two dollars.

That means each razor costs twenty-five cents!

"
"Okay, so there are nine tall cheerleaders and one shorter one.  The tall ones are all 64 inches, and the short one is 60 inches.  They make a pyramid, with four on the bottom, then three, then two, and the shortest one on top.  

Let's see... nine times 64 is 576.  Plus the short one's 60 inches, that's 636 inches total for the tall part.  

There are 12 inches in a foot, so 636 divided by 12 is 53 feet! 


53 

"
"Okay, so Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours. That's 5 times 8, which is 40 minutes of walking each day.  

If she does that for 5 days, it's like adding 40 minutes five times.  That's 40 + 40 + 40 + 40 + 40, which equals 200 minutes!


200 

"
"Okay, so Brett is 14 now. In four years, he'll be 18.  His sister Angela will be 54 then, 'cause that's three times 18.  So now Angela is 50, 'cause 54 take away 4 is 50.

"
"Okay, so Paul drives twice a day, and that costs him $6 in the morning and $2 in the afternoon.  That's $6 + $2 = $8 every day.

He does this for 14 days, so it's $8 x 14 = $112.

He spent $112 on driving. 



"
"Ashley brought a lot of oranges! She had five boxes, and each box had ten oranges inside. That's 5 times 10, which is 50 oranges! Brianne brought even more oranges, 20 more than Ashley. So she had 50 plus 20, which is 70 oranges.  

Together they have 50 plus 70, which is 120 oranges.  Each pie needs 3 oranges, so they can make 120 divided by 3, which is 40 pies! 

40 

"
"Okay, so Mark wants to have a party for his wife. One place costs $200 no matter how many people come, but he has to pay extra for food, $5 for each person. The other place costs $25 for each person, but food is already included.  

To figure out when they cost the same, we gotta think about how many people would make the costs equal.  

Hmm... if 10 people come, the first place would cost $200 + (10 people * $5/person) = $250. The second place would cost 10 people * $25/person = $250.

So, 10 guests would make the two places cost the same!

"
"Okay, so Bodhi found some bugs, and David found half as many as Bodhi. Lily found 7 more bugs than David.  All together they found 43 bugs. Hmm... let me see...

If David found half of what Bodhi found, and they found 43 bugs together, Bodhi must have found a lot!  

Let's see... if we take away 7 from Lily's bugs, she'd have the same as David.  And David has half of what Bodhi has.  

This is tricky!  I need to think about it some more... 



"
"Okay, so Mariah used a quarter of the yarn, and her grandma used half. That's like cutting the yarn into four pieces and Mariah took one, and grandma took two!  

A whole skein has 364 yards, so Mariah used 91 yards (cause 364 divided by 4 is 91). Grandma used 182 yards (cause 364 divided by 2 is 182).

If you add those together, they used 273 yards in total!


273 

"
"Okay, so Cherrie has 5 friends. Two friends want lots of gifts, five each! That's 2 times 5, which is 10 gifts.  The other friends only want 2 gifts each, and there are 3 of them, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 gifts.  

That's 10 plus 6, which is 16 gifts. But wait, she buys 10 more! So that's 16 plus 10, which is 26 gifts!


26 

"
"Okay, so the chair is 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet bigger than that, so it's 8 feet wide.  The couch is twice as wide as the rug, which is 16 feet, and then 2 feet longer, so it's 18 feet long!

"Okay, so Frederick wants lots of popsicle sticks but doesn't want to spend too much money.  He can get more sticks from the bigger piece of wood, even though it costs a little more.  If he buys four of the bigger pieces, he can make 1600 popsicles! 


1600 

"
"Let's see... Mario has 6 dogs, and each dog needs 4 snowshoes. So that's 6 times 4, which is 24 snowshoes.

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, and he needs 24 snowshoes, so that's 24 times $12.00...  

Hmm, 24 times 12 is... $288.00! 


$288.00
"
"Okay, so Janet takes the bus a lot!  Two times a day, five days a week. That's ten bus rides!

Each ride costs $2.20, so ten rides cost 10 times $2.20, which is $22.00.

But if she buys a pass for $20.00, she saves $2.00!


$2.00 

"
"Okay, let's count the animals!

The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep. That's 30 + 10 = 40 animals on the farm.

The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep. That's 60 + 20 = 80 animals at the zoo.

If we add them all together, there are 40 + 80 = 120 animals!

"Rose bought lots of onions and potatoes! She got 12 onions and 4 potatoes. That's 'cause she bought 4 times more than Sophia.  So Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.  

That means Sophia bought 4 things in total! 



"
"Okay, so Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.  That's a lot!  He has until July, which is a long time. To lose a pound, you gotta burn 3500 calories.  So, 30 pounds is 30 times 3500... hmm... that's a big number!  

Let's see... if he has 200 days, he needs to lose a little bit each day.  

So, 105,000 calories / 200 days... that means he needs to burn 525 extra calories each day! 


525 

"
"Gerald gets $30 each day, and he worked for seven days, so he made 30 times 7 which is 210 dollars!  He spent 100 dollars, so he has 210 minus 100 dollars left. That's 110 dollars!


$110 

"
"Okay, so Hannah runs 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km. That means she runs 8 times 0.25 which is 2 kilometers!  

She needs 60 ml of water for every kilometer, so for 2 kilometers she needs 2 times 60 which is 120 ml of water.


120 

"
"Okay, so Julie starts with $500. She spends some on clothes, then some on CDs.  

First, she spends 20% on clothes. That's like 20 out of every 100 dollars. So she spends $100 on clothes.

Now she has $400 left. Then she spends 25% of that on CDs. That's like 25 out of every 100 dollars, so she spends another $100 on CDs.

That means she has $300 left.


$300 

"
"Okay, so the house and the lot together cost $120,000.  The house is three times more expensive than the lot.  That means if we think of the lot as one part, the house is three parts.  That's four parts in total.

So, we gotta split the $120,000 into four equal parts.  

$120,000 divided by 4 is $30,000.

That means the lot costs $30,000.

But the house is three times more expensive, so it costs $30,000 times 3, which is $90,000!


$90,000 

"
"Tara bought lots of bags, 8 packs with 5 bags in each pack. That's 40 bags in total! She paid $4 for each pack, so that's $160 altogether. Then she painted them and sold them for $8 each, so she made $320!  If you take away the money she spent, she made $160 profit.


$160 

"
"Okay, so Joe punches a lot! He punches 25 times every minute.  A fight has 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long.  Hmm... let's see... 

That's 25 punches every minute times 3 minutes, so that's 75 punches in each round. And since there are 5 rounds, it's 75 punches times 5...  

That's 375 punches! 



"
"Suzanne made lots of cookies! Josh made a quarter of Suzanne's cookies, so he made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies. Kelsie made twice as many cookies as Josh, so she made 9 x 2 = 18 cookies.

"
"Ali has four ten dollar bills, so that's 4 times 10 which is 40 dollars. He also has six twenty dollar bills, so that's 6 times 20 which is 120 dollars.  

That means he has 40 plus 120 dollars, which is 160 dollars in total.

He gives half of that to his sister, so he gives her 160 divided by 2 which is 80 dollars.

That leaves him with 160 minus 80 dollars, which is 80 dollars.

He spends 3 out of every 5 dollars on dinner, so he spends 80 times 3 divided by 5 which is 48 dollars.

That means he has 80 minus 48 dollars left, which is 32 dollars.


$32 

"
"Okay, so Rob takes 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.  Royce takes twice that long, so that's 120 times 2, which is 240 minutes. But Royce takes even longer, 40 more minutes than that! So Royce takes 240 plus 40, which is 280 minutes.

"
"Let's see... she needs lots of wool!

* Each kid gets 2 for a hat plus 4 for a scarf plus 12 for a sweater plus 1 for mittens plus 2 for socks. That's 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 skeins for each kid.
* Since she has 3 kids, she needs 21 times 3, which is 63 skeins!

"
"Okay, so Chris has lots of math problems! He did 12 on Monday, and then 3 times that on Tuesday, so that's 12 x 3 = 36 problems.  

That's 12 + 36 = 48 problems done already.

He had 100 to start with, so he has 100 - 48 = 52 left.

On Wednesday, he did a quarter of those, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

That means he has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left for Thursday.

"
"Okay, so Tony picks 6 quarts. Bobby picks 1 less than Tony, so he picks 5 quarts. Kathy picks twice as much as Bobby, so she picks 5 times 2 which is 10 quarts. Ricky picks 2 less than Kathy, so he picks 10 minus 2 which is 8 quarts.  

If you add them all up, 6 plus 5 plus 10 plus 8 equals 29 quarts!

"
"They baked 200 loaves, sold 93 in the morning and 39 in the afternoon. That's 93 + 39 = 132 loaves sold.

Then they had 200 - 132 = 68 loaves left.

"
"Let's see... Jackson has lots of tulips! He puts 6 red ones in each row, and he has 36 red tulips.  So that's 36 divided by 6, which is 6 rows of red tulips.

He puts 8 blue tulips in each row, and he has 24 blue tulips. So that's 24 divided by 8, which is 3 rows of blue tulips.

That means he has 6 rows + 3 rows, which is 9 rows in total! 


9 

"
"Okay, so Heather has lots of raisins! She wants to share them equally for cookies, granola, and snack mix. That means each thing gets 27 cups / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Cookies need 3/4 cup of raisins for each batch.  So, Heather can make 9 cups / (3/4 cup/batch) = 12 batches of cookies!


12 

"
"Okay, so Ada uses 12 of those electric thingy-ma-bobs each hour.  Each one costs a dollar fifty. So that's 12 times a dollar fifty, which is 18 dollars a day!

Now she wants to add something that uses 2 more electric thingy-ma-bobs. So now she's using 14 thingy-ma-bobs. That's 14 times a dollar fifty, which is 21 dollars a day!

That means she's spending 3 more dollars each day.  In a week, that's 3 times 7, which is 21 more dollars!


$21.00 

"
"Okay, so one person takes 5 days to paint half a house.  That means it takes them 10 days to paint the whole house.

If we have 5 people helping, it's like having 5 times the painters! So it would take them 10 days / 5 people = 2 days to paint the whole house.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take them 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours.


48 

"
"Okay, so Ophelia has 20 sofas.  She has 2 more chairs than sofas, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has three times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 22 x 3 = 66 chairs.

Jenna also has 2 less sofas than chairs, so she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Altogether, they have 20 + 64 = 84 sofas.

And they have 22 + 66 = 88 chairs.

That means they have 84 + 88 = 172 sofas and chairs all together! 


172 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Tom spent $48 and the CD cost $4. That means the headphones cost $48 - $4 = $44.

If he didn't buy the headphones, he could have bought $44 / $4 = 11 more CDs!

"
"Okay, so Josh worked out for 4 hours every week for most of the time. That's like, 4 hours, 4 hours, 4 hours, 4 hours, 4 hours, 4 hours... for six weeks! That's 24 hours!

Then he did extra one time for two weeks, 5 hours each week. So that's 5 + 5 = 10 more hours.

And one more time he did 6 hours.

Let's add it all up: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours! 


40
"
"Okay, so there were 48 people on the bus. Then 8 got off, and 40 got on!  That's 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 people.

"Okay, so Jame is gonna be 27 in 5 years, so right now he's 22.  In 8 years, he'll be 30. His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age then, so the cousin will be 55.  But that's in 8 years!  So the cousin is 47 now. That means the cousin is 25 years older than Jame. 


25 

"
"Okay, so Errol bought a computer for $1100. The printer was $400 cheaper, so it cost $700.  That means the computer and printer together cost $1100 + $700 = $1800.

He spent $2400 in total, so the two monitors cost $2400 - $1800 = $600.

If one monitor costs the same as the other, then one monitor costs $600 / 2 = $300.


$300 

"
"There were 10 girls. The boys found 60 shells each, so they found 60 x 10 = 600 shells.

The girls found 600 + (60 x 4) = 600 + 240 = 840 shells.

Each girl found 840 / 10 = 84 shells.

"Okay, let's see...

The first book is 31 mm, and the second one is 50 mm. The third book is 5 mm less than the second, so it's 45 mm. The last book is double the first book, so it's 31 times 2 which is 62 mm.

Now, we add them all up: 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

"Okay, so the dinner was $50, and we split it in half, so that's $25 each. But my wife wants me to pay extra for the tip.  The tip is 20% of $50, which is like 20 out of every 100 dollars. So that's $10 for the tip.

So I pay my half, which is $25, plus the $10 tip. That means I pay $35.


$35 

"
"Okay, so the eldest boy got $6 at first. Then he got $5 more, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day he got another $10, so he had $11 + $10 = $21.

Then he tripled his money, so he has $13 x 3 = $39 now!

"Okay, so Elvis wants to save $1125 this month.  That's a lot! He wants to save double in the second half of April than the first half. April has 30 days, so that's 15 days in each half.

Let's see... half of $1125 is $562.50.  He needs to save that much in the second half.

If he saves the same amount each day for the last 15 days, he needs to save $562.50 divided by 15 days.  That's $37.50 each day!


$37.50 

"
"Okay, let's see... Verna bought three apples for a dollar fifty each, so that's 3 times 1 dollar fifty, which is 4 dollars and 50 cents.  Then she got five oranges for 80 cents each, so that's 5 times 80 cents, which is 4 dollars. And six peaches for 75 cents each, so that's 6 times 75 cents, which is 4 dollars and 50 cents.

So all together, that's 4 dollars and 50 cents plus 4 dollars plus 4 dollars and 50 cents, which is 13 dollars.

If she gave the store 20 dollars, she gets 20 dollars minus 13 dollars, which is 7 dollars in change! 



"
"Jairus earns 80 cents for every task, and Jenny earns 50 cents. If they both do 20 tasks, Jairus will get 16 dollars (80 cents x 20 = 1600 cents, which is 16 dollars) and Jenny will get 10 dollars (50 cents x 20 = 1000 cents, which is 10 dollars).

So Jairus will get 6 dollars more than Jenny (16 - 10 = 6).


6 

"
"Okay, so Jeff gets four times more than Brad.  That means if Brad gets $1, Jeff gets $4.  We gotta figure out how to split $100 so that happens. Hmmm... let's see... if we give Brad $20, then Jeff gets $80! That's four times more!

$80 

"
"Okay, so Jeff walks 3 miles to work and then 3 miles back home, so that's 6 miles each day.  If he works 5 days a week, he walks 6 times 5 which is 30 miles! 


30 

"
"Okay, so Elise writes the whole alphabet two times, that's 26 letters times 2, which is 52 letters. Then she writes half the alphabet, so that's 26 divided by 2, which is 13 letters.  

So far she wrote 52 plus 13, which is 65 letters.

Then she writes all those letters again, so that's another 65 letters.

That means she wrote a total of 65 plus 65, which is 130 letters! 


130 

"
"Okay, so Ali calls 3 families first. Then each of those families calls 3 more families.  And then those families call 3 more, and then those families call 3 more!  Let's see... that's a lot of families!  

Hmm... I think it would be 81 families in the fourth round. 



"
"Mark was sick for a long time and lost weight. He lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months. That's a lot of weight! If he weighed 70 pounds at the end, he must have weighed more before.  

Let's see... 10 pounds lost each month for 3 months is 30 pounds total. So, if he weighed 70 pounds after losing weight, he must have weighed 100 pounds before. 


100 

"
"Okay, so James has 80 toys. Jonathan wants five times that many, so that's 80 times 5 which is 400 toys!  But Jonathan needs 2 more toys to get to 400.  That means he has 398 toys right now. 


398 

"
"Okay, let's see...

Daniel needs five notebooks, and each one costs a dollar fifty, so that's five times a dollar fifty... hmm... that's seven dollars fifty!

He also wants two pens at twenty-five cents each. Two times twenty-five cents is fifty cents.

A calculator costs twelve dollars, and a geometry set is ten dollars.

So, all together it's seven dollars fifty plus fifty cents plus twelve dollars plus ten dollars... that's thirty dollars!

But wait! The shop has a discount of ten percent. Ten percent of thirty dollars is... hmm... three dollars!

So, Daniel only has to pay thirty dollars minus three dollars, which is twenty-seven dollars! 


$27
"
"Okay, let's see... Carly buys five hamburgers for four dollars each, so that's 5 times 4, which is 20 dollars.  Then she gets ten packs of fries, and each pack is 30 cents, so that's 10 times 30 cents... hmm... that's 3 dollars!  And five drinks at 2 dollars each is 5 times 2, which is 10 dollars.

So all together, that's 20 plus 3 plus 10, which is 33 dollars.  She paid with a fifty dollar bill, so she gets 50 minus 33 dollars back... that's 17 dollars!


$17 

"
"Okay, so Antonella sold lots of stuff!  

First, she sold $1000 worth, and she gets 30% of that, which is like 30 cents for every dollar. So that's $300!

She sold even more, another $1500! For that extra stuff, she gets 10% which is like 10 cents for every dollar. So that's $150!

Let's add it up: $300 + $150 = $450!

Antonella earned $450. 



"
"Okay, so Bill has 2 boxes of water, and each box has 24 waters. That's 2 times 24, which is 48 waters!

He has lots of friends coming over, 70 of them! And he wants each friend to have 2 waters. So that's 70 times 2, which is 140 waters.

Hmmm, so he needs 140 waters but only has 48.  That means he needs to buy 140 minus 48 more waters.  

140 take away 48 is 92.

He needs to buy 92 more waters! 


92 

"
"Okay, so Ray swims fast when the water is cold. It takes him 16 minutes to swim a mile. When it's warm, it takes him longer.  Twice as long as 16 minutes is 32 minutes, and then add 2 more minutes, so it takes him 34 minutes in warm water.

If he swims 3 miles in cold water, that's 16 minutes times 3, which is 48 minutes.

In warm water, it's 34 minutes times 3, which is 102 minutes.

That means it takes him 102 minus 48 minutes longer in warm water, which is 54 minutes!


54 

"
"Okay, so John makes $2 for every hour he works. He works 5 hours each day, and he works 4 days a week. That means he makes $10 each day.  

If he works for a whole week, he makes $40. He wants to save $80, so it will take him 2 weeks. 


2 

"
"Hmm, let's see... the fish sub costs $40.  The cold-cut combo is three times that, so it costs $40 x 3 = $120.  

If I add those together, it's $40 + $120 = $160.

So lunch costs $160 today. 



"
"Okay, so there are 21 buttons in total.  Some have two holes, and some have four.  Seven buttons have two holes, so the rest have four holes. That's 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with four holes.

Those 14 buttons have 14 * 4 = 56 holes!

And the seven buttons with two holes have 7 * 2 = 14 holes.

Let's add them all up: 56 + 14 = 70 holes!


70 

"
"Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, so it's 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's, so it's 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches.

"
"Hmm, this is a tricky one!

Octavia drinks half the coffee she's supposed to. Juan drinks ten times more than her. The doctor says Juan should only drink 4 cups.  

So, Juan needs to figure out how much less he's drinking than 4 cups.  

Let me see...  If we knew how much Octavia drinks, we could figure it out! 



"
"Let's see... there are 3 cages with 10 hamsters, so that's 3 times 10 which is 30 hamsters.  Then there are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs, so that's 3 times 5 which is 15 guinea pigs.  

If we add them all up, 30 hamsters plus 15 guinea pigs makes 45 rodents! 


45 

"
"Okay, so Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so she weighs 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so he weighs 260 pounds.

To find the average, we add up their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

Then we divide that by 3 because there are three friends: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.


180 

"
"Okay, so the sun starts at 32 degrees and goes up 5 degrees every hour for 10 hours.  That's like climbing stairs! 

So it goes up 50 degrees (5 times 10).  

That means the sun will be 82 degrees up from the ground! 



"
"Let's see... James has two sons. One is 12, and the other is 8 because he's 4 years younger.  That means James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles!

Each pack has 5 candles, so he needs 20 / 5 = 4 packs of candles.

If each pack costs $3, then he spends 4 * $3 = $12 on candles.


$12 

"
"Let's see... Judy read for 15 minutes every night for a whole week, that's like 15 times 7, which is 105 minutes!

And she reads 2 pages every 1.5 minutes, so in the first week she read 105 divided by 1.5, which is 70 pages.

Then she read 100 pages in the second week.

So in total, she read 70 plus 100 pages, which is 170 pages! 


170 

"
"Cody ate 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

That's 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches gone.

So there are 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches left! 

5 

"
"Shiloh is 44 now, so in 7 years he'll be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

That's like three times as old as his nephew will be then.  So if we think about it, Shiloh's nephew will be 51 / 3 = 17 years old in 7 years.

That means the nephew is 17 - 7 = 10 years old today! 



"
"The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00 for her first tooth. Then she got $1.00 for each of the next three teeth, so that's $1.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $3.00.  

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half of $1.00, which is $0.50 for each tooth. So that's $0.50 + $0.50 = $1.00.

Let's add it all up: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00


$9.00 

"
"Richie scored lots of goals! He got 80. Mark got 20 less than Richie, so he got 60. Anna got 45 less than Richie, so she got 35.  If you add them all up, 80 plus 60 plus 35 is 175!


175 

"
"Mitchell sold 21 lemonades for $4 each, so he made 21 times 4 dollars, which is $84.  Liam only made $63.  That means Mitchell made $84 - $63 = $21 more than Liam.


$21 

"
"Okay, so Peter has $70. He spends $5 each day for four days on wooden toys. That's $5 x 4 = $20.

He has $70 - $20 = $50 left.

The plastic toys cost $2 each, so he can buy $50 / $2 = 25 plastic toys.

He bought 4 wooden toys, so he has 25 + 4 = 29 toys in total! 


29 

"
"Let's see... the kitty's spaying was $200.  Her shots were $20 each, and she had 3 of those, so that's $20 x 3 = $60. Uh oh, she broke 4 vases at $12 each, so that's $12 x 4 = $48.

Okay, to find the total, we add it all up: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.


 

"
"Ford grows 40 roses every week.

The flower shops need 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses every week.

Ford needs 65 - 40 = 25 more roses each week.

That means he needs 25 * 4 = 100 more roses every month!


100 

"
"Okay, so Katina starts with $3000.  She takes out $100 every month, and there are 12 months in a year. So in one year, she takes out $100 x 12 = $1200.

She does that for two years, so that's $1200 x 2 = $2400 taken out total.

If she started with $3000 and took out $2400, she has $3000 - $2400 = $600 left.


$600 

"
"Okay, so they spend $3 on bread and that makes 10 sandwiches.  That means each sandwich costs 30 cents for bread. They also spend $30 on cheese and stuff for 10 sandwiches, so that's $3 more per sandwich.  So each sandwich costs $3.30 to make. They sell each one for $7.00, so they make $3.70 profit on each sandwich. If they sell 10, that's $3.70 times 10, which is $37.00!


$37.00 

"
"Kate has lots of crayons! She can make 24 crayon muffins. If she sells each one for $1.50, she can make $36.00!

"
"Okay, so Michael needs new carpet for his room. His room is 18 feet long and 12 feet wide, so that's 18 times 12 which is 216 squares.

The carpet costs $12 for each square, so that's 216 times 12, which is $2592.

He also needs padding, which is $2 for each square, so that's 216 times 2, which is $432.

Taking out the old carpet costs $4 per square, so that's 216 times 4, which is $864.

Putting the new carpet in costs $34 per square, so that's 216 times 34, which is $7344.

Now we add all that up: $2592 plus $432 plus $864 plus $7344 equals $11232.


$11232
"
"Okay, so Mack saw birds for a whole week! Let's see...

* Day 1 & 2: 50 birds
* Day 3: No birds
* Day 4 & 5: 120 birds
* Day 6: 20 birds
* Day 7: 90 birds

Hmm, to find the average, we gotta add all the birds up and then split them into the 7 days.

280 birds all together... so 280 split into 7 days is... 40 birds each day!


40 

"
"Okay, so Diane starts with 20. Then she adds half of 20, which is 10. That makes 30.  Then she divides 30 by 5, which is 6.  Then she takes 20 and takes away 12, which is 8.  Finally, she multiplies 6 by 8, and that's 48!

"
"Okay, so Maggie's oven is a little too hot. It says 450 but it's really 468.  That's like, 18 degrees too hot!

If she wants it to be 520, she needs to set it a little lower.  Hmm, 18 degrees is like 4% too hot. So, she should set it 4% lower than 520.

Let me see... 4% of 520 is 20.8.  So she should set it to 520 minus 20.8... which is 499.2!


499.2 

"
"Okay, so the first movie is an hour and a half long. That's like 90 minutes.  The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes, so that's 2 times 60 minutes which is 120 minutes, plus 5 more minutes, so 125 minutes.

If we add those together, 90 plus 125 is 215 minutes. 


215 

"
"Okay, so Herb's house cost $76,000. Juan's house is cheaper, like 30% less.  That means we gotta take 30 out of every 100 from Herb's price.  

Hmm, 30 out of 100 is like 3 dimes out of every dollar.  So, 30% of $76,000 is $22,800.

Now we take that away from Herb's price: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200. That's how much Juan's house costs.

To find the total, we add both prices: $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.


So the answer is $129,200. 

"
"Judy has 12 cups and 12 times 2 is 24 dishes. That's 12 plus 24, which is 36 things. Her friend has 40 cups and 24 plus 20 is 44 dishes. That's 40 plus 44, which is 84 things.  So, together they have 36 plus 84, which is 120 things!


120 

"
"Okay, so Pete gets 90 contacts in one box, and that lasts him 45 days.  That means each contact lasts him one day, right?  

If he buys two boxes, that's 90 contacts x 2 = 180 contacts!

Each box costs $100, but it's on sale for 10% off, so that's $10 off.  So each box costs $90. Two boxes cost $90 x 2 = $180.

So, 180 contacts cost $180.  That means each contact costs $180 / 180 = $1.00!


$1.00 

"
"Okay, so Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, that's 3 hours total.  John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 times 2, which is 4 hours. On Sunday, he worked 3 times longer than Jill, so that's 1 times 3, which is 3 hours.  That means John worked 4 plus 3, which is 7 hours.

Jill made 3 times 10 dollars, which is 30 dollars. John made 7 times 10 dollars, which is 70 dollars.  

John made 70 dollars and Jill made 30 dollars, so John made 70 - 30 = 40 dollars more than Jill.


$40 

"
"Okay, so Hannah burns lots of calories working out!  She burns 500 calories every hour doing aerobics, and she does that for 2 hours. That's 500 times 2, which is 1000 calories! Then she runs for an hour and burns 600 calories doing that. So in total, she burns 1000 plus 600, which is 1600 calories.

She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories. So we need to see how many times 200 goes into 1600.  That's 1600 divided by 200, which is 8.  

So she needs to drink 8 times 100 ml, which is 800 ml of water.


800 

"
"Okay, so there are lots of jelly beans!  

The blue ones are the starting point.  We know there are some red ones, but there are a little less of them. And there are some green ones, but there are a little more of them than the blue ones.

All together there are 4500 jelly beans. That's a lot to count!

Hmmm... if we take away a little from the blue ones to get the red ones, and add a little to the blue ones to get the green ones, we can figure out how many more green ones there are than red ones.

Let's see...  

It's 30 more green jelly beans! 



"
"Okay, so Jared starts at 47 words per minute. Then he gets better and goes to 52 words per minute. If he gets even better by 5 more words, he'll be at 57 words per minute!

To find the average, we add all the numbers together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Then we divide that by 3 because there are three numbers: 156 / 3 = 52


52 

"
"If Martin eats Cheerios he loses weight, and if he eats donuts he gains weight.  Let's see... he loses 1.25 pounds each week with Cheerios and that's for 5 weeks, so that's 1.25 times 5 which is 6.25 pounds less.  With donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds each week for 5 weeks, so that's 1.75 times 5 which is 8.75 pounds more.  

Hmmm, so he'd be 8.75 more pounds with donuts and 6.25 less pounds with Cheerios.  That means the difference is 8.75 minus 6.25 which is 2.5 pounds.


2.5 

"
"Okay, so Alex invited 100 people.  Then each of those people brings 2 friends, so that's 100 times 2 which is 200 more people!  

Then she calls 10 more friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses, so that's 8 more people.

Let's add it all up: 100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318 people!

Alex needs 318 seats. 



"
"Okay, so the little Affenpinscher dog weighs 10 pounds. The Dachshund is bigger, twice as big, so it weighs 20 pounds! The Papillon is smaller, only a fourth of the Dachshund's weight, so it weighs 5 pounds.  Now, the Mastiff is a really big dog, 44 times bigger than the Papillon!  So, 44 times 5 is... 220 pounds! Wow, that's a big dog!


220 

"
"Okay, so the boots on Amazon cost 16 dollars plus 4 dollars for shipping, that's 20 dollars.

On eBay, the boots are 13 dollars, but shipping is 8 dollars because it's twice as much as Amazon. So that's 13 plus 8, which is 21 dollars.

That means the boots are 5 dollars more expensive on eBay.

"The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and gets twice as tall each day.

Day 1: It's 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet tall.
Day 2: It's 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet tall.
Day 3: It's 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet tall!

That's taller than the window! So it takes 3 days.

"
"Okay, so John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.  And each 100 grams has 3 grams of protein.  That means in 200 grams there's 6 grams of protein!

He eats that every day, so in a whole week, that's 6 grams a day times 7 days... which is 42 grams of protein!


42 

"
"Hmm, let me think... If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means he's grown a lot!  

If he's twice as old now, he must be 10 years old now.  

In 3 more years, he'll be 13!

"
"Okay, so George needs two implants that cost $2000 each. That's $2000 plus $2000, which is $4000.  Then he wants a fancy crown for one of them that costs $500 more. So now it's $4000 plus $500, which is $4500.

He already paid $600, so he still needs $4500 minus $600, which is $3900.

He makes $15 every hour at work.  To get $3900, he needs to work $3900 divided by $15, which is 260 hours.


260 

"
"Okay, so we have a triangle, right?  And all the angles inside a triangle add up to 180.

One angle is like the baby angle, the smallest one.  Another angle is twice as big as the baby angle, and the last one is three times as big!

Hmm, let's see... if the baby angle is, say, 30, then the next one is 30 times 2, which is 60. And the biggest one is 30 times 3, which is 90!

So the biggest angle is 90 degrees! 


90

"Okay, let's see...

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 times 4, which is 20 legs!

Cats also have 4 legs, so 2 cats have 2 times 4, which is 8 legs.

Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 times 2, which is 20 legs.

Now, let's add them all up: 20 + 8 + 20 = 48 legs!


48 

"
"Okay, so Jamaal starts with 8 pounds. Then he makes it heavier by half of 8, which is 4 pounds. So now it's 8 plus 4, which is 12 pounds. But that's too much, so he takes off 2 pounds. 12 minus 2 is 10!

"
"Okay, so Steve starts with 5 games. Then he gets 1 new game each month for a whole year, that's 12 more games! Plus 5 more for Christmas, so that's 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games!

The next year he gets even more games, 2 each month, so that's 24 more games! Plus 5 more for Christmas, so now he has 22 + 24 + 5 = 51 games!

The last year he gets 4 games each month, so that's 48 more games! Plus 5 more for Christmas, so he has a lot of games now: 51 + 48 + 5 = 104 games! 

Wow, that's a lot of games!


104 

"
"Okay, so the plane goes 1200 miles in 3 hours. That means it goes super fast!  If it goes another 2000 miles, it's like going 1200 + 2000 = 3200 miles in total.

Hmm, if it goes 1200 miles in 3 hours, maybe we can figure out how long it takes to go 1000 miles...  

Let's see, 1200 miles is like 4 times 300 miles, and 3 hours is like 3 times 1 hour. So it takes 1 hour to go 300 miles.

That means it takes 1000 miles / 300 miles per hour = 3 and a bit hours to go 1000 miles.

So, to go 3200 miles, it would take 3200 miles / 300 miles per hour = 10 and a bit hours.

But we already know it took 3 hours for the first 1200 miles, so it takes 10 and a bit hours - 3 hours = 7 and a bit hours more.


 

"
"Okay, so Ruiz makes a lot of chocolate! He makes 120 pounds in just two hours. Marissa is pretty good too, she makes a little less than Ruiz.  

If they both work for a whole day, which is 12 hours, they make a ton of chocolate together! Let's see... Ruiz makes 60 pounds every hour, and Marissa makes 45 pounds every hour.  

So together, they make 60 + 45 = 105 pounds every hour!

In 12 hours, that's 105 times 12, which is 1260 pounds of chocolate! Wow!

"
"Okay, so Howard starts with $100. On Monday he spends $8, then on Tuesday he spends $8 times 2 which is $16.  On Wednesday he spends $16 times 4 which is $64.  

To find out how much he has left, we add up all the money he spent: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Then we take that away from the money he started with: $100 - $88 = $12.

Howard has $12 left.

"
"Okay, so Patrick sold a lot of lemonade!  

He sold 15 cups every hour for four hours, so that's 15 times 4, which is 60 cups.  Each cup cost 50 cents, so he made 60 times 0.50, which is $30.00.

Then he sold 10 cups every hour for two hours, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 cups. Each cup cost 60 cents, so he made 20 times 0.60, which is $12.00.

To find out how much he made in total, we add the two amounts: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00


$42.00 

"
"Okay, so the car goes 'round and 'round a lot!  

It goes 'round 725 times for every 2 miles.  Jeremy drives a lot, 400 miles every month!  That's a whole lotta 'round and 'rounds!

Each tire can go 'round 10,440,000 times before it's tired out.

Hmm, let's see...  If it goes 'round 725 times every 2 miles, and he drives 400 miles, that's a lot of times going 'round!

It can go 'round 10,440,000 times before it needs to be changed.

I think it will take 6 years before he needs new tires.

"
"Okay, so the big shampoo costs $24.  It lasts for 120 washes if you use two pumps each time. But Jackie only uses one pump, so it will last her twice as long, right? That means it'll last for 120 washes times 2, which is 240 washes!

So, each wash costs $24 divided by 240 washes, which is 10 cents.  

Since Jackie uses one pump per wash, each pump costs 10 cents! 


10
"
"Okay, so Joe has $50. The shirt is $25, but it's 30% off, so that's like getting $7.50 off!  The shorts are $35, and they're also 30% off, so that's $10.50 off.

So the shirt costs $17.50 and the shorts cost $24.50. That's $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00

Joe spends $42.00, and he started with $50.00, so he has $8.00 left! 


$8.00
"
"Okay, so Juan needs butter for his croissants. He uses a quarter pound for every group of twelve croissants.  He wants to make four groups a day, and he's making them all week long.  

Let's see... four groups a day means he needs a whole pound of butter each day! And a week has seven days, so he'll need seven pounds of butter for the whole week.


7 

"
"Okay, so Monica's street is shorter.  It costs lots of money to repave a street!  Let's see... Lewis' street is way longer, so it will cost more.  Hmm...  If we do the math, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street. 


$65960
"
"Okay, so John had $100,000 for the first 5 months. That's like having 5 piles of $100,000!

Then he needed 10 times longer, so that's 5 months times 10, which is 50 months!

For the rest of the months, he needed 50% more money each month. That means he needed half again as much, so each month cost $100,000 plus $50,000, which is $150,000!

He needed that extra money for 45 months, so that's 45 times $150,000, which is a lot of money!

Let me see... 45 times 150,000 is 6,750,000.

And don't forget the first 5 months cost $500,000.

So, all together, it cost 6,750,000 plus 500,000, which is $7,250,000!

$7,250,000 

"
"Let's see... the first player ate 6 ounces of steak. The second player ate 8 little pieces of beef, and each one was 1 ounce, so that's 8 ounces. The third player ate a big steak that was 16 ounces!  

So, 6 plus 8 plus 16 is... 30! 

They ate 30 ounces of meat. 



"
"Okay, so there are a thousand people in the group, and they each write three things every day.  That's a lot of writing!  March has thirty-one days.  So, if we multiply a thousand by three, we get three thousand. Then we multiply that by thirty-one, and that's ninety-three thousand! 


93000 

"
"Okay, so Gary washes clothes two times every week. Each time he washes, he uses 20 big jugs of water. Each jug costs 15 cents.  

Let's see... there are 52 weeks in a year, so he washes clothes 2 times a week * 52 weeks = 104 times a year.

That's a lot of washing! He uses 104 times * 20 jugs = 2080 jugs of water a year.

Now, if each jug costs 15 cents, then 2080 jugs * 15 cents = 31200 cents.

Hmm, that's a lot of cents!  There are 100 cents in a dollar, so 31200 cents / 100 cents/dollar = $312.

So Gary spends $312 on water for his washing every year. 


$312
"
"Okay, let's see... Scarlett spent $10 on the aquarium. Then she got rocks for $2.50 each, and she got two bags, so that's $2.50 times 2, which is $5.  The coral was $2 each, and she got three, so that's $2 times 3, which is $6. The fishies were 50 cents each, and she got 20, so that's 20 times $0.50, which is $10. And the fish food was $2.

So, let's add it all up: $10 + $5 + $6 + $10 + $2 = $33.00 


$33.00
"
"The beanstalk was 3 inches tall at first. Then it got twice as big, so it was 3 times 2 which is 6 inches tall. Then it grew 4 more inches, so it was 6 plus 4 which is 10 inches tall! 

10 

"
"Okay, so Prince sells lots of meat every day! He sells 15 big kilograms every hour, and he works for 10 hours. That's 15 times 10, which is 150 kilograms every day!

Bill's bull is really big, 750 kilograms.  To find out how many days it takes Prince to sell all that meat, we gotta see how many times 150 goes into 750.  

Hmm, let's count! 150, 300, 450, 600, 750! It takes 5 days.


5 

"
"Okay, so there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so that's 4 times 18... which is 72 seats!

The administrators took up one-fourth of the seats, so that's 72 divided by 4... which is 18 seats.

That leaves 72 minus 18, which is 54 seats.

The parents took one-third of those, so that's 54 divided by 3... which is 18 seats.

So, the students got the rest, which is 54 minus 18... that's 36 seats!


**Answer:** 36 

"
"Okay, so there are 6 poles at each corner, and each pole has 4 lights. That means there are 6 times 4, which is 24 lights at each corner.  

If there are 4 corners, that's 24 times 4, which is 96 lights in total. But 20 lights aren't working, so we need to take those away. 96 minus 20 is 76.


76 

"
"Okay, so one DVD can be played a thousand times. One DVD has been played 356 times already, so it can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times. The other DVD has been played 135 times, so it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.  

If we add those together, 644 + 865 = 1509.

So the answer is 1509. 



"
"Okay, so John went to see the doctor for his back two times a week for six weeks. Each time he went, he stayed for two hours.  That's a lot of time!  If each hour costs $125, let's see... two times a week is 2 times 2, which is 4 hours a week.  Then 4 hours a week times 6 weeks is 24 hours total.  

So, 24 hours times $125 each hour is...  $3000!  That's a lot of money!


$3000 

"
"Okay, so Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. He chews some at school, one on the way home, and one after dinner. That's 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces gone.

He has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left. Then he gives half to his sister, so that's 14 / 2 = 7 pieces for her.

Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces left at the end of the day. 


7 

"
"Hmm, let's see... If Charmaine is gonna be 16 in 12 years, that means she's 4 years old now.  So in 4 more years, she'll be 8!

"
"The baseball coach spent 9 times 3 dollars, which is 27 dollars. The basketball coach spent 8 times 14 dollars, which is 112 dollars.  

If you take 112 and take away 27, you get 85 dollars.


85 

"
"Let's see... Arianna has 10 rows of flowers, and each row has 20 flowers. That's 10 times 20, which is 200 flowers in total!

But only 4 out of every 5 flowers bloomed.  So we need to figure out what 4 out of 5 of 200 is. Hmmm... that's tricky.

*counts on fingers*

I think it's 160 flowers! 



"
"Okay, so Ashley has 20 kb per second.  That's like 20 tiny pieces of information every second.  But a Mb is like a big box of those pieces, with 1000 tiny pieces inside.

So first, we gotta see how many of those big boxes Ashley gets every second.  We divide the tiny pieces by how many are in a big box: 20 / 1000 = 0.02 big boxes per second.

Now, there are 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour. So we gotta multiply to see how many big boxes Ashley gets in an hour: 0.02 times 60 times 60 = 72 big boxes per hour!


72 

"
"Okay, so the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. That's 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 cars!

Then it pulled 4 less cars each day for the rest of the week. So that's 10 - 4 = 6 cars each day.

There are 7 days in a week, and it already pulled cars for 3 days, so that leaves 7 - 3 = 4 more days.

So, for those 4 days, it pulled 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24 cars.

Now, let's add up all the cars: 30 + 24 = 54 cars!


54 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Adam needs to be 4 feet tall. He's 40 inches now, and that's 3 feet and 4 inches.  He needs to grow 8 more inches to be 4 feet tall.

He grows 2 inches every year, so it will take him 4 years to grow 8 inches! 



"
"Okay, so James sold ten cars for twenty-five thousand dollars each. That's a lot of cars!  

The company had to pay some money to get the cars first, though. They paid thirty percent of the price for each car, so that's like thirty out of every hundred dollars.  

James gets ten percent of the money the company makes after they sell the cars.  

Let me see... hmm...  

That means James made seventeen thousand five hundred dollars! 



"
"Okay, so there are 100 surfers, but only some can stay up on the big wave.  It says only 25% can stay up, so that's like a quarter of them.  

A quarter of 100 is 25 surfers.

Then it says 60% of those surfers are girls.  So 60% of 25 is... hmm... that's 15 girls.

That means the rest are boys!  So 25 surfers minus 15 girls is 10 boys.


10 

"
"Okay, so the diamond is $2000. The gold one is a little cheaper, like, four out of five as much as the diamond.  So that's $2000 times four, then split into five parts... that's $1600 for the gold one!

The silver one is $400 less than the gold one, so it's $1600 minus $400, which is $1200.

To find the total, we add them all up: $2000 + $1600 + $1200. That's $4800! 



"
"Max got 16 snowflake stamps. He got 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he got 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. He got 9 less rose stamps than truck stamps, so he got 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.  

In total, he got 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps! 


45 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Tom is going faster, so he'll catch up eventually.  

If Tom goes 15 miles further every hour than Bob, it will take him 5 hours to catch up the 75 miles.

"
"Okay, so Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so he caught 11 fish. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so he caught 14 fish! 


14 

"
"Okay, so Manny's classes cost $60. His parents say they won't pay if each class costs more than $10.  That means all the classes together can't cost more than $100.  

If they cost $100, he can go to all 10 classes.  But they only cost $60, so he can miss some classes and still be okay.

Hmm... $100 - $60 = $40. That means he can miss $40 worth of classes.

Since each class costs $10, he can miss $40 / $10 = 4 classes.

"
"Julie is super fast at the cash register! She's twice as fast as Jewel. Jewel helps 50 people every day.  If they both work all week, how many people do they help?

Let's see... Julie helps twice as many as Jewel, so she helps 50 x 2 = 100 people each day.

Together, they help 50 + 100 = 150 people every day.

In a whole week, that's 150 x 7 = 1050 people!


1050 

"
"Paisley ran 4 miles, and Reggie ran 5 times that, so Reggie ran 4 x 5 = 20 miles! Reggie ran 3 more miles than Lynn, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

"
"Okay, so apples cost $5.20 for four, so one apple costs $1.30.  Five apples would cost $6.50. Oranges are $3.30 for three, so one orange is $1.10. Five oranges cost $5.50.  

If Clyde buys five apples and five oranges, he'll pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00 


$12.00
"
"Okay, so Bob's hole is like a big box, right?  It's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep.  That's a lot of dirt!

If each scoop takes 3 seconds, and the hole is 6 times 4 times 3, which is 72 scoops of dirt, then it'll take him 72 times 3 seconds.

That's 216 seconds! 



"
"Okay, so the truck costs $30,000 to start.  

The king cab costs extra, which is $7500.  Leather seats are $2500 because that's one-third of the king cab price. Running boards are $2000, 'cause they're $500 less than the leather seats. The lights are $1500.

So, all the extras cost $7500 + $2500 + $2000 + $1500 = $13500.

That means the whole truck costs $30000 + $13500 = $43500! 


$43500
"
"Okay, so Tim gets more money now! He makes $20000 each month, and now he gets an extra $1000. That makes $21000! Plus, he gets a bonus of $10000! So that's $21000 + $10000 = $31000 every month!

In a whole year, that's $31000 times 12 months, which is $372000! 


$372000
"
"Okay, let's see... James buys lots of clothes!

He gets 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. So that's 10 times 750... which is 7500 dollars!

The pants are cheaper, they cost 1/5 of the suits, so that's 750 divided by 5... which is 150 dollars each. He buys 10 pants, so that's 10 times 150... which is 1500 dollars!

He also gets 3 shirts for every suit, so that's 10 suits times 3 shirts... which is 30 shirts! Each shirt costs 60 dollars, so 30 times 60 is... 1800 dollars!

Now we add up all the costs: 7500 for the suits, plus 1500 for the pants, plus 1800 for the shirts. That's a lot of adding! 7500 plus 1500 is 9000, and then plus 1800 is... 10800 dollars!


$10800
"
"Okay, so they write 20 news stories about politics and weather every day, and 10 about business. That's 20 + 10 = 30 stories every day!

February has 28 days, so they write 30 stories a day times 28 days, which is 30 x 28 = 840 stories!

"
"Alisa biked for a long time! 12 miles every hour for 4 and a half hours... that's a lot of biking!  Let's see... 12 times 4 and a half is 54 miles.

Stanley biked for a shorter time, 2 and a half hours at 10 miles an hour. So he biked 25 miles.

If we add Alisa's miles and Stanley's miles, we get 54 plus 25, which is 79 miles!


79 

"
"Okay, so Bill digs fast in the soil, 4 feet every hour! That's a lot!  He has to dig 24 feet in the soil, so that'll take him 6 hours (24 divided by 4).

Then he hits clay, which is harder. He digs half as fast in clay, so only 2 feet every hour. He has 8 feet of clay, so that'll take him 4 hours (8 divided by 2).

So, all together, it takes him 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours to dig the whole well!

"
"Hmm, let's see... Howie needs cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and all his classmates. That's a lot of cupcakes!  He wants two cupcakes for each person, so he needs 2 for himself, 2 for his teacher, and 2 for each of his 25 classmates.

That's 2 + 2 + (2 x 25) = 2 + 2 + 50 = 54 cupcakes!

"Okay, so Fishio got 2000 likes at first. Then after a few weeks, she had 70 times more likes! That's a lot of likes!  

So 2000 times 70 is 140,000 likes.

Then she got even more likes, 20,000 more!

So now she has 140,000 plus 20,000 which is 160,000 likes!

160000 

"
"Okay, so Clara bought 20 pomegranates on Tuesday for $20 each. That's 20 times 20, which is $400. But she had a voucher for $2 off, so she paid $398.

The next day, the pomegranates cost $30 each, so 20 times 30 is $600. But there was a 10% discount, so we need to figure out 10% of $600. That's $60.  So, she paid $600 minus $60, which is $540.

To find the difference, we subtract the Tuesday price from the Wednesday price: $540 minus $398 is $142.


Answer: 142 

"
"Okay, so Ariadne sold red hats for $400. That's like half the money she made from green hats. So green hats must have made her $400 x 2 = $800.

That means in the first month she made $400 + $800 = $1200 from all the hats.

The next month she made a bit less, like three-quarters of what she made the first month. So that's $1200 x (3/4) = $900.

To find out how much she made in two months, we add the two months together: $1200 + $900 = $2100.


2100 

"
"Okay, so James rode the carriage for four hours, but one hour was free! That means he paid for three hours. The first hour cost $15.  The other hours cost more, double the first hour, so they each cost $30.  

So, $15 plus $30 plus $30 is... $75!



"
"Sally got paid less than she should have. She had $200, and now she has $420. That means she got $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

She should have gotten $300, but she only got $220. So they took away $300 - $220 = $80 from her paycheck.


$80 

"
"Okay, so Lori needs enough eggs for everyone to have 3 deviled egg halves.  She has 16 friends coming, so that's 16 times 3, which is 48 halves.

Each egg makes 2 halves, so she needs 48 halves divided by 2, which is 24 eggs.

Eggs come in dozens, and a dozen has 12 eggs. So, 24 eggs is 24 divided by 12, which is 2 dozens of eggs!

"
"Okay, so the plane cost a lot of money first, right?  150,000 dollars!  Then he has to pay 5000 dollars every month for a place to keep it.  And he uses twice that much on gas, so that's 5000 times 2 which is 10,000 dollars.  So every month it costs him 5000 plus 10,000, which is 15,000 dollars.  

In a whole year, that's 15,000 times 12, which is 180,000 dollars.  

So, all together it costs him 150,000 plus 180,000, which is 330,000 dollars for the first year! 



"
"Okay, so Finley cooked rice for 30 minutes. Pork took 20 minutes longer than rice, so that's 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Beans took half the time it took to cook the rice and pork together.  That's 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

So, all together it took 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes to cook everything! 


120 

"
"Okay, so we got two mixes of nuts.

The first one has half a pound of almonds and a third of a pound of walnuts. Almonds cost ten dollars a pound, so half a pound is five dollars. Walnuts cost fifteen dollars a pound, so a third of a pound is five dollars too. That means the first mix costs ten dollars.

The second mix has a fifth of a pound of almonds and a third of a pound of walnuts. A fifth of a pound of almonds is two dollars, and the walnuts are still five dollars. So that mix costs seven dollars.

If you buy the first mix, you pay three dollars more than if you buy the second mix.

"Okay, so Lee has sheep and geese.  They have 70 legs all together. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2.  There are 20 heads in total.  

Hmm... let me see... If we have lots of sheep, we'd have lots of legs.  But we also need to have enough geese to make 20 heads.

I think there are 15 sheep! 



"
"Okay, so Roger's coffee usually costs $5, but it's more expensive now. It costs 20% more, which is like adding an extra dollar, so it's $6 now. He needs coffee for a whole week, and he uses one pound each day. That's 7 pounds of coffee!  So the coffee costs 7 times $6, which is $42.  Oh, and he got a donut for $2.  

Let's add it all up: $42 for coffee plus $2 for the donut is $44.


$44 

"
"Let's see... Gus spent $20.00. He bought chips for $4.00, chicken for $8.00, and soda for $1.00.  That's $4 + $8 + $1 = $13.00.

So the apple pie cost $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00 


$7.00
"
"Hmm, let's see... James gives 198 to District A and 209 to District C. That's 198 plus 209, which is 407.  

If he gives out 600 in total, then he gives 600 minus 407 to District B.  That's 193! 


193 

"
"Okay, so John goes to cooking class a lot! Four times a week for two hours each time. That's like, eight hours a week of cooking! And he does that for six weeks, so that's eight times six, which is forty-eight hours of cooking!

He learns a new recipe every hour and a half, so let's see... forty-eight divided by one and a half... hmm... that's thirty-two recipes! 


32 

"
"Okay, so there are 150 teachers playing basketball.  Sixty of them teach history, so the rest must be math teachers. That's 150 - 60 = 90 math teachers.

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours, so all the math teachers sleep for 90 * 6 = 540 hours.


540 

"
"Okay, so Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has a little less, 3/4 of what Aurelia has, so that's $120 times 3/4 which is $90. Rayna has even more, $60 more than Kassidy, so she has $90 + $60 = $150.

If they put all their money together, they'd have $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.  If they shared it equally, each person would get $360 divided by 3, which is $120.


$120 

"
"Okay, so the game has four parts, and each part is 12 minutes long. That's 12 plus 12 plus 12 plus 12, which is 48 minutes. But they played 5 more minutes, so it was 48 plus 5... that's 53 minutes!

"Okay, so there are 50 people working.  20 of them are bosses.  But only some of those bosses are the really big bosses.  That's 30% of the bosses.  Hmm... 20 bosses times 30... that's 6!  

So 6 people are the big bosses. 



"
"Okay, so Svetlana needs 5 big spoonfuls of flour, 3 big spoonfuls of sugar, and a tiny bit of salt for each muffin. That's 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 big spoonfuls in total for one muffin.

If she wants to make 16 muffins, she needs 8.25 times 16, which is 132 big spoonfuls!

"They have 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds of candy all together.  If they share it equally, they each get 12 / 3 = 4 pounds of candy!

"
"Okay, so Adam bought 7 candies that cost 50 cents each. That's 7 times 50 cents, which is $3.50.  He also got 10 candies that cost 75 cents each. That's 10 times 75 cents, which is $7.50.

So all together, his candies cost $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00.

He gave the cashier $15.00, so his change is $15.00 - $11.00 = $4.00.

"
"Christina had 12 good days in total. She already had 8 good days, then one more good day, and then another good day. That's 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 good days.  

If she had 12 good days and already had 10, then she has 12 - 10 = 2 good days left.

"
"Okay, so Janey has 21 books.  That's 3 more than double what Sally has.  Hmm... if we take away the extra 3 books Janey has, she'd have 18 books.  That means Sally has half of that!  

Half of 18 is 9.

Sally has 9 books. 

"
"Hmm, let's see... the bamboo grows 30 inches every day.  It's already 20 feet tall, which is like 240 inches.  We want to know how many days until it's 600 inches tall.

So, it needs to grow 600 - 240 = 360 more inches.

If it grows 30 inches each day, it will take 360 / 30 = 12 days! 


12 

"
"Okay, so James has 4 toys for 4 doggies. Then 8 more doggies come!  That means he needs 8 more toys.  

Then, even more doggies came, double the amount from before! So that's 8 times 2, which is 16 more doggies! He needs 16 more toys for them.

But then 3 doggies went home, so he doesn't need those toys anymore.

Let's count all the toys: 8 + 16 = 24 toys. Then take away 3 because the doggies left: 24 - 3 = 21 toys.


21 

"
"Okay, so they put in $1200 all together. Dylan put in a big chunk, 2 out of 5 of the whole thing. That's like cutting the money into 5 pieces and Dylan takes 2.  That's $480 for Dylan.

Then Frances put in 2 out of 3 of what was left.  So we gotta figure out how much was left first.  $1200 minus $480 is $720.  Frances put in 2 out of 3 of that, so that's $480 too!

That means Skyler put in the rest.  $1200 minus $480 minus $480 is $240.


$240 

"
"They already have 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

They want to get to 100 signatures.

So they need 100 - 64 = 36 more signatures!

"Karen earns double what Lorie earns, so she makes $10 x 2 = $20 every hour.

If she works 3 hours a day, she makes $20 x 3 = $60 each day.

Over two days, she makes $60 x 2 = $120.

"If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, that means each potato makes 6 hash browns!  So if you have 96 potatoes, you can make 96 times 6 hash browns, which is 576 hash browns!

"Let's see... 8 adults weigh 8 times 80, which is 640.  

Then we add Jack, so that's 640 plus 80, which is 720.

Uh oh, that's 20 more than the elevator can hold! 


20 

"
"Okay, let's count the cookies!

Katarina has 68 cookies. Max has 5 more than Katarina, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

The Cookie Monster has 12 less cookies than Max, so he has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so she has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies!


298 

"
"Okay, so Shania made her dress longer. It's now 140cm long. She added 20cm of lace, and before that, she made it 50% longer.  Hmm... that means the dress was 140cm - 20cm = 120cm long before the lace.

Now, if 120cm is 150% of the original length (because she added 50%), then the original dress was 120cm / 1.50 = 80cm long.


80 

"
"Okay, so Chris mows the whole lawn in an hour in slow mode, which is 60 minutes.  In fast mode, it takes him 40 minutes.

He does half the lawn slow, so that's 60 minutes divided by 2, which is 30 minutes.

The other half he does fast, so that's 40 minutes divided by 2, which is 20 minutes.

If you add those together, 30 minutes plus 20 minutes is 50 minutes!

"
"They already walked for 6 minutes plus 13 minutes, so that's 19 minutes.  They have 30 minutes to get to school, so they have 11 minutes left!

"
"Okay, let's see...

Apples cost $4. Bananas are $2 each kilo, and she got two, so that's $2 times 2, which is $4. Oranges are $3 each kilo, and she got two, so that's $3 times 2, which is $6.

So, $4 plus $4 plus $6 is... $14! 



"
"Celinda bakes a lot of cookies! She bakes double what Greta bakes, so that's 30 times 2 which is 60 cookies.  

That means they have 30 + 60 = 90 cookies in total.

They eat 10, so there are 90 - 10 = 80 cookies left to put in the box.


80 

"
"Okay, so there are two twins and three triplets. One twin is older than one of the triplets by 7 years.  If all of them together are 44 years old, how old is one of the twins? Hmm... let me think.

If we take away the 7 years from the older twin, it's like they're the same age as one of the triplets.  So, let's see... 44 minus 7 is 37.

Now we gotta split 37 between the two twins and two of the triplets. That's like splitting it into four parts.  So 37 divided by 4 is 9 with a little leftover.

That means one of the twins is 9 years old plus the extra 7 years, so... 9 + 7 = 16! 



"
"Okay, so John has 3 hours before dinner, which is like 3 times 60 minutes, so that's 180 minutes.  He has 20 minutes of math, 40 minutes of reading, and 20 minutes of history, so that's 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes of homework.  

If we take away his homework time from the time before dinner, 180 - 80 = 100 minutes.  John has 100 minutes to nap! 


100 

"
"Okay, so Manolo buys five lollipops and they cost 40 cents each. That's 5 times 40 cents, which is $2.00.

He also buys four candies and everything together costs $3.20. So the candies cost $3.20 minus $2.00, which is $1.20.

That means each candy costs $1.20 divided by 4, which is 30 cents.

If he buys 10 lollipops, that's 10 times 40 cents, which is $4.00.

And 10 candies would cost 10 times 30 cents, which is $3.00.

So, all together, 10 lollipops and 10 candies would cost $4.00 plus $3.00, which is $7.00! 


$7.00
"
"Okay, so Rong saves 20 coins each month. Neil saves more than that, like 2/5 more.  That means he saves 8 more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 28 coins each month (20 + 8 = 28).

If they save for ten years, that's a long time! Let's see... Rong saves 20 coins a month times 12 months, that's 240 coins a year.  Over ten years, that's 2400 coins (240 x 10 = 2400).

Neil saves 28 coins a month times 12 months, so that's 336 coins a year (28 x 12 = 336). Over ten years, he saves 3360 coins (336 x 10 = 3360).

Now, let's add up how many coins they both have: 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins! 



"
"Okay, so John's dog needs two shots that cost $20 each. That's $20 + $20 = $40.

The heartworm check costs 60% of the whole bill.  Hmm, that means we need to figure out the whole bill first.

The shots cost $40, and the heartworm check is 60% of that, so it costs $40 x 0.60 = $24.

So the whole bill is $40 + $24 = $64.

John brought $125, and the bill is $64, so he has $125 - $64 = $61 left.


$61 

"
"Okay, so we got 5 bananas, and each banana costs a dollar, so that's 5 dollars. Then there's 12 apples, and each apple is 50 cents, so that's 6 dollars.  The oranges are tricky, they cost 3 dollars each, and we got 7 of them, so that's 21 dollars.  

If we add all that up, 5 plus 6 plus 21, we get 32 dollars for the whole crate! 


$32.00
"
"Okay, so Brittany has lots of squares on her blanket.  Let's see... she has 14 red ones. Then she has 4 more blue ones than red, so that's 14 + 4 = 18 blue ones.  She has 6 more green ones than blue, so that's 18 + 6 = 24 green ones. And she has 12 less white ones than green, so that's 24 - 12 = 12 white ones.

To find out how big her blanket is, we add up all the squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

So her blanket is 68 square feet big! 


68
"
"Let's see... Mia has 8 little chairs for the babies.  She has 5 times more big chairs, so that's 8 times 5 which is 40 big chairs. That makes a total of 40 plus 8, which is 48 chairs.

But she has 42 grown-ups coming and 15 babies, so that's 42 plus 15, which is 57 people.  

Hmmm, 57 people minus 48 chairs is 9. Mia needs 9 more chairs!

"
"Okay, so there are 50 deer, and half of them are bucks, so that's 25 bucks.  Then, 20 out of every 100 bucks have 8 points, so that's like 20 out of 100 bucks is 5 bucks!


5 

"
"Okay, so Adam has 50 points. Betty did really well and got 30 more points than Adam, so she has 50 + 30 = 80 points!

Tom has 30 less points than Betty, so he has 80 - 30 = 50 points.

Marta is super good! She has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 50 x 3 = 150 points.

Let's add up all the points: 50 + 80 + 50 + 150 = 330 points.

They need 400 points to go on the trip, so they need 400 - 330 = 70 more points! 


70 

"
"Great Grandma Jones has lots of great-grandbabies!  

Let's see... she has 3 kids, and each of them has 3 kids. That's 3 times 3, which is 9 grandkids!

And each of those grandkids has 3 babies. So that's 9 times 3, which is 27 great-grandbabies! 


27 

"
"Okay, so Greta gets $2400. She saves half of that for later, which is like splitting it in two. Half of 2400 is 1200. Then she uses some for her car, which is like a fifth of her money, so that's 480.  If she saves 1200 and spends 480, that's 1680 gone.  So she has 2400 minus 1680 left, which is 720.


$720.00 

"
"Hmm, let's see... If there are 20 spots for pencils but 4 are missing, that means there are 16 pencils in the box.  Since pencils come in pairs, we gotta see how many times 2 fits into 16.  

2, 4, 6, 8...  It fits in 8 times! So there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box. 


8 

"
"Okay, so the city has lots of fireworks! They have 15 boxes with 20 fireworks in each box. That's a lot of fireworks!  

Hannah can see 40% of them from her house.  

She also has her own fireworks, 3 boxes with 5 in each box.

Let's see... 15 times 20 is 300 fireworks in the city. 40% of 300 is 120.  

And Hannah's fireworks are 3 times 5, which is 15.

So, 120 plus 15 is 135! Hannah will see 135 fireworks! 


135 

"
"Okay, so there are 20 people going to the movies.  Each person gets two drinks and three snacks. That's 40 drinks and 60 snacks altogether!

If each drink and snack costs $2, then the drinks cost $80 (40 x $2) and the snacks cost $120 (60 x $2).

That means they spent $200 in total on drinks and snacks! 


$200 

"
"Okay, so Gissela's truck is like the smallest one, it can carry 4000 pounds. Gordy's truck is bigger, it can carry 800 more pounds than Gissela's, so that's 4000 + 800 = 4800 pounds!

If we put all their trucks together, they can carry 11600 pounds.  That means Gary's truck must carry the rest!  So we take the big number and take away what Gissela and Gordy can carry: 11600 - 8800 = 2800 pounds.

Gary's truck can carry 2800 pounds! 



"
"Okay, so there are 8 boys and 6 girls. The girls each ate 3 dumplings. The boys ate 1 more dumpling than the girls, so they ate 4 dumplings each.  

Let's see... 8 boys times 4 dumplings each is 32 dumplings. And 6 girls times 3 dumplings each is 18 dumplings.

So, Larry cooked 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings!

"
"Okay, so Colorado City uses a lot of water from the river, like 40%! And most of that water, 80%, goes to factories and stuff.  That means the rest, 20%, is for other things, like our homes and parks.  So, Colorado City uses 20% of its water for those things, and that's 20% of the 40% they take from the river.  Hmm, that's like... 8%!

"
"Hmm, let's see... Alex makes $12 each day, and there are 7 days in a week. So she makes $12 times 7, which is $84 in one week.  

For two weeks, it would be $84 times 2, which is $168.



"
"Okay, so they make 100 quarts of chocolate in 2 hours, that's like 50 quarts every hour! And vanilla, they make 50 quarts in 4 hours, so that's 12 and a half quarts every hour.

If you add those together, they make 62 and a half quarts every hour.

Now, if they make that much every hour, in 48 hours they'd make a whole lot!  

Let's see... 62 and a half times 48... hmm... that's 3000 quarts! 


3000 

"
"Okay, let's see...

Marcus buys lots of yummy treats!  Five croissants cost 5 times $3, which is $15. Four cinnamon rolls cost 4 times $2.50, so that's $10. Three quiches are 3 times $4, making $12. And thirteen muffins are 13 times $1, which is $13.

If we add all that up, it's $15 + $10 + $12 + $13 = $50.

But wait! He has a special card that gives him $5 off.

So, his total is $50 - $5 = $45.

"Okay, so Ginger and Amy both start with 100 candies. Ginger eats 4 candies every day, and Amy eats 3.  After two weeks, which is 14 days, Ginger eats 4 times 14 which is 56 candies. Amy eats 3 times 14 which is 42 candies.

That means Ginger has 100 minus 56 candies left, which is 44. Amy has 100 minus 42 candies left, which is 58.

Amy has 58 minus 44 candies more than Ginger, which is 14!

"
"Okay, so Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles for every little square foot. His bathroom is 36 square feet, but he only wants to do two-thirds of it.  Hmm... two-thirds of 36 is like cutting it into three pieces and taking two. That's 24 square feet!

So he needs 24 times 24 tiles, which is... 576 tiles! 



"
"Okay, so James had to pay $20 just to go pick blueberries. Then, each pound cost $1.50. He got 30 pounds, so that's $1.50 times 30, which is $45.  

But he had to pay the $20 to get in first, so it was $45 plus $20, which is $65.

At the store, blueberries cost $2.50 a pound, and he got 30 pounds, so that's $2.50 times 30, which is $75.

He saved $75 - $65, which is $10!


Answer: 10 

"
"Okay, so they wanted to buy 500 computers and thought each one would cost $700. But then the computers got more expensive! They cost 10% more, which is like adding $70 to each one. So now each computer costs $770.  

To find out how much they paid in total, we gotta multiply the new price by the number of computers: $770 x 500 = $385,000 


$385,000 

"
"Okay, let's see...

He used 6 eggs and each egg has 75 calories, so that's 6 times 75... which is 450 calories!

The cheese is 2 ounces and each ounce is 120 calories, so that's 2 times 120... which is 240 calories.

The ham is also 2 ounces and each ounce is 40 calories, so that's 2 times 40... which is 80 calories.

Now we add it all up: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories!


770 

"
"Okay, so pencils cost 50 cents each, and I got 6 of them. That's 50 times 6... hmm... 300!  

Erasers are 25 cents each, and I got 8. So that's 25 times 8... let me see... 200!

So all together, the pencils and erasers cost 300 cents plus 200 cents, which is 500 cents.  That's the same as $5.00!

If I gave the store $10.00, I should get $5.00 back.

"Okay, so Helga taps really fast!  

When her arms are down, she taps 300 times with one foot and 250 with the other, so that's 300 + 250 = 550 taps every minute!

She dances like that for 3 minutes, so that's 550 x 3 = 1650 taps.

When her arms are up, she taps slower, 200 times with each foot, so that's 200 x 2 = 400 taps every minute.

She does that for 2 minutes, so that's 400 x 2 = 800 taps.

Now we add all the taps together: 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps!

"Hmm, let's see... Ron doesn't want his car to get broken, so he needs to fix the pothole.

Fixing it himself costs him money for stuff to fix it and a fine.  The stuff costs 3 times $25, which is $75.  And the fine is $120. So that's $75 plus $120, which is $195.

If he doesn't fix it, his car will cost $450 to fix!

So he saves $450 - $195 = $255 by fixing it himself! 


$255 

"
"Okay, so they started with lots of chairs, 170 big ones and 23 little ones.  Then some broke, 20 big ones and 13 little ones went to the carpenter.  

Let's see... 170 take away 20 is 150 big chairs left. And 23 take away 13 is 10 little chairs left.

So, 150 plus 10 is... 160 chairs left! 



"
"Okay, so they had 5 pizzas, and each pizza had 12 slices. That's 5 times 12, which is 60 slices in total!

Bryce and two friends ate 2 out of every 3 slices, so they ate a lot!  The other two friends ate 3 out of every 4 slices.

Hmm, that's a lot of pizza gone! Let me see... 60 slices minus the slices they ate is how many are left.  

18 slices are left! 



"
"Okay, so the kitty cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The doggy eats the same amount but faster, in only 20 minutes!  

To find the average, we add the times together: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Okay, so Topher's shoe is super big, 8 feet and 4 inches!  That's like, way bigger than my shoe.  

We gotta figure out how long Bobby's shoe is.  It says Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the size of Bobby's.  

Hmm... let's see... if we take away the extra 10 inches from Topher's shoe, that leaves us with... 90 inches!

And that 90 inches is 9 times the size of Bobby's shoe. So, Bobby's shoe is 90 inches divided by 9... which is 10 inches!


**Answer:** 10 

"
"Okay, so Hannah breaks a lot of windows!  

Let's see... she breaks windows on a quarter of the student cars. That's 64 cars divided by 4, which is 16 cars. Each of those cars has 4 windows, so that's 16 times 4, which is 64 windows.

Then she breaks windows on three-quarters of the teacher cars. That's 32 cars times 3, which is 96 cars. But wait, she only breaks windows on 3/4 of them, so that's 96 divided by 4, which is 24 cars. Each teacher car has 2 windows, so that's 24 times 2, which is 48 windows.

So, in total, she breaks 64 windows plus 48 windows, which is 112 windows!

"Okay, so Candy has lots of thread! Let's see... she has 15 light blue and 45 dark blue, so that's 15 plus 45... which is 60 blue spools!

"
"Okay, so 5000 people were waiting to vote.  By lunchtime, 2 out of every 5 people had voted. That's like cutting the line into 5 parts and taking 2 parts away.  So 2000 people voted by lunchtime.

That means 3000 people were still waiting. Then, by 4 o'clock, 2 out of every 3 of those people voted. So that's another 2000 people!

That means 1000 people were still waiting to vote.

"Dora is 15. Her dad is twice her age plus 8 more years, so he's 15 times 2 plus 8, which is 38! Dora's mom is 4 years younger than her dad, so she's 38 minus 4, which is 34.  

To find their total age, we add Dora's age, her dad's age, and her mom's age: 15 plus 38 plus 34 equals 87.

If he started with 32 ounces and used 30 ounces, he has 32 - 30 = 2 ounces left.

"
"Clara has 20 books. Steven has half as many as Clara, so Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.

"
"Okay, so Cecelia buys big jars of milk for $5 each. She gets 10 of those. That's 10 times 5, which is 50 dollars.

The smaller jars cost $3 each. She buys 16 of those. That's 16 times 3, which is 48 dollars.

To find out how much she spent in total, we add the cost of the big jars and the small jars: 50 plus 48 is 98 dollars.


98 

"
"Okay, so there are 50 kids in the class. 10 like to bake, and 5 like basketball. That means 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 kids like video games or music.  

If 5 like basketball, then 5 x 2 = 10 like music.

That leaves 35 - 10 = 25 kids who like video games! 


25 

"
"Jeremy saw some birds, then some flew away when he threw a rock.  Some more birds came later. Let's see... he started with 12 birds, and 12 divided by 3 is 4, so 4 birds flew away. That leaves 8 birds. Then 20 more came, so 8 plus 20 is 28!

There are now 28 birds. 



"
"There are 80 students in total, and they're split into two classes, so each class has 40 students.  If 40% are girls, that means 60% are boys!  

So, 40 students times 60% is... hmm... 60% of 40 is 24! There are 24 boys in each class. 


24 

"
"Mara had 2 slices of cake. Then she put 3 more on the plate. That's 2 + 3 = 5 slices!

Then she had even more cake because she tripled the slices. 5 times 3 is 15 slices!

She ate 2 slices, so now she has 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Uh oh! Her friend took 5 slices. That means she has 13 - 5 = 8 slices left. 


8 

"
"Let's see... she has lots of animals to groom!  

If she does a little bit each day, she'd groom 4 animals every day. 



"
"Okay, so Mark spent 3 times $1800 on the packs, that's a lot of money! That's 3 times 1800, which is 5400 dollars.

He got two really good cards, one for 4000 dollars and one for 1000 dollars.  That's 4000 plus 1000, so 5000 dollars!

He also got 30 more cards worth 50 dollars each.  That's 30 times 50, which is 1500 dollars.

So all together, he made 5000 plus 1500 dollars, which is 6500 dollars!

He made 6500 dollars but spent 5400 dollars, so he made a profit of 1100 dollars! 


$1100
"
"Okay, so Jake's family has two grown-ups and two kids.

The first park costs $26 for each grown-up, so that's 2 times $26 which is $52.  Then each kid costs $12, and there are two kids, so that's 2 times $12 which is $24.  

If we add those together, the first park costs $52 plus $24, which is $76.

The second park costs $14 for each grown-up, so that's 2 times $14 which is $28.  Each kid costs $10, and there are two kids, so that's 2 times $10 which is $20.

Adding those together, the second park costs $28 plus $20, which is $48.

If they go to the second park, they'll save $76 minus $48, which is $28! 


$28
"
"Okay, so he saves 10 cents on each tomato, right?  'Cause 50 cents minus 40 cents is 10 cents.

He sells a whole bunch of tomatoes, 500! So that's 500 times 10 cents... hmm... that's 50 dollars he saves each day!

And there are 7 days in a week, so he saves 50 times 7...  That's 350 dollars!


$350 

"
"Okay, so Sean has 56 marbles. Cal has twice as many as Sean, so Cal has 56 times 2 which is 112 marbles. Carl has four times as many as Sean, so he has 56 times 4 which is 224 marbles.  

To find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have together, we add their marbles: 224 + 112 = 336 marbles!


336 

"
"Hmm, let's see... We have 54 students and need 12 groups.  If we make 6 groups, each group has 9 students.  

To have 12 groups, we need 12 groups times 9 students each, which is 108 students.

We need 108 students but only have 54, so we need 54 more students to make all those groups! 

 6 



"
"Okay, so Candy rents chairs. On weekdays she rents 60, and on weekends she rents 100.  That's a lot of chairs!

Let's see... there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days, so that's 60 * 5 + 100 * 2 = 300 + 200 = 500 chairs every week.

A month has 4 weeks, so she rents 500 * 4 = 2000 chairs every month.

If she does this for two months, she rents 2000 * 2 = 4000 chairs!

4000 

"
"Okay, so Gunther had 48 bananas. Then that sneaky Arnold took half, so Gunther had 24 left. Gunther added 25 more, so he had 49! But then Arnold took 12 more, leaving Gunther with 37.  Gunther added 6 more, so he had 43 bananas in the end. 


43
"
"Okay, so there are 4 roommates sharing a $100 bill.  That means each roommate pays $25 each month.  If there are 12 months in a year, each roommate pays $25 times 12, which is $300 for the whole year!


$300 

"
"Okay, so Jeff had lots of glasses and plates for the party! He had 8 groups of 12 glasses, that's like 8 times 12, which is 96 glasses! And he had 4 groups of 12 plates, so that's 4 times 12, which is 48 plates.

Uh oh, some broke! 10 glasses broke, so he has 96 minus 10, which is 86 glasses left. And 6 plates broke, so he has 48 minus 6, which is 42 plates left.

Let's see, how many does he have all together? 86 glasses plus 42 plates is 128!


128 

"
"Okay, so Lorraine has lots of stickers! She trades a bunch of her small stickers for big buttons. Then she trades some of her big stickers for more big buttons, and the rest for even more small buttons.  

Let's see... she ends up with 107 buttons! 



"
"Joey played two games on Monday, one on Friday, and then on Saturday he played four games 'cause that's double the Monday games!  So, he played 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 games in a week!

7 

"
"Okay, so there are 33 people voting.  Twice as many people voted yes than no.  Hmm... that means if we split the people into three groups, one group would be the ""no"" votes, and the other two groups would be the ""yes"" votes.

So, 33 people divided by 3 is 11 people in each group.

That means 2 groups of 11 people voted yes, which is 22 votes!


22 

"
"Okay, let's see...

11 kids need extra-small shirts.  Twice that many need small, so that's 11 times 2, which is 22 small shirts.

Then 4 less kids need medium than small, so that's 22 minus 4, which is 18 medium shirts.

Half as many kids need large as medium, so that's 18 divided by 2, which is 9 large shirts.

And 6 more kids need extra-large than large, so that's 9 plus 6, which is 15 extra-large shirts.

To find the total, we add up all the shirts: 11 plus 22 plus 18 plus 9 plus 15 equals 75 shirts.


75 

"
"Hmm, if the bag is 5% off, that means it's a little bit cheaper!  

So, 5% of $140 is like taking away $7.  

That means the bag costs $133 now. 


$133
"
"Wow, that's a lot of songs!  Let's see... 300 songs in each playlist and he has 20 playlists... that's 300 times 20... hmm... that's 6000 songs!

And each song is 10 hours long, so 6000 times 10 is... 60,000 hours!

60000 

"
"Okay, so 20 people think horse number 2 will win. That leaves 30 people.  Then 24 people think horse number 7 will win.  So that means 6 people think horse number 12 will win! 



"
"Okay, so Jana has some puppies.  We know that six of them are girl Pomeranians, and that's only one-third of all the Pomeranians.  That means there are 6 times 3, which is 18 Pomeranians in total.

But wait, there's more! Those Pomeranians are only two-thirds of all her puppies. So, we need to do 18 times 3, which is 54, and then divide that by 2. That means Jana has 27 puppies! 


27
"
"Jayden has $70 and his sister gave him $45.  That's $70 + $45 = $115.  The camera costs $200, so he needs $200 - $115 = $85 more.


$85 

"
"Okay, so they need 250 cases for all the houses. The second house needs the most, and the first house needs half of that.  The third house needs double the first house. Hmmm... that means the third house needs the same amount as the second house! So the third house needs 100 cases. 


100 

"
"Let's see... Leila buys 3 cucumbers and each one costs $2, so that's 3 times 2 which is $6. Jack gets 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so that's 5 times 1, which is $5. Chase buys one lettuce for $3.  

If we add it all up, $6 plus $5 plus $3 is $14.


14 

"
"Okay, so George has lots of bananas, 200! And he has 45% more pears.  That means he has a lot more pears than bananas.  

Hmm, let's see... if we add 45% of the bananas to the bananas, that's like adding more pears.  

200 plus 45% of 200 is... 290 pears!

So, he has 290 pears and 200 bananas.  That's a lot of fruit!

Let's add them together: 290 plus 200 is 490!


490 

"
"Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on a ball. That means she had $60 left.  Each candy bar costs $5, so she could buy $60 / $5 = 12 candy bars.


12 

"
"Okay, so Sam needs 5 big oranges for every jug of juice.  If he wants to make 4 jugs, that's 4 times as much orange!  So he needs 4 times 5 oranges, which is 20 oranges.

Each orange costs $3, so 20 oranges cost 20 times $3, which is $60.


$60 

"
"Ezra read a lot of books! He read 300, and then read 150 more, so that's 300 + 150 = 450 books for Ezra. Ahmed read half as many as Ezra, so he read 300 / 2 = 150 books.  

Together they read 450 + 150 = 600 books!


600 

"
"Okay, let's see... Tanya gets $15 for every hour she teaches.

On Monday, she taught for 5 hours, so she made 15 times 5, which is 75 dollars. Oh, and she taught more than 3 classes, so she gets an extra $5! That means she made 75 plus 5, which is 80 dollars on Monday.

On Wednesday, she taught for 2 hours, so she made 15 times 2, which is 30 dollars.

So, all together, she made 80 plus 30 dollars, which is 110 dollars!


110 

"
"They sold 20 vanilla perfumes (4 kinds times 5 each) and 16 fruity perfumes (8 kinds times 2 each).  That means they sold 4 more vanilla perfumes than fruity perfumes.

"
"Okay, so Bennet sells eggplants for $3 each and he has 20 of them. That's 20 times 3, which is $60!

He wants to make $135 total, so he needs $135 minus $60, which is $75 from the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, so he needs to sell each one for $75 divided by 25, which is $3. 


$3
"
"Okay, so Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 on Sunday, that's 7 + 5 = 12 hours total.

She reads for 3 hours, so she has 12 - 3 = 9 hours left.

She plays video games for 1/3 of that time, so that's 9 / 3 = 3 hours of video games.

That means she plays soccer for 9 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find out what percentage that is, we do 6 divided by 12, which is 0.5.  Then we multiply by 100 to make it a percentage, so 0.5 times 100 is 50%.


50 

"
"Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave half to Brandon, so that's 50 divided by 2, which is 25 pencils.  Then he had 25 left. He gave Charlie 3 out of every 5 of those, so that's 3 times 5, which is 15 pencils. That means Anthony kept 25 minus 15, which is 10 pencils.


10 

"
"Okay, so Jack drives to the museum and back, which is 150 miles each way, so that's 300 miles total. He drives fast, 75 miles every hour!  

That means it takes him 4 hours to get there and 4 hours to get back.  

He spends 6 hours looking at all the cool stuff in the museum.

So, all together, he's gone for 4 hours + 6 hours + 4 hours = 14 hours!


14 

"
"Okay, so Henry has lots of toys to put together! He needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. That's 57 times 4, which is 228 wheels!  

Then he has 73 motorcycles, and each one needs 2 wheels. So that's 73 times 2, which is 146 wheels.

In total, he needs 228 plus 146 wheels, which is 374 wheels.

He has a big box with 650 wheels, so he'll have 650 minus 374 wheels left over.  

That means he'll have 276 wheels left! 



"
"Okay, so the laptop costs a thousand dollars, but it's on sale for 20% off.  That means we gotta figure out what 20% of a thousand dollars is.  

Hmm... 20% is like 20 out of every 100, so it's like 20 cents for every dollar.  So 20% of a thousand dollars is 200 dollars!

That means the laptop is 200 dollars cheaper, so we pay 1000 - 200 = 800 dollars!



"
"Okay, so Mike has lots of movies!  

He has 600 movies, and a third of them are in sets, like all the Harry Potter movies together. Those sets are cheaper, only a third of the price of a normal movie. Normal movies cost $10, so the sets cost $3.33 each.

There are 600 / 3 = 200 movies in sets. So those cost 200 * $3.33 = $666.

That leaves 600 - 200 = 400 movies that aren't in sets. Some of those are old movies, and they only cost $5. Forty percent of the movies that aren't in sets are old, so that's 400 * 0.40 = 160 old movies. Those cost 160 * $5 = $800.

That means there are 400 - 160 = 240 newer movies left. Those cost $10 each, so they cost 240 * $10 = $2400.

To find the total cost, we add up all the prices: $666 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67



$3866.67
"
"Okay, let's see... Winston got 6 pounds of peaches and they cost $2.00 each, so that's 6 times 2 which is $12.00.  Then he got 8 pounds of plums at $1.00 each, so that's 8 times 1 which is $8.00. And lastly, he got 6 pounds of apricots at $3.00 each, so that's 6 times 3 which is $18.00.  

Now we add it all up: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00


$38.00 

"
"Okay, so they drove for a long time, 6 hours! And they went 50 miles every hour in the car.  That's like, super fast!

They hiked for 1.5 hours, which isn't as long. They went slower when they hiked, 20 miles every hour.

Let's see... 50 miles an hour for 4.5 hours is... hmm...  225 miles! And 20 miles an hour for 1.5 hours is 30 miles.

So, they went 225 miles driving plus 30 miles hiking, which is 255 miles in total!


255 

"
"This is a tricky one!  Ava and Emma are playing a game, and we need to figure out who got more points.

Ava did better in some ways, but Emma did better in others.  

To know who won, we'd need to know how many enemies they jumped on, how many berries they got, and how much time they had left at the end.  

It's like trying to figure out who won a race without knowing how fast they ran! 

"
"Okay, so they bought four pizzas for 64 dollars. Two pizzas cost 30 dollars, so the other two pizzas cost 34 dollars.  If they cost the same, then each of the other pizzas cost 17 dollars! 


$17
"
"Okay, so they ride their bikes three times a day for five days. That's 3 times 5 which is 15 times.

Then there are two days where they ride twice as much, so that's 3 times 2 which is 6 times each day.  

And since it's two days, that's 6 times 2 which is 12 times.

So in total, they ride 15 times plus 12 times, which is 27 times!


27 

"
"Okay, so Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He bought some more fish, and now he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  

He bought 17 fish from the store, but we don't know how many were orange and how many were white.  

Let's see... if he has twice as many orange fish as white fish, maybe he bought 4 white fish? That would make 8 white fish in total (4 he had + 4 he bought). And then he'd have 16 orange fish (twice the white fish).

Hmm, that means he bought 4 white fish! 


4 

"
"Okay, so Andy drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home every day. That's 10 miles a day!

He does that Monday to Friday, so that's 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles a week.

His car drinks 1 gallon of gas for every 10 miles, so he uses 50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons of gas a week.

Gas costs $3 a gallon, so 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

Andy spends $15 on gas every week. 



"
"Carrie got ten twenties, so that's ten times twenty dollars, which is two hundred dollars! She also got one hundred forty quarters.  Each quarter is twenty-five cents, so that's one hundred forty times twenty-five cents... hmm... that's thirty-five dollars!

She spent three-fifths of the twenties, so that's like cutting the two hundred dollars into five parts and taking three of them. Three-fifths of two hundred is one hundred twenty dollars.

So, she spent one hundred twenty dollars on twenties and thirty-five dollars on quarters.  That's one hundred twenty plus thirty-five, which is one hundred fifty-five dollars!


155 

"
"Let's see... Ricardo has 5 tomato plants and each one gives him 22 tomatoes. So that's 5 times 22, which is 110 tomatoes!

He also has 8 eggplant plants, and each one gives him 4 eggplants. So that's 8 times 4, which is 32 eggplants.

Now we add the tomatoes and eggplants together: 110 plus 32 equals 142 fruits!


142 

"
"Okay, so Samwell sold lots of TVs!  Some were smart TVs, some were old-fashioned TVs, and the rest were fancy OLED TVs.  We know he sold 40 TVs in total.

Let's see... a quarter of them were smart TVs, so that's 40 divided by 4, which is 10 smart TVs.

And then 1 out of 8 were the old-fashioned kind, so that's 40 divided by 8, which is 5 old-fashioned TVs.

That means he sold 10 plus 5, which is 15 smart and old-fashioned TVs altogether.

So, to find out how many OLED TVs he sold, we take the total number of TVs and subtract the smart and old-fashioned ones: 40 minus 15 equals 25!

He sold 25 OLED TVs! 


25
"
"The school is paying half, so that's $300 / 2 = $150.  John needs $300 for the trip and the school is paying $150, so he still needs $300 - $150 = $150.  But he already has $50, so he's still missing $150 - $50 = $100.


$100 

"
"Okay, so it's 45 degrees during the day but way colder at night, 33 degrees colder!  That means it's 12 degrees at night.  Brrr!  The pipes freeze if it gets below 32 degrees, so it's gonna be close.  Each log makes it 5 degrees warmer.  Hmm, let's see... 32 minus 12 is 20.  So he needs to make it 20 degrees warmer.  That means he needs to burn 4 logs! 



"
"Okay, so there were 90 people and they made groups of 9. That's 10 groups!  

Three-fifths of the groups found seashells, so that's 6 groups.

Each person in those groups found 2 seashells, and there are 9 people in each group. So that's 6 groups times 9 people times 2 seashells... hmm...  

Let me count it out... 6 times 9 is 54, and 54 times 2 is 108!


108 

"
"Okay, so there were 172 people on the train. Then 47 got off, and that's like taking away, so 172 minus 47 is 125. But then 13 more got on, so we add that back: 125 plus 13 is 138.  Then 38 more got off, so we take that away: 138 minus 38 is 100.

So there are 100 people left on the train! 



"
"Damien finds 10 bottle caps every day, and each one is worth 25 cents.  That's like 25 cents, 25 cents, 25 cents, ten times! So he makes $2.50 every day.

In a month, there are 30 days.  If he makes $2.50 each day, then in a month he makes $2.50 times 30, which is $75.00! 


$75.00 

"
"Jamie works for 8 hours and gets $20 for each hour. So that's 8 times 20, which is $160.

She worked extra hours, 3 more hours! For those extra hours, she gets $30 each hour. So that's 3 times 30, which is $90.

Now we add the money from her regular hours and her extra hours: $160 plus $90 is $250.


$250 

"
"Let's see... there are 12 girl lions and half that many boy lions, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 boy lions.  

Then there are 14 baby lions too!  

So in total, there are 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 lions! 


32 

"
"Okay, so the jeans were $40, but they're on sale for 25% off.  That means they're cheaper!  Let's see... 25% of 40 is 10 dollars off. So the jeans cost $30 now.  Mike pays with a $50 bill, so he gets $20 back!


$20.00 

"
"Okay, so they start with 200 people. Then they add 20 more each month for three months, so that's 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 more people.

Now they have 200 + 60 = 260 people working there.

Each person gets $4000, so 260 people times $4000 is... hmm... let me count it out...  

260 times 4000 is 1,040,000! 


1040000 

"
"Okay, so they sing ""Deck the Halls"" two times, and that song is 150 seconds long.  So that's 150 plus 150, which is 300 seconds. Then they sing ""Jingle Bells"" one time, and that's 240 seconds.  So all together it's 300 plus 240... that's 540 seconds!


540 

"
"Okay, so Billy gets paid more 'cause he's been working longer.  He gets $11.50 an hour now. Sally just started so she only gets $10.50. They both work 20 hours.

Let's see... $11.50 times 20 is $230 for Billy.  $10.50 times 20 is $210 for Sally.

That means Billy makes $20 more than Sally.


$20 

"
"Three loaves of bread cost $6 because 2 dollars times 3 is 6. Two bagels cost $2 because 1 dollar times 2 is 2.  

If you take away 2 from 6, you get 4. So three loaves cost $4 more than two bagels.


$4 

"
"Okay, so Pierson got 278 points. Nikita got half of that plus 11 more... hmm... let's see. Half of 278 is 139, and then we add 11... that's 150!

So Nikita got 150 points.  Now we add that to Pierson's score: 278 + 150 = 428

They got 428 points together! 



"
"Okay, so there are lots of kids planting trees!  

They have 40 classes with 25 kids in each, so that's 40 times 25, which is 1000 kids planting trees.

And each class has 3 teachers, so that's 40 times 3, which is 120 teachers.  

The teachers plant 2 trees each, so that's 120 times 2, which is 240 trees.

So all together, they plant 1000 trees plus 240 trees, which is 1240 trees! 


1240

"Let's see... Bubbles has lots of animals! Three puppies, five koalas, two zebras, and four frogs. That's a lot!  

If she wants goats to be 30% of all her animals, we gotta figure out how many goats that is. Hmmm...  

She has 14 animals in total.  30% of 14 is...  

*counts on fingers*

She needs to buy 5 goats! 



"
"Okay, so Kris wants to play for 30 hours.

She plays for half an hour each day for two weeks. That's 14 days! So that's 14 times 0.5 hours, which is 7 hours.

Then she plays for 2 hours every day for a whole week, so that's 7 days times 2 hours, which is 14 hours.

In total, she played 7 hours plus 14 hours, which is 21 hours.

She needs to play 30 hours, and she's already played 21, so she needs to play 9 more hours.

"The second car is going faster, so it will be ahead.  It's going 10 miles faster each hour.  So in two hours, it will be 20 miles ahead!

"Okay, so the diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. That's $600 + $300 = $900 altogether.

But there's extra money 'cause it's fancy! It's 30% more, so we gotta figure out what 30% of $900 is.  

Hmm, 30% is like 30 out of every 100, so we can do (30/100) * $900 = $270.

So the extra cost is $270.  Now we add that to the regular price: $900 + $270 = $1170.


$1170 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many kids passed the test in total.  

Third grade: 340 kids passed out of 500.

Fourth grade: 40 kids passed out of 100.

Fifth grade:  Hmm, twice as many fourth graders passed, so that's 40 times 2 which is 80 kids passed. And there are 400 fifth graders, so 80 out of 400 passed.

Now let's add up all the kids who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 kids

There are 1000 kids in total, so 700 out of 1000 passed. That's 70%!

"
"Okay, so Milo needs 12 chips for every inch of his mosaic, and it's gonna be 3 inches tall. That means he needs 12 times 3, which is 36 chips for every inch long he makes it. He has two bags of chips, and each bag has 72 chips, so he has 72 times 2, which is 144 chips.  

If he needs 36 chips for every inch, and he has 144 chips, he can make it 144 divided by 36, which is 4 inches long!

"
"Okay, so they had 10 quarts left.  Four kids drank 1.5 each, so that's 4 times 1.5... hmm... that's 6 quarts! Then 16 kids drank 2 quarts each, so that's 16 times 2... that's 32 quarts!  

So they drank 6 plus 32, which is 38 quarts!  

If they had 10 left, and drank 38, they must have started with 38 plus 10... that's 48 quarts!

But the question wants to know how many gallons that is. There are 4 quarts in a gallon, so 48 divided by 4 is... 12 gallons!

"Dale had 100 candies, but then he sold some and got more! He sold 150 candies, so he needs to sell 50 more to sell them all.

"
"Okay, so there are 10 students at first. Then they double every month.

* After one month, there's 10 times 2, which is 20 students.
* Then it doubles again, so there's 20 times 2, which is 40.
* It keeps doubling! So it's 40 times 2, which is 80.
* Then 80 times 2 is 160.
* And finally, 160 times 2 is 320!

So by the end of May, there are 320 students.  That means 310 new students came!

"
"Okay, so Felix climbs trees and gets stuff out for kids. He makes 25 cents for every branch he climbs. He made $105 this week.  

Let's see... if he worked 5 days, that's like $105 divided by 5, which is $21 a day.  

Hmm, so he made $21 each day climbing trees.  He gets 25 cents per branch, so he climbed $21 divided by $0.25, which is 84 branches each day!


84 

"
"Okay, let's count the petals!

She picks 3 flowers with 5 petals, so that's 3 times 5, which is 15 petals.

Then she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals, so that's 4 times 6, which is 24 petals.

Next, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals, so that's 5 times 4, which is 20 petals.

Finally, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals, so that's 6 times 7, which is 42 petals.

Now, let's add all the petals together: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

But oh no, she drops one of each kind of flower! That's 5 petals gone.

So, she has 101 - 5 = 96 petals left in the vase.


96 

"
"Let's see... they used 9 marshmallows each, so that's 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows gone.  

They dropped 3, so that means they have 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.

Each s'more needs one marshmallow, so they can make 14 more s'mores!

They can each have 14 / 2 = 7 s'mores.

"
"Okay, so Jack plays for 20 minutes with one quarter. His friends who aren't as good only play for 10 minutes with one quarter.  The good friend plays for 30 minutes with one quarter.

They play for a long time, 4 whole hours! That's like 240 minutes.

Let's see... Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters.

His not-so-good friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters.  Since there are two of them, that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The good friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters.

Altogether, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

If each quarter is 25 cents, they spend 68 * $0.25 = $17.00 


$17.00
"
"Okay, so Tanya makes her scrub in a jar that holds 10 ounces.  She puts in the same amount of lemon stuff and smelly stuff. She also puts in the same amount of salt and sugar. She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as lemon stuff.  Hmm... that's a lot of stuff!

Let's see... if we think of the lemon stuff as 1, then the smelly stuff is also 1. Salt is 2, and sugar is also 2. Oil is twice the salt, so that's 4!

So Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil. 



"
"Okay, so John buys three goats and each goat costs five hundred dollars. That's fifteen hundred dollars for the goats!  

Then he buys two cows, and each cow costs fifteen hundred dollars. So the cows cost three thousand dollars.

If we add the cost of the goats and the cows, it's fifteen hundred plus three thousand, which is four thousand five hundred dollars.

"
"Paul has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so that's 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes.

He needs 63 cupcakes in total, so he needs to buy 63 - 48 = 15 more cupcakes.

"
"Okay, so Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice that, so Joe has 20 x 2 = 40 cars.

Joe sells some cars, 20% of them. That's like 40 / 5 = 8 cars.

Then he gives his mom twice as many as he sold, so that's 8 x 2 = 16 cars for his mom.

Altogether, he gave away 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

If he started with 40 and gave away 24, he has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.


16 

"
"Okay, so they got $175,000, but some came from other places.  They got $50,000 from other places, so the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now we gotta split that money between 20 students.  That means each student raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.


$6,250 

"
"Sandy walked for 8 hours the first day.  The second day she walked for half that time, so that's 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

That means she walked for 8 + 4 = 12 hours in total.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so she walked for 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.


720 

"
"Hunter saw 50 cars at first. Then he saw 20 more! That's 50 plus 20, which is 70 cars.  But then some cars left. Half of the cars went away, so 70 divided by 2 is 35 cars. That means there were 35 cars left when Hunter went to lunch.


35 

"
"Okay, so John does lots of work! He does 30 sets of work each day, and each set has 5 little jobs. Each little job pays him $1.20.  

If he works for a whole week, that's 7 days. Let's see... hmm...  

* He makes $6.00 for each set of work.
* He makes $180.00 each day.
* So for a whole week, he makes $1260.00!

"Okay, so Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Julie got 4 less than that, so she got 10 points.  In the second game, Sasha scored 6 less than Julie's first game score, so she got 4 points.  

If you add up Sasha's points from both games, it's 14 + 4 = 18 points!

"
"Hmm, let's see... Kimberly has lots of cat food! 8 packs times 11 tins in each pack is... 88 tins!  

She has 6 packs of dog food with 6 tins each, so that's 6 times 6 which is 36 tins.

88 minus 36 is... 52! Kimberly has 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. 



"
"Okay, so PJ has some cards. Smendrick has three times as many as PJ. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.  All together they have 341 cards.  Hmm... that's a lot of cards!

Let's see... if we figure out how many cards PJ has, we can figure out how many Smendrick and Becca have.  Then we can add them all up and see if it equals 341. 

I'm gonna try guessing and checking.  What if PJ has 20 cards?  That means Smendrick has 60 cards (3 times 20) and Becca has 72 cards (60 plus 12).  

If we add those up, 20 + 60 + 72 = 152. That's not enough!

Let's try a bigger number for PJ. What if PJ has 47 cards?  Then Smendrick has 141 cards (3 times 47) and Becca has 153 cards (141 plus 12).

If we add those up, 47 + 141 + 153 = 341!  That's it!

Becca has 153 cards.

"
"Cindy had 5 green eggs. She had twice as many blue eggs, so that's 5 times 2 which is 10 blue eggs. She had one less pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 divided by 3 which is 3 yellow eggs.  

Let's add them all up: 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs!

"
"Okay, so Milly has to pay to send the book back. It costs 35 cents for every pound the book weighs, and the book weighs 4 pounds. So that's 35 cents times 4, which is $1.40.

Then it costs 8 cents for every mile to send it, and it's going 20 miles away. So that's 8 cents times 20, which is $1.60.

Altogether, sending the book costs $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Milly paid $32 for the book, but Amazon will give her some money back. They'll give her 75% of the money back, which is like 3 quarters.  So that's $32 times 0.75, which is $24.00.

So, Milly loses $32 (what she paid) minus $24 (what Amazon gives back) minus $3 (for shipping) which is $5.00.

"
"Mulan starts with $40 and gets $100 from her dad, so she has $40 + $100 = $140.

The jeans cost $30 each, and she buys two, so that's $30 x 2 = $60.

The bag costs $20, so all together she spends $60 + $20 = $80.

If she started with $140 and spent $80, she has $140 - $80 = $60 left.

"Okay, so Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars every month.

He makes 8,000 in the first week. Then only 4,000 in the second week 'cause that's half of the first week.

The third week is busy! He makes 24,000 bars, that's three times the first week!

So, in total for those three weeks, he made 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

That means he needs to make 14,000 more bars in the last week to reach 50,000. 


14000 

"
"Okay, so Britany makes lots of TikToks! Let's see... she makes 18 TikToks a week, and each one is 4 minutes long.  That's 18 times 4, which is 72 minutes just for the TikToks.

Then she sings for 2 hours, and that's 2 times 60, so 120 minutes.

And she does her makeup for 15 minutes every day for 6 days, so that's 15 times 6, which is 90 minutes.

So in total, that's 72 + 120 + 90, which is 282 minutes every week.

But we want to know how much time she spends in a whole month, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So we do 282 times 4, which is 1128 minutes.

That's a lot of TikTok! 



"
"Okay, so the company charges $129 to hang some stuff.  They hang 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 fancy light, and 10 pictures for that price.  

Angela has more stuff: 6 mirrors, 2 fancy lights, and 20 pictures.

Let's see... she has 2 extra mirrors, so that's 2 times $15, which is $30. She has 1 extra fancy light, so that's $15 more. And she has 10 extra pictures, so that's 10 times $15, which is $150.

So, $129 plus $30 plus $15 plus $150 is... $324! 



"
"Okay, so Eva has $20.00. Anthony has $10.00 more than Eva, so he has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00. Roy saved 40% more than Anthony. That means he saved an extra $30.00 times 40%, which is $12.00. So Roy has $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.


$42.00 

"
"Okay, so Pompei lifts a mountain 1 inch high. Saskay lifts it 12 times higher, so that's 12 inches! Kagiyami lifts it even higher, 4 times what Saskay can, so that's 12 times 4, which is 48 inches! And Naruto is the strongest, lifting 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so that's 48 times 10, which is 480 inches!

But we need to know how many feet that is. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide 480 by 12.  That's 40 feet!

"
"Okay, so Mason bikes 8 miles every hour. He bikes for 4 hours, then rests, and then bikes for 6 more hours.  

Let's see... 8 miles an hour for 4 hours is 32 miles. Then he bikes 8 miles an hour for 6 hours, that's 48 miles.

So, 32 miles plus 48 miles is... 80 miles! 


80 

"
"Okay, so three kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the road. That means one kangaroo takes much longer, right?  

If one kangaroo takes 54 hours, a turtle, which is slower, will take even longer! Turtles are super slow. If four turtles are going half as fast as one kangaroo, it's gonna take them a long time.  

Hmm... I think it would take them 27 hours! 



"
"Okay, so Kora made 20 dishes. Rory made 20 more than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. Jada made twice as many as Rory, so she made 40 x 2 = 80 dishes.  

To find the total, we add up all the dishes: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.


140 

"
"Okay, so the laptop costs $600, but it's cheaper if she trades in her old one. It's $400 after the trade-in.

She got $150 from her job and her mom gave her $80.  She also needs $50 more.

That means she has $150 + $80 = $230

Then $230 - $50 = $180

So she has $180 in her purse! 


$180 

"
"Okay, so Adam has 3 big apples and each one makes 5 slices, so that's 3 times 5 which is 15 slices. Then he has 5 small apples and each one makes 3 slices, so that's 5 times 3 which is 15 slices too!  That's a lot of apple, 15 plus 15 is 30 slices! But he eats 15, so 30 minus 15 is... 15!

15 

"
"Hmm, let's see... The farmer gets 5 liters from each cow, and he has 3 cows, so that's 5 times 3 which is 15 liters.  He wants 25 liters, so he needs 25 minus 15, which is 10 more liters.  Since each cow gives 5 liters, he needs 10 divided by 5, which is 2 more cows!

"
"Okay, so Patrick has three glue sticks.  One has a little bit used, like, five-sixths is still there. Another one has one-third left, and the last one has half left.  If they were all brand new and twelve millimeters long, we gotta figure out how much is NOT used up.

Hmm... let's see. Five-sixths of the first one is 10 millimeters, one-third of the second one is 4 millimeters, and half of the last one is 6 millimeters.

If we add those up, 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters!

"
"Okay, so Gabriel wants a car that costs ten thousand dollars and a phone that costs eight hundred dollars. That's a lot of money! He already has five thousand dollars from working and his brother gave him two hundred dollars.  

Let's see... ten thousand plus eight hundred is eleven thousand eight hundred dollars.  Five thousand plus two hundred is five thousand two hundred dollars.  

Hmm, eleven thousand eight hundred minus five thousand two hundred... that's five thousand six hundred dollars!

Gabriel still needs five thousand six hundred dollars.

"
"Craig has two twenty dollar bills, so he has $40.  The squirt guns cost $12 and the water balloons cost $9.  If we add those together, that's $21.  If we take $21 from $40, that means Craig has $19 left. 


$19
"
"Okay, so Jack has 60 dishes.  He has twice as many dishes as socks, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Let's add up all the socks: 60 + 30 = 90 socks

Now let's add up all the dishes: 30 + 60 = 90 dishes

Finally, let's add the socks and dishes together: 90 + 90 = 180

"
"Okay, so Vicki has 2 hours for the concert, which is like 120 minutes.  She takes out 10 minutes for a break, so that leaves 110 minutes for the groups. Each group needs 10 minutes to get on, play, and get off the stage.  If we divide the time for the groups by how long each group takes, we get 110 divided by 10, which is 11.

So, 11 groups can perform! 



"
"Okay, so Brenda starts with $300.  Every year she gets $225 more.  After one year she has $300 + $225 = $525. After two years she has $525 + $225 = $750. And after three years she has $750 + $225 = $975.


$975 

"
"Okay, so there are 40 white shirts and half of them have collars, so that's 40 divided by 2 which is 20 white shirts with collars.  That means 20 white shirts don't have collars.

Then there are 50 flowery shirts and 20 of them have buttons. So 50 minus 20 is 30 flowery shirts without buttons.

That means there are 30 flowery shirts without buttons and 20 white shirts without collars.  30 minus 20 is 10.

"
"Okay, so the farmer has lots of eggs!  He puts 30 eggs on each tray.  If he has 900 eggs, that's 900 divided by 30... hmm... that's 30 trays!

He sells each tray for $2.50. So, 30 trays times $2.50 each is... $75! 



"
"Okay, so Mr. Smith has lots of goats! He has 55 on one farm and 45 on the other.  He sells some goats, 10 from the first farm and then twice that many from the second farm. That's 10 times 2, which is 20 goats!

So now the first farm has 55 minus 10 goats, which is 45 goats left. The second farm has 45 minus 20 goats, which is 25 goats left.

If we add those together, 45 plus 25, we get 70 goats!


70 

"
"Okay, so James buys shoes a lot! He gets 2 pairs every month, and that's like 2 times 12, which is 24 pairs in a whole year.  

If he spends $2640 on all those shoes, we gotta split that up by the 24 pairs.  

Hmm, let's see... $2640 split by 24 is... $110 for each pair! 



"
"Okay, so you buy three green baskets for $25 each, that's 3 times 25, which is 75 dollars.  Then you get three red baskets, but they're cheaper! Each one is $18, but you save $2 on each one. So, each red basket costs 18 minus 2, which is 16 dollars.  Three red baskets cost 16 times 3, which is 48 dollars.

Now, let's add up the green and red baskets: 75 plus 48 is 123 dollars.


$123 

"
"Okay, so there are 90 rooms, but we only need to clean half. That's like 90 divided by 2, which is 45 rooms.

Each room takes 20 minutes to clean, so 45 rooms times 20 minutes is... hmm...  900 minutes!

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 900 minutes is the same as 15 hours.


15 

"
"Okay, so they build 12 houses the first year. Then they build 12 times 3, which is 36 houses the next year.  That's 12 plus 36, which is 48 houses! Then they double that, so 48 times 2 is 96 houses.  

So in total, they build 48 plus 96, which is 144 houses! 


144 

"
"Okay, so my brother is older than me by 3 years, and I'm older than my sister by 2 years. My mom is a bit tricky - she's one less than three times my brother's age.  If we all add up to 87 years, how old am I? Hmm... let me think...

I'm gonna guess I'm 11 years old! 



"
"Mr. Jackson has 27 kids in his class and each kid needs 2 glue sticks. That's 27 times 2, which is 54 glue sticks.  Glue sticks come in packs of 8, so he needs to buy 54 divided by 8 packs.  That's a little more than 6 packs, so he needs to buy 7 packs to have enough for everyone.


7 

"
"Okay, so the river starts with 4000 gallons of water. Then it rains a lot and there's twice as much water, so that's 4000 times 2 which is 8000 gallons.  On the third day, even more water comes, 6000 more gallons! So we add that to the 8000, which makes 8000 plus 6000, that's 14000 gallons!

14000 

"
"Hmm, let me see...

So, ten people are sick, and each one makes six more people sick every day.  

On the first day, that's 10 times 6, which is 60 more people sick. So now there are 70 sick people.

Then on the second day, those 70 people each make 6 more sick, so that's 70 times 6...  carry the one... that's 420 more people! Now there are 490 sick people.

On the third day, all those 490 people make 6 more sick each...  that's a lot of people! 490 times 6 is...  wow, 2940!

So after three days, there are 3430 people sick. 



"
"Rafaela got $20 from each of the 40 people, so she got 20 times 40 dollars, which is $800!

Julieta got a little less than Rafaela, 10% less. That means she got $80 less than Rafaela, so she got $800 - $80 = $720.

To find out how much they got together, we add Rafaela's money and Julieta's money: $800 + $720 = $1520.

"
"Okay, so Claire gets one badge every month. Amber takes twice as long, so she gets one badge every two months. That means in a whole year, she gets 12 months / 2 months per badge = 6 badges.

Wendy is super fast! She gets three times as many badges as Claire, so she gets 1 badge/month * 3 = 3 badges every month. In a year, that's 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges!

Wendy gets way more badges than Amber.  She gets 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 more badges than Amber.


30 

"
"Okay, so Paige bakes banana bread for 5 hours, and she makes 2 loaves every hour. That's 5 times 2, which is 10 loaves!

Each loaf has 8 slices, so she has 10 times 8, which is 80 slices.

Each slice costs 50 cents, so she makes 80 times 50 cents... hmm... that's 40 dollars!


$40.00 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Gretchen has 70 gold coins, and that's 30 more than her silver coins. So she has 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.

"
"Mr. George had 600 burritos.  All the students ate 500 burritos.  Mr. George ate 20 burritos. That's 500 + 20 = 520 burritos gone.

So, 600 - 520 = 80 burritos left over! 


80 

"
"Okay, so they have 12 red cars.  They have 2 less green cars than red cars, so that's 12 - 2 = 10 green cars. They have 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, so that's 10 x 3 = 30 blue cars.  

That's 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars.  

If they have 75 cars in total, then they must have 75 - 52 = 23 yellow cars! 


23 

"
"Okay, so they have 85 books all together.  Sofie has more books than Anne, and Anne has less than Fawn. Hmm...

Let's see... if we think of Fawn having a bunch of books, Anne has a little less, and Sofie has even more than Anne.  

I think Fawn has 28 books!

"The potatoes weighed 5 pounds. The sweet potatoes weighed double that, so they were 5 times 2 which is 10 pounds. The carrots weighed 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes, so they were 10 minus 3 which is 7 pounds.

"
"Okay, so Greg needs a lot of jello!  He has 30 kids coming and each kid wants 4 cups. That's 30 times 4, which is 120 cups!

Each box makes 10 cups, so he needs 120 divided by 10, which is 12 boxes.

Each box costs $1.25, so 12 boxes cost 12 times $1.25.  That's $15.00!


$15.00 

"
"The phones cost 5 times $700, so that's 5 x 700 = $3500.  

If he gave the seller $4000, then the change is $4000 - $3500 = $500.


$500 

"
"Okay, so Madeline and Keenan spend $400 on food each month. Madeline pays for most of it, like 60%.  That means Keenan pays the other part, which is 40%.  

If we take 40% of $400, that's $160 for Keenan for the whole month.  

Now, a month has 4 weeks, so we gotta split that $160 by 4.  That means Keenan spends $40 each week on food.


$40 

"
"Okay, so Tobias had a big pizza with 60 pieces. On the first day, he ate a lot, like two-fifths of the whole pizza! That's 24 pieces. Then the next day he ate 10 more.  

On the third day, he ate some more, but I gotta do some thinking to figure that out.  Let's see... he had 60 pieces, then ate 24, then 10 more... that's 34 pieces gone. So he had 60 - 34 = 26 pieces left.

He ate seven-thirteenths of those left... hmm... that's 14 pieces!

So in total, he ate 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces! 


48 

"
"Okay, so David wants some soda and water.  

Soda costs $3.00 for one bottle, and he wants 3, so that's 3 times $3.00 which is $9.00.

Water costs $2.00 per bottle, and he wants 2, so that's 2 times $2.00 which is $4.00.

If we add the price of the soda and the water, it's $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00


$13.00 

"
"Okay, so David has $12.48 and each bolt costs 3 cents.  He wants 16 bolts, so that's 16 times 3 cents, which is 48 cents.  If we take 48 cents away from his $12.48, he has $12.00 left. 


$12.00
"
"Hmm, let's see... Ella makes $33 for 3 hours of walking dogs.  That means she makes $11 each hour because 33 divided by 3 is 11.

If she walks dogs for 12 hours, she'd make $132 because 11 times 12 is 132!


$132 

"
"Paul started with 52 marbles and got 28 more, so that's 52 + 28 = 80 marbles!  But then he lost some.  

If he lost a quarter of his marbles, that's like cutting them into four equal groups and taking one away.  So he lost 80 / 4 = 20 marbles.

That means he has 80 - 20 = 60 marbles left.


60 

"
"Okay, so Amy is good at history!  

She gets most of the questions right. Let's see...

* She gets 8 out of 10 multiple choice right, so that's 8 points!
* She gets 18 out of 20 true/false right, so that's 18 points!
* For the long answer ones, she gets 3 out of 5 right.  Each one is worth 5 points, so that's 15 points!

If we add all those up, 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points!


41 

"
"Okay, so Isaias wants to make $2000 extra. He sells each chicken for $50, and he's selling 180 chickens (that's 3/5 of his 300 chickens).  

If he sells all those chickens, he'll make 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.

But he wants to make $2000 extra, so he must have spent $9000 - $2000 = $7000 to buy the chickens.


$7000 

"
"Julie sold 14 glasses. Micah and Mitchell sold the rest, and they sold the same amount.  So they each sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses split in half, which is 18 / 2 = 9 glasses each.

Julie sold 14 - 9 = 5 more glasses than Micah. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Iris spent $400 on her hair.  Her manicure cost 1/4 of that, so that's $400 divided by 4, which is $100. Her pedicure cost 3/4 of the manicure price, so that's $100 times 3/4, which is $75.  

To find out how much she spent in total, we add up the prices: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.


575 

"
"Sarah gets $2 for every meter of rope. Her rope is 20 meters long, so she makes 20 times $2 which is $40!

The new rope costs $1.50 for each meter, and she wants 20 meters, so that's 20 times $1.50 which is $30.

If she has $40 and spends $30, she has $10 left over! 


$10
"
"Melanie is 8 years old now.  In 10 years, she'll be 18.  

To be three times her age now, she needs to be 8 x 3 = 24 years old.

That means she needs 24 - 8 = 16 more years!


16 

"
"Okay, let's see... Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 all together.  That means each pack of bacon costs $2.  The chicken costs twice as much as the bacon, so each pack of chicken costs $4.  She has 6 packs of chicken, so that's $4 times 6, which is $24.  Strawberries are $4 each and she has 3, so those are $12. Apples are half the price of strawberries, so they are $2 each. She has 7 apples, so those are $14.

Let's add it all up: $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $60.

If Kelly has $65 and her groceries cost $60, she has $5 left! 



"
"Elaina's final concert was super long! It was twice as long as her normal concerts, plus she played extra songs for 15 minutes at the end.  The whole thing was 65 minutes long.  

Hmm, if we take away the extra 15 minutes, that leaves 50 minutes.  That 50 minutes is twice as long as her normal concert. So, her normal concerts must be 25 minutes long! 


25
"
"Argo started with 200 toys. He gave away a lot of toys!  He gave Alyssa 40, Bonnie 80, and Nicky 30.  

To find out how many he has left, we need to add up the toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

Then we take that number away from the toys he started with: 200 - 150 = 50 toys.

Argo has 50 toys left. 



"
"They make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday and Wednesday, so that's 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas.

On Friday they make double, so that's 125 x 2 = 250 chimichangas.

Altogether, they make 250 + 250 = 500 chimichangas! 


500 

"
"Hmm, let's see... He has 50 microphones, but 20 of them can't fit. That means 50 - 20 = 30 microphones can fit.

Since microphones go in pairs, he can make 30 / 2 = 15 pairs.


15 

"
"Let's see... six birds in the bushes plus four birds flying... that's ten! And then there's three groups of eight birds eating, so that's like eight plus eight plus eight, which is twenty-four!  Ten plus twenty-four is thirty-four birds! 


34 

"
"Lani had 55 cookies, but she ate 5. That means she has 50 cookies left.  She puts them in 5 jars, so each jar gets 10 cookies! 


10
"
"Let's see... the daisies have 10 petals each and there are 4 of them, so that's 10 times 4 which is 40 petals! The orchids have 5 petals each and there are 5 of them, so that's 5 times 5 which is 25 petals.  

Hmmm, 40 minus 25 is 15. So the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids!


15 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Smith has 100 plants.  A quarter of them are inside, so that's 25 plants. That leaves 75 plants. Two-thirds of those are outside, so that's 50 plants.  That means the other 25 plants must be flowering plants!

So the answer is 25%. 



"
"A whatchamacallit is super fast, going 121 meters every second! It goes way faster than a thingamabob, like 11 times faster.  And a whirligig is even faster than a thingamabob, like 5 times faster. So, if a thingamabob goes 11 meters a second, a whirligig goes 5 times that, which is 55 meters a second! 


55 

"
"Okay, so Ellen eats two carrots, a salad for $6, and yogurt. The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.

That means the salad and yogurt together cost $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen spends $11 in total, so the carrots cost $11 - $9 = $2.

Since she buys two carrots, one carrot costs $2 / 2 = $1. 


$1 

"
"Mark works 8 hours a day, and he works 5 days a week. That's 8 times 5, which is 40 hours a week.

He used to make $10 an hour, but now he makes $12 an hour. So he makes $12 for every hour he works.

He works 40 hours a week, so he makes $12 times 40, which is $480 a week! 


$480 

"
"Hmm, this is a tricky one! Tasha made money from lemonade and mowing lawns. We know she made $80 in total.  

She mowed Kamala's lawn a bunch of times, and Alba's lawn even more times! But we don't know exactly how many times she mowed each lawn.  

Since we don't know how many times she mowed, we can't figure out exactly how much she made from lemonade. 



"
"Okay, let's see... Martin weighs 55 kg. Carl is bigger, 16 kg bigger! So Carl weighs 55 + 16 = 71 kg.  Christian is even bigger than Carl by 8 kg, so he weighs 71 + 8 = 79 kg.  Harry is a little smaller than Christian, 5 kg smaller, so Harry weighs 79 - 5 = 74 kg.


74 

"
"Okay, so John rents his car a lot! He makes $25 each hour, and he rents it for 3 hours ten times a month.  That's like 10 times 3, which is 30 hours!  So he makes 30 times $25, which is $750. But he has to pay $500 for the car, so he gets to keep $750 - $500, which is $250.


$250 

"
"Martha had 2 notebooks before she bought more.  Then she got 5 more, so now she has 7 notebooks! Joseph has 6 notebooks because he has 3 times as many as Martha had at the start.  Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph. 


1 

"
"Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 more than that, so he rowed 10 more miles (50 / 5 = 10). That means Anis rowed 60 miles (50 + 10 = 60).

To find the total, we add Dijana's miles and Anis's miles: 50 + 60 = 110 miles.


110 

"
"Susan had 100 cookies, but her husband ate 4. That means there are 96 cookies left.  She has 6 nephews, so if she shares them equally, each nephew gets 16 cookies! 


16
"
"Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 18 pages today, so she read 10 + 18 = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 today, so he read 13 pages.

Denise read 28 - 13 = 15 more pages than Daniel.


15 

"
"Calvin has enough soup for 8 little bowls.  He and his wife each eat one big bowl, and that's like two little bowls. His kids each eat one little bowl. So they use 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 little bowls. That leaves 8 - 6 = 2 little bowls left for the kids to have for lunch!

2 

"
"Hmm, let's see... William bought five notebooks and each notebook costs a dollar fifty. So that's five times a dollar fifty... which is seven dollars fifty!  And the pen costs fifty cents.  So, seven dollars fifty plus fifty cents... that's eight dollars!


$8.00 

"
"Okay, so Jo makes small masks with 2 yards of stuff and gets 4 masks.  That means each small mask needs half a yard.  She wants 20 small masks, so that's 20 times half a yard, which is 10 yards!

For the big masks, she uses 2 and a quarter yards for 3 masks.  So each big mask needs a little more than three-quarters of a yard.  She wants 8 big masks, so that's 8 times three-quarters of a yard, which is 6 yards.

Altogether, she needs 10 yards plus 6 yards, which is 16 yards! 


16
"
"Deepa saw 9 movies times 3, that's a lot of movies!  That's 27 times she went to the movies.  If she spent $216, then each movie cost $216 split into 27 parts.  Hmm, let me count on my fingers... $216 split by 27 is $8.


$8 

"
"Harold sleeps a lot!  He sleeps for 10 hours. Then he works, but he works less than he sleeps, only 8 hours. And he walks his dog for 1 hour.  That's 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours!  

There are 24 hours in a day, so he has 24 - 19 = 5 hours left to play or do other fun stuff! 


5 

"
"Tim had 7 blue boxes and 9 red boxes. He used 3 blue boxes and 3 red boxes for fishing.  That means he has 4 blue boxes and 6 red boxes left.  

If you add those together, he has 10 boxes left! 


10 

"
"Joseph had lots of books! Sarah has 9, and Joseph had twice that, so he had 9 times 2 which is 18 books. But then he lost some. He lost 2 books, so now he has 18 minus 2 which is 16 books. 


16
"
"Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives 6 to Jamie (because 30 divided by 5 is 6) and then 10 to Donald.  That's 16 marbles gone in total.  If he started with 30 and gave away 16, he has 14 left!


14 

"
"Okay, so Duncan is 60 now, but eight years ago he was 52.  That means Adam was half Duncan's age then, so Adam was 26.  If Adam was 26 four years ago, now he's 30.  In eight more years, he'll be 38! 


38 

"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 200 acres. Farmer Smith has twice that amount plus 100 more, so that's 200 times 2 which is 400, then plus 100 more, so that's 500 acres!  

Together they have 200 plus 500 acres, which is 700 acres. 


700 

"
"Colby makes 20 cents for each package. He does 40 packages each hour.  That's 40 times 20 cents, which is 8 dollars each hour.  He works for 8 hours, so he makes 8 times 8 dollars, which is 64 dollars!


$64.00 

"
"Okay, so John drinks water every half hour. A really hard sudoku takes him an hour and a half, which is like, three half hours.  That means he drinks 3 bottles of water!

"
"Okay, so Benny threw bologna at red and yellow balloons. He used two pieces for each red balloon and three for each yellow one. He used 58 pieces in total, and there were 20 red balloons.  

Hmm... let's see. He used 2 pieces per red balloon times 20 red balloons, that's 40 pieces for the red ones.  That means he used 58 total pieces minus 40 pieces, so 18 pieces for the yellow balloons.

If he used 3 pieces per yellow balloon, then he must have had 18 pieces divided by 3, which is 6 yellow balloons!


6 

"
"Okay, so Jon drives 100 miles every day for a whole month. That's like driving to the next town and back a bunch of times!  A month has 30 days, so he drives 100 times 30, which is 3000 miles!

He needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, so he needs 3000 divided by 1000, which is 3 tune-ups. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday. Then on Wednesday, he works twice as much, so that's 5 times 2 which is 10 hours. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, so that's 10 minus 2 which is 8 hours.  

To find the total, we add up all the hours: 5 plus 10 plus 8 equals 23 hours.


23 

"
"Okay, so Julia and Nadine got the same amount of money from their mom. They put it together to buy a cake for $11, balloons for $3, and two ice creams for $7 each. That means the ice cream cost $7 x 2 = $14.

All together, they spent $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they shared the money, their mom gave each of them $28 / 2 = $14. 


$14
"
"Kira has 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. That's a lot of fruit!  Lola ate 2 pieces.  If we count all the fruit Kira has and then take away the 2 Lola ate, we can find out how much is left.  

Let's see... 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces of fruit.  Then 14 - 2 = 12 pieces left.


12 

"
"Let's count!

There are 6 kids playing tennis and 6 times 2 is 12 kids playing volleyball. That's 6 plus 12, which is 18 kids playing tennis and volleyball.

Then there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so that's 16 plus 22, which is 38 kids playing soccer.

Altogether, there are 18 plus 38 kids, which is 56 kids!


56 

"
"Okay, so they sold 300 lollipops 'cause 30 kids sold 10 each.  If each one costs 80 cents, that's 300 times 80 cents... hmm... that's 240 dollars! But they spent 150 dollars to buy them, so they made 240 minus 150... which is 90 dollars!


90 

"
"Larry has lots of pets! He has 3 kitties.  He has 3 times that many doggies, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 doggies! He has 2 less bunnies than doggies, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 bunnies. He has a fish tank with 3 times the number of bunnies, so that's 7 times 3, which is 21 fishies! And he has 7 gerbils, which is 1/3 the number of fishies.

Let's add them all up: 3 kitties + 9 doggies + 7 bunnies + 21 fishies + 7 gerbils = 47 pets! Wow!


47 

"
"Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats 4 slices a day because he eats twice as much. That's 2 + 4 = 6 slices they eat together each day.  

The bread has 24 slices, so it will last 24 / 6 = 4 days. 

4 

"
"Martha collects shells for 5 years, and she gets one new shell every month.  So that's 5 times 12 months, which is 60 months.  Since she gets one shell each month, she'll have 60 shells! 


60 

"
"Okay, so Lana has 27 cups and puts them in 3 rows. That means each row has 9 cups.  She wants the same amount of chamomile and mint in each row. So that's 9 cups split in half, which is 4.5 cups of each!


4.5 

"
"Okay, so the sloth takes 4 hours for each trip to get berries.  If he has 8 hours, he can go down twice! That means he needs to get 24 berries in just two trips.  So, he needs to get 12 berries each time he goes down. 


12 

"
"The pool has lots of water, 10,000 gallons! Anthony and his dad take half of it to fill a tank. That's 5,000 gallons in the tank.

They use 500 gallons every day to water their garden. After 6 days, they used 500 x 6 = 3,000 gallons.

So, they have 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 gallons left in the tank.


2000 

"
"Okay, let's see... Colby has $150 for movies. He already spent some on movies and snacks.  

He wants to see a movie on Friday, get popcorn, and candy. That costs $10 for the movie + $8 for popcorn + $2 for candy = $20.

He has enough money for one more movie! 


1 

"
"Okay, so Andrew made lots of yummy treats!  

The mini cinnamon rolls have 200 calories each, and he made 200 of them. That's 200 times 200, which is 40,000 calories!

The mini blueberry muffins have 150 calories each, and he made 300 of them. That's 300 times 150, which is 45,000 calories!

To find the total, we add the cinnamon roll calories and the muffin calories: 40,000 plus 45,000 equals 85,000 calories. 

Whew, that's a lot of calories!


85000 

"
"Okay, so Rita takes out a lotta Junebugs!

* Monday: 39 Junebugs
* Tuesday: 39 x 2 = 78 Junebugs
* Wednesday: 39 x 2 = 78 Junebugs
* Thursday: 48 Junebugs
* Friday: 57 Junebugs

Let's add them all up: 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Now, to find the average, we gotta divide the total by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60 Junebugs


60 

"
"The bus went 300 miles because 60 times 5 is 300. The car went 240 miles because 30 times 8 is 240.  

300 take away 240 is 60.

So the bus went 60 miles farther. 


60
"
"Let's see... Sophie has lots of toys! She has 31 blocks, 8 fluffy animals, and 9 rings. That's 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 toys.

She has 62 toys in total, so she must have 62 - 48 = 14 bouncy balls! 


14 

"
"Okay, so Peter, Paul, and Jean are 100 years old all together. Paul is 10 years older than John. And Peter's age is Paul's age plus John's age.  Hmm... let me see...

If we add Paul's age and John's age, we get Peter's age. And Paul is older than John by 10 years.  

Let's say John is 20 years old. Then Paul would be 30 years old (20 + 10).

If we add those together, Peter is 50 years old (20 + 30)!

So Peter is 50 years old. 


50
"
"Okay, so Maria has 4 friends, and each friend gets 2 balloons. That's 4 times 2, which is 8 balloons! Maria has 1 balloon too, so that's 8 plus 1, which is 9 balloons. Then her mom gives everyone 3 more balloons.  That's 5 people times 3 balloons, which is 15 balloons! So, 9 plus 15 is 24 balloons in total!


24 

"
"Okay, so they have lots of boxes! Ten people gave five boxes each, so that's ten times five, which is fifty boxes.  They already had ten boxes, so now they have fifty plus ten, which is sixty boxes.  Each table holds two boxes, so they need sixty divided by two, which is thirty tables.  They already have fifteen tables, so they need thirty minus fifteen, which is fifteen more tables.


15 

"
"Okay, so Zoey spits 40 seeds and each one goes 10 feet. That's 40 times 10, which is 400 feet! Sydney spits 35 seeds and each one goes 12 feet. So that's 35 times 12, which is 420 feet.  

To find the average, we add up the distances and divide by 2 because there are two people. 400 plus 420 is 820. Then 820 divided by 2 is 410.


410 

"
"Okay, so Fern wants to make lots of widgets and sell them!

The Widgeteer makes 60 widgets every hour, and it runs all day and all month! That's a whole lotta widgets! The other one makes less, only 45 an hour.

If she sells each widget for $6, the Widgeteer will make her way more money 'cause it makes more widgets.  I think she should get the Widgeteer!

Let me see... 64800 dollars more! 



"
"Cameron stays for 17 hours. The hotel costs 1000 pesos for 12 hours, and then 70 pesos for each extra hour.  He needs to pay for 5 extra hours, so that's 5 times 70 pesos, which is 350 pesos.

So, in total, he pays 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.  Cameron saves 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos!


250 

"
"Okay, so each goat eats 5 pounds of hay.  There are 15 goats, so that's 5 times 15, which is 75 pounds of hay for all the goats.

Sheep eat less hay. They eat 2 times the amount a goat eats, then take away 3 pounds. So that's 2 times 5 minus 3, which is 7 pounds of hay for each sheep.

There are 12 sheep, so they eat 7 times 12, which is 84 pounds of hay.

To find the total, we add the goat hay and the sheep hay: 75 plus 84 is 159 pounds.


159 

"
"Okay, so John makes 50 dollars every hour and worked for 6 hours. That means he made 50 times 6, which is 300 dollars!

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 minus 50, which is 250 dollars left.

Then he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each.  That's 5 times 10, which is 50 dollars.

So now he has 250 minus 50, which is 200 dollars.

He wants to put 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 minus 100, which is 100 dollars left.

Each pen costs 25 dollars, so he can buy 100 divided by 25, which is 4 pens! 


4 

"
"Craig spelled a lot of long words! He spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, so that's 20 times 15, which is 300 letters. His brother spelled words with 50 more letters than Craig, so that's 300 plus 50, which is 350 letters.  

To find the total, we add Craig's letters and his brother's letters: 300 plus 350 is 650.


650 

"
"Hmm, let's see... 8 children in a row, and 7 rows... that's 8 times 7, which is 56 children in each school.  And there are 5 schools, so we do 56 times 5...  

That's 280 children! 



"
"The teacher has lots of juice! She has 9 papers that let her get 100 juice bottles each. That's 9 times 100, which is 900 bottles!  

She gives each of her 29 students 2 bottles, so that's 29 times 2, which is 58 bottles.

If she starts with 900 and gives away 58, she has 900 minus 58 left.  That's 842 bottles for her!


842 

"
"Okay, so Patty charges $40 just to come to your house. Then she charges $35 for every hour she works, even if she doesn't work a full hour.  She worked for 2 and a quarter hours, so that's like 2 hours and 15 minutes.  That's a little more than 2 hours, so it's $35 times 2 which is $70.  Plus, she used $60 in parts.  So, $40 + $70 + $60 is... $170!


$170 

"
"Okay, so James buys ten CDs, and each one costs fifteen dollars. That's fifteen times ten, which is one hundred and fifty dollars!

But wait, he gets them for forty percent off!  That means he saves sixty dollars (because forty percent of one hundred and fifty is sixty).

So, he pays ninety dollars for the CDs (one hundred and fifty minus sixty).

Then, he sells five of the CDs for forty dollars each. That's two hundred dollars!

He made one hundred and ten dollars! (Two hundred minus ninety).


$110 

"
"Let's see... Jen has 6 yams and each yam costs $1.50. So that's 6 times $1.50, which is $9.00.

Her sweet potatoes are $2 each and she has 10, so that's 10 times $2.00, which is $20.00.

And her carrots are $1.25 each and she has 4, so that's 4 times $1.25, which is $5.00.

If we add all that up, $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

So Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything! 


$34.00
"
"Okay, so James swims 60% of the lake, which is like a little more than half. That's 12 miles!

He swims at 2 miles per hour, so that takes him 6 hours. Then he rests for 3 hours, which is half the time he swam.

He has 8 miles left to go, but he's tired, so he swims slower, only 1 mile per hour. That takes him 8 more hours.

So, in total, it takes him 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours to cross the lake. 


17
"
"Okay, so Sam had 70 loaves.  The bakery has seven times that amount, so that's 7 times 70 which is 490. But then they have 40 less than that, so we take away 40 from 490.  That means the bakery has 450 loaves! 



"
"Jasmine started with 15 stickers, but lost some at playtime.  She had 8 stickers left. Then her teacher gave her more stickers for being helpful, so she has 13 stickers now! 


13
"
"Okay, so Cayley sells newspapers. He gets extra money for every newspaper he sells.

For the New York Times, he gets 10 cents for every dollar, so for 6 newspapers, that's 6 times 50 cents, which is $3.

For the Wall Street Journal, he gets 8 cents for every dollar, so for 10 newspapers, that's 10 times $1.20, which is $12.

If we add those together, $3 plus $12 is $15.


$15.00 

"
"Deanna is 26, and Marcus is 5 years younger than her, so Marcus is 21.  Marcus is half Leo's age, so Leo must be 21 times 2! That means Leo is 42 years old. 

42 

"
"Okay, so Bahati scored the most points, and he scored 20 more than Azibo.  Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati.  If they scored 45 points total, let's see... hmm... Azibo must have scored 5 points! 



"
"Hmm, so the book is 1.5 inches thick and each inch has 100 pages.  That means there are 150 pages in the book! 



"
"Okay, so Vince staples really fast! He does 30 reports every 15 minutes.  He worked a long time, from 8 in the morning until 11 at night. That's like, a whole day!  

Hmm, let's see... there are 60 minutes in an hour, and he worked for 15 hours. So that's 60 times 15, which is 900 minutes!

He staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, so we gotta see how many times 15 goes into 900.  That's 60 times!

So he stapled 30 reports times 60... that's 1800 reports! Wow!


1800 

"
"Okay, so Kim sleeps from 10 at night until 6 in the morning. That's like 8 hours of sleep!  

But she got up to walk around for a bit, from 2:15 to 2:38.  That's not much time, right? And she woke up a little early to go potty.

Let's see... 8 hours is a long time, but she wasn't sleeping the whole time. Hmmm... I think she slept for 452 minutes. 



"
"Okay, so Jonathan has lots of cups, two dozen is like, a whole bunch! That's 24 cups. He has less spoons, only two-thirds as many.  Hmm, two-thirds of 24... that's 16 spoons.

But then he gives some away, 6 spoons for his friend. So now he only has 10 spoons left.

Let's see, he has 24 cups and 10 spoons, so that's 34 things in total! 


34 

"
"Okay, so the hospital has 1000 beds, but only 1/5 are full. That means 200 beds have people in them.  

They get 50 new people every day, and that's for two weeks, which is 14 days. So that's 50 times 14, which is 700 more people!

That means there are 200 + 700 = 900 people in the hospital now.

If there are 1000 beds and 900 are full, then there are 100 empty beds left.


100 

"
"Robyn sends 16 emails a day. 7 are for work.  That leaves 9 emails. Two-thirds of those are to family, so that's 6 emails.  That means 3 emails are for her boyfriend. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Aliya is 3. Shawna is three times older than Aliya, so Shawna is 3 times 3 which is 9. Shawna's dad is five times older than Shawna, so he is 5 times 9 which is 45. 

45 

"
"Courtney said there were 48 people, but she counted too high. Kelly said Courtney counted 20% too many.  That means we need to take away 20% of 48.  Hmm, 20% is like 20 out of every 100, so let's see... 20 out of 100 is like cutting 48 into 5 pieces and taking one away. That's 9.6.  So we take 9.6 away from 48. That's 38.4.  You can't have part of a person, so there must have been 38 people at the concert. 


38 

"
"Okay, so Jason carried 2 balls.  Jeffrey carried half as many as Jason, so he carried 1 ball. Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so he carried 4 balls.  That means they carried 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls in total! 


7 

"
"Okay, so they dug a bunch of holes! Ten, then thirteen, then eight.  But then they had to fill two back in 'cause they were too deep!  

That means they had 29 holes before they found the treasure.  The island had four times as many holes at the end of day four as it did at the end of day one. So, they must have dug 7 holes on day one.

That means they dug 22 holes on day four! 


22 

"
"Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips. Collins got 15 more than them, so he got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total, we add up all the chips: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 corn chips.


225 

"
"Okay, so Jen needs stuff for his trip that costs $400.  His tickets cost way more, like half again as much as the stuff!  That means his tickets cost $400 plus another $200, which is $600!


$600 

"
"Okay, so Adelwolfe, Stan, and Alex caught Pokemon together. They got 339 in total!

Adelwolfe caught some, and Stan caught 13 less than four times what Adelwolfe caught. Alex caught 5 more than Stan.

Hmm... that's tricky. Let me see...

If we say Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon, then Stan caught 4 times that minus 13, so 160 - 13 = 147 Pokemon!

So Stan caught 147 Pokemon. 



"
"Hmm, let's see... each show is 20 minutes long. And there are only half as many shows as minutes in one show, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 shows.

That means he'll watch 10 shows * 20 minutes each = 200 minutes! 


200 

"
"Okay, so the birdie flies south for a long time, then goes a little north, then south again.  

Let's see... 10 hours times 30 miles is 300 miles south. Then it goes 2 hours times 18 miles, that's 36 miles north.  Then 5 hours times 22 miles is 110 miles south.

So, 300 minus 36 plus 110... that's 374 miles!


374 

"
"Greta made 12 brownies. Her office gave her 6 more. Her friends gave her 48 more! That's a lot of brownies!  They ate 18 brownies at her party.  Let's see... 12 plus 6 plus 48 is 66 brownies. Then take away the 18 they ate... 66 take away 18 is 48.

Greta has 48 brownies left! 



"
"Okay, so Nani is 8. His brother is twice that, so he's 8 times 2 which is 16. Nani's sister is younger, 25% younger. That means she's 2 years younger than Nani, so she's 6.  If you add them all up, 8 plus 16 plus 6, that's 30!


30 

"
"Okay, so Andy has lots of racquets to string!

Let's see... he has 3 with synthetic gut, and those take 15 minutes each. So that's 3 times 15, which is 45 minutes.

Then he has 5 with polyester, and those take 22 minutes each.  That's 5 times 22, which is 110 minutes.

And lastly, he has 4 hybrid ones, which take 18 minutes each. So that's 4 times 18, which is 72 minutes.

Now we add all that up: 45 plus 110 plus 72 is 227 minutes!


227 

"
"Okay, so John buys two phones for full price, which is $600 each, so that's $600 times 2, which is $1200.

Then he buys two more phones, but they're half price, so each one is $600 divided by 2, which is $300.  

So those two phones cost $300 times 2, which is $600.

Now we add the prices together: $1200 plus $600 is $1800.


$1800 

"
"Okay, so Carlton's team has 13 players, and Zeke's team has 7 more than that.  So Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

That means there are 13 + 20 = 33 players in total! 


33 

"
"Okay, so Robert's fence is like a big rectangle.  It's 15 feet long and 10 feet wide.  That means all the way around it is 15 + 10 + 15 + 10 = 50 feet!

He needs 2 slats for every foot, so he needs 50 x 2 = 100 slats.


100 

"
"Mrs. Harrington had 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 to her mom and 2 to her sister, so that's 4 boxes gone. That leaves her with 12 - 4 = 8 boxes. She kept 2 boxes for herself, so she sold 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.  Each box has 20 oranges, so she sold 6 * 20 = 120 oranges.


120 

"
"The USA has lots of states, 50 of them! India has a little less.  It has 4 more than half the number of states the USA has.  So, let's see... half of 50 is 25, and then we add 4 more... that's 29 states for India.

If we add all the states together, that's 29 + 50 = 79 states!


79 

"
"Okay, so Tyler wants to buy some books. They cost $18, $13, and $8. That's a lot of numbers! Let's add them up: 18 plus 13 plus 8 is 39 dollars.

He already has $14, so he needs 39 minus 14, which is $25 more.

He makes $5 every hour.  To get $25, he needs to work 5 hours. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Robert has 30 cherries. Richard has 10 less than Robert, so Richard has 20 cherries. That means Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together.  

If they have 60 cherries all together, then Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry! 


20 

"
"Okay, so Sunny sold gingerbread and apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 10 gingerbread. He sold 4 less apple pies than gingerbread, so that's 10 - 4 = 6 apple pies.

Gingerbread earned him 10 times $6, which is $60. Apple pies earned him 6 times $15, which is $90.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more gingerbread than Saturday, so that's 10 + 5 = 15 gingerbread. He sold 15 apple pies on Sunday.

That's 15 times $6 for gingerbread, which is $90. And 15 times $15 for apple pies, which is $225.

On Saturday, he made $60 + $90 = $150. On Sunday, he made $90 + $225 = $315.

So for both days, he made $150 + $315 = $465! 



"
"Okay, so Pamela uses one squirt of sunscreen every hour, and she's outside for four hours each day. That's one squirt times four, which is four squirts a day!

She's on vacation for eight days, so that's four squirts a day times eight days, which is thirty-two squirts.

Each bottle has eight squirts, so she needs thirty-two squirts divided by eight squirts per bottle... that's four bottles! 


4 

"
"The blue car costs $100. The red car is cheaper, 40 less.  So the red car costs $60.  If you add them together, $100 plus $60 is $160.


$160 

"
"Okay, so Emil is 19 now.  When he's 24, his dad will be twice as old, so his dad will be 24 times 2 which is 48.  And his brother will be half Emil's age then, so he'll be 24 divided by 2 which is 12.

But we want to know how old they are *now*.  Emil's dad is 48 now, but Emil is only 19, so his dad is 48 minus 5 which is 43.  And Emil's brother is 12 now, but Emil is 19, so his brother is 12 minus 5 which is 7.

If we add their ages together, 43 plus 7 is 50. 


50
"
"Okay, so Adrianne got 20 beads from her mom. Her sister gave her 10 more than that, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her double what her mom gave her, so that's 20 x 2 = 40 beads.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads!


90 

"
"Okay, so Joe got 3 pounds on Thursday. Then on Friday, he got 4 times that, so that's 3 times 4 which is 12 pounds!  On Saturday, he got half of what he got on Friday, so that's 12 divided by 2 which is 6 pounds.  

Altogether, he has 3 plus 12 plus 6 which is 21 pounds of crawfish.  If each serving is 3 pounds, he has 21 divided by 3 which is 7 servings.


7 

"
"Okay, so there are 30 kids in the class.  20 of them are football players, so that leaves 10 kids.  Then 25% of those kids are cheerleaders or in band, so that's 2 and a half kids.  You can't have half a kid, so I guess 2 more kids are leaving.  That means 6 kids are leaving early for the game! 



"
"Okay, so Sophie wears a size 5. Charlie's boots are five times bigger, so he wears a size 25!  To find the average, we add their sizes together: 5 + 25 = 30. Then we divide by 2 because there are two people: 30 / 2 = 15.

So the average shoe size is 15! 



"
"Okay, so Pat has a really long flower bed!  It's 111 feet long.  Each flower needs a little space, like 12 inches wide, and Pat wants to put 1.5 feet between each one.  She already has 17 flowers, but they cost $6 each at the store.  

Let's see... we gotta figure out how many more flowers Pat needs.  Then we can see how much money she'll spend.  Hmm... this is tricky! 


Let me think...  

Pat will spend $162 at the store. 

"
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, so he eats 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.  

In a week, he eats 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels.


63 

"
"Okay, so Katherine has 5 baskets.  In each one she puts 3 petunias that cost $3 each, so that's 3 times 3 which is $9. Then she adds 2 sweet potato vines that cost $2.50 each, so that's 2 times $2.50 which is $5.  So each basket costs $9 plus $5, which is $14.  

Since she has 5 baskets, she spends $14 times 5, which is $70.


$70.00 

"
"Let's see... they used 12 pounds for the sunflowers and 15 pounds for the carnations. That's 12 plus 15, which is 27 pounds!  They started with 30 pounds, so they have 3 pounds left for roses. Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Jessica gets $2000 every month. She saves a quarter of that for shoes, which is like cutting her money into four pieces and taking one.  That means she saves $500 each month for shoes!

If she saves $500 every month, in a whole year she saves $500 times 12, which is $6000!

Each pair of shoes costs $1000, so she can buy $6000 divided by $1000, which is 6 pairs of shoes. 


6 

"
"Okay, so Emily peels shrimp super fast! She can do 6 shrimp every minute.  That means for 90 shrimp, it'll take her 15 minutes (90 divided by 6).

Then she cooks them, and that takes 10 minutes for 30 shrimp. So for 90 shrimp, it'll take her 30 minutes (3 times longer!).

So, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes.  That's 45 minutes in total!


45 

"
"Okay, so the air conditioner made the room cooler. First, it was on low for a while, and that made it 6 degrees cooler. Then it was on high, and that made it even cooler, by 12 degrees! So that's 6 plus 12, which is 18 degrees cooler.

But then they turned it off, and the room got a little warmer again. It got 4 degrees warmer.

So, it was 18 degrees cooler, but then 4 degrees warmer, so that means it was 14 degrees cooler than when they started. 


14
"
"Hmm, let's see...

Comet Halley comes back every 75 years. Bill's dad saw it when he was 30. Bill saw it when he was three times older than his dad was then.  That means Bill was 3 times 30, which is 90 years old.

Since the comet comes every 75 years, and Bill was 90 when he saw it, that means he must have seen it before when he was 90 - 75 = 15 years old!


15 

"
"Let's see... Buford pays electric and gas every month, so that's 1 check each month for each one. That's 1 + 1 = 2 checks every month.

He gives to the church twice a month, so that's 2 more checks.

And he pays for the yard stuff four times a year, so that's like one check every three months.

Hmm... 2 checks a month times 12 months is 24 checks. Plus 24 for the church is 48 checks. Plus 4 more for the yard is... 52 checks!


52 

"
"Okay, so the first plane goes to Greece a lot, like three out of every four times!  That means it goes to other places the rest of the time. The other plane only goes to Poland, and it goes way less, only 44 times a day.  That's half the times the first plane goes, so the first plane goes 44 times 2, which is 88 times!

If it goes to Greece 66 times, then it goes to France and Germany the other 22 times.  Since it goes to France and Germany the same amount, it goes to France 22 divided by 2 times, which is 11 times!


11 

"
"Okay, so Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice that, so that's 20 times 2 which is 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote together, so that's 20 plus 40 which is 60 seconds.  

To find the total time, we add up all their howling times: 20 plus 40 plus 60 equals 120 seconds.  

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 120 seconds is the same as 2 minutes! 


2 

"
"Adam got $6 from his mom and $12 from his dad, that's $6 + $12 = $18.

The trousers cost $30, so he needed $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.


$12 

"
"Okay, let's see...

We know Helene is the oldest because she's twice as old as the average age of all of them.  And all the kids together are 20 years old.

Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4, so that's 3 + 4 = 7 years.

If all four kids together are 20, then 20 - 7 = 13 years for Helene and Wilfred together.

Since Helene is twice the average age, and the average age is 20 / 4 = 5, then Helene is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

That means Wilfred is 13 - 10 = 3 years old.


3 

"
"Walter got $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from online, so that's $500 + $1500 = $2000. His lawyer will give three times that much, so that's $2000 x 3 = $6000!  

6000 

"
"Okay, so there were lots of cookies! 100 people brought 15 cookies each, so that's a whole bunch!  The bride gave half of them to the church.  If each person at the church got 15 cookies, we gotta figure out how many people were there.  Hmm... 750 cookies went to the church, and they gave 15 to each person. So, there were 50 people at the church! 


50 

"
"Okay, so there are two grown-ups and four kids.  The grown-ups get bigger pieces, like twice as big as the kids' pieces.  Hmm... that means if we think of the watermelon cut into, like, eight pieces, each grown-up gets two pieces and each kid gets one.

So, each grown-up gets 2 out of 8 pieces. That's like a quarter, right?  A quarter is 25%!


25 

"
"Okay, so the doctor works for nine hours.  He spends three hours checking on sick people in the hospital and five hours seeing other patients.  That's eight hours total.  If he works nine hours, he has one hour left! 


1 

"
"Okay, so Jordan needs 20 minutes to mix the cake, then 30 minutes to bake it.  Then it has to cool for 2 whole hours, that's like 120 minutes! And then 10 more minutes to put the frosting on.  

Let's see... 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.  That's 3 hours!

So if she wants the cake ready by 5 o'clock, she needs to start at 2 o'clock. 


2:00 pm 

"
"They sold 8 boxes together and that's 64 chocolate bars.  So each box has 8 chocolate bars! 

8 

"
"Okay, so they charge $25 just to use the room, and then $1.50 for each kid.  They have 10 kids, so that's $1.50 times 10, which is $15.  So each class costs $25 + $15, which is $40.

They have class 3 times a week, so that's $40 times 3, which is $120 a week.

In a month, there are 4 weeks, so they make $120 times 4, which is $480.


$480 

"
"Okay, so Peter has 4 boxes of chocolate and Martha has 7 boxes. Peter has 64 chocolates in total and Martha has 56.  

Let's see... if Peter has 64 chocolates and 4 boxes, that means each box has 64 divided by 4, which is 16 chocolates!

Martha has 56 chocolates and 7 boxes, so each of her boxes has 56 divided by 7, which is 8 chocolates.

That means Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolates in each box than Martha!


8 

"
"Okay, so there are 50 porcupines, and 3 out of every 5 are girls. That means there are 30 girl porcupines. Each girl porcupine has 4 babies every month, so that's 30 times 4, which is 120 babies every month!  

In a whole year, that's 120 babies times 12 months, which is 1440 babies!  

So, we add all the babies to the porcupines we started with: 1440 plus 50 is 1490 porcupines!


1490 

"
"Okay, so the pool is like a big box, right?  We gotta figure out how much water fits in the box.

It's 14 feet wide and 25 feet long, so that's 14 times 25, which is 350. Then it's 4 feet deep, so we do 350 times 4, which is 1400. That's how much water fits!

They said to multiply that by 5.9 to know how many gallons, so 1400 times 5.9 is 8260 gallons.

Each gallon costs 10 cents, so we do 8260 times 0.10, which is 826 dollars.


$826.00 

"
"Okay, so they have 9 red sticks.  Then they have 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so that's 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.  And they have 3 less yellow sticks than blue sticks, so that's 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

To find the total, we add them all up: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks! 



"
"Okay, so Matteo drove for 4 hours really fast, like zoom zoom! He went 55 miles every hour.  That's 55 times 4, which is 220 miles.

Shandy drove slower, 45 miles every hour, but for a long time, 10 hours! So she went 45 times 10, which is 450 miles.

To see how much farther Shandy went, we do 450 minus 220. That's 230!


230 

"
"Okay, so there are 3000 kids at the school. Half of them are older than 16, so that's 1500 kids.  A quarter of the older kids are boys, so that's 375 boys. That means 1125 of the older kids are girls.

The other half of the kids are younger than 16, so that's another 1500 kids. Half of them are boys, so that's 750 boys. That means 750 of the younger kids are girls.

If we add all the girls together, there are 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls at the school.

"Bethany runs 10 laps. Trey runs 14 laps 'cause he runs 4 more than Bethany. Shaelyn runs 7 laps 'cause she runs half as many as Trey. Quinn runs 5 laps 'cause she runs 2 less than Shaelyn.  

Bethany runs 5 more laps than Quinn!

"Okay, so Wanda and Ms. B are trying to fill a big tank that holds 18,000 gallons of water.

On the first day, Wanda fills a quarter of the tank, which is like cutting the tank into four equal parts and taking one. That's 18,000 divided by 4, which is 4,500 gallons.

Ms. B pumps in three-quarters of what Wanda did, so she pumps in 3 times 4,500, which is 13,500 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumps in two-thirds of what she did on the first day, so that's two-thirds of 4,500 gallons, which is 3,000 gallons.

Ms. B only pumps in one-third of what she did on the first day, so that's one-third of 13,500 gallons, which is 4,500 gallons.

Let's add up all the water they pumped: 4,500 + 13,500 + 3,000 + 4,500 = 25,500 gallons.

But wait! The tank only holds 18,000 gallons. That means they pumped in too much water!

To find out how much water is left to fill the tank, we subtract the water they pumped from the tank's capacity: 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons.



So the answer is 6000.
"
"Okay, so Maria's power bank was losing power while she was charging her friends' phones. It lost a lot of power, like 9% every hour for a while, then it lost a little less, 7% every hour.  In the end, it only had 28% left.

That means before it lost any power, it must have had more than 28%, right?  Hmm, let me think... It lost a bunch of power, then some more, and then ended up with 28%.  

I think the answer is 17.65%! 



"
"Okay, so Janet makes $10 each hour working and gets another $15 from tips. That's $25 every hour! If she works for 40 hours a week, she makes $25 times 40, which is $1000 every week!

She wants to save $2000 for a car, and that's like saving $1000 twice.  So she needs to work for 2 weeks.

"
"Okay, let's see... Jamaar has $10. He bought some peaches, pears, kiwis, and apples.  

Peaches and pears are 50 cents each, so 3 peaches cost $1.50 and 4 pears cost $2.00.

Kiwis are $1 each, so 2 kiwis cost $2.00. Apples are 75 cents each, so 5 apples cost $3.75.

If we add all that up, he spent $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

That means he has $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Plums cost 25 cents each, so he can buy $0.75 / $0.25 = 3 plums! 



"
"Anne had lots of sweets! She had 15 packs with 60 sweets in each pack. That's a lot of candy! She kept 2 packs for herself, so she had 13 packs to share with her friends.  She has 10 friends, so she gave each friend the same amount of sweets from the 13 packs.  

If you count all the sweets in the 13 packs, it's 780 sweets!  

So each of her friends got 78 sweets. 


78 

"
"Okay, so the carrots start at $120.  Then they go up by 5 dollars every year.  So after one year they cost $125. Then another 5 dollars the next year, so they cost $130. And then 5 more dollars the last year, so they cost $135! 



"
"Olivia put 9 pictures in each album because 72 pictures split into 8 albums is 9.  She has 27 selfies because she has 3 selfie albums with 9 pictures each. She has 18 portraits because she has 2 portrait albums with 9 pictures each. That means she has 27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45 selfies and portraits!


45 

"
"Hmm, let's see... James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes.  He reads 18 pages, so that's like reading 3 pages six times!  

If 3 pages takes 10 minutes, then 6 times that is 60 minutes!


60 

"
"Okay, so there were 100 people at the hotel. Then 24 people left early.  That means there were 76 people left. Then 15 people stayed late, and twice that many, which is 30 people, came in later.  So now there are 106 people. Then 7 more came after dinner, so there are 113 people at the hotel now! 

113 

"
"John picked 4 bananas on Wednesday and 6 on Thursday. That's 4 + 6 = 10 bananas.

On Friday, he picked three times the amount from Wednesday, so that's 4 x 3 = 12 bananas.

Now he has 10 + 12 = 22 bananas!


22 

"
"Okay, so there are 60 questions. 40% are easy, so that's like 24 questions.  The rest are hard and medium, so that's 36 questions split in half, which is 18 each.

Aries is good at easy questions, so she'll get 75% of those right, which is 18 questions.

For the medium and hard ones, she gets half right, so that's 9 right for each, for a total of 18.

So, she gets 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right! 


36
"
"Okay, so Teresa sells the big fluffy animals for three times more than the little ones.  She sold twice as many little ones as big ones and made $120.  Each little one costs $4.  Hmm... let me see...

If she sold twice as many little ones, maybe she sold 6 big ones and 12 little ones?  

Let's see if that works... 6 big ones times $12 each is $72.  And 12 little ones times $4 each is $48.  $72 plus $48 is $120!  

So she sold 12 little stuffed animals.


12 

"
"Okay, so the man eats 5 sandwiches every day. His wife eats 4, and their son eats 2.  That's 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches every day!

If they eat 11 sandwiches a day, in a whole week they eat 11 times 7, which is 77 sandwiches.


77 

"
"Suzanne sold lots of cookies and cupcakes! She made 80 dollars from cookies and 240 dollars from cupcakes. That's 320 dollars in total!  She gave 10 dollars to each of her sisters, so she gave away 20 dollars.  If you take 20 dollars from 320 dollars, she has 300 dollars left.


$300 

"
"The twins found 30 eggs each, so they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs together.  

If 10 eggs were left over, then their friends found 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs.

"
"Okay, so one dwarf digs up 12 pounds of ore each day with just his hands. If he uses an iron pickaxe, he can dig up twice as much, so that's 12 times 2 which is 24 pounds!

A steel pickaxe is even better! It lets him dig up 50% more than the iron pickaxe.  That means he digs up an extra 24 divided by 2, which is 12 pounds. So with the steel pickaxe, he digs up 24 plus 12, which is 36 pounds a day!

If one dwarf digs up 36 pounds a day, in a month with 30 days, he digs up 36 times 30 which is 1080 pounds!

Now, if we have 40 dwarves all digging with steel pickaxes, they dig up 1080 times 40 which is 43200 pounds! 



"
"If two sandwiches cost $3, and four sandwiches cost $6, then each sandwich costs $1.50.  So eight sandwiches would cost 8 times $1.50, which is $12.00!


$12.00 

"
"Okay, so Tom buys a new bedroom for $3000.  He sells his old one for $1000 and uses that money.  That means he still has to pay $2000.  He pays 10% each month.  

10% of $2000 is $200.


$200 

"
"Okay, so Sally had lots of balloons!  

She had 25 red ones, 7 green ones, and 12 yellow ones.  Uh oh, some red ones popped!  That's 40% of them, which is like 10 balloons.  

Then she let go of half her yellow balloons, so that's 6 less.

Then she found some blue balloons in a tree! She took 75% of them, which is 6 blue balloons.

So, she had 15 red balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. That's 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 balloons!


27 

"
"Hmm, let's see. There's a chance the teacher won't even be there tomorrow, so maybe he doesn't have to do it!  Even if she is there, she might give everyone more time. And if not, maybe Marcus can say his dog ate it!  So, I think there's a pretty good chance he won't have to turn it in. 


30% 

"
"Okay, so they got a big place for graduation with lots of seats!  They gotta take out the seats for the kids graduating and the teachers first. Then, they see how many seats are left for everyone else.  

If they split those seats up evenly for each graduate, each one gets 5 tickets to give to their family and friends! 



"
"Grandpa eats a lot of jelly beans!  He can eat 75 big ones.  He can eat twice as many medium ones, so that's 75 times 2 which is 150 medium ones.  And 3 little ones are the same as 1 medium one, so he can eat 150 times 3 which is 450 little ones!


450 

"
"Okay, so Melissa works for 6 hours each day for 3 days. That's 6 times 3, which is 18 hours!

She gets $15 each day, so for 3 days she makes 15 times 3, which is $45.

But she has to pay $3 for parking each day, so that's 3 times 3, which is $9.

So she makes $45 but spends $9, which means she has $45 - $9 = $36 left.

Now we gotta see how much she makes each hour.  She worked 18 hours and has $36, so it's $36 split into 18 parts. That's $2 each hour!


$2 

"
"Okay, so Ted had $200.  He bought 3 books and each book cost $16. That's 3 times 16, which is $48.  He also got 3 pencils that cost $6 each. So that's 3 times 6, which is $18.  

To find out how much he spent in total, we add the cost of the books and pencils: $48 + $18 = $66.



"
"Okay, so Richard has a driveway that's 24 feet wide. He puts a soda every 3 feet.  That means he can fit 8 sodas across (24 divided by 3 is 8).

He takes 5 seconds to walk to each soda and drop the candy in. Since there are 7 spaces between the 8 sodas, it'll take him 35 seconds to do them all (7 times 5 is 35).


35 

"
"Uncle Franky has two boxes with forty apples in each box. That's a lot of apples!  He puts eight apples in each pack.  Let's see... two boxes have eighty apples in total. Eighty divided by eight is ten. So he can make ten packs of apples! 


10 

"
"Okay, so Amor buys some yummy cheese! Parmesan is $11 a pound, and she gets 2 pounds. That's 2 times 11, which is 22 dollars. Mozzarella is $6 a pound, and she gets 3 pounds. So that's 3 times 6, which is 18 dollars.  

All together, the cheese costs 22 plus 18, which is 40 dollars. If she started with 50 dollars, she has 50 minus 40 dollars left. That's 10 dollars! 


$10
"
"Okay, so Jim borrowed a lot of money for school, like two hundred thousand dollars!  He also didn't make any money for four years 'cause he was studying.  That's another hundred thousand dollars he missed out on.  So, he needs to make three hundred thousand dollars to catch up.

His new job pays seventy-five thousand dollars a year.  If he saves all of it, it will take him four years to make enough money. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Jim's bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. He needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider, so that means it needs to be 10 feet long and 12 feet wide.

To find out how much fabric he needs, we gotta multiply the length and the width: 10 feet times 12 feet equals 120 square feet.


120 

"
"Okay, so they delivered 425 letters on Monday. Then on Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's letters.  Hmm, one-fifth of 425 is 85, and then we add 17... that's 102 letters on Tuesday!

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice the amount from Tuesday. Twice the amount of Tuesday's letters is 204, and then add 5 more... that's 209 letters on Wednesday!

To find the total, we add up all the letters: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters! 


736
"
"Okay, so Molly has 16 friends coming to the party.  Ten want chicken salad, and that costs $6.50 each.  So that's 10 times 6.50... hmm... let me count that out... that's $65.00!

Six friends want pasta salad, and that's $6.00 each. So that's 6 times 6... which is $36.00.

Now we add the chicken salad price and the pasta salad price together: $65.00 plus $36.00 is $101.00.


$101.00 

"
"Okay, so Johnny's dad lost five dollars at first. Then he won eleven dollars, yay! But then he lost sixteen dollars and fifty cents.  

That's a lot of losing!  To find out how much he lost on average, we gotta add up all the losing and then split it into three parts, 'cause there were three races.

Five dollars plus sixteen dollars and fifty cents is twenty-one dollars and fifty cents.  

Twenty-one dollars and fifty cents split into three parts is seven dollars and seventeen cents each time.


$7.17 

"
"Hmm, let's see... 26 countries, and each one has 5 cities with 1000 people. So that's 5 times 1000, which is 5000 people in each country.  And then we have 26 countries, so it's 5000 times 26...  

That's a lot of people! It's 130,000 people! 



"
"Xavier is now 51 inches tall because he grew 3 inches. Cole is now 52 inches tall because he grew 2 inches.  

52 - 51 = 1

"
"Okay, so they had $1920 to share. The second person got more than the first, and the third person got the most!  

Let's see... if the first person got, say, $420, then the second person got $420 + $80 = $500. And the third person got double the second person, so that's $500 x 2 = $1000.

If you add those up, $420 + $500 + $1000 = $1920! That's all the money!

So the first person got $420. 


$420
"
"Okay, so they worked for part of a day every day for three whole weeks.  That's a lot of painting!

Let's see... three weeks is like 3 times 7 days, so that's 21 days.

And each day they worked for 3 out of 8 parts of a day.  Hmm, that's like 3 slices of a pie cut into 8 pieces.

If a whole day is 24 hours, then 3 slices would be... 9 hours!

So each painter worked 9 hours every day for 21 days.  That's 9 times 21... which is 189 hours!

 189 

"
"Okay, so Rory picked up some tennis balls.  

In the second set, he got some balls. Let's say he got 6 balls.

In the first set, he got 4 more balls than the second set, so that's 6 + 4 = 10 balls!

 
**Answer:** 10 

"
"Okay, so the car starts at $20000.  Then it loses 21% each year.  

* In 2008, it loses 21% of $20000, which is a lot! That means it's worth less.
* Then in 2009, it loses 21% of the *new* price, so it gets even cheaper.
* And then again in 2010!

Hmm, that's a lot of figuring.  I think it would be about $9860.62 in 2010. 



"
"Hmm, let's see... half of 50 is 25, so there are 25 English books.  And 10% of 50 is 5, so there are 5 German books. That means there are 25 + 5 = 30 books that aren't in Spanish.  

So there must be 50 - 30 = 20 Spanish books! 


20
"
"Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days. That's 325 times 4, which is 1300 kilometers!

She needs to drive 1955 kilometers in total, so she still has to drive 1955 minus 1300 kilometers.  

That's 655 kilometers!


655 

"
"Okay, so Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. And there are 16 cups in a gallon, right?  

So, if she drinks 8 cups a day, that's like half a gallon!  

If she drinks half a gallon every day for 30 days, that's like drinking 15 gallons in a whole month!


15 

"
"Okay, so there were 120 people on the train. Then 20 more got on, so that's 120 + 20 = 140 people.

Then some people got off, 50 of them. But then twice that many got on, so that's 50 x 2 = 100 people.

So now there are 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people on the train!

But wait, more people got off at the last stop, 80 of them.

So, 190 - 80 = 110 people are left on the train.


110 

"
"Okay, let's see... Alison bought a shirt for $10. Her shorts cost $5 more than that, so they were $15. Her shoes were $48, but they were half off, so they were $24. And her socks were $8, but she had a coupon for $2 off, so they were $6.  

If we add all that up: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55


$55
"
"Okay, so you got a kitchen floor that's 200 squares big, right? And each tile is like a little square, one foot by one foot.  That means you need 200 of those tiles to cover the whole floor.

Each tile costs $12, so you gotta multiply that by 200.  

12 times 200 is... hmm... let me count on my fingers...  

That's $2400! 



"
"Okay, so James' insurance is more expensive now because he had an accident. It's 60% more than the normal price, which is $120 every month.  

That means it's $120 plus 60% of $120.  Hmm, 60% is like 60 out of every 100, so that's (60/100) times $120.  

Let me do that on my fingers... 60 times 120 is 7200, and then divide by 100... that's $72 extra!

So his insurance is $120 + $72 = $192 every month.

Now, there are 12 months in a year, so he pays $192 times 12, which is $2304 for the whole year.


$2304 

"
"Okay, so Greg washes sheets for four little beds and one big bed every week. His washing machine can only wash two little bed sheets at once and one big bed sheet at once.  

Let's see... he washes the little bed sheets twice a week 'cause he can only wash two at a time. And he washes the big bed sheet once a week. So that's two plus one, which is three loads every week!

There are lots of weeks in a year, fifty-two to be exact! So he does three loads a week times fifty-two weeks, which is... one hundred and fifty-six loads! 


156 

"
"Okay, so they watch 4 movies on Saturday. Then on Sunday, they watch half of that, which is 2 movies.  So that's 4 plus 2, which is 6 movies every weekend!

If they watch movies for 4 weeks, that's 6 movies a week times 4 weeks, which is 24 movies! 


24 

"
"Leo had 100 stickers. Then he got 50 more. That's 100 + 50 = 150 stickers!

This year he got double the stickers from last year, so he got 50 * 2 = 100 stickers.

Now he has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers!


250 

"
"Let's see... Imma has 3 kitties and each kitty eats 60 grams of food twice a day. So that's 60 times 2 which is 120 grams per kitty each day.  Then we multiply that by 3 kitties, so that's 120 times 3 which is 360 grams a day for all the kitties.  

If she has 720 grams of food, it will last 720 divided by 360 which is 2 days. 


2 

"
"Okay, so they had 4 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices, that's 4 times 8 which is 32 slices in total! Becky ate 10 slices, and Jake ate 3 less than Becky, so he ate 7 slices. Silvia ate double what Jake ate, so she ate 7 times 2 which is 14 slices.  

To find the total, we add up all the slices they ate: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices!


31 

"
"Betsy took longer to cook than Donovan.  They cooked for 98 minutes total. If Betsy took 18 more minutes than Donovan, then Betsy cooked for 58 minutes. 


58
"
"Okay, let's see...

The cast costs $200.

The doctor charges $300 every hour, and she saw the doctor for half an hour, so that's $300 / 2 = $150.

The pills cost $4 each, and she got 30, so that's $4 x 30 = $120.

Parking costs $6 every hour, and she had to park for 2 hours, so that's $6 x 2 = $12.

Now, let's add it all up: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482


482 

"
"Okay, so James gets lots of emails!  He gets 80 every day. But some of them he doesn't have to answer.  Twenty out of every hundred don't need an answer. That's like 1 out of every 5.  So, he doesn't answer 16 emails each day.  That means he answers 64 emails every day.  If he works 5 days a week, he answers 64 times 5, which is 320 emails!


320 

"
"Okay, let's count them up!

Monday had 32 classes. Tuesday had double that, so that's 32 times 2, which is 64 classes. Wednesday had three times Monday's amount, so that's 32 times 3, which is 96 classes. Thursday had 30 classes, and Friday had 25.

To find the total, we add them all up: 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247 classes! 


247
"
"Okay, so John got 100 three times, that's like 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.  Then he got an 80.  So all together that's 300 + 80 = 380.

Now we gotta split that 380 by the number of tests, which is 4.  380 split by 4 is 95!


95 

"
"Okay, so the glee club had 20 pizzas and ate a lot of them!  They ate 70%, which is like most of them.  That means they have a few left.

The football team got twice as many pizzas, so they had 40! They ate even more than the glee club, 80% of them.

Let's see... if we take away the pizzas they ate from both teams, we can find out how many are left.  Hmm... that's 14 pizzas left over! 



"
"Okay, so Anthony wants to send lots of coupons! He sends 700 little ones, and then twice as many big ones, so that's 700 times 2 which is 1400 big coupons.

The little ones cost 5 cents each to mail, so that's 700 times 5 cents, which is 35 dollars.  The big ones cost 15 cents each, so that's 1400 times 15 cents... hmm... let me see... that's 210 dollars.

Now we add the cost of the little ones and the big ones together: 35 dollars plus 210 dollars is 245 dollars.


$245.00 

"
"Okay, so Sidney had some meatball sandwiches. He started with seven, but then Mark ate some.  Sidney had three left. Then Sidney got three more sandwiches.  That means he had six sandwiches in the end. Each sandwich has four meatballs, so he had 6 times 4 meatballs, which is 24 meatballs! 


24 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, and each truck had 20 tons of fertilizer.  But 5 trucks broke down, so only 15 trucks made it to the farmers.  

If each truck has 20 tons, and 15 trucks made it, then they delivered 15 times 20 tons, which is 300 tons!


300 

"
"Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter 'cause he uses 1 pound for every group of 12 croissants and he's makin' 6 groups.

The butter is $4.00 a pound, but there's a deal! Buy one, get one half off. So, he buys 3 pounds at full price, which is 3 times $4.00, that's $12.00.

Then he gets 3 pounds half off, so that's $4.00 times 0.50, which is $2.00 per pound.  And 3 times $2.00 is $6.00.

So, all together it costs him $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00 


$18.00
"
"Okay, let's see... Kayla invited a lot of people!  

She invited 25 friends from school, 7 girls from dance, and 13 family members. That's 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people!

But 4 people can't come, so 45 - 4 = 41 people will be at the party.

The movie theater costs $125 if 20 people come, and then it's $6 more for each extra person. Kayla has 41 - 20 = 21 extra people.

So that's 21 x $6 = $126 extra.

In total, the party will cost $125 + $126 = $251! 



"
"Maggie spent some of her money, and Riza did too. They both started with $60. Maggie spent a quarter, which is like cutting her money into four equal parts and taking one. That's $15! Riza spent one-third, which is like cutting her money into three equal parts and taking one. That's $20.  

So Maggie has $45 left, and Riza has $40 left. If we add that together, they have $85 left in total!


85 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Robles has three monkeys.  One monkey eats 10 bananas a day. Another eats 4 more than that, so that's 14 bananas!  

That means the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas every day.

Mr. Robles has enough bananas for a whole week, which is 7 days. So he has 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas each day for all the monkeys.

If the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas!

"Teddy did half of the first puzzle, so that's 500 divided by 2, which is 250 pieces. Then he did a whole other puzzle, so that's another 500 pieces.

"Okay, so Jenny buys 15 roses.  That's a whole bunch!  A dozen roses is 12, so she buys one of those for $15. Then she needs 3 more roses, and each of those costs $2, so that's $6 more.  

That means all the roses cost $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny has five $5 bills, so she has $25.  

If the roses cost $21, she gets $25 - $21 = $4 back.

Now, quarters are worth 25 cents, so she gets $4 / $0.25 = 16 quarters back!

"
"Okay, let's see...

He sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, so that's 6 times 5.50... hmm... that's $33.00!

Then he sells 9 burger platters for $11 each.  9 times 11 is... 99 dollars!

And lastly, he sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each.  20 times 1.50... that's $30.00.

Now we add it all up: $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00


$162.00 

"
"Okay, so the first train comes in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. Then the next train comes 30 minutes after the first one leaves. That one only stays for 5 minutes.  The third train comes an hour after the second one leaves, and it leaves right away. The train Paul needs comes 20 minutes after the third one leaves.  

Let's see... 10 minutes for the first train, plus 20 minutes it stays... that's 30 minutes. Then 30 more minutes until the next train. That's 60 minutes. Then 5 minutes for that train. That's 65 minutes. Then another hour, which is 60 minutes. That's 125 minutes. Then 20 more minutes.

So Paul waits for 145 minutes.

"
"Melanie already has 120 toothpicks. She needs 200, so she needs 80 more.

If she gets 10 each week, that's 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks per week = 8 weeks.

"
"Okay, so the watch cost $2000 at first. Mr. Rogers got it for less, 75% of the price. That's like getting 3 quarters of the money back!  

Then he sold it to his friend for more, 120% of what he paid. That's like getting a little extra, like 1 whole and 1/5 more!

To figure out how much less the friend paid than the first price, we gotta do some subtracting.  

The friend paid $1800, and the watch started at $2000.  

$2000 - $1800 = $200

That means the friend saved $200!

Now, to see what percentage that is of the first price, we gotta divide the savings by the first price and multiply by 100.

($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%



The friend got a 10% discount! 

"
"Hmm, let's see... if one spring makes one jellyfish every second, then in a whole minute it makes 60! And in an hour, that's 60 minutes times 60 jellyfish, so that's 3600 jellyfish!

If we have 5 springs, they'd make 5 times as many, so that's 3600 times 5, which is 18000 jellyfish in an hour!

But we want to know how many they make in 4 hours, so we multiply that by 4... 18000 times 4 is 72000 jellyfish! 


72000 

"
"Okay, so Binkie got 90 points. Frankie did way better! He got twice Binkie's score plus 15 more points.  That means Frankie got 90 times 2 which is 180, then add 15 more... so Frankie got 195 points! 


195 

"
"Okay, so James walks to the store, but he has to go back home first.  That means he walks to the store, then back home, then to the store again.

He walks 4 miles to the store, but only goes halfway, so that's 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.

He walks 2 miles to the store, then 2 miles back home, then 2 miles to the store again. That's 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 miles in total.

He walks 4 miles every hour, so it takes him 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours to get to the store.


1.5 

"
"Okay, so Jenny buys lots of bananas! Ten bunches, that's a lot! Each bunch has four bananas, so that's ten times four, which is forty bananas.

If she bought them one by one, it would cost eighty cents each, so forty times eighty cents is thirty-two dollars.

But she buys them in bunches for three dollars each, so ten bunches cost thirty dollars.

That means she saved two dollars! 



"
"Okay, so Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence. Harry gets more fence than Sam, 60 feet more!  To figure out how much Sam gets, we gotta think about it like sharing.  

If we take away Harry's extra fence, they have the same amount. That's like splitting the fence in half, right?  

So, 100 feet minus 60 feet is 40 feet.  That means they each get 20 feet if they split it evenly.

Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 



"
"Hmm, let's see... the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years.  That means it grows 2 inches every year!  So in 13 years, it would grow 2 inches times 13 years... that's 26 inches!

"
"Okay, so Marcel sells three kinds of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking.

* MTB bikes cost $500 each.
* BMX bikes cost half as much as MTB bikes, so they cost $250.
* Trekking bikes cost $450 each.

Marcel sold 300 bikes in total. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so that's 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

He also sold 15% BMX bikes. That's 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

The rest were MTB bikes: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now let's see how much money he made:

* Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
* BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
* MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

To find the total, we add all that up: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250


Marcel made $131,250 from selling bikes that month! 

"
"The farmer makes 5 bales every hour, so in 6 hours he makes 5 times 6 which is 30 bales. The truck takes away 3 bales every hour, so in 6 hours it takes 3 times 6 which is 18 bales.  That means there are 30 minus 18 bales left, which is 12 bales.


12 

"
"Okay, so John has lots of classes! He has 6 normal ones and 2 extra, so that's 8 classes a day. Each class is 40 minutes, so that's 8 times 40... hmm... let me count that up... that's 320 minutes of class each day!

He goes to class 5 days a week, so that's 320 times 5...  carry the one... that's 1600 minutes of class a week!

On the weekend, he studies some more. He studies for the same amount on Saturday and Sunday, and it's 1/16 of his weekly class time. So that's 1600 divided by 16... which is 100 minutes each day.

So that's 100 minutes on Saturday plus 100 minutes on Sunday, which is 200 minutes total.

Now, let's add up all his learning time: 1600 minutes of class plus 200 minutes on the weekend is 1800 minutes!

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1800 minutes is... 30 hours! Wow, that's a lot of learning!

"
"Okay, so the ball starts way up high, 3 floors up! That's like 3 times 24 feet, so 72 feet!  

Then it bounces, and each bounce it goes a little lower. It goes 2 out of 3 of the height it was before. So after the first bounce, it goes 72 feet times 2 out of 3, which is 48 feet.

Then it bounces again!  This time it goes 2 out of 3 of 48 feet, which is 32 feet!


32 

"
"Okay, let's see...

The first kid is 6 feet tall, which is like 72 inches. The second kid is 2 inches taller, so they're 74 inches. The third kid is 5 inches shorter than the second, so they're 69 inches.  The last kid is 3 inches taller than the third, so they're 72 inches tall!


72 

"
"Hmm, let's see... they sold 2000 apples and each bag has 10 apples. So that's 200 bags!  And they sell each bag for $5.  

200 bags times $5 is... $1000! 


$1000
"
"Okay, so the T-Rex ate half, then the velociraptors ate half of what was left. That means the Allosaurus ate the last bit, which was 270 kilograms.  

So, before the Allosaurus, there was 270 times 2, which is 540 kilograms.

And before the T-Rex ate, there was 540 times 2, which is 1080 kilograms!


1080 

"
"Okay, so Tony needs to paint four walls. Two walls are big, like ten steps long and eight steps tall. The other two walls are smaller, five steps long and eight steps tall.

Each can of paint can cover a little bit of wall, like twenty steps worth. And each can costs twelve dollars.

Hmm... let's see.  We gotta figure out how much wall there is in total. Then we can see how many cans Tony needs.

The big walls are ten times eight, which is eighty steps each. So both of them together are eighty times two, which is one hundred sixty steps!

The smaller walls are five times eight, which is forty steps each. So both of them together are forty times two, which is eighty steps.

Now we add the big walls and the small walls: one hundred sixty plus eighty is two hundred forty steps!

Now we gotta see how many cans Tony needs. Two hundred forty steps divided by twenty steps per can is twelve cans.

Finally, twelve cans times twelve dollars each is... one hundred forty-four dollars!


$144 

"
"Okay, so Ellen had 3 fizzy sodas that were shaken up.  Her brother took one of the shaken ones, so there are 2 left.  There are 8 sodas in total now.  So, if her friend picks a soda, there's a 2 out of 8 chance it's a shaken one.  That's like 1 out of 4, which is 25%!


25 

"
"Okay, so one train goes super fast at 60 miles every hour! The other train is slower, going only 30 miles each hour.  If they both go for 3 hours, the fast train goes 180 miles (60 x 3) and the slow train goes 90 miles (30 x 3).  

If you add those together, they are 270 miles apart!


270 

"
"Okay, so Billy helps 2 people every hour, and he works for 3 hours each day. That means he helps 2 times 3, which is 6 people every day!

There are 31 days in March and 19 in April, so that's 31 plus 19, which is 50 days.  But he takes a break for 10 days, so he only works for 50 minus 10, which is 40 days.

If he helps 6 people every day for 40 days, he helps 6 times 40, which is 240 people!


240 

"
"Hmm, let's see... 12 buses with 35 people in each... that's a lot of people!  12 times 35 is...  420!  And then there's 20 cars with 3 people each... so that's 20 times 3... which is 60.  

So, 420 plus 60 is... 480 people! 



"
"Okay, so Mike is 24. Martha is 4 years younger than him, so she's 20. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so he's 30! 


30
"
"Hmm, let's see... the big slide is 300 feet long and you go 60 feet every minute. So it takes 5 minutes to go down!  The smaller slide is 240 feet and you go 80 feet every minute, so that takes 3 minutes.

That means the big slide takes 2 minutes longer! 



"
"Okay, so Bobby takes a lunch break for half an hour every day. That's 30 minutes. He also takes two 15 minute breaks, so that's another 30 minutes.  

That means he takes 30 + 30 = 60 minutes of breaks every day.

Over five days, that's 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes of breaks.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 300 minutes is the same as 300 / 60 = 5 hours!


5 

"
"Okay, so Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran a lot more, like 3 times more than Amber, so that's 8 times 3, which is 24 more miles!  That means Micah ran 8 + 24 = 32 miles.

Amber and Micah ran 8 + 32 = 40 miles together.  

That means Ahito ran 52 - 40 = 12 miles. 


12 

"
"Okay, so Sheila started with $85.00 on her card. Then she returned something for $15.00, so now she has $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

She bought a frying pan that was on sale! It was $20.00 but 20% off, so that's $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00 off.  The pan cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

The towels were $30.00 but 10% off, so that's $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00 off. The towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

So, the frying pan and towels together cost $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

Adding that to what she had before, her new balance is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.


$113.00
"
"Okay, so some jellyfish are big and some are small. The big ones can change color, and 6 of them turned blue under the light.  If a third of the big jellyfish change color, that means there were 6 x 3 = 18 big jellyfish.

If 18 big jellyfish are one-fifth of all the jellyfish, then there must be 18 x 5 = 90 jellyfish in total!


90 

"
"Okay, so Chris is 4. Ben is twice as old as Chris, so Ben is 4 times 2 which is 8.  Caroline is three times older than Ben, so she is 8 times 3 which is 24!


24 

"
"Okay, so Lauren wants to save up for when she's old and doesn't work anymore. She wants to save for 20 years of not working.  She makes $100,000 now, and she wants to spend $40,000 each year when she's old.

She saves 20% of her money now, which is $20,000 every year.

To have enough money for 20 years, she needs $40,000 x 20 = $800,000.

So, she needs to save for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years! 

40 



"
"Okay, so Marty has a big ribbon, 100 centimeters long! He cuts it into four pieces, so each piece is 25 centimeters long. Then he cuts each of those pieces into five even smaller pieces.  That means each tiny piece is 5 centimeters long!

"
"If 40% of the school is 240 boys, that means there are 600 kids in the whole school!  

If there are 240 boys, then there must be 360 girls.

"
"Okay, so Mommy bought pots for $19 and dirt for $26. That's $19 plus $26, which is $45. But she had a coupon for $7 off, so we take $7 away from $45.  That means she spent $38.


$38 

"
"Hmm, let's see...  

Three ladies have tall shoes, four inches high! And three ladies have smaller shoes, two inches high.  

If we add all the heights together, it's like having six shoes that are four inches tall, which is 24 inches. Then we add six shoes that are two inches tall, which is 12 inches. That's 36 inches in total!

Now we have six ladies, so we share those 36 inches between them.  36 divided by 6 is... 6!

Wait, that doesn't sound right.  Let me try again...  

Oh! It's 3 inches!

"
"Soledad wants to hike a lot in June! She wants to hike 9300 miles, but if she hikes 125 miles twice a day, that's only 250 miles a day.  In a whole month, that's 250 miles a day times 30 days, which is 7500 miles.  

That means she needs to hike 1800 more miles!  To do that in 30 days, she needs to hike 60 more miles each day.


60 

"
"Let's see...

* They have 3 red balls and each costs $9, so that's 3 times 9... which is 27 dollars!
* They have 11 blue balls and each costs $5, so that's 11 times 5... which is 55 dollars!
* They have lots of green balls, 25 of them, and each costs $3. So that's 25 times 3... which is 75 dollars!

Now we add all that up: 27 plus 55 plus 75... that makes 157 dollars!


157 

"
"Let's see... they have 12 big apples. Peter wants a quarter, that's like cutting the apples into four parts and taking one. So Peter gets 3 apples. Paul wants a third, so that's like cutting the apples into three parts and taking one. Paul gets 4 apples.  

That's 3 plus 4, which is 7 apples gone.  

So James gets the rest, which is 12 minus 7, which is 5 apples! 


5 

"
"Okay, so it was 2 degrees, then it got colder by 8 degrees. That's like going down a slide!  So now it's 2 minus 8, which is -6.  But then it got a little warmer by 3 degrees. So we add 3 to -6.  That's -3! 


-3
"
"Okay, so Raymond starts with $21. Then he gets $11 more, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.  

But then he spends $5 on a comic, so he has $32 - $5 = $27 left.

And then he spends $19 on a puzzle, so he has $27 - $19 = $8 left.


$8 

"
"Anna had $12 left after buying some stuff. She bought two books and has $2 left now.  That means the books cost $12 - $2 = $10 all together.

If she bought two books for $10, then each book cost $10 / 2 = $5.


$5 

"
"Hmm, so there were 50 kids in the class last year. This year, 20 more kids joined!  That means there are 70 kids in the class now! 

70 

"
"Hmm, let's see... the light blinks a lot in 5 minutes! If it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, that means it blinks 51 times every minute.  

To find out how long it takes to blink 459 times, we can think about it like this: if it blinks 51 times every minute, we need to see how many minutes it takes to blink 459 times.

459 divided by 51 is 9. So it takes 9 minutes! 


9 

"
"Okay, let's count the fishies!

Tate starts with 4 boy guppies and 3 boy goldfish, that's 4 + 3 = 7 boy fish.

He also has 7 girl guppies and 5 girl goldfish, so that's 7 + 5 = 12 girl fish.

Then he gets 2 more boy guppies and 2 more boy goldfish, so now he has 7 + 2 + 2 = 11 boy fish.

He also gets 1 more girl guppy and 3 more girl goldfish, so now he has 12 + 1 + 3 = 16 girl fish.

Let's see, he has 16 girl fish and 11 boy fish.  That means he has 16 - 11 = 5 more girl fish than boy fish.


5 

"
"Amalia mowed the lawn for 4 hours. Megan walked the dog and that took her 4 hours plus 2 more hours, so that's 6 hours. Dior did laundry and that took her 4 hours more than Amalia, so that's 8 hours.  

If we add up all the time, it's 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours.


18 

"
"Okay, so John drives for 2 hours each way to see his parents.  He goes 70 miles every hour, so that's 2 times 70 miles, which is 140 miles each way.

Since he goes there and back, that's 140 miles times 2, which is 280 miles for one trip.

He sees his parents twice a month, so he drives 280 miles times 2, which is 560 miles!


560 

"
"Sofie walks a lot! She walks 10 miles every day for a whole week, that's like walking around my whole town!  Brian walks half as much as Sofie, so he walks 35 miles in a week.

"
"Okay, so they need to make 400 toys, right?  And five people are working on it. Two people make 6 toys every hour, so in 10 hours they make 120 toys (6 times 10 is 60, and 60 times 2 is 120).  Two other people make 4 toys an hour, so they make 80 toys in 10 hours (4 times 10 is 40, and 40 times 2 is 80).

That's 200 toys already (120 plus 80).  They need 400, but they still need 20 more at the end, so they made 380 toys (400 minus 20 is 380).

That means the last person made 180 toys (380 minus 200 is 180) because 180 plus 200 is 380.

And if they worked for 10 hours, that means they made 18 toys every hour (180 divided by 10 is 18).


18 

"
"Okay, so Kory's dog is 60 pounds. Elijah has one dog that's like a quarter of that, so that's 60 divided by 4, which is 15 pounds. His other dog is half the size of Kory's, so that's 60 divided by 2, which is 30 pounds.  

So Elijah's dogs weigh 15 plus 30, which is 45 pounds.  

Then we add Kory's dog's weight, so 45 plus 60 is 105 pounds!


105 

"
"Okay, so Kris got 7 stickers from someone and had 9 more, so that's 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.

That means Luis gave Kris 16 stickers, but that was only half of what Luis had! So Luis had 16 x 2 = 32 stickers.

Luis got those stickers from Seth, and that was only half of what Seth had. So Seth had 32 x 2 = 64 stickers at the start!


64 

"
"Let's see... he has 3 big bags with 10 ounces each, so that's 3 times 10, which is 30 ounces!  

Each ounce has 30 M&Ms, so he has 30 times 30, which is 900 M&Ms!

If he puts 10 in each small bag, he can make 900 divided by 10, which is 90 small bags!


90 

"
"Hmm, let's see... the Earth is really big, like, super big!  If Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, and half of the Earth is 20,000 kilometers, it would take him 50 days to fly that far. 


50 

"
"Okay, so the fastest car is super speedy!  

The second fastest car is like five times faster than a normal car, which goes 120 miles per hour. So the second fastest car goes 5 times that, which is 600 miles per hour!

And the fastest car is even faster! It's like one and a quarter times faster than the second fastest car. So, it goes 1.25 times 600 miles per hour, which is 750 miles per hour!

Wow!

"
"Liam is 16 now, so two years ago he was 14.  That means Vince was 7 two years ago.  So now Vince is 9!

"
"Okay, so Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together.  Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Sarah must have painted 9 eggs (30 - 12 = 18, and 18 / 2 = 9). That means Camden painted 21 eggs (9 + 12 = 21).

Arnold and Madeline painted the rest of the eggs, which is 26 eggs (56 - 30 = 26). They each painted the same amount, so Arnold painted 13 eggs (26 / 2 = 13).

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold (21 - 13 = 8).


8 

"
"Okay, so Nik has lots of crayons! He wants to put them in boxes. Each box holds 8 crayons, and he has 200 crayons.  

Let's see... 200 crayons divided by 8 crayons per box is 25 boxes.

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so 200 crayons weigh 200 ounces.

The boxes also weigh something! Each box weighs 8 ounces, and he has 25 boxes, so that's 200 ounces for the boxes too.

All together, that's 200 ounces of crayons plus 200 ounces of boxes, which is 400 ounces.

But the question wants to know the weight in pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so 400 ounces divided by 16 is 25 pounds.

"
"Okay, so the tree is 80 feet tall, but he can only use 80% of it, which is like 80 out of 100.  That's 64 feet!

He makes logs that are 4 feet long, so he can make 64 divided by 4, which is 16 logs.

Each log gives him 5 planks, so he has 16 times 5, which is 80 planks.

He sells each plank for $1.20, so he makes 80 times $1.20, which is $96! 


$96
"
"Okay, so Valerie makes $5000 a month. Her brother makes double that, so he makes $5000 x 2 = $10000.  

Together they make $5000 + $10000 = $15000.

Their mom makes double what they make together, so she makes $15000 x 2 = $30000.

To find out how much they all have, we add it all up: $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000


45000 

"
"Grandma walks slow on the beach, it takes her 40 minutes to walk 2 miles.  She walks faster on the sidewalk, twice as fast!  So the sidewalk only takes her 10 minutes.  That means her whole walk takes 40 minutes plus 10 minutes, which is 50 minutes.

"
"Jane has $32 saved up already. She needs $60, so she needs $28 more.  If she saves $4 each week, it will take her 7 more weeks to get to $60. 


7 

"
"Okay, let's count the birdies!

Three trees have 7 birdies each, so that's 3 times 7, which is 21 birdies.

Then two trees have 4 birdies each, so that's 2 times 4, which is 8 birdies.

And one last tree has 3 birdies.

If we add them all up: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 birdies!


32 

"
"Hmm, let's see...

If Bob gets 2 dozen more marbles, that's like getting 2 groups of 12, so that's 2 times 12 which is 24 more marbles!

If he has 60 marbles after getting those extra ones, he must have had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles before.

But then he loses 10, so he'll have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles left.


26 

"
"Okay, so Donny needs his water to be at least 40 degrees to drink it. One mug is too cold, only 33 degrees.  He mixes some of that cold water with some from another mug, and now it's warm enough!  

The other mug must have been pretty hot to make the mix warm enough.  It has to be at least 68 degrees! 



"
"Okay, so he starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Then he gets 20 more cows every day for three weeks. That's like 20 cows a day times 7 days, which is 140 cows every week.  And three weeks is 140 times 3, so that's 420 more cows!

He also gets 10 chickens every day for three weeks. So that's 10 chickens a day times 7 days, which is 70 chickens every week. And three weeks is 70 times 3, so that's 210 more chickens!

So now he has 50 cows plus 420 cows, which is 470 cows. And he has 20 chickens plus 210 chickens, which is 230 chickens.

That means he has 470 cows plus 230 chickens, which is 700 animals in total! 


700 

"
"Okay, so Russell buys four packs of bagels, and each pack has nine bagels. That's a lot of bagels!  Each pack costs ten dollars, so four packs cost forty dollars. But wait, he gets a discount! Ten percent off means he saves four dollars. So, he pays thirty-six dollars for all the bagels.  

He has thirty-six bagels, and he paid thirty-six dollars, so each bagel costs one dollar!


$1.00 

"
"Okay, so Gomer ate some mashed potatoes. He ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so that's 18 scoops.  

To make the mashed potatoes, you need 3 potatoes for every 2 scoops.  So, for 18 scoops, you'd need... hmm... let's see... 18 divided by 2 is 9. And then 9 times 3 is 27!

So Gomer ate 27 potatoes! 


27
"
"Okay, so Chester eats 3 eggs every day for a whole month, that's 30 days! So that's 3 times 30, which is 90 eggs.

Then he eats 5 eggs a day for another month, so that's 5 times 30, which is 150 eggs.

In total, he eats 90 plus 150, which is 240 eggs.

Now, a dozen has 12 eggs, so we need to see how many times 12 goes into 240.  240 divided by 12 is 20.

So Chester needs 20 dozens of eggs! 


20 

"
"Okay, so there are 17 green jelly beans and twice that many red ones, which is 17 times 2, that's 34 red jelly beans.  That means there are 17 plus 34, which is 51 green and red jelly beans.  If there are 60 jelly beans in all, then there must be 60 minus 51, which is 9 blue jelly beans! 


9 

"
"Okay, so Tim has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons every year.  That means he gets 5 times 6 lemons, which is 30 lemons every year!

A decade is 10 years, so he gets 30 lemons a year times 10 years, which is 300 lemons! 


300 

"
"Okay, so there are 5 men for every 9 women on the bus. That means there are 5 + 9 = 14 parts in total.

If there are 84 people on the bus, that means each part has 84 / 14 = 6 people.

There were 9 parts of women, so there were 9 * 6 = 54 women on the bus at first.

Then 20 women got off, so there are 54 - 20 = 34 women left.


34 

"
"Okay, so Faraday sells sunflowers for $2 each and bouquets for $8. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.

He makes $26 from sunflowers and $56 from bouquets every day. That's a lot of flowers!

Let's see... he makes $26 from sunflowers each day, and $56 from bouquets, so that's $26 + $56 = $82 every day.

Over three days, that's $82 x 3 = $246!

Hmm, figuring out how many sunflowers that is is tricky.  I think we need to ask the teacher for help on this one! 



"
"Adam buys lots of rocks to sell. He spends all his $100 on rocks. Each rock costs $5.  He sells each rock for $7, but he doesn't sell all of them. He only sells 60% of the rocks.  

Let's see... he buys 100 divided by 5, which is 20 rocks. He sells 20 times 60%, which is 12 rocks. He makes 12 times $7, which is $84.

He started with $100 and made $84, so he lost $100 minus $84, which is $16.


$16 

"
"Okay, so Lauren draws a lot of pictures!  

Let's see... she needs 9 days for the big pictures, 6 days for the medium ones, and 7 days for the small ones.

If we add those up, it takes her 9 + 6 + 7 = 22 days to draw all the pictures. 


22 

"
"Chatty has 36 eggs 'cause three dozen is 3 times 12.  If she shares them equally with her 4 kids, each kid gets 9 eggs! 


9 

"
"Okay, so Jen has 3 fishies, and each one needs $1 for food every day.  That means she spends 3 dollars each day on fishy food.

May has 31 days, so she spends 3 dollars a day times 31 days... hmm... that's 93 dollars!


$93 

"
"Patricia started with 30 roses, then gave 24 to her mom. That leaves her with 6 roses.  Then she buys 15 more!  So now she has 6 + 15 = 21 roses.


21 

"
"Okay, so Sid went 110 miles then another 140 miles. That's a lot of miles!  

He drove for 2 hours then 3 more hours.  

To find his average speed, we gotta see how many miles he went each hour.  

Let's add up all the miles: 110 + 140 = 250 miles.

Then add up all the hours: 2 + 3 = 5 hours.

Now we divide the miles by the hours: 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

So Sid was going 50 miles per hour on average. 


50
"
"Okay, so Mark has one ticket with a chance of winning, like, one out of five.  The other ticket is way better, like three times better! So that one has a chance of winning three out of five times.

To win with both, you gotta win with the first one *and* the second one.  That's kinda tricky, so it's not gonna happen as often.  I think it's like, one out of every eight times, or maybe 12%? 


12% 

"
"Okay, so Jim found 27 seashells. Carlos found 5 less than Jim, so he found 22 seashells. Carrey found half as many as Carlos, so he found 11 seashells.  

Let's add them all up: 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

They split the seashells evenly, so each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.


20 

"
"Mason eats carrots every day! He eats 4 carrots from Monday to Friday, that's 4 times 5 days, which is 20 carrots! On Saturday and Sunday he eats 5 carrots each day, so that's 5 plus 5, which is 10 carrots.  

If we add all the carrots together, 20 plus 10 is 30 carrots! 


30 

"
"Okay, so the first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer, so that's like adding a little extra time to the first song.  

Hmm, 60% of 5 minutes is 3 minutes. So the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

That means the whole cassette is 5 + 8 = 13 minutes long!


13 

"
"Linus buys a phone for $20 and sells it for $40, so he makes $20 more!

He bought 2 phones on Monday, so he made $20/phone * 2 phones = $40.

He bought 4 phones on Tuesday, so he made $20/phone * 4 phones = $80.

In total, he made $40 + $80 = $120!


120 

"
"Okay, so Isabel is the tallest at 7 feet. Ned is shorter than Isabel by 2 feet, so Ned is 5 feet tall. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, making him 6 feet tall.  Carl's cane is half his size, so it's 3 feet long! 


3 

"
"Okay, so Hortex makes lots of carrot juice, right?  They make enough to give 20% of the energy a person needs each day to 4200 people.  But we want to know how much more they need to make to give 100% of the energy to 2300 people.

Hmm, that's tricky. Let's see... 2300 people need a lot more energy than 4200 people!  They'd need to make way more juice! I think they'd need to make a whole bunch more bottles.  

Let me count...  


7300 

"
"Okay, so Carla has eight babies, and six wear purple. Two babies wear blue.  Some babies wear bows! Two purple babies and two blue babies wear bows.  

So, if a baby has a bow, it's either purple or blue.  There are two purple babies with bows, and four babies in total with bows. That means there's a 50% chance a baby with a bow is wearing purple.


50 

"
"Hmm, let's see... they got lots of reports!  

They got 1907 on Monday and Tuesday, and then 2136 on Thursday and Friday. That's a lot of papers!  

If they got 5168 for the whole week, we gotta figure out how many were on Wednesday.  

Let me count on my fingers... 5168 take away 1907... and then take away 2136...  

That means they got 1125 reports on Wednesday! 



"
"Okay, so Abraham had 80 squares of land. He sold half, that's like cutting it in two, so he sold 40 squares for $50. Then he sold some more, a quarter of what was left. A quarter is like cutting something into four pieces, so he sold 10 more squares for $30.  That leaves him with 30 squares. He sold those for $3 each, so that's 30 times 3, which is $90.

If we add up all the money, $50 + $30 + $90, he made $170!


$170 

"
"Haley is 26, and Geb is 10 years younger than half of Haley's age.  So, half of Haley's age is 26 divided by 2, which is 13. Then, we take 10 away from that, so Geb is 3 years old. 


3 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Tyrion changes his mask two times each time he goes out. And he goes out three times a day. So that's two times three, which is six masks a day!  

If he uses six masks a day, then in two days, he uses six times two, which is twelve masks!


12 

"
"Cole hid a whole bunch of eggs, 3 dozen to be exact! That's like 3 times 12, which is 36 eggs! Lamar found 5, and Stacy found double that, so she found 10. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he got 8. And Mei found half as many as Charlie, which is 4.  

Let's see, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.  

That means there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hiding! 


9 

"
"Okay, so John goes to three apartment buildings. The first two have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last one is bigger, like, way bigger! It has 60 more apartments for every 100 apartments in the other two, so it has 400 times 0.60, which is 240 more apartments.

That means the last building has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Altogether, he goes to 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments!

He goes to each building three times a week, so that's 1440 times 3 = 4320 times he picks up garbage.

He gets 40 cents for each time he picks up garbage, so he makes 4320 times $0.40 = $1728.00 every week! 


$1728.00
"
"Okay, so the tree starts with 50 fruits. Then it gets bigger and makes way more!

* When it's 6, it has 50 times 3, which is 150 fruits!
* When it's 7, it has 50 times 7, so that's 350 fruits.
* When it's 8, it's almost as much as when it's 10, but 200 less.  
* When it's 10, it has 50 times 20, wow, that's 1000 fruits! So when it's 8, it has 1000 minus 200, which is 800 fruits.

Let's add all the fruits together: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = 2350 fruits! 



"
"Sophia gave Jack $20.  

Now Jack has $120! 

"
"Okay, so the red rope is super long, four times longer than the blue one! The blue rope is a little bit shorter than the yellow rope, by 7 centimeters.  All three ropes together are 37 centimeters long.  Hmm... let me see...

If we think about it, the yellow rope is the longest, then the red rope, and then the blue rope.  

Let's see... if the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, and all three ropes together are 37 centimeters, the red rope must be really long!

I think the red rope is 20 centimeters long! 



"
"Rissa had three times more money than Ronnie, so she had 3 * $5 = $15.

Rissa gave some money to her little sister, and now she has 4/5 of her money left. That means she gave away 1/5 of her money, which is $15 * (1/5) = $3.

Ronnie also gave $3 to his little sister.  So, Ronnie has $5 - $3 = $2 left.


$2 

"
"Okay, so the mural is half yellow, which means it used 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint.  That leaves 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints for the red, white, and purple.  Since they're all the same amount, each one used 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.


2 

"
"Okay, let's see... Tom has four bedrooms, and each one is 20 feet by 12 feet.  That means each bedroom is 20 times 12, which is 240 square feet.  

All the bedrooms together are 240 times 4, so that's 960 square feet.

The living room is five times bigger than one bedroom, so it's 240 times 5, which is 1200 square feet.

Now we add up the bedrooms and the living room: 960 plus 1200 is 2160 square feet.

But wait, there's more! The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. So we add that too: 2160 plus 1000 is 3160 square feet.

So the whole house is 3160 square feet big! 



"
"Okay, so Alice sees 3 clouds on Monday. Then on Tuesday, she sees double that, so that's 6 clouds! Wednesday is double Tuesday, so that's 12 clouds. Thursday is double Wednesday, so that's 24 clouds. And Friday is double Thursday, so that's 48 clouds!

Let's add them all up: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds! 


93 

"
"Okay, so the big box has 100 pods, and the new one has 20 more, so that's 100 plus 20, which is 120 pods!  The big box costs $12, and the new one does too, so that means you get 120 pods for $12.  If you use one pod each time you wash dishes, you can wash dishes 120 times with the whole box.  So if the box costs $12, you can wash dishes 120 / 12 = 10 times for $1!


10 

"
"Okay, so Thomas gets lots of twenty dollar bills, like fifty of them! But then he loses some on the way home, uh oh! That's ten less bills.  He uses some to pay a bill, half of what he has left. Then, wow, his money gets three times bigger!  He changes all his money into five dollar bills.  Let me count... hmm... he has two hundred and forty five dollar bills!


240 

"
"Team A scored 4 goals first. Team B scored 2 less than that, so they got 2 goals.  Then Team B scored lots more in the second half, 8 goals! Team A only got 2 more.  So Team A had 6 goals total and Team B had 10. That means they scored 16 goals all together! 


16
"
"Okay, so the teacher starts with a big piece of chalk, right? He uses a little bit each day, but on Monday he used a lot because his students needed extra help.  

He has a little more than 2 inches left. He uses a little bit each day, like a tiny bit, so he can use it for a couple more days before it gets too small.

I think he can use it for 2 more days. 


2 

"
"Okay, so there are 12 boys and 12 girls, that's 24 kids in total.  Some of them are on varsity, some aren't.  Let's see... one-third of the girls are on varsity, so that's 12 divided by 3, which is 4 girls. And one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so that's 12 divided by 4, which is 3 boys.  

So, 4 girls plus 3 boys means 7 kids are on varsity. That leaves 24 minus 7, which is 17 kids not on varsity.


17 

"
"Mike has 5 masks. Johnny has 3 times that amount plus 2 more. So, Johnny has 5 times 3 which is 15, plus 2 more, making it 17 masks! 


17
"
"Okay, so James has 30 teeth. The dentist fixes 4 teeth by drilling them. Then the dentist puts caps on 7 more teeth than he drilled, so that's 4 + 7 = 11 teeth with caps.  

That means the dentist fixed 4 + 11 = 15 teeth in total.

To find out what percentage that is, we can think of it like this: if 30 teeth is 100%, then how much is 15 teeth?

Hmm, 15 is half of 30, so that's 50%!


50 

"
"Mr. Marcellus got $5600 back. 



"
"Okay, so Wendy is way older than Colin right now.  In seven years, Colin will be older, but Wendy will still be older.  And in 25 years, Colin will be a third of Wendy's age now. Hmmm... that's tricky.

Let me see... if Colin is a third of Wendy's age in 25 years, that means Wendy is three times older than Colin will be then.  

I think Colin is 20 now.  That seems to make sense! 



"
"Okay, so Bob has $27000 and wants to buy books for 3 schools. That means each school gets $9000.

He can buy 100 books for $500, so that means each book costs $5.

If each school has $9000, and each book costs $5, then each school can buy 1800 books! 


1800 

"
"Okay, so there were two apples. Then one more fell on Newton's head! He picked them up and threw one back up, and then five more fell down!  He put most of them in his pocket, then threw one more up and six more fell! He got all the apples and went home.  

Let's see... two plus five is seven. Then he threw one, so six left. Then six more fell, so that's twelve plus one he was holding, so thirteen!

He brought home thirteen apples! 



"
"Hmm, let's see... Ali needs a lot of coal!  

He gets 850 big kilos of coal, and each bag has 50 kilos. So, that's 850 divided by 50... which is 17 bags!

Each bag costs $18, so 17 bags times $18...  that's $306!


$306 

"
"Okay, so Kate's friends eat a lot of pizza!  Let's see... 6 friends times 6 slices each is 36 slices of cheese pizza. And 6 friends times 4 slices each is 24 slices of pepperoni.  

That's a lot of pizza!  We need to see how many whole pizzas that is.  36 cheese slices means she needs 3 cheese pizzas. And 24 pepperoni slices means she needs 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. That's 6 pizzas in total!

"
"Sam ran a lot this week!  He ran 3 miles three times, so that's 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 miles. Then he ran 5 miles two times, so that's 5 + 5 = 10 miles.  

If we add those together, 9 + 10 = 19 miles!

19 

"
"Okay, so Jay makes 20 snowballs every hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. That's like, a lot of melting!  

Let's see... if he makes 20 snowballs an hour, but loses some, it'll take him longer than just one hour to get to 60. Hmmm... maybe 5 hours? 


**Answer:** 5 

"
"Hmm, let's see... John is 28 now, and Digimon is 20 years old. That means John was 8 when Digimon came out 'cause 28 take away 20 is 8.

John was twice as old as Jim then, so Jim was 4 'cause 8 divided by 2 is 4.

So, Jim is 24 now 'cause 4 plus 20 is 24!


24 

"
"Doxa ate one slice. Her sister ate two slices because she ate one more than Doxa. Her brother ate three slices because he ate one more than his sister.  

So, they ate 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices in total!

"
"Okay, so they used 38 bandages the first day and then 10 less the next day, so that's 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

Then they used half a pack on the third day, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

That's a total of 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages used up.

They got 50 bandages the first time and then 2 packs of 50, so that's 50 + (2 * 50) = 150 bandages.

If they had 78 left at the end, they must have started with 78 + 91 = 169 bandages.


169 

"
"Okay, so May's haircut cost $30 for every inch she cut off. She started with 10 inches and now has 8 inches, so she cut off 2 inches.  That means her haircut cost 2 times $30, which is $60.  

Then she also had to pay $40 for the color. So in total, it cost $60 + $40 = $100. 


100 

"
"Okay, so Jen works a lot! She works 7 and a half hours each day, and she does that for 6 days every week.  She gets paid $1.50 for every hour she works.  

She also gets an extra $10 if she comes to work every day in a month.  April has 4 weeks, so she gets paid for 4 weeks of work.

Let's see... 7 and a half hours times $1.50 is $11.25 each day.  Then she makes $11.25 times 6 days, which is $67.50 every week.

So for the whole month, she makes $67.50 times 4 weeks, which is $270.00.

And don't forget the extra $10 for coming to work every day! So she gets $270.00 plus $10.00, which is $280.00!


$280.00 

"
"Okay, let's see... Jason did a lot of chores!

He got $3 for laundry, $1.50 for his room, $0.75 each time he took out the trash, and $0.50 each time he emptied the dishwasher.

He emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so that's 6 times $0.50 which is $3.00.

He did laundry once, so that's $3.00.

He took out the trash twice, so that's 2 times $0.75 which is $1.50.

He cleaned his room once, so that's $1.50.

Now let's add it all up: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00


$9.00 

"
"Wow, that's a lot of blood!  

If a whale has 40 gallons of blood and a shark has three times that, then a shark has 40 x 3 = 120 gallons of blood.

If ten sharks are swimming, they have 120 x 10 = 1200 gallons of blood altogether! 


1200 

"
"Okay, so first there were 50 people. Then 40 more came. That's 50 plus 40, which is 90. Then double the 40 came, so that's 40 times 2, which is 80.  So now we have 90 plus 80, which is 170. Then 3 times the first group came, so that's 50 times 3, which is 150.  

Finally, we add all the people together: 170 plus 150 is 320!


320 

"
"Alain has 5 packs of red pens, and his mom bought twice as many black pens, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 packs of black pens.  

That means he has 5 + 10 = 15 packs of pens in total.

Each pack has 5 pens, so he has 15 x 5 = 75 pens!


75 

"
"Okay, so John buys lots of drinks! He gets 10 bottles of scotch for $600. That means each bottle costs $60.

He wants twice as much cognac, so that's 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac. Cognac is pricier though, it costs $60 plus half of that, which is $30 more. So each cognac bottle is $60 + $30 = $90!

That means the cognac costs 20 x $90 = $1800.

All together, he spends $600 + $1800 = $2400 on all the drinks. 


$2400
"
"Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice that many Lodgepole Pine trees, so he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. That's 20 + 40 = 60 trees on the first day!

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

That means he planted 30 + 50 = 80 trees on the second day.

In total, he planted 60 + 80 = 140 trees!

"
"Fred made lots of root beer! He started with 24 gallons, but his kids drank some, then his wife spilled some, and his friend drank some too.  By the time the party came, there were only 8 gallons left.  Since 4 people were at the party, they each got to drink 2 gallons.

"
"Okay, so there are some coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge. Four times that number plus eight more equals forty.  Hmm... let me think. If we take away the eight, that leaves us with thirty-two.  And thirty-two divided by four is eight!

So there are **8** coffee mugs. 

"
"Okay, so there are 66 fish.  One-third have red stripes, so that's 66 divided by 3, which is 22 fish.  That leaves 66 minus 22, which is 44 fish.  Then 5 out of every 11 of those fish have blue stripes.  So that's 44 divided by 11, which is 4, and then times 5, which is 20 fish.

So, 22 fish have red stripes and 20 have blue stripes. That's 22 plus 20, which is 42 fish! 


42 

"
"Amy had two eyeshadow things with four colors each, so that's 2 times 4 which is 8 colors. Then she had three makeup sets with six colors each, so that's 3 times 6 which is 18 colors.  That's 8 plus 18, which is 26 colors! But her sister took one of the eyeshadow things, so that's 26 minus 4, which is 22 colors. Then Amy used some of the makeup, half of the colors from one set, so that's 6 divided by 2 which is 3 colors.  So she has 22 minus 3, which is 19 colors left.

"
"Hmm, let's see... Mattison is 60 inches tall, and his house is 7 times taller than him, so that's 60 times 7, which is 420 inches!

The first floor is 3 times Mattison's height, so that's 60 times 3, which is 180 inches.

If Mattison and the first floor together are 180 inches, and the whole house is 420 inches, then the second floor is 420 minus 180, which is 240 inches tall.

But the question asks about the roof from the second floor, so we need to take away the height of the second floor's floor.  That means the roof is 240 minus 180 inches high, which is 60 inches! 



"
"Okay, so there were 700 shells, right?  The Alphas found a bunch, 40% of them. That's like, 280 shells! Then The Finders found 60% of the rest.  Hmmm, let's see... that's 252 shells.  So that means the Gogetters found the rest!  

That's 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 shells!


168 

"
"Okay, so Bernie has four doggies.  They all need to walk a bit each day.  One dog walks one mile, another walks four miles, and the third walks three miles.  If they all need to walk three miles on average, that means they need to walk twelve miles in total!  

Let's see... one plus four plus three is eight miles.  That means the last dog needs to walk four miles! 



"
"Okay, so John's house is worth a lot of money, $250,000! He borrows some money from the bank, which is 40% of his house value. That's like taking 40 out of every 100 dollars.  

So, he borrows $100,000. Then, he uses most of that money, 60% of it, to pay off his debts. That's like using 60 out of every 100 dollars.

He used $60,000 to pay off debts.  If he borrowed $100,000 and used $60,000, he has $40,000 left over.


$40,000 

"
"Let's see... Deandre caught three tunas. One was 56 big ones, another was 46, and the last one was 26.  That's a lot of tuna!

If each one of those big tuna fish is worth 50 cents, we gotta add up all the tuna first. 56 plus 46 plus 26 is 128!

Now, 128 times 50 cents... hmm... that's 64 dollars!


$64.00 

"
"Okay, so Trinity buys magazines for $72. Then she sells them for more money, 11/8 times more!  That means she sells them for $99.  

To find out how much money she made, we take the selling price and take away the buying price: $99 - $72 = $27

She made a profit of $27! 



"
"Okay, so Brian's dehumidifier takes out water from the air.

On low, it takes out 1 bottle of water each day. He used it for 3 days, so that's 1 x 3 = 3 bottles.

On medium, it takes out twice as much, so that's 1 x 2 = 2 bottles each day. He used it for 3 days, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 bottles.

On high, it takes out twice as much as medium, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 bottles each day. He used it for 5 days, so that's 4 x 5 = 20 bottles.

Let's add all the bottles together: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 bottles.


29 

"
"They had 10 packs of balloons and each pack had 30 balloons. So that's 10 times 30, which is 300 balloons! But they had 12 left over, so they threw 300 minus 12 balloons.  That means they threw 288 balloons! 



"
"Okay, so Saanvi needs 14 mL of one medicine. Then she needs three times that amount of the other medicine, so that's 14 times 3 which is 42 mL.  

That means each dose has 14 plus 42, which is 56 mL in total.

If she needs 8 doses, we do 56 times 8, and that's 448 mL!


448 

"
"Ali's class can fit 120 students. John has two classes, and each one is smaller than Ali's. Each of John's classes can fit 120 divided by 8, which is 15 students. So, John's two classes can fit 15 times 2, which is 30 students.  

If we add Ali's class and John's classes, that's 120 plus 30, which is 150 students.


150 

"
"Okay, so Stephen borrowed money from his sister. He has to give her a little extra, like a thank you.  He pays her a bit each month, and then at the end, he pays the rest.

Let's see... he borrowed $300, and the extra is 2%, which is like 2 out of every 100.  That's $6 extra.

So, he owes $306 in total. He pays $25 each month for 11 months, so that's $25 times 11, which is $275.

That means he still owes $306 - $275 = $31 in the last month.


$31 

"
"Okay, so Jordan has two little babies that need new diapers a lot! Each baby needs 5 new diapers every day. That's 5 diapers times 2 babies, which is 10 diapers in total.

But Jordan's wife helps out and changes half of them. So Jordan changes 5 diapers. 


5 

"
"Okay, so the jar is like a box, right? It's 6 inches wide and 6 inches long, and 15 inches tall.  That's a lot of jelly beans!

Each jelly bean is tiny, like a little cube. It takes up 0.15 of a cubic inch.  

They can't fit them in perfectly, though.  There's gonna be some space between them, so they only use about 80% of the space in the jar.

Tim thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red.  

There are actually 900 red jelly beans in there.  Let's see how far off Tim was...

Hmm, that's a tricky one. I'm not sure how to figure that out exactly.  Maybe someone else can help? 



"
"Okay, so the bus starts with 20 people. Then 40 more get on, so that's 20 + 40 = 60 people.

Then, 30 more people get on (because 3/4 of 40 is 30). Now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people.

At the next stop, everyone doubles! So now there are 90 x 2 = 180 people.

The bus can hold 200 people, so there's room for 200 - 180 = 20 more people.


20 

"
"Okay, so Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year, and each time it costs $2.  That means she spends 3 times 2 dollars, which is $6 every year.

She does that for 5 years, so that's 6 dollars times 5 years, which is $30.

Then the price goes up a lot, like 150%!  That means it's now 2 dollars plus 150% of 2 dollars, which is 2 plus 3 dollars, so it costs $5 to go now.

She keeps going for 3 more years, so that's 3 times 5 dollars times 3 years, which is $45.

To find out how much she spent in total, we add the first part and the second part: $30 plus $45 is $75.


75 

"
"Okay, so there are 10 kids from each grade that get to try the escape room, and there are 4 grades. That's 10 times 4, which is 40 kids!

But only 8 kids can go in at a time. So that's 40 kids split into groups of 8, which is 5 groups.

Each group gets 45 minutes. So 5 groups times 45 minutes is... hmm...  let's see... 225 minutes! 



"
"John made 4 tables and each table costs $20. So that's 4 times 20, which is 80 dollars. He also made 2 roof frames for $10 each, so that's 2 times 10, which is 20 dollars.  

To find out how much Ali has to pay, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames: 80 plus 20 is 100 dollars.


100 

"
"Okay, so Ian has a big board, 40 feet long! He wants to cut it into two pieces. The bigger piece has to be four times longer than the smaller one.  Hmm... that means if the small piece is, let's say, 8 feet, the big piece would be 8 times 4, which is 32 feet! 


32 

"
"Okay, so Aiden wants 80 meatballs. He gets 16 meatballs from every pound of meat.  That means he needs 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat.

He puts 2 tablespoons of seasoning in every pound of meat, so he needs 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.


10 

"
"Let's see... five windows times 35 inches each is 175 inches.  And he needs twice that much fabric, so that's 175 times 2... which is 350 inches! 


350 

"
"Okay, so the phone costs 25 cents for each minute at first.  If you talk for 16 minutes, that's 16 times 25 cents, which is 4 dollars.  Then it gets cheaper, only 20 cents a minute.  So the rest of the call, 20 minutes, costs 20 times 20 cents, which is 4 dollars too!  

So, all together it costs 4 dollars plus 4 dollars, which is 8 dollars. 


$8.00 

"
"Okay, so it rained 2 inches on Monday.  Tuesday will have twice that much rain, which is 2 times 2, or 4 inches. But it's gonna rain even more than that! It'll rain 1 more inch on top of the 4 inches, so that's 4 + 1 = 5 inches!


5 

"
"Okay, so Carly needs enough treats for everyone in her class to have two. That's 5 people times 2 treats each, so she needs 10 treats.

She makes some cupcakes, and then more brownies.  The brownies are tricky because she makes three times the cupcakes, but then takes away two.  

Hmm, let me see... if she made 3 cupcakes, she'd make 3 times 3 which is 9 brownies. But then she takes away 2, so that's 7 brownies. That's 3 cupcakes plus 7 brownies, which is 10 treats!

So Carly must have made 3 cupcakes. 


**Answer:** 3 

"
"Okay, so Karen wants a manicure and a pedicure. That's $35 plus $40, which is $75.  But wait, there's a discount! If she gets both, it's 20% off.  Hmm, 20% of $75 is $15. So now it's $75 minus $15, which is $60.

Oh, and she wants pretty nail art on all ten fingers! That's $3 per nail, so that's $3 times 10, which is $30.

Altogether, it's $60 plus $30, so Karen will pay $90.


$90 

"
"Let's see... she gets 3 magazines that each have 12 magazines a year. So that's 3 times 12, which is 36 magazines! Then she has one that gives her 6 magazines. And the last one gives her 4 times the 6 one, so that's 6 times 4, which is 24 magazines!  

If we add all those up, 36 plus 6 plus 24, we get 66 magazines! 



"
"Okay, so Samantha has 27 paintings. Shelley has 12 more than Samantha, so Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.  Kim has 8 less paintings than Shelley, so Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings. 

31 

"
"Okay, so the toy cost $40 at first. Then it got more expensive by 80%, which is like adding a lot more money!  That makes it $72. But then in January, it got cheaper by 50%, so we take half of $72 away. Half of $72 is $36. 


$36 

"
"Okay, so Charlie makes $80 for each lesson, but he gives veterans a discount.  The discount is 25% of $80, which is like a quarter of $80. A quarter of $80 is $20. So he charges veterans $80 - $20 = $60.

He has four regular lessons, so he makes 4 * $80 = $320 from those.

He has two lessons with veterans, so he makes 2 * $60 = $120 from those.

In total, he makes $320 + $120 = $440 today! 


$440
"
"Okay, so we gotta add up all her scores: 50 plus 80 plus 80 plus 60 plus 40 plus 90 plus 100 plus 70 plus 60.  That's 630!

Now we gotta split that number by how many quizzes she took, which is 9.  

630 split by 9 is 70! 

So her mean score is 70. 

"
"Eve started with 20 pomelos. She has 5 left. That means she gave away 15 pomelos! 


15
"
"Walter ate 24 apples, that's like, a lot of apples! Then he gave 9 to his sister.  That leaves him with 27 apples. He sold each apple for $3, so he got 27 times 3 dollars, which is $81.


81 

"
"Regina wrote a lot of books! If 9 books is three-quarters of all the books she wrote this year, then she must have written more!  

Let's see... if 9 is three parts, then one part is 9 divided by 3, which is 3.

If one part is 3, then four parts is 3 times 4, which is 12!


12 

"
"Okay, so Michael drives 50 clicks every hour, and he drives for three whole days. That's like driving for 24 hours times 3, which is 72 hours!

So he drives 50 clicks every hour for 72 hours, that's 50 times 72... hmm... that's 3600 clicks!

Now, the trip from Alaska to Texas is super long, 6000 clicks.  

Let's see... 3600 clicks is how much of 6000 clicks?  

It's like cutting a pizza into 6 slices, and he ate 3 slices. That's half the pizza! So he drove 60% of the way.


60 

"
"Okay, so Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 6 times 5 grapes, which is 30 grapes, to make juice. That's a lot of juice! Then their mom used 48 grapes for pies because each pie needs 12 grapes.  

So, they had 36 grapes plus 48 grapes at the beginning. That's 84 grapes! 


84 

"
"Hmm, let's see... 

There were 82 teachers, but 13 were sick.  So that leaves 69 teachers. Then they got 9 helpers, so 69 plus 9 is... 78!

78 

"
"Okay, so Bud buys pasta for a dollar. Then he gets cheddar cheese for three dollars.  He needs twice as much gruyere cheese, so that's three times two, which is six dollars!  

So, the pasta and cheese cost one plus three plus six, which is ten dollars every week.

There are fifty-two weeks in a year, so he spends ten times fifty-two dollars, which is five hundred and twenty dollars! 


520.00 

"
"Okay, so they gotta clean 80 rooms, and they got 5 days.  Each room takes 15 minutes.  That's a lot of cleaning!

Let's see... 80 times 15 is 1200 minutes of cleaning.

They work 8 hours a day, which is 480 minutes.  So over 5 days, that's 480 times 5, which is 2400 minutes.

Hmm, so 1200 minutes of cleaning out of 2400 minutes of work... that's half!

So the answer is 50%. 



"
"Okay, so Elly has lots of books!  

Each middle shelf holds 10 books, and she has two of those. That's 10 + 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf is super strong and holds twice as many as a middle shelf, so that's 10 x 2 = 20 books.

The top shelf holds 5 less than the bottom, so it holds 20 - 5 = 15 books.

All together, one bookcase holds 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Elly has 110 books, and 55 books fit in one bookcase, so she needs 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.


2 

"
"Rose buys lots of eggs, five groups of twelve! That's sixty eggs in total. She pays $2.40 for each group, so that's $2.40 times five, which is $12.00.

She wants to sell them in groups of three for $1.00 each.  So, she can make twenty groups of three eggs. Twenty groups times $1.00 each is $20.00.

If she sells them all, she'll make $20.00 and spent $12.00, so her profit is $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00!


$8.00 

"
"Okay, so Skyler has lots of hats! Half are red, so that's 100 divided by 2, which is 50 red hats.  That leaves 50 hats left.  

Then, 3 out of every 5 of those are blue.  Hmm, so that's 3 times 10, which is 30 blue hats!

That means there are 50 minus 30, which is 20 white hats.


20 

"
"Okay, so Archie gets a deal on the jerky! It's usually eighteen dollars, but it's three dollars cheaper.  That means it costs fifteen dollars.  He gets thirty sticks of jerky in the bag.  

Hmm, if we split fifteen dollars by thirty sticks, each stick costs fifty cents! 


50
"
"Okay, so Audrey needs to get 70% of the questions right on both tests.  That's a lot!

The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% right.  Hmm, let's see... 60% of 70 is 42.

The second test has 40 questions. To move on, she needs to get 77 questions right in total.  

So, she needs to get 35 questions right on the second test! 



"
"Mary makes some strawberry cubes. Then she makes blueberry cubes. She makes 5 times as many blueberry cubes as strawberry cubes, but takes away 4.  She makes 116 cubes in total.

Hmm... that's a lot of cubes! Let's see... if she makes 20 strawberry cubes, that means she makes 5 times 20, which is 100 blueberry cubes. But then she takes away 4, so she makes 96 blueberry cubes.


96 

"
"Ara played lots of games! She played 40 games each year for four years. That's 40 times 4, which is 160 games!

She scores 21 points in every game, so we need to do 160 times 21.  That's 3360 points!


3360 

"
"Brendan started with 10 marbles, but he dropped some. He only found 3 of them.  When he got home, he found a bead in the bag, not a marble, so he took it out.  That means he has 4 marbles left. 


4
"
"Okay, so Jason wants to sell 15 cars.  

For every 25 calls he makes, one person comes to the car place.  

And for every two people who come to the car place, one buys a car.

So, he needs 15 people to buy cars, which means he needs 30 people to come to the car place.

That means he needs to make 750 phone calls! 

750 

"
"Let's see... they have 4 flashlights, one for each person.  

They have 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each. So that's 4 rooms times 4 candles, which is 16 candles!

The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each. That's 4 rooms times 5 candles, which is 20 candles.

So they have 16 plus 20 candles, which is 36 candles.

That means they have 36 candles plus 4 flashlights, for a total of 40!


40 

"
"Let's see... Mitchell has two bags with 55 chips each, so that's 55 plus 55 which is 110 chips!  

He has 5 people in his family, so if they share equally, each person gets 110 divided by 5... hmm... that's 22 chips each! 


22 

"
"Okay, so John takes 5 minutes for the first side. Then he takes 10 minutes for the second side and 10 minutes for the third side.  The last two sides are quicker, only 2 and a half minutes each.

Let's add it all up: 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes! 



"
"Okay, so there are 20 helmets.  There are half as many robots as helmets, so that's 20 / 2 = 10 robots. There are twice as many footballs as helmets, so there are 20 x 2 = 40 footballs.

That means there are 10 robots + 20 helmets + 40 footballs = 70 things in total! 


70 

"
"Okay, so Tim works for 6 hours every day talking on the phone.  Each phone call takes him 15 minutes.  He works 5 days a week.  Hmm... let's see...

If he works for 6 hours a day, that's like 6 times 60 minutes, which is 360 minutes!

And each call takes 15 minutes, so he does 360 divided by 15, which is 24 calls each day.

Now, he works 5 days a week, so he does 24 calls a day times 5 days, which is 120 calls!


120 

"
"Hmm, let's see...

The old varnish takes 7 minutes for one painting, so for six paintings, it takes 7 times 6, which is 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes for one painting, so for six paintings, it takes 12 times 6, which is 72 minutes.

That means the new varnish takes 30 minutes longer! 


30 

"
"Okay, let's see... Crista has a lot of plants! 

Some need half a cup of water, some need a whole cup, and some need just a little bit.  

Let's add it all up:

* Half cup plants: 4 plants * 0.5 cups = 2 cups
* Whole cup plants: 8 plants * 1 cup = 8 cups
* Little bit plants: 8 plants * 0.25 cups = 2 cups

Now, let's add all the cups together: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups


12 

"
"Okay, so Phineas has to go 200 yards.  Half of that is on land, which is 100 yards.  He hops that fast, 20 yards every minute, so that takes him 5 minutes.

The other half is in the water, also 100 yards. He swims slower, 10 yards every minute, so that takes him 10 minutes.

If you add the hopping time and swimming time, it takes him 15 minutes to get home. 


15 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks, and each box has 8. So he needs 56 divided by 8, which is 7 boxes.  Each box costs $2.00, so 7 boxes would cost 7 times $2.00, which is $14.00.


$14.00 

"
"Okay, so the main phone costs $20.  The other phones cost half that, so they each cost $10.  There are four other phones, so they cost $10 x 4 = $40 all together.  

That means the whole plan costs $20 + $40 = $60!


$60 

"
"Okay, so Derrick makes 10 dozens of doughnuts every day. That's a lot of doughnuts!  And each one costs $2.  

Let's see... 10 dozens is 10 times 12, which is 120 doughnuts.  

So he makes 120 times $2 every day, which is $240.

June has 30 days, so he makes $240 every day for 30 days. That's $240 times 30, which is $7200!


$7200 

"
"Hmm, let's see... Jade takes 210 pictures and puts 7 in each group. She makes 6 groups every day. So, she puts 7 times 6 pictures up each day, which is 42 pictures!  

To find out how many days it takes, we need to see how many times 42 goes into 210.  

That's 5 days! 



"
"Okay, so Alicia takes 5 shirts, 2 pants, and 1 skirt to the cleaners every week.

The shirts cost $5 each, so that's 5 times $5, which is $25.

The pants cost $8 each, and she has 2, so that's 2 times $8, which is $16.

The skirt costs $6.

So, every week she spends $25 + $16 + $6 = $47 on cleaning.

If she does that for 5 weeks, it's $47 times 5, which is $235. 


$235.00
"
"Okay, so John talks super fast now! He can say 375 words every minute!  If he has to say 4500 words, that's like saying all those words ten times in a row!  

Let's see... 4500 words split into groups of 375 is 12 groups. So it takes him 12 minutes!


12 

"
"Okay, so Conor saw 50 people on the first day. Then 20 more came the next day, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 people.

The third day was busy! Twice as many people as the second day came, so that's 70 x 2 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week, Conor saw 60 people each day, and there were 4 more days, so that's 60 x 4 = 240 people.

To find the total, we add up all the people Conor saw: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 people! 


500 

"
"Okay, so Garrett's popcorn is poppin'! First, 20 kernels pop. Then, three times that many pop, so that's 20 times 3, which is 60!  Then, it pops even faster, four times the first amount, so that's 20 times 4, which is 80!  But then it slows down to half of the last amount, so that's 80 divided by 2, which is 40.  And then a few more pop after he takes it off the heat, which is 40 divided by 4, so that's 10 more.

Let's add them all up: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210!

Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat! 



"
"Okay, so Tim needs lemons for lemonade. He needs 1 cup of lemon juice for every gallon of lemonade.  And 6 lemons make 1 cup of juice. He's making 4 gallons for the party, so that's 4 cups of juice! That means he needs 4 times 6 lemons, which is 24 lemons.

But wait, his friend wants an extra gallon that's extra sour! That's like making two cups of juice from lemons. So that's 2 times 6 lemons, which is 12 more lemons.

Let's add them up: 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons!

Tim needs 36 lemons. 



"
"Okay, so there are three big German Shepherd dogs, and they each eat 5 big bags of food every day. That's 3 times 5, which is 15 bags!

Then there are two Bulldog puppies, and they each eat 3 bags of food a day. So that's 2 times 3, which is 6 bags.

All together, they eat 15 plus 6, which is 21 bags every day.

In a whole week, that's 21 times 7, which is 147 bags! 

147 

"
"Okay, so we got 10 animals with two legs each. That's 10 times 2, which is 20 legs!

Then we got 15 animals with four legs each. That's 15 times 4, which is 60 legs!

Now we add them together: 20 plus 60 is 80!


80 

"
"There are 4 blue blocks and twice that many yellow blocks, so that's 4 x 2 = 8 yellow blocks.  That means there are 4 + 8 = 12 blue and yellow blocks altogether.

If there are 32 blocks in total, then there must be 32 - 12 = 20 red blocks!


20 

"
"Elvis drove west for a long time, then turned around and drove east for even longer!  He was going 18 miles every hour.  

If he drove west for 5 hours and east for 8 hours, let's see... 

* West: 5 hours times 18 miles per hour is 90 miles.
* East: 8 hours times 18 miles per hour is 144 miles.

He drove further east than west, so we need to see how much further. 144 miles minus 90 miles is 54 miles.

So Elvis is 54 miles from his house.

"Okay, so the boat started at $9000.  The first year it lost 30%, which is like 30 out of every 100.  That's $2700 less! So it's worth $6300.

Then it lost another 30% the next year, so that's another big chunk of money gone.  That's $1890 less, so now it's worth $4410.

The last year it only lost 20%, which is a little better. That's $882 less, so the boat is now worth $3528. 


$3528
"
"Okay, so there are lots of Starbursts!  

There are 54 red ones, and twice that many orange ones, so that's 54 times 2 which is 108 orange ones.  There are half as many yellow as red, so that's 54 divided by 2 which is 27 yellow ones.

That's 54 plus 108 plus 27, which is 189 candies.

If there are 232 candies total, then there must be 232 minus 189 which is 43 pink ones!

"
"Okay, so Helen stayed in the hotel for three nights, and each night cost $80. That's 80 + 80 + 80 = $240 for the hotel.

Each bus ride cost 10% of the hotel price, which is $80 times 0.10, that's $8. She took the bus 7 times, so that's 8 times 7 = $56 for the bus.

In total, she spent $240 + $56 = $296.


296 

"
"Mazie had 52 marbles. Dallas has 21 now, but he lost 4, so he had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles from Mazie. That means Darla got 52 - 25 = 27 marbles!


27 

"
"Okay, so there are two grown-ups, and they each need a ticket that costs $12. That's $12 + $12 = $24.

The little kid needs a ticket too, and it costs $8.

They also got two popcorns, and each one costs $3, so that's $3 + $3 = $6.

Let's add it all up: $24 + $8 + $6 = $38


$38
"
"Okay, so John's car is super heavy, like a big elephant! It weighs 1200 pounds, and then there's stuff inside too. His bags are 250 pounds, and his two little kids are 75 pounds each.  

To move the car, he needs to push with 1% of all that weight.  

Let's add it all up: 1200 + 250 + 75 + 75 = 1600 pounds.

Now, 1% of 1600 is like finding 1 out of every 100. That's 16 pounds!

"
"Hmm, James wants to put streamers all the way around his fence.  His fence is like a big rectangle.  One side is 20 feet long, and the other side is 15 feet long.  

To get all the way around, we gotta add up all the sides!  So 20 + 15 + 20 + 15 = 70 feet!

James needs 70 feet of crepe paper. 



"
"Okay, so Mia is 40, and Emma is older by 16 years. That means Emma is 40 + 16 = 56 years old.

To find the average, we add their ages together: 40 + 56 = 96.

Then we divide that by 2 because there are two of them: 96 / 2 = 48.


48 

"
"They found lots of seashells!  Let's see... 214 plus 432 plus 86 is 732 seashells. But some were cracked, 67 of them.  So, 732 take away 67 is... 665 good seashells! 



"
"Okay, so Avery needs plates for 12 people. Each person needs a big plate, a small plate, and a bowl. The big plates cost $6, the small plates cost $4, and the bowls cost $5.  

Let's see... that's $6 + $5 + $4 = $15 for each person's plates.

Since she has 12 people, it's $15 x 12 = $180.00 


$180.00 

"
"Steve took a long time to finish his puzzle!  

Half of Steve's time is 10 hours divided by 2, which is 5 hours. Anna took 2 more hours than that, so she took 5 + 2 = 7 hours.


7 

"
"Okay, so Dexter has five piggy friends! Each piggy eats 4 pounds of food in the morning and 4 pounds at night. That's 8 pounds a day for each piggy!  

Since he has five piggies, that's 8 times 5, which is 40 pounds of food every day.

In a whole week, that's 40 pounds a day times 7 days, so 280 pounds.

Dexter started with 300 pounds, and the piggies ate 280 pounds, so he has 20 pounds left! 


20 

"
"Okay, so John has 20 friends coming to his party and they each want 2 hot dogs. That's 20 times 2, which is 40 hot dogs!  But he already has 4 hot dogs, so he needs 40 minus 4, which is 36 more hot dogs.

Hot dogs come in packs of 6, so he needs 36 divided by 6, which is 6 packs of hot dogs. Each pack costs $2, so he needs to spend 6 times 2, which is $12.


$12 

"
"Okay, so Frances sells cupcakes for $2 each and she sells 20 of them. That's 20 times 2, which is $40!

She also sells cookies for $1 each and she sells 40 of them. So that's 40 times 1, which is $40.

She made $40 from cupcakes and $40 from cookies, so that's $40 plus $40, which is $80!

But she had to buy trays for $4 each and she bought 5 trays. So that's 5 times 4, which is $20.

If she made $80 and spent $20, she has $80 minus $20 left.  That's $60!


$60 

"
"Okay, so there were 5 kids at first. Then each kid got a friend, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 kids! Then on the next street, each kid got TWO more friends, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 kids! But then the first 5 kids got tired and went home.  So 20 minus 5 is... 15 kids!


15 

"
"Let's see... Mamou had 1360 meals. She gave out 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals.  

So she has 1360 - 142 = 1218 meals left. 


1218
"
"Okay, so James has a quarter, which is 25 cents. Then he has two nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents, so that's 10 cents.  He also has 7 dimes, and each dime is 10 cents, so that's 70 cents.  

Let's add it all up: 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents!


105 

"
"Okay, so there are two brothers. One is 12, and the other is 24 because 12 times 2 is 24.  There are three sisters, and they are all 16.  

So, 12 plus 24 plus 16 plus 16 plus 16 is... 84! 



"
"Okay, so Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night. That's 30 minutes a day just for meditating!

And she does yoga for a whole hour, 5 days a week.  So that's 5 hours of yoga!

Let's see... 30 minutes a day times 7 days is 210 minutes for meditating in a week.

And 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 5 hours of yoga is 300 minutes.

That means she does 210 + 300 = 510 minutes of practice every week!

Now, in 4 weeks, that's 510 times 4, which is 2040 minutes! 

Wow, that's a lot of practice!


2040 

"
"Okay, so Octavia has lots of shirts!  Let's see...

* The small shirts are 3 feet each, and she has 11 of those, so that's 3 times 11, which is 33 feet.
* The medium shirts are 4 feet each, and she has 8, so that's 4 times 8, which is 32 feet.
* The big shirts are 6 feet each, and she has 6, so that's 6 times 6, which is 36 feet.

Now we add all those up: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 feet!

So the quilt is 101 square feet big. 


101
"
"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is 3 times 12, so that's 36 seeds. A big sunflower has 50% more, so that's like half of 36 more seeds. Half of 36 is 18, so the big sunflower has 36 plus 18, which is 54 seeds.  

Together they have 36 plus 54, which is 90 seeds! 


90 

"
"Okay, so George has 18 pens. Timothy has three times that, so he has 18 x 3 = 54 pens. Sarah has half as many as Timothy, so she has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.


27 

"
"Okay, so Albert is 36 inches tall. Anne is twice his size, so she's 36 times 2 which is 72 inches tall. Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so she's 72 minus 2, which is 70 inches tall. But Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so before summer she was 70 minus 3, which is 67 inches tall.


67 

"
"Okay, so they make 5000 chocolate bars every day and sell each one for $2. That means they make 5000 times 2 dollars, which is 10,000 dollars every day!

If they do that for a whole week, that's 10,000 times 7, which is 70,000 dollars!

And for two weeks, it's 70,000 times 2, so they make 140,000 dollars!


$140000 

"
"Okay, so Jake buys two shirts that cost $8 each.  But one is half off! So that's $8 - $4 = $4 for the cheaper shirt.

Then the two shirts together cost $4 + $8 = $12.

The shoes were $40, but they're 40% off, so that's like $40 - $16 = $24 for the shoes.

So all together, Jake spends $12 + $24 = $36.


$36 

"
"Ryan gets $6 every week for doing his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks, so he has $6 x 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream for himself and 3 friends, so that's 4 ice creams. Each ice cream cost $1.25, so the ice cream cost $1.25 x 4 = $5.

That means Ryan has $18 - $5 = $13 left.

Movie tickets cost $6.50 each. Ryan can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets. 


2 

"
"Okay, let's see... Ellen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a frame, so that's $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani spent $30 on sunglasses and $100 on each of the two bathrobes, so that's $30 + $100 + $100 = $230.

To find out how much they spent together, we add Ellen's spending and Lani's spending: $105 + $230 = $335.


$335 

"
"Okay, so Tim makes this yummy mix with passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey.  He uses 2 pounds of passion fruit that costs $6 each, so that's 2 times 6, which is $12. Then he uses 1 and a half pounds of jackfruit, and that costs $8 a pound. So that's 1 and a half times 8, which is $12 too!  The honey costs $10 a pound, and he uses 2 pounds, so that's 2 times 10, which is $20.

To make one jar, it costs $12 + $12 + $20, which is $44. He sells each jar for $50, so he makes $50 - $44, which is $6 profit for each jar.

If he sells 10 jars, he makes $6 times 10, which is $60!


$60 

"
"Okay, let's see...

* He has 32 quarters, and each one is worth 25 cents, so that's 32 times 25... hmm... that's 800 cents!  But that's in cents, not dollars.  Gotta divide by 100 to get dollars... 800 divided by 100 is 8 dollars.

* He has 95 dimes, and each dime is 10 cents. So that's 95 times 10... that's 950 cents!  Divide by 100 to get dollars... 950 divided by 100 is 9 dollars and 50 cents.

* He has 120 nickels, and each nickel is 5 cents. So that's 120 times 5... that's 600 cents! Divide by 100 to get dollars... 600 divided by 100 is 6 dollars.

* He has a LOT of pennies, 750! Each penny is just 1 cent. So that's 750 cents. Divide by 100 to get dollars... 750 divided by 100 is 7 dollars and 50 cents.

Now we gotta add all the dollars together: 8 dollars + 9 dollars and 50 cents + 6 dollars + 7 dollars and 50 cents...  

That's 31 dollars!


$31.00
"
"Okay, so Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, and then $7.50 for each movie ticket. That's $7.50 x 2 = $15.00 for the movies.  

Then she got a bracelet for $8.50.  

So, all together she spent $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00.

Her parents gave her $40.00, so she has $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00 left.


$13.00 

"
"Okay, so Josh fixes 3 cars each day. He works 5 days a week 'cause he takes Sundays and Wednesdays off.  He makes $4 for each car he fixes.

Let's see... 3 cars a day times 5 days is 15 cars a week.

Then 15 cars times $4 each is $60 a week.

Two weeks is double that, so he makes $120 in two weeks! 


$120
"
"Okay, let's count the cookies!

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies. That's 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies!

He eats one of each kind for a snack, so that's 3 cookies gone. Now he has 18 - 3 = 15 cookies.

Then he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.  That leaves him with 15 - 2 = 13 cookies.

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, so now he has 13 - 2 = 11 cookies.

Finally, he bakes 4 of each kind of cookie! That's 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 more cookies.

So, he has 11 + 12 = 23 cookies! 



"
"Okay, so Matthew has 12 toy soldiers.  He sells half of them for $5 each, so that's 6 toys times $5, which is $30. Then he sells the other 6 toys for $7 each, so that's 6 times $7, which is $42.  If you add those together, he makes $30 plus $42, which is $72!


72 

"
"Okay, so the doggy digs a lot of holes!  He digs 6 every day for 14 days, so that's 6 times 14... hmm... carry the one... that's 84 holes!

Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the doggy digs 6 more at night. So Nate really fills 9 minus 6, which is 3 holes every day.

To fill all 84 holes, it'll take him 84 divided by 3...  that's 28 days!

There are 7 days in a week, so 28 days is the same as 28 divided by 7... which is 4 weeks.

"
"Norman High School has lots of students, 4000! Butler High School has a little less, like three-quarters of that.  So, Butler has 3000 students.  That means Norman has 1000 more students than Butler.


1000 

"
"Hmm, let's see... they made lots of cookies!  They made 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies. That's a lot!  If they made 7995 cookies in total, we gotta figure out how many are chocolate chip.  

Let me add the rainbow and oatmeal cookies first: 2595 plus 3075 is 5670.

Now, we take that number away from the total cookies: 7995 minus 5670 is... 2325!

So they made 2325 chocolate chip cookies! 



"
"Igor had to get 16 test tubes, but he only got 8. He got 16 Petri dishes, which is 2 more than he needed. He got the right number of beakers, but some got lost.  He put 29 things on the table in total.  Hmm... that means he lost some beakers. Let's see... he needed 16 + 7 + 14 = 37 things. He only put 29 on the table, so he lost 37 - 29 = 8 things.  But he only got 8 test tubes instead of 16, so he didn't lose any beakers!

0 

"
"Let's see... he has 4 tables and each table has 4 legs. So that's 4 times 4, which is 16 legs.  Each leg needs 2 screws, so he needs 16 times 2, which is 32 screws. He has 40 screws and needs 32, so he'll have 8 left over! 


8 

"
"Okay, so there are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice that, so it has 10 x 2 = 20 eggs!  

That means there are 10 + 20 = 30 eggs in both baskets together.


30 

"
"Okay, let's see... Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than that, so she raised $430 + $320 = $750.  Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300. So Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now to find the total, we add up what everyone raised: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180


2180 

"
"Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron ran half that, which is 2 miles. Aaron ran his 2 miles in 16 minutes, so he runs a mile in 8 minutes. Vanessa runs twice as slow as Aaron, so she takes 16 minutes to run one mile. Since she ran 4 miles, it took her 16 minutes per mile times 4 miles, which is 64 minutes.


64 

"
"Okay, so he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.  And he has 200 feet of dock.  That means he needs 3 times 200 feet of line, which is 600 feet! But he already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 more feet of line.


594 

"
"Okay, so Tom's restaurant has 6 groups of people coming each night. Each group gets 2 plates of food that cost $5 each, so that's 2 times 5 which is $10. Then they also get a bottle of wine for $5. So each group spends $10 + $5 which is $15.

Since there are 6 groups, they make 6 times $15 which is $90 each night.

They're open 2 days a week, so they make $90 times 2 which is $180 a week!


$180 

"
"Okay, so the man bought 50 watermelons for $80. He made extra money, like 25 cents for every dollar he spent, so he made $20 extra.  That means he sold all the watermelons for $100.  

If he sold all 50, then each one cost $2. 



"
"Okay, so Dora is gonna be 12 in three years, so right now she's 9.  James is twice as old as Dora, so he's 18.  John had James when he was 19, so now he's 37.  John had his youngest son when he was 32, so the youngest son is 5. In three years, the youngest son will be 8! 



"
"Hmm, let's see... Ana peels oranges faster than Jane.  If they both peel for a whole hour, Ana will peel more oranges.  

Ana peels 3 oranges every 3 minutes, so in an hour (60 minutes) she peels 20 oranges! Jane peels 4 oranges every 4 minutes, so in an hour she peels 15 oranges.

That means Ana peels 5 more oranges than Jane! 


5 

"
"Okay, so Mark got a deal on the radiator! It was 80% off, which is a lot!  

That means he saved $320. So the radiator cost him $80.

The mechanic charged $50 for each hour, and it took 3 hours. So that's $50 x 3 = $150.

To find out how much he paid in total, we add the price of the radiator and the mechanic's fee: $80 + $150 = $230.


$230 

"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has chickens and cows, right?  They have 70 legs all together. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4.  Hmm... let's see... if we have lots of chickens, we won't have many cow legs.  

I think there are 5 chickens! 



"
"They have 7 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices, so that's 7 times 8 which is 56 slices!  There are 4 people sharing, so they each get 56 divided by 4, which is 14 slices.
