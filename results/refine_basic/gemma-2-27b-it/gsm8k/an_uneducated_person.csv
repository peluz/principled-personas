"Well, lemme see... she gets 16 eggs, eats 3, and uses 4 for bakin'. That's 7 gone, right? So she got 9 left. She sells 'em for 2 bucks a pop, so that's... 9 times 2...  

$18 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... two bolts o' blue and half o' that in white... so that's one bolt o' white...  Two plus one... gotta be three! 


3 

"
"Well, lemme see... He bought the house for eighty thousand, then put in fifty thousand more. So that's a hundred and thirty thousand he's got in it already.  Then it went up by, what was it, a hundred and fifty percent?  That's a lot!  So it's worth, uh...  two hundred thousand now!  

So he made seventy thousand bucks! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... he runs three of them sprints three times a week, right? And each one is sixty meters long... so that's like, three times sixty...  carry the one...  that's, uh... five hundred and forty meters! 


540 

"
"Well, lemme see... she gives 'em 15 cups in the mornin' and 25 in the afternoon, so that's 40 cups already.  She's gotta give each chicken 3 cups, and she's got 20 chickens, so that's 60 cups total.  

So she needs to give 'em another 20 cups at night. 


20
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He buys one for five bucks, then the next one's cheaper, right?  So, like, half off?  That's two for eight bucks.  He needs a whole bunch, sixteen...  That's like eight sets of two.  Eight times eight is... sixty-four!

$64 

"
"Well, lemme see... Seattle's got 20 sheep, right? And Charleston's got, like, four times that, so that's 80.  Then Toulouse has double Charleston, so that's... hmm... carry the one... 160!  So, all together, that's 20 plus 80 plus 160...  

260! 



"
"Well, lemme see... she downloads 2 gigabytes every minute, right? And the file's 200 gigabytes big. So that's 200 divided by 2... which is 100 minutes. But then that computer thingy makes her start over, and that takes 20 minutes. So it's 100 plus 20... that's 120 minutes. 


120 

"
"Well, lemme see... He drove for three hours at sixty miles an hour, so that's, uh...  carry the one... one eighty miles. Then he goes back, but sits in traffic for two whole hours, not movin' an inch.  Then he goes slow for a bit, like thirty miles an hour for half an hour, so that's fifteen miles. Then he finally gets goin' fast, eighty miles an hour for an hour and a half... that's a hundred and twenty miles.

So, he went one eighty out, then came back one thirty-five miles...  

That means he's forty-five miles from home. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she works 40 hours at 10 bucks an hour, so that's 400 bucks right there. Then she gets extra for the other 5 hours, which is like, 12 bucks an hour 'cause it's overtime. So that's 60 bucks more.  Add 'em up, and she made 460 bucks this week.


$460
"
"Hmm, lemme see... so it had 60 downloads the first month. Then it got real popular and had three times that, so that's like 60 times 3, which is 180. But then the next month it went down some, like 30 less outta every 100, so that's 180 minus... lemme see... 30 outta every 100 is like 54 less. So that's 180 minus 54, which is 126.

Now we gotta add all them up: 60 plus 180 plus 126... carry the one... that's 366! 


366
"
"Hmm, lemme see... donuts, cupcakes, and cheesecakes... that's a lotta sweets!  

Three dozen donuts at sixty-eight bucks a pop... that's, uh... two hundred and four dollars!

Two dozen cupcakes at eighty bucks a dozen... that's one sixty, I think.

And six dozen cheesecakes at fifty-five a dozen...  carry the one... three thirty!

So, all together... two oh four plus one sixty plus three thirty...  that's... six ninety-four dollars! 



"
"Well, lemme see... that tree costs a whole lotta money up front, ninety bucks!  And it only makes seven lemons a year, which ain't much.  He sells 'em for a buck fifty each, so that's ten fifty, but then he gotta spend three bucks on water and stuff.  So he's makin' seven fifty a year.  Hmm... ninety divided by seven fifty...  That's gonna take him a while, like twelve years, I reckon. 


12 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... She had some vacuums, right? Sold a bunch at the green place, then a couple more at the red one.  Then she sold half of what was left at the orange place.  She ended up with 5.  Gosh, that's tricky...  

I think she musta started with 18 vacuums. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... 20 kids in class, right? Some like that fancy dancin', some like the jazzy stuff...  That leaves a bunch for the hip-hop, I reckon.  Gotta be more'n half, I'd say.  

60% 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  That jewelry is shiny, but those gadgets are pretty cool.  If the jewelry goes up by 2.5%, that's like...  $125 more, right? And the gadgets only go up by 1.2%, so that's like... $96 more.

So, I guess the jewelry would make more money.

**Answer:** $125 



"
"Well, they went 80 miles one way, then another 150 miles... so that's a whole lotta miles!  Gotta be... 230 miles, I reckon. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she makes 20 bucks an hour teachin' and 30 bucks an hour coachin'.  She teaches a whole lotta hours, 35 a week, and coaches 15.  That's 50 hours a week workin'! And she does that for 50 weeks outta the year.  

So, 35 times 20 is 700 bucks a week teachin'. And 15 times 30 is 450 bucks a week coachin'.  Add those together, that's 1150 bucks a week!

Now, 1150 times 50 weeks...  carry the one... that's 57,500 bucks a year!

57500 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she eats 3 eggs every day, right?  And there's 7 days in a week, so that's 21 eggs a week.  Four weeks is like a month, so that's 21 times 4...  uhhh... carry the one... that's 84 eggs!  Now, how many dozens is that?  A dozen's 12, so... 84 divided by 12...  

7 



"
"Well, she walked 6 miles already, right? And she's gotta go 12 miles total. So that leaves 6 more miles.  She wants to go 4 miles an hour, and she's already been walkin' for 2 hours. So she only got one hour left.  She gotta walk 6 miles in that one hour.  

That means she gotta go 6 miles per hour! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... so you got that orange stuff, right?  Most of it's water, like, two outta three parts. Then you got that pineapple drink, and that's mostly water too, but not as much. You spill some of the orange, that's a bummer.  

So, you mix 'em together, and you got a whole lotta drink, 24 liters!  

Now, how much water's in there?  I dunno, maybe... 15.67 liters?  Sounds about right. 



"
"Well, lemme see... Samantha's 31, and her cousin Raymond's older by 6 years, so he's 37.  He had his boy when he was 23, so the kid's gotta be 37 minus 23... that's 14!  So the little fella was born 14 years ago.


14 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 

He sold three to the first folks, then four more to the next two.  That's... seven DVDs! 


7
"
"Hmm, lemme see... It burns for a while, right?  Four hours, I think. And it gets shorter by two of them finger-length things every hour. So, that's like... two, four, six, eight!

8 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so the book's cheaper now, right?  It's 25% off, so that means it's like, a quarter less than what it used to be.  If it's $19.50 now, and that's 75% of the real price, then the real price gotta be more, right?  

I think it was $26.00 before. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she got chicken for 12 bucks, five milks at 3 bucks a pop, so that's 15 more. Then four apples at a buck fifty each, so that's 6 more.  That's 33 bucks already.  She paid 50, so the pizzas gotta be 17 bucks.  Each pizza is 8.50, so she got... two pizzas! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... three shorts at sixteen fifty... that's like, forty-nine fifty, right?  Pants are twenty-two fifty each, so three of them is sixty-seven fifty. Shoes are forty-two a pop, so three is... uh... one hundred and twenty-six.  

Now, add all that up...  

*scribbles on a napkin*

That's two hundred and forty-three dollars! 



"
"Well, lemme see... she eats one a night, so that's 60 ice creams in 60 days.  Each box has 15, so that's 4 boxes she needs. If each box is 4 bucks, then it's 4 times 4...  

16.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He went 20 miles, then stopped. Then he stopped again 15 miles from the end, which is 60 miles total... so that's 45 miles.  

So he went 45 minus 20 miles... that's 25 miles!


25 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... them fancy heels cost thirty-three bucks and the other ones is double that, so sixty-six bucks.  That's ninety-nine bucks for both of 'em.  But the boots is five bucks more than that, so...  

$104 

"
"Okay, so they're like, 7 parts to his age and 11 parts to Allen's age, right? And together it's 162 years.  Hmm... lemme see... if we split that 162 into 18 parts (7+11), each part is worth 9 years. So Darrell's 63 (7 times 9) and Allen's 99 (11 times 9).  

Now, in 10 years, Allen's gonna be 109 (99 plus 10).

109 

"
"Well, lemme see... that first fella says 80. The second one says 20 more than half of that, so that's like 40 plus 20, which is 60. And the last one says 25% more than the first one... hmm, that's a quarter more, so that's like 20 more, makin' it 100.

Add 'em all up, 80 plus 60 plus 100, that's 240. Now divide that by 3 'cause there's three guesses... 240 divided by 3 is 80.

So I guess the answer is 80. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... ten dogs, half an hour each... that's like, five hours a day, right?  And there's seven days in a week... so that's... uh...  carry the one... thirty-five hours! 


35 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Gretchen's got a whole bunch of coins, right?  She's got more gold ones than silver ones, like, thirty more.  If she's got a hundred and ten coins all together...  

*counts on fingers*

Gotta be... seventy gold coins! 


70
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Raymond's got a whole lotta jewels, forty! Aaron's got some less than half of that, but then he gets five more... so maybe twenty-five? And Siobhan, she's got two less than Aaron... so that's... twenty-three?

23 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He played for a while, scored some points, then scored more points.  That's... uh... 9 points! 



"
"Well, lemme see... he eats two a day, so that's sixty in a month, right?  And those yogurt things are five bucks for four... so that's fifteen of them sets he needs.  Fifteen times five...  carry the one... that's seventy-five dollars! 


$75.00
"
"Hmm, lemme see... He sold his Legos for money, right? And then he bought games with that money. He had some money left over, so he musta sold a bunch of Legos.  

I think he still has 2 Legos left. 



"
"Well, lemme see... he runs 60 miles a whole week, and does it over 3 days.  First day's a long one, 3 hours. The other two days, he runs half that, so that's 1.5 hours each.  So that's 3 hours plus another 3 hours, makin' 6 hours total.

If he runs 60 miles in 6 hours, that means he's goin' 10 miles every hour. 


10
"
"Well, lemme see... she skips at 3 miles an hour, and that's half as fast as she runs, so she runs at 6 miles an hour.  Walkin' is slower, gotta be, right? She runs four times faster than she walks, so she walks at 1.5 miles an hour.

She runs for a third of the time, so that's 2 hours outta the 6.  That means she walks for 4 hours.

Runnin' for 2 hours at 6 miles an hour, she covers 12 miles. Walkin' for 4 hours at 1.5 miles an hour, she covers 6 miles.

Add those together, and she travels 18 miles. 


18
"
"Well, Suzy's phone is brand new, just a year old. Ben's phone is older, like twice as old as Suzy's, so that's two years. Now, Brandon's phone is super old, like four times older than Ben's. So, that's gotta be... eight years old! 


8
"
"Well, lemme see... that there dragon breathes fire real far, like a thousand feet! But Polly can chuck that shiny spear thing a good ways, four hundred feet.  But if she holds that blue rock, she can throw it three times farther! So, that's... twelve hundred feet!  

That means she can stand two hundred feet away from the fire breathin' and still hit the dragon. 


200 

"
"Well, lemme see... she had five pies, and each one had eight slices, so that's a whole lotta pie!  If there were 14 pieces left, that means they ate a bunch.  Hmm... 40 pieces to start, take away the 14 left...  

That's 26 pieces they gobbled up! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... 2000 calories, and you already ate 1800... so that's 200 left.  The bag has 250 calories per serving, so that's less than one whole serving.  Each bag is 300 grams and has 5 servings, so each serving is 60 grams.  If you can only have less than one serving, you can probably eat... maybe around 48 grams? 



"
"Well, lemme see... he makes 10 candles outta each pound o' wax, and he needs enough for 20 candles, so that's two pounds o' wax.  That's gonna cost him 20 bucks.  If he sells 'em for 2 bucks a pop, that's 40 bucks.  So he makes 20 bucks profit, I reckon.


$20.00 

"
"Okay, so Meredith writes a lotta articles, right?  Five on Monday, then a bunch more on Tuesday, like, way more.  Then double that on Wednesday.  That's a lot of writin'!  

Let's see... five on Monday, then two more on Tuesday, so that's seven. Then double that for Wednesday, so fourteen.  That's a whole lotta articles!  Five plus seven plus fourteen... that's twenty-six articles!

Now, each one takes four hours, so twenty-six times four... hmm... lemme count that up...  

104 hours!  That's a lot of time spent typin'!



"
"Hmm, lemme see... She started with 80, used a bunch at work, and had some left over...  

She used 220 at work, so that's 80 plus 220... that's 300!

But she had 23 left, so she musta bought a pack with 277 in it. 


277
"
"Well, lemme see... he bought a bunch of blue ties, right?  Five of 'em at forty bucks a pop, so that's two hundred bucks gone already.  Then he got double that in red ones, so that's ten red ties.  Those red ones are fancier, costin' sixty bucks each.  So that's ten times sixty, which is... uh... six hundred bucks.  

Add that to the two hundred for the blue ones, and that's eight hundred bucks total. 


$800
"
"Hmm, lemme see... she had 4 feet of wire, right? And each piece is 6 inches.  That's like, a foot and a half, I think. So, she got... 8 pieces! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Fifteen floors, eight apartments on each floor... that's a lotta apartments!  If most of 'em are full, then there's gotta be a bunch empty, right?  I'd say... maybe thirty? 


30 

"
"Well, lemme see... he gets 252 eggs every day, right? And that's like, seven days a week, so that's a whole lotta eggs!  He sells 'em for two bucks a dozen, so... hmm...  carry the one...  I think he makes 'bout 294 dollars a week. 


294 

"
"Well, lemme see... he goes out for three hours at ten miles an hour, so that's thirty miles, right?  Then he comes back goin' slower, six miles an hour.  Hmm...  If he goes six miles every hour, it'll take him five hours to go thirty miles. 


5 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He takes out 30 comic books, and those are light, right?  So he needs to take out some toys too.  If each toy is heavier, he probably needs to take out, like, 15 toys. 


15 

"
"Okay, so the guy fixes truck tires for sixty bucks a pop and car tires for forty. On Thursday he does six truck tires and four car tires.  That's, lemme see... six times sixty is three-sixty, and four times forty is one-sixty. So Thursday he made four-eighty.

Then on Friday he does twelve car tires, so that's twelve times forty, which is four-eighty.

Hmm, they both made the same amount.  So the answer is zero, I guess?



"
"Well, lemme see... they got 7 kittens already, right? And Patchy had, like, a whole bunch more, three times as many as the ones they brought home. Trixie had 12, so that's a lot of kitties!  

Let's see... 7 plus... uh... 21... that's 28... and then add Trixie's 12...  

That's a whole lotta kittens! 40! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Jean had 30, ate some... that leaves her with 28.  She puts two in each bag... so that's... 14 bags! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... he got 42 bucks and each movie costs 7 for the ticket and 7 for the popcorn, so that's 14 bucks a pop.  

42 divided by 14...  carry the one...  that's 3 times! 


3
"
"Hmm, lemme see... that truck can carry 5000 pounds, but it's already got 3755 pounds in it. So that leaves...  uh... 1245 pounds left.  Each box weighs 15 pounds, so...  that's like... 83 boxes. 


83
"
"Lemme see... so he had to pay forty bucks for the food, right? Then they added some extra 'cause it was delivered, like ten bucks more. And then three bucks for bringin' it to him. Oh, and he gave the guy four bucks extra.  So... that's... uh...  

... fifty-seven dollars! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Six bunches of raspberries, twenty in each... that's a lotta raspberries!  Plus, there's some just hangin' around.  Let's see...  *counts on fingers*  

...  187!  That's a whole heap of raspberries! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... 25 oranges, one's bad, some ain't ripe yet, and a couple are sour...  That leaves a lotta good ones, I reckon.  Gotta be... 17? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she spent 500 on the shiny stuff, then another 800 for the fancy jeweler guy. That's 1300 already!  And then she gotta pay extra for insurance, which is 10% of that... so that's another 130 bucks.  

So, all together, it cost her 1430 dollars! 



"
"Well, she works there for 30 years, right? And after 20 years she gets extra money. So it's like 50,000 plus somethin'.  Hmm, 5% of 50,000 is... lemme see...  that's 2,500 more dollars each year. So it's 50,000 plus 2,500...

$52,500 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so she pays 140 bucks every month, right? That's like, a lotta money for watchin' shows!

So, six months is half a year, so that's 140 times 6... which is... uh... 840 bucks!

Then they give her a discount, 10% less... so that's like, 14 bucks off each month.

So now it's 140 minus 14... that's 126 bucks a month.

Another six months of that is... 126 times 6...  which is 756 bucks.

Now we gotta add those two together... 840 plus 756...  carry the one... that's 1596 bucks!

Sheesh, that's a lot of money for watchin' TV!


1596 

"
"Well, she went 100 miles and only needed 4 gallons to fill it back up.  So, if her tank holds 12 gallons, that's like havin' three times the gas she just used, right? So she could probably go like 300 miles, I reckon. 


300 

"
"Well, lemme see... He watches the boob tube for two hours, then reads for, hmm, half of that, so that's one hour.  That's three hours total. And he does that three times a week, so that's nine hours a week.  Now, four weeks is... lemme count... that's 36 hours! 


36
"
"Hmm, lemme see... four schools, two teams each, five players on each team... that's a lotta folks! And don't forget the coaches!  

I think... I think it's 48 people all together. 



"
"Well, lemme see...  They had a whole bunch o' diamonds, 175 of 'em! Then they had some rubies, but not as many as diamonds, 'bout 35 less.  And then there were even more emeralds, double the rubies!  Gosh, that's a lot of shiny rocks!  

If ya add 'em all up, I reckon there's gotta be... 595 gems in that chest! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa boys, twice as many as girls... that's a lotta kids!  Sixty girls... times two... that's... uh... a hundred and twenty boys!  So, a hundred and twenty plus sixty... that's a whole lotta kids, like, a hundred and eighty!  Five kids to every teacher... so...  

36 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she gets 5 bucks a week for 8 weeks, so that's 5 times 8... which is 40 bucks.  That means she had 100 bucks minus the 40 bucks, so... 60 bucks to start!


$60
"
"Hmm, lemme see... she teaches a lotta classes, huh?  Five each day, that's like, a whole bunch! And then eight more on Saturday?  Gosh, that's a lot of dancin'!

If each kid pays fifteen bucks, and there's fifteen kids in each class...  carry the one...  

She makes...  seven thousand four hundred and twenty-five dollars! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He's got twenty steps for one dish, and the other one's got double that, so that's forty.  Twenty plus forty... that's sixty steps in total.


60 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... he sells them brownies for three bucks a pop, and he sold a whole bunch, 43 of 'em! That's... uh... carry the one...  129 bucks from the brownies. Then them cheesecakes, four bucks a slice, and he sold 23...  that's... 92 bucks from the cheesecake.  

So, 129 plus 92...  that's 221 bucks! 


221
"
"Hmm, lemme see... five phones at a hundred and fifty each... that's seven-fifty, right?  And then there's that interest thingy... two percent of a hundred and fifty...  carry the one...  that's three bucks per phone.  So fifteen bucks total for the interest.  So seven-fifty plus fifteen... that's seven-seventy-five.  And she pays that over three months... so that's... two-fifty-five a month.


255 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so he sells them marigolds for 'bout 3 bucks a pop, right?  And he sells a whole bunch of 'em, like 12. So that's 3 times 12...  carry the one... that's 36 bucks!

Then he's got them petunias, those are cheaper, like 2 bucks each. He sells 9 of those, so that's 2 times 9...  that's 18 bucks.

And then them begonias, they're also 2 bucks each, and he sells a lotta those, 17! So that's 2 times 17...  that's 34 bucks.

Now, let's add it all up... 36 plus 18 plus 34...  that's 88 bucks!


88 

"
"Well, lemme see... He's got four levels, right? And the tippy top one is 16.  If each one's half the size of the one below it, that means the one under it is 32, then 64, and then the bottom one's gotta be 128.  So, you add all them up... 16 plus 32 plus 64 plus 128... that's 240.  Then you split that by 4 'cause there's four levels...  

240 split by 4 is 60. 


60
"
"Well, lemme see... she feeds it one cup a day for, like, half a year, right? That's a lotta cups! Then it gets two cups a day for the rest of the year.  Hmm, that's a whole lotta dog food!  I reckon she's gonna need, like, five bags or somethin'. 


5 

"
"Well, lemme see... Sarah does a whole lotta laundry, 400 pounds! Raymond's a bit lazier, he only does half, so that's 200 pounds.  David's the real slacker, he only does a quarter of what Sarah does, so that's 100 pounds.  

So, Raymond does 100 more pounds than David. 


100
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Flowers in threes cost two-fifty.  So, eighteen flowers, that's six of them packs. Six times two-fifty... carry the one... that's fifteen bucks.

Now, two flowers for a dollar.  Nine packs of them, that's nine dollars.

Fifteen minus nine...  That's six dollars saved!



"
"Hmm, lemme see... so the groomer costs a hundred bucks, but they give ya thirty percent off 'cause he's a new customer.  That's like, thirty dollars off, right? So it's a hundred minus thirty... that's seventy dollars!


$70
"
"Hmm, lemme see... They each got 4 liters, so that's 8 liters gone. Then the boy took 6 more...  That's 14 gone outta the 24.  So, there's gotta be 10 left, right?


10 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Charlie had some stickers, then got more, then more, then gave some away, then used some...  

That's a lotta stickers!  

Let's see... I think he has 17 stickers left. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Grace is 125, right? And Alex is, like, four times that minus two... so that's... uh...  carry the one...  

They weigh 623 pounds together, I think. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Three bushes with twenty-five roses each... that's a lotta roses! And each one has eight pokey things...  

So, uh...  three times twenty-five is seventy-five... then times eight...  

That's a whole bunch of pokey things!  

600 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they played 22 games, and won more than they lost...  

They won 8 more games than they lost, so...  I think they won 15 games. 


15
"
"Well, lemme see... he goes on four trips a year, right? And he's been doin' that since he was 23.  So that's, like, a whole lotta trips! He's 34 now, so that's 34 minus 23... which is 11 years of trips.  

Four trips a year for eleven years... hmm...  carry the one... that's gotta be... 44 shirts, I reckon.

"
"Well, lemme see... It rang four times the first time, then three times longer the second time, so that's like... twelve times? And then half of that the third time, so six times?  

So, four plus twelve plus six... that's twenty-two times! 


22 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so Sylvie gets 600 bucks a month, right? And every year she gets an extra 10% 'cause she's been there a while.  So after one year, that's like... 60 extra bucks, right? So 660 total. Then another 10% the next year, so that's...  66 more bucks?  So 726. And then one more year, another 10%, so that's... lemme see... 72 more bucks? So 798 bucks a month!

 798.60 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Marilyn sold a whole lotta records, like ten times more than Harald.  Together they sold a bunch, 88,000.  So Harald musta sold, like, 8,000, right? 


8000
"
"Well, lemme see... she invited 16 folks, but some don't show up, right? So she needs bags for, like, less than 16.  She needs three-quarters of a bag for each person, that's kinda weird, but okay.  So, 16 times three-quarters... hmm... that's 12 people she needs bags for.  And each bag costs two bucks. So, 12 times 2... that's 24! 


$24 

"
"Well, lemme see... them big dinos eat a whole lotta food, 'bout 10 pounds each. Them little ones, they don't eat as much, maybe half. So, 20 big dinos, that's 20 times 10, which is 200 pounds! And 5 little dinos, that's 5 times 5, which is 25 pounds.  

So, you gotta have 200 plus 25, which is... 225 pounds of that potato salad! 


225
"
"Well, Cindy's got four little critters. Marcia's got two more'n that, so that's six. And Jan, she's got a whole bunch, like three times Marcia's. So that's, uh... eighteen!  

Altogether, that's a lotta pets! Four plus six plus eighteen... lemme see...  

28 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Corey's gotta be older than James 'cause James is the youngest.  And Amy's older than Jackson...  Let's see...  Corey's 11, Amy's 9, and James is 10.  So Jackson's gotta be 4!

"
"Well, Lee's fast, runnin' that 400 in 38 seconds! Gerald was slower by 2 seconds, so that's 40 seconds for him. But Gerald got himself all healthy and stuff, and now he's 10% faster.  Hmm, 10% of 40... lemme see... that's 4 seconds faster! So now Gerald can run it in 36 seconds! 


36
"
"Well, lemme see...  They got 60 dogs, and for every dog there's two kitties, so that's 60 times 2, which is 120 kitties.  That's a lotta cats!  So that's 60 plus 120, which is 180 doggies and kitties.  But there's less bunnies, 12 less than the doggies and kitties, so that's 180 minus 12, which is 168 bunnies.  Now we gotta add 'em all up: 168 bunnies plus 180 doggies and kitties makes... 348 pets! 


348
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Two-fifths are boys, so that's a lotta boys!  That leaves a bunch of girls, right?  And most of them are in the girl scouts...  

So, if there's 200 kids, and two-fifths are boys, that's like... 80 boys, maybe?  

That means there's 120 girls.  And two-thirds of them are scouts... so that's...  a lot of scouts!  

Let's see... 120 minus... hmm...  

Gotta be 40 girls not in the scouts. 


40
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Harry slept a whole lotta hours, nine! James, he's a sleepyhead too, but not as much. He slept, like, two-thirds of what Harry did.  That's gotta be... six hours?  So Harry slept three more hours than James.

"
"Well, lemme see... she makes a lotta sauce, that's for sure.  If one can makes half as much sauce, and she got 32 ounces, that's like... four cans, right? And each can has three tomatoes, so that's... twelve tomatoes! 


12 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Thirty cars, but five took off, so that's twenty-five left. Then twenty drove through later, so... five musta gone through first. 


5 

"
"Well, lemme see... Mary got 18 new plants, right? And she already had 2 on each of her 40 window things. So that's a whole lotta plants!  She's givin' one from each window away, so that's 40 plants gone.  Hmm... 18 plus the ones she had... carry the one...  

58 

"
"Okay, so Jerome's first friend rang the doorbell a bunch, like twenty times. Then his next friend rang it even more, like five extra times, so that's twenty-five. The third friend rang it a whole lot, ten more times than the last friend who rang it sixty times. So that's seventy!  

Let's see... twenty plus twenty-five plus seventy plus sixty...  

That's a lotta ringing! It's one hundred and seventy-five! 


175 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... he gotta read a whole lotta pages!  Four from science, twenty from that social studies book, seven from history, and eight from geography. That's a lot! He already read fifteen, so that's good. He's got four more days, so...  I guess he needs to read, like, six pages each day? 


6 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He drinks water with every meal, that's like four times a day, right?  And he does that five days a week... so that's twenty glasses already. Then on the weekend he swaps one for a soda, so that's two less...  

So, twenty plus six...  

26 

"
"Well, lemme see... it takes 10 minutes for the fog to go 3 miles, right? And the city's 42 miles long. So, that's like... 14 times the fog gotta go 3 miles.  So, 14 times 10 minutes... that's 140 minutes, I reckon. 


140 

"
"Well, lemme see... she puts down a quarter of 'em, so that's like, 250 pieces, right? Then her momma puts down some more, a third of what's left.  Hmm, that's tricky.  So there's 750 left after Poppy, and a third of that is...  250 again! So they put down 500 pieces all together. That means there's gotta be 500 left, right?


500 

"
"Well, lemme see... Amir eats 5 cookies, and Cody eats, like, three times that, so that's 15 cookies for Cody.  So, 15 plus 5 is... 20 cookies! 


20
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Three boxes, huh?  Each one's like, five by six by four, but the walls take up some space.  So, it's smaller on the inside.  

Let's see...  If the walls are an inch thick, that means you gotta take away an inch from each side, right?  So, the inside is three by four by two.

Three times four times two... that's twelve.  But that's just one box!  Three boxes is... twelve times three...

That's thirty-six! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Frankie watched a whole lotta TV!  

He watched one show for a whole hour on Monday and Tuesday, so that's two hours right there. Then on Thursday he watched one long show and a shorter one, so that's another hour and a half. And on Friday he watched two long shows, so that's two more hours.

That's five and a half hours total.  He watched seven hours all together, so that means he watched an hour and a half on Wednesday.

Each of those short shows is half an hour, so he musta watched three of 'em on Wednesday. 


3 

"
"Well, lemme see... he had 110 cookies, but dropped 5, so that's 115. Then he made 15 extra, so take that away and you get 100.  That's double what he made last year, so he made 50 last year. 


50
"
"Hmm, lemme see... so they buyin' ten gallons at three bucks a pop, right? That's thirty bucks.  But then they get twenty cents back for each gallon, so that's two bucks off.  So it's thirty minus two... that's twenty-eight bucks!


$28.00
"
"Well, lemme see... Beatrice had a big ol' pile, like two across and a whole bunch up and down. Marcell had his pile too, but it was wider, not as long.  If they ate 'em all, I bet they ate a whole lotta roll-ups!  Hmm, I'd say 'bout 45 each, maybe?


45 

"
"Well, lemme see... she rows twenty feet in sixteen seconds, and it takes her sixty-four seconds to get to shore. So, that's like, three times as long, right?  So she rows sixty feet, maybe? And for every ten feet, it's two liters of water. So, that's six times two...  

12 liters!

25
"
"Well, lemme see... Jamal's phone holds a whole lotta pictures, way more than Brittany's.  Brittany's phone can hold, like, a bunch less. And that bunch less is 'cause of the ducks in Jamal's picture.  If Jamal's phone holds 1800 pictures, and Brittany's holds way less, and that's 'cause of the ducks... hmm... I'd say there's gotta be about 6 ducks in the picture. 


6
"
"Well, lemme see... she bought them 2x4s for ten bucks a pop, and she got ten of 'em, so that's a hundred bucks right there.  Then them 4x4s, those were sixteen bucks each, and she had five, so that's eighty bucks more.  So she spent a hundred eighty bucks total.

Now, lumber's gone up, so she can sell them 2x4s for fifteen bucks each, that's a hundred fifty bucks. And them 4x4s, she can get twenty-four bucks each for those, so that's a hundred twenty bucks.  So she makes two hundred seventy bucks sellin' 'em all.

Two seventy minus a hundred eighty... that's ninety bucks profit! 



"
"Well, lemme see... she uses 7 spoonfuls of sugar for every 13 cups of water, right?  And she used a whole bunch of stuff, 120 of 'em total.  Hmm...  If I picture it like 7 sugar, 13 water, 7 sugar, 13 water...  I bet if I kept goin' I could figure it out.  

Let's see... 7 plus 13 is 20.  So, that's like one whole set of sugar and water.  And she used 120 of those sets...  Nope, that ain't right.  

Hold on... 120 divided by 20... that's 6!  So each set is like 6.  And she used 7 spoonfuls of sugar in each set.  So, 6 times 7... that's 42!

She used 42 spoonfuls of sugar. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Two shoes for each kid, and he got three kids... so that's six shoes.  And they cost sixty bucks each...

"
"Okay, so Adrien made more than Lylah, right? Like, way more. And then he got a raise, a big one!  

If he made 40 grand four years ago, and now he's makin' 56 grand, that's a lot more money! Lylah probably got a raise too, but we don't know how much.

Hmm, let's see... 56 grand for Adrien plus...  I dunno, maybe Lylah makes 40 grand too now? That'd be 96 grand together!

$96000 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He uses two of them paper things a week, right? And each one has thirty pieces of paper... so that's sixty pieces a week.  A month has, what, four weeks? So that's... uh...  carry the one...  two-forty! 


240 

"
"Let's see... Morisette got 5 red ones and 8 orange ones. Kael got double the red ones, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10. And half the orange ones, so that's 8 split in half, which is 4.  So, 5 plus 10 red ones is 15. And 8 plus 4 orange ones is 12.  Altogether, that's 15 plus 12, which is 27.

27 

"
"Well, Sadie slept a whole lotta hours on Monday, eight to be exact. Then she had to do some school stuff, so she slept less the next two days, like six hours each.  That's twelve hours total for those two days. Then the rest of the week she slept seven hours each night, 'cause she was tired from all that schoolin'. So that's seven times four, which is twenty-eight hours.  Add it all up, eight plus twelve plus twenty-eight, and she slept a whopping forty-eight hours that week!

48 

"
"Well, Rosie runs real fast at first, ten miles every hour for three hours. That's a whole lotta miles, like thirty! Then she slows down, only five miles an hour.  She runs like that for four more hours. Hmmm, that's twenty more miles. So, if you add 'em up, thirty plus twenty, she runs fifty miles in seven hours. 


50
"
"Hmm, lemme see... She put stamps on some letters, right? And now there's 30 with stamps.  If she stamped 20, then there musta been 10 with stamps before. 


10
"
"Well, lemme see... she had 12 spoons at the end, and her hubby gave her 5.  So that's 12 minus 5... that's 7.  But she used 3 to taste the stew, so you gotta add them back in... 7 plus 3... that's 10!

10 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He got 38 chicken ones, and then some more fishy ones... 6 more, he said. So that's like, 38 plus 6...  carry the one...  that's 44 fishy ones.  

Now we gotta add 'em all up... 38 plus 44...  that's a lotta sausages! 82! 


82
"
"Well, Lily made 50 friends, and Amy made a whole bunch more, like 20 more. So, if you add them together, that's gotta be a lot of friends!  

Let's see... 50 plus 20 is... 70!  And then you add Lily's 50... that's 120 friends all together! 


120 

"
"Lemme see... so he buys four of them big watermelons, right? And them watermelons cost, like, a whole lotta money, maybe forty-five dollars each?  Then he gets twenty peppers, and those are fifteen bucks a pop. And ten oranges, which are probably forty dollars each 'cause they're fancy.  

*counts on fingers*

Okay, so that's... a lot.  Like, eight hundred and eighty dollars, I think?


$880
"
"Hmm, lemme see... so they see a lotta folks, right?  Five hundred a day! And each one takes 'bout 24 minutes.  That's a whole lotta talkin' to doctors!

They pay the doctors a hundred and fifty bucks an hour, but they charge folks two hundred bucks an hour.  So they're makin' some extra cash there, for sure.

Let's see...  

If they see 500 folks and each one takes 24 minutes, that's like... a whole lotta hours.  

I dunno, maybe ten thousand bucks?


$10,000 

"
"Well, lemme see... Sixty elves, huh?  Some quit 'cause kids threw up on 'em, that's nasty!  Let's see... a third of sixty...  carry the one...  that's twenty elves gone.  So, forty left. Then more quit 'cause they got kicked? Ten of 'em?  So that's... thirty elves left.

"
"Well, lemme see... He spent 500 bucks in May, and then 60 less in June, so that's... hmm... 440 bucks in June.  So, all together, that's 500 plus 440...  

940! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Pam went on the roller coaster twice, so that's 2 times 6 tickets... which is 12 tickets. Fred went on it 4 times, so that's 4 times 6... which is 24 tickets.  They both went on the luge twice, so that's 2 times 6, which is 12 tickets each. So, Pam used 12 + 12, which is 24 tickets. Fred used 24 + 12, which is 36 tickets.  

Altogether, they used 24 + 36... which is 60 tickets! 


60
"
"Hmm, lemme see... He walked 4 miles on Monday, and then 6 times that on Tuesday, so that's like... 4 times 6... which is 24 miles.  That's a lot of walkin'! So Monday and Tuesday was 4 plus 24, which is 28 miles.  If he walked 41 miles total, then Wednesday musta been 41 minus 28...  carry the one... that's 13 miles!


13 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He gets four washes a month, and each one costs fifteen bucks... so that's sixty bucks a month.  Now, there's twelve months in a year, so...  carry the one...  that's seven hundred and twenty dollars!

"
"Lemme see... two subs is fifteen bucks, chips is three, cookies is two... so that's twenty dollars already.  Then they tack on four more for bringin' it, and she wants to give the guy five bucks extra... so that's... twenty-nine dollars! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... so he did 75 questions one day and 100 the next.  He only did 5 each hour, though.  That's a lotta questions!  He had 8 hours for the first one, so that's 5 times 8... 40 questions done.  Leaves 35 left over.  Then the next day he had 6 hours, so that's 5 times 6... 30 done.  That leaves 70 left over from that one.  So, 35 plus 70...  that's a whole lotta questions left undone!  

105 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Four times the blue ones is like, 12 times 4, which is... uh... 48!  And then you gotta add 22 more... so that's 48 plus 22...  

70! Gotta be 70 pink ones. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Twenty cars... twelve are them fancy automatic ones, four are stick shifts... so that leaves... four must be them semi-automatic thingamajigs.  

So, uh... that's 20% I think? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa bees!  If there's twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queen bees, that's a lotta countin'!  

Let's see... if there's 700 bees total, and we gotta split 'em up...  I reckon there's gotta be a whole bunch of worker bees, maybe 'round 400? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He plays games for two hours, right? And he makes ten bucks an hour workin'. So, that's twenty bucks a day from workin' instead of playin'.  A week's got seven days, so...  carry the two...  that's a hundred and forty bucks! 


140 

"
"Lemme see... milk's two bucks, eggs is three, so that's five.  Them light bulbs and cups is three each, and the roach traps is four... so that's ten bucks.  But wait, there's tax on that stuff, right?  Ten percent... so that's... uh... another dollar.  So the stuff without food is eleven bucks.  Five plus eleven... that's sixteen dollars!


$16
"
"Okay, so he's got 3 folks already, and 5 more comin' in. That's 8 houses to clean.  He needs 2 bottles of that bleach stuff for each one, and those cost 2 bucks a pop. So that's 16 bottles, right?  16 times 2 is 32 bucks. Then he needs them cloths, 5 bucks a pack, and he needs one for each house. So that's another 40 bucks.  

He's makin' 92 bucks total, so 92 minus 32 for the bleach and 40 for the cloths... that's 20 bucks left over.

$20 

"
"Well, lemme see... he's got ten of them hectare things, and each one has a hundred pineapples. So that's ten times a hundred... that's a thousand pineapples! And he gets 'em every three months, so in a whole year, that's like... four times, right?  So a thousand times four...  

4000 

"
"Lemme see... he had 500 blocks, then another box with, like, way more, three times more! So that's 500 times 3, which is... uh... 1500!  And then a little one with, like, a quarter of the first one, so that's 500 divided by 4... which is 125.  So all together, it's 500 plus 1500 plus 125...  

That's a lotta blocks!  2125! 



"
"Well, lemme see... 30 bees flew out first, then half of them came back, so that's 15. Then a whole bunch more flew out, double the first time, so that's 60 more.  That's a lotta bees!  All them bees gotta come back sometime, right? So I guess 90 bees came back at the end.


90 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  They paid twelve bucks for the grown-up and ten for the little one, so that's twenty-two dollars.  But they got eight bucks back, so she musta given the man thirty dollars.

"
"Well, Charlie's got a lotta friends, twelve of 'em!  Dorothy's got way less, like a third of that.  And James? He's got even more than Charlie, like four times what Dorothy's got.  So, lemme see... if Dorothy's got, like, four friends, then James has... sixteen! 


16
"
"Well, lemme see... Steve's got farther to go, but he's on a bike, so that's faster, right?  Tim's on a skateboard, so he's gonna be slower.  Steve's gonna be waitin' for Tim for a bit, I betcha...  Hmm... maybe like 4 minutes? 


4 

"
"Lemme see... she charges 25 cents per tire, right?  So bikes got two tires, so that's 50 cents a bike.  She did 5 bikes, so that's... lemme see... 250 cents?  Which is...  $2.50.  Then them trikes got three tires, so that's 75 cents a trike. She did 3 of them, so that's...  $2.25.  And the unicycle, that's just 25 cents.

So, $2.50 plus $2.25 plus $0.25...  that's $5.00! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... ten packs of cookies, six in each... that's a lotta cookies!  If each one's a dime, that's... uh...  carry the one...  six bucks for all of 'em.  He gave the man a ten dollar bill, so... that's four dollars back, I reckon.

"
"Well, lemme see... Dave ate fourteen, then that sneaky seagull took half of those, so that's seven more gone.  That's twenty-one fries already gone! Then them pigeons come along and snatch nine more.  That leaves us with... twelve.  Then that raccoon, he's a real thief, takes most of the rest, eight of 'em!  That leaves four.  And then just one more gets snatched by them ants.  So, there were five left at the end, right?  

Gotta add all them up... five plus four plus eight plus nine plus fourteen plus seven...  

That's forty-three fries! 


43
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He has three classes on some days and two on others.  Those are hour long, right?  So, that's like, a lotta hours.  Sixteen weeks is a long time too.  Gosh, I dunno, maybe like... 272 hours? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... he bakes a whole lotta stuff!  Three hundred of them little rolls, a bunch of them fancy croissants, and sixty long baguettes.  Those baguettes are like, two feet long, so that's a lot!  

If you put 'em all together, end to end, I bet it'd be, uh...  maybe... two hundred and eighty feet?  Yeah, that sounds about right.


280 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... them monkeys eat a lotta bananas, like 200 each month. Them gorillas, they're big fellas, need 400! And the baboons, they ain't so bad, just 100. So that's... *counts on fingers* 700 bananas every month.  But the zookeeper only goes to the farm every two months, so he needs... *counts again* 1400 bananas! 



"
"Well, lemme see... Blake ran back and forth a whole bunch, like fifteen times on that big field. That's gotta be a lot of yards, right? Kelly, she ran once back and forth, then got tired of Blake and just ran to that 40-yard line thing a bunch of times.  

Hmm, I think Kelly ran way more than Blake. I bet she ran like a thousand yards more than him, maybe even more!



"
"Hmm, lemme see... four pens at a dollar fifty each... that's six bucks. Two notebooks at four dollars... that's eight. And the big paper thing was twenty.  So, six plus eight plus twenty...  

34 

"
"Well, he starts with eleven little fellas, right? Then a bunch more pop up, six of 'em! So that's a whole lotta tadpoles, like seventeen! But then two sneak off under a rock.  So I guess he sees fifteen now. 


15 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... So it had 17 feet, then got 7 more... that's like, 24 feet, right?  Then on Wednesday it was, uh, two-thirds of that...  I think that's 16 feet? 


16 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Anakin got a whole bunch of fishies! Ten star-y ones, six horsey ones, and three funny lookin' ones. Locsin, he got less star-y ones, like five, and less horsey ones too, only three. But he got more of the funny ones, like five!  

So, all together... that's a lotta fishies! I think it's thirty-two! 


32 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so it goes up by 20%, right?  That's like, a fifth more, I guess? So after two months it's 20 bucks plus a fifth more... that's... uh... lemme grab a pencil...  

*scribbles on a napkin*

Okay, so it's 24 bucks after two months. Then it goes up again, and again, and again...  

*more scribbling*

Man, this is hard.  It's gotta be a lot more than 20 bucks, though.  I'd say... maybe... 90 bucks? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Five cars at four bucks a pop... that's twenty bucks. Three of them action fellas cost fifteen bucks, and the doll costs the same. So, twenty plus fifteen plus fifteen...  that's fifty bucks!


50 

"
"Well, if she loses 3 hours of work makin' 35 bucks an hour, that's like 105 bucks gone, right?  But the fella wants 90 bucks to do 'em. So, she'd have 15 more bucks if she just paid the guy.


$15 

"
"Okay, so Elvira got a computer for €1090, then a scanner thingy for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102.  That's a lot of stuff!

Let's see... €1090 plus €157 plus €74 plus €102...  That's €1423.

She had €1500, so she has €1500 minus €1423 left.

That's €77!  She can buy a nice shirt with that. 


€77
"
"Hmm, lemme see... she needs a lotta eggs for all them flans.  If she gets 9 eggs each time she watches the kid, and she needs 3 for each flan...  I guess she gotta watch the kid 5 times.

"
"Well, lemme see... Seth's twice as old as Brooke, right? And in two years, they'll be 28 together.  Hmm...  That means Seth's gotta be the older one.  

If they're 28 together in two years, and Seth's older, he's gotta be... lemme think... maybe 16? Yeah, 16 sounds about right.


16
"
"Well, Ethel's got eight bucks, right?  Jimmy's got double that, plus two more... so that's sixteen plus two... lemme see...  

$18 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He walks twenty miles each day, but on the weekend days he only does ten. So, that's like, twenty times five, which is a hundred. Then ten times two is twenty.  A hundred plus twenty... that's a lotta walkin'!  

120 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so the hat's 25 bucks, right? And the jacket's like, way more, three times more... so that's 25 times 3...  uhhh... 75!  And the pants, they cost the same as the hat and jacket put together, then cut in half... so that's 25 plus 75, which is 100, then cut in half... 50 bucks for the pants.

So, all together, that's 25 plus 75 plus 50...  carry the one...  150 bucks! 


$150
"
"Hmm, lemme see... 80 spiders with 8 legs... that's a lotta legs!  Then there's 90 bugs with 6 legs each... and 3 weirdo bugs with 10 legs.  Gosh, that's a lot of countin'!

I think it's... 1210 legs! 



"
"Well, lemme see... Sally Thirtytwo is 8, and Sally Four is the same age, so that's 8 too. Granny Red is double Sally Four, so she's 8 times 2, which is 16. And Sally Two is older than Granny Red by 3 years, so she's 16 plus 3, makin' her 19.  

Now, if we add all their ages up... 8 plus 8 plus 16 plus 19... that's 51! 


51
"
"Okay, so she gotta pay 300 for the school thing, 200 for the card thingy, and 500 for the house, right? That's a thousand bucks already.  But she wants to pay extra, like, half again more. So that's another 500 bucks.  So every month it's 1500 bucks.  Now, there's 12 months in a year, so that's... lemme see... 1500 times 12...  carry the one...  that's 18,000 bucks for the whole year! 


$18000
"
"Well, lemme see... 60 potatoes, huh?  Takes a minute and a half to peel each one, so that's... a lot of time.  And then 5 seconds to cut 'em up.  Gosh, that's quick!  

Let's see... 60 times a minute and a half... carry the one...  That's gotta be, like, an hour and a half just for peelin'.  Then add on another...  5 minutes for cuttin'.

So, all together, it's gonna take him about an hour and fifty-five minutes. 



"
"Lemons cost three bucks a gallon, and they make five bucks a gallon sellin' it. They made twenty-five bucks profit, so they musta sold five gallons.  Five gallons times three bucks a gallon is... lemme see... fifteen bucks! 


$15
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa folks runnin'!  If 80 are Japanese, that leaves a bunch of Chinese, right?  They say 60 Chinese are boys... so the rest gotta be girls.  

That's gotta be... 100 girls! 



"
"Okay, so Zaid makes six thousand bucks a month. He spends a quarter of that on his place, which is fifteen hundred. Then he spends another two thousand on gas for his car. That's already three thousand five hundred gone!

He gives half of what's left to charity, so that's another twelve fifty.  He gives his daughter two hundred and his wife seven hundred, so that's nine hundred total.

Let me see... six thousand minus three thousand five hundred minus twelve fifty minus nine hundred...  

That leaves him with three hundred and fifty dollars. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Bo got 40 crabs, right? Monic got less, like 4 less, so that's 36. Rani got more than Monic, like 10 more, so she got 46.  

If you add them all up, 40 plus 36 plus 46... that's a lotta crabs!  It's 122! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... he makes ten bucks an hour, right?  So first week, that's like, ten times five... fifty bucks!  Then the next week, ten times eight... that's eighty!  So, fifty plus eighty...  that's a hundred and thirty!

$130 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so three-quarters of the kids voted for the winner, right?  That's like, a lot! If there were 80 kids votin', that means the winner got, uh... 60 votes?  So the loser got the rest, which is 20. 


20
"
"Well, lemme see... that Sandra sure is mad!  She got 200 of them fancy pink flowers, and that's five times more than the white ones. So there musta been 200 divided by 5, which is 40 white flowers.  And she wanted four times as many red roses as white ones, so that's 4 times 40...  carry the one... that's 160 red roses!  Poor Fred better hurry!


160 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Jan's thirty, right? And she's older than Mark by a couple years.  Two years back, Mark was five years older than half Jan's age... so that means...  

Let me think...  

If Jan's thirty now, she was twenty-eight two years ago. Half of that is fourteen.  Mark was nineteen two years ago, so now he's twenty-one.  

Since Jean's older by two years, she's gotta be twenty-three. 


23
"
"Well, lemme see...  

That fast team, they all run the same, right? So that's 55 seconds times 4, which is... uh... 220 seconds.

The other team, the slowpoke, they get faster each time.  So it's 60, then 57, then 54, then 51. Add those up... that's 222.

So the fast team wins by... 2 seconds! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  If you roll a die, there's a good chance you'll get a number bigger than 3, right? Like, half the time!  Rollin' two even numbers in a row, that's trickier. Gotta get lucky twice! I'd say it's way less likely, maybe like a quarter of the time? So, yeah, rollin' a big number is more likely, by like, a whole bunch.

"
"Well, lemme see... Momma got 20 apples, and Jenna got half of that... so that's 10 for Jenna.  20 plus 10...  that's 30 apples all together! 


30
"
"Hmm, lemme see... so they got rats in three cages, right? And each rat gets six pieces of straw.  They got hamsters too, but they get less straw. And some rabbits gettin' some too.  

If they used up 160 pieces of straw, and I gotta figure out how many rats are in each cage...  

Well, I reckon there's gotta be 5 rats in each cage. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... so Mandy owes a hundred bucks, right? And every month it goes up by 2 bucks, 'cause of that interest thingy. So after three months, it'd be a hundred, plus two, plus two, plus two... that's a hundred and six dollars and twelve cents!


$106.12 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... he buys 'em for 20 bucks a pop, then adds 2 bucks to get 'em to his place. So that's 22 bucks he's already spent on each one. He sells 'em for 30 bucks, so he makes 8 bucks on each bag. He made 400 bucks total, so he musta sold... 50 bags! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... they spent 20 bucks on tickets, then 4 bucks less on grub, so that's 16 bucks.  Rides cost 33 each, so that's 66 bucks for both.  All together that's... lemme add that up... 20 plus 16 plus 66...  that's 102 bucks!  Split between three friends, that's 34 bucks each.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... them ducks gotta eat a lotta bugs, huh?  3.5 pounds each, that's a whole mess!  Ten ducks, so that's like... 35 pounds a week, right?  

So, how many pounds a day?  Well, there's seven days in a week... so it's gotta be... 5 pounds a day! 



"
"Well, lemme see... he plants ten trees every year, but cuts down two. So that's like eight more trees each year, right?  He starts with fifty, so after ten years, that's eighty more trees, makin' it a hundred and thirty. But then thirty percent of them die...  Hmm, that's a lotta trees kickin' the bucket.  Thirty percent of a hundred and thirty...  Let's see...  That's gotta be...  ninety-one trees left. 


91 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... They put out 18 pink ones, then took some away and painted 'em white.  Then they put more pink ones out.  So there's gotta be a whole bunch of pink ones! I bet there's like, 24 more pink ones than white ones.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... She needs five crayons, and each one costs two dollars... so that's ten dollars total, right?  If she has twenty dollars, she'll get ten dollars back.


$10 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... a pen costs the same as a pencil and eraser together.  Pencil's a buck twenty, eraser's thirty cents... so a pen's a dollar fifty.  Eight pens... that's like... a dollar fifty times eight...  

$12.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 200 carrots, and they's givin' 'em to 40 places...  Each place gets 2 carrots...  So, that's 40 times 2...  That's 80 carrots they's usin'.  That leaves... 200 minus 80...  

120 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa folks in Soda, huh?  They say there's 'bout 8400 fellas and 9000 ladies.  That's a whole lotta grown-ups!  So if there's 23,000 people total,  that means the rest gotta be the little rugrats, right?  

Let's see... 23,000 minus 8400 minus 9000...  Carry the one...  

Gotta be 'bout 6200 kids, I reckon.


6277 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she started with 20, then got a whole bunch more, like three times that... so that's 20 times 3, which is 60. Then she got some more, but not as many, 20 less than before... so that's 60 minus 20, which is 40.  Then she got even more, twice as much as the first two times put together... so that's 60 plus 40, which is 100, and then times 2, so that's 200!

Now, let's add it all up: 20 plus 60 plus 40 plus 200... that's a lot of cards!  It's 320! 



"
"Well, lemme see... he does 500 for one guy and 500 for the other, right?  That first guy pays him a nickel a pop, so that's 25 bucks. The other guy pays double, so that's a dime a sentence.  So that's 50 bucks.  25 plus 50 is 75 bucks.  

7500 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He gets 5 buckets in the mornin' and 6 in the evenin', right?  And each bucket has 5 of them liters... so that's...  *counts on fingers* ... 25 in the mornin' and 30 in the evenin'...  That's a whole lotta water!  So, 25 plus 30...  

55 

"
"Well, lemme see... he gets an extra 5000 bucks right off the bat, that's good! And then his pay goes up by 5%, so that's like... a hundred bucks more each week?  So he's makin' 2100 a week now.  That's 2100 times 52 weeks in a year...  carry the one...  that's a lotta money!  Add that 5000 on top and...  

114200 



"
"Well, lemme see... she got 10 acres, and each one makes 5... thingy-ma-bobs of grapes.  And each thingy-ma-bob makes 2 barrels of wine. So... that's a lotta wine!

"Hmm, lemme see... he eats two slices on his sandwich every day, so that's like, fourteen slices. And then them omelets, he puts three extra slices in those, so that's nine more. And then that big ol' macaroni thing, that's eight slices.  

So, fourteen plus nine plus eight...  carry the one... that's thirty-one slices!

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Janet had some pens, right?  She got a bunch more pens, blue and red ones.  Let's see... 22 plus 10 is 32. Then she got... a lot more.  I think she has like, a whole lotta pens now. Maybe... 98? 


98 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she wants a 93 average, right? And she's got five tests already.  So, if she wants a 93 average on six tests, she needs a whole lotta points!  

Let's see... 93 times 6... that's a lot of countin'!  

She needs to get a 120 on that last test, I reckon. 



"
"Hmm, let me see... He rides 25 clicks a pop, five times a week, for four weeks... that's a lotta clicks!  Then he does it less, only twice a week, but goes farther each time...  

*counts on fingers*

I think he did 'bout 860 clicks in total. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Joe's got a lotta candy!  Those chocolate bars are big, like twice the size of them apples. If one of them chocolate bars is 40 grams, then them little apples gotta be 20 grams, right?  So, 25 chocolate bars is 1000 grams, and 80 apples is 1600 grams.  Add those together, and that's a whole lotta candy, 2600 grams! 


2600
"
"Well, lemme see... she got 4 cakes on Monday. Then, on Tuesday, she got, like, a whole bunch more, three times as many! So that's 4 times 3, which is... 12 cakes!  And then on Wednesday, she went crazy and got 5 times what she got on Tuesday... so that's 12 times 5... hmm... carry the one... that's 60 cakes!

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so they got these plates, right?  Cost a whole lotta money, six thousand bucks for just half a dozen!  Then they got cups, twenty dozen of 'em, and those cost less, twelve hundred bucks less than the plates.

It's gotta be... seven fifty! Yeah, seven fifty cents a cup. 


$7.50
"
"Okay, so Sara wants a jacket for 30 bucks and two pairs of shoes, which is 20 bucks a pop, so that's 40 bucks for the shoes.  That's 70 bucks total. She already has 10 bucks and made 20 bucks babysittin'. So she needs 40 more bucks.  She gets 4 bucks every time she mows the lawn, so she gotta mow 10 times.


**Answer:** 10 

"
"Well, lemme see... them white chickens lay more eggs, right?  And he gets 42 eggs every day.  If he had more red chickens, he wouldn't get so many eggs. So, I'm thinkin' he's gotta have... 4 red chickens. 



"
"Well, lemme see... that park's a right long rectangle, ain't it?  He walks all the way around, so that's like, all the sides added up.  

That's a lotta walkin'!  If he goes 3 miles every hour, it'll take him a good while.  Hmm... I'd say 'bout 5 hours. 


5 

"
"Well, lemme see... she saw a hundred folks on the first day, then fifty more the next, so that's a whole lotta people!  If she saw five hundred by the third day, that means she saw... hmm...  two hundred and fifty on the third day, I reckon. 


250 

"
"Well, lemme see... the big pool's leakin' just as fast as the little one, right?  And four minutes ago, the big one had double the water. Now it's got four times as much.  Hmm... that means the little one musta lost a good chunk of water in those four minutes.  

I'd say the little pool's got about 8 gallons left now. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she needs 320 bucks for the shoes and 32 more for the belt, so that's... 352 dollars total.  She makes 8 bucks an hour, so...  I guess she gotta work 44 hours. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she borrows two thousand, right? And she gotta give back ten percent more, so that's like... two hundred more bucks. So that's two thousand two hundred she owes.

If she pays a hundred and sixty-five every month for a whole year, that's like... a lot of months, twelve I think?  So that's a hundred and sixty-five times twelve...  carry the one... that's nineteen eighty.

So she paid nineteen eighty, but she owed two thousand two hundred.  That means she still owes... two hundred and twenty bucks! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Four roses... and seven more of them fancy dahlias... that's a lotta flowers!  

Let's see... four plus seven... that's eleven!  So eleven dahlias and four roses... that's fifteen flowers all together!

"
"Well, lemme see... Harriet's 21, right? And Adrian's three times older, so he's gotta be... uh... 63!  Zack's twice as old as Harriet, so he's 42.  

Now, in three years, they'll all be older... Harriet'll be 24, Adrian'll be 66, and Zack'll be 45.  

Add those up... that's 135.  Divide that by three 'cause there's three of 'em... and that's 45!


45 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got 251 points all together, right?  Naomi got 68, Yuri got, uh, lemme think... half of Naomi's is 34, and then 10 more is 44. Brianna got 17 more than Naomi, so that's 68 plus 17, which is 85.  

So, 68 plus 44 plus 85 is... *counts on fingers* 197.  

That means Jojo got 251 minus 197... which is 54!


54 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she does crosswords for ten minutes each, and she did three of them... so that's 30 minutes.  Then she does them sudoku things for 5 minutes each, and she did eight of those... so that's 40 minutes.

70
"
"Hmm, lemme see... She had 120 buckets of water, used 90, so that leaves 30. Then she got more rain, double what was left... so 30 times 2 is 60 more.  

30 plus 60... that's 90 buckets now! 


90
"
"Hmm, lemme see... He plants 90 of them red ones... and then 40 less of the other kind... so that's like... 50 of them other flowers?  

So, 90 plus 50... that's 140 flowers all together. 


140 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they spent fifteen thousand the first year, right? And then another... lemme see... fifteen thousand split into three parts... that's five thousand! So, fifteen plus five... that's twenty thousand!

"Hmm, lemme see... Carlos pays thirty bucks every hour for his boat thingy, and he uses it for three hours. So that's thirty times three... ninety bucks! Benji's raft is cheaper, eighteen bucks an hour, and he uses it for five hours.  That's eighteen times five... also ninety bucks!  

So, ninety plus ninety... they gotta pay one hundred and eighty bucks all together. 


180 

"
"Well, lemme see... He takes six days on the bus, and half that time in a car, so that's three days.  So, six plus three... that's nine days total.

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He had a bunch of water ones, but lost some. Then he got more grass ones.  So, I guess... about a third of 'em are water, right?

33 

"
"Lemme see... burrito is six-fifty.  Then he gets more stuff, that's two bucks, a dollar, a dollar, and fifty cents more.  Oh, and three bucks for chips and a drink.  So that's... uh... fourteen dollars. But he has a five dollar thingy, so... nine dollars. 


$9.00
"
"Well, lemme see... Kalinda puts in 4 pieces every minute, and her momma does half of that, so that's 2. Together they do 4 plus 2, which is 6 pieces every minute.  That puzzle has 360 pieces, so it'll take 'em 60 minutes to finish.  That's a whole hour!

1 

"
"Well, lemme see... they had a whole bunch of watermelons, right?  Like a hundred and twenty.  Then that Ashlyn lady took a bunch, 'bout thirty I think.  Then she came back and took some more, like, a whole lotta them.  Hmm... I bet there weren't too many left after that.  Maybe like twenty-one?


21 

"
"Okay, so he buys twelve cars, right? And each one costs twenty thousand dollars. So that's, uh... lemme see... twelve times twenty thousand...  carry the one... that's two hundred and forty thousand dollars for the cars.

Then there's that ten percent tax thingy.  Ten percent of two hundred forty thousand... hmm... that's twenty-four thousand dollars more.

And then he gotta pay a thousand bucks to register each car. So that's twelve times a thousand...  twelve thousand dollars more.

So, all together, it's two hundred forty thousand plus twenty-four thousand plus twelve thousand...  that's two hundred and seventy-six thousand dollars! 


$276,000
"
"Well, lemme see... Robert got 20 shells, and Kylie got 5 more than that, so she got 25 on Monday.  Then on Tuesday, she got twice as many as Monday, so that's... hmm... 25 times 2...  That's 50!

"
"Well, lemme see... He buys 25 pens, right? And he can make one new pen outta five empties. So, he can make 5 more pens from the empties. That means he's got 25 plus 5...

68
"
"Hmm, lemme see... So a thousand kids were in the hall, right?  Some went out door A, that's 300 of 'em. Then a bunch more went out door B, like, more than half of the rest.  So that leaves, uh... not too many left for door C.  I'd say maybe... 280? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... John got a whole lotta candy, 54!  Robert got way less, and James got a little more than Robert.  

If John got double what Robert got, then Robert got 54 split in half, which is 27.  James got 6 more than Robert, so he got 27 plus 6, which is 33.

John got 54 and James got 33, so John got 21 more candies.

"
"Well, Dolly has two books, and Pandora has one.  They both read their own books, so that's three books right there. Then they read each other's books, so that's two more for Dolly and one more for Pandora.

6 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He talks to his boss every day for 15 minutes, so that's like, 15 times 30... uh... 450 minutes gone already. And he used another 300 minutes talkin' to other folks.

250 minutes left!

Sue ate a whole bunch of calories, way more than her sister! I think it's somethin' like... five thousand six hundred more calories. 


5600
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  So there's three classes with twenty kids each, right?  And half the whole school is boys, so that's thirty boys total.  The first two classes got a bunch of girls, fifteen and twelve... so that's twenty-seven girls already.  That leaves three girls for the last class.  So if there's twenty kids in the last class and three are girls, the rest gotta be boys...  

17 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He had 61, took off 9... that's like, 52 left. Then he got 18 more... so that's gotta be 70, right?


70 

"
"Well, lemme see... he killed ten wolfies and fifteen kitty cats last night. Then today, he got three times more wolfies than kitty cats, and three less kitty cats than yesterday.  That's a lotta critters!  

So, he got, uh...  *counts on fingers*...  a whole bunch of animals!  

73 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He starts on the third floor, goes up... four times that is... twelve... plus six more... that's eighteen! 


18
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Mitchel went down a whole bunch, 30 times! Anne went less, like, way less, 'bout a third less I think.  So maybe 20 times? And Robert, he's a wild one, he went four times more than Anne... so that's like... 80 times?  

84 

"
"Well, lemme see...  Ten stalls with twenty cows each, that's a whole lotta mooin'!  He gets forty more cows, so now there's a bunch more.  He puts 'em in all the stalls even.  Hmm... eight stalls...  Let's see...  That's gotta be... ninety-six cows! 


96
"
"Lemme see... a hundred pennies is a dollar, right?  And forty nickels is two dollars, I think.  Twenty dimes is another two dollars. And forty dollar bills... well, that's forty dollars!  So, uh... add it all up... that's forty-five dollars!


45.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... that's a lotta wood!  If each piece weighs 400 pounds, and it's 200 feet tall, that's like... a whole bunch of pieces!  And them termites ate some, huh?  Well, if it was 8000 pounds before, and they ate 30%, that's...  carry the one...  5600 pounds left! 


5600
"
"Hmm, lemme see... eight books at fifty cents each... that's four dollars, right?  And then there's that extra two dollars... so that's... six dollars! 



"
"Well, lemme see... Andrea has a whole lotta apples, 52 of 'em! And she got 8 more than Jamal, so Jamal's got... hmm... 44 apples.  

Jamal's got more bananas, 4 more than his apples, so that's 48 bananas. Andrea's got half as many bananas as Jamal, so she's got 24.

Now, let's add 'em all up... Andrea's apples and bananas is 76, and Jamal's is 92.  

Altogether, that's a whole heap of fruit, 168!


168 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Two cups for a dozen cookies, huh?  She's makin' a whole lotta cookies!  Let's see... 36 today and 30 tomorrow... that's a lot of countin'!  

*counts on fingers*

I think that's... 66 cookies.  

Now, how many dozens is that?  *counts by twelves*

Five and a half dozen!  

So, she needs... *counts by twos*

Eleven cups of flour! 


11
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa pennies, huh? Two-thirds of 'em... that's like, most of 'em, right?  So, if there's a hundred pennies in a dollar...  carry the one...  I think it's gotta be...  

$62.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Five boxes with fifty marbles each... that's a lotta marbles!  So that's like, two hundred and fifty, right? And then she gets twenty more?  So... two hundred and fifty plus twenty...  

That's gotta be two hundred and seventy! 


270
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Chris got 6 trees, and Ferdinand got half of that... so that's 3 trees. Harry got, uh, twice Ferdinand's trees plus 5 more... so that's 6 plus 5... which is 11 trees!  Harry's got 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 


8
"
"Carmen's got a hundred bucks. Samantha's got more than her, like twenty-five more, so that's, uh... one twenty-five! And Daisy, she's got even more, fifty more than Samantha, so that's... one seventy-five!  

Now, to get all their money together... hmm...  a hundred plus one twenty-five plus one seventy-five...  that's four hundred dollars! 


400 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so the house costs 350,000, right? But then there's that extra stuff, like talkin' to the guy who sells houses, that's 5%... so that's like... 17,500 more? And then there's somethin' else, a transfer thingy, that's 12%, so that's... 42,000 more?

So, 350,000 plus 17,500 plus 42,000... that's 409,500!  But she only has 400,000.

So it's 9,500 more than she can spend. 



"
"Okay, so he sold his house for four hundred thousand, right? But then he had to pay some fees, like three percent for somethin' called transfer and five percent for a broker guy. That's a lot of percentages!  And he still owed money on the house, two hundred and fifty thousand.  

So, lemme see... four hundred thousand minus the fees, minus what he owed...  

Hmm, that's a lotta subtractin'.  I think he ended up with one hundred and eighteen thousand dollars. 


$118,000
"
"Well, lemme see... it takes 20 minutes to get to 300 degrees, right? And then it takes longer to get to 400, like, way longer.  Hmm, 40% longer... that's like, a lotta extra time.  

So, it takes 20 plus some more to get to 400. Then it takes a little less time to cook the chicken than it did to heat up.  

I'd say it takes, like, maybe 50 minutes all together? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He bought a whole lotta newspaper ads, fifty of 'em at five bucks a pop. That's... lemme grab a pencil...  carry the one...  that's two-fifty!  Then them fancy TV ads, fifteen of those at seventy-five each...  that's a lotta money, eleven twenty-five!  

So, two-fifty plus eleven twenty-five...  that's thirteen seventy-five!


$1375
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Sixteen balls, half are them golf ones... so that's eight. And half of them golf balls are blue... so that's... four, I think? 


4 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she got 300 in the first one. Then the second one has more, 12 more... so that's 312.  The third one is busted, only half as much as the first... so that's 150.  

Now we gotta add 'em all up... 300 plus 312 plus 150...  

That's a lotta candy! 762! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Two houses, three rooms each... that's six rooms.  Two windows in each room, so that's twelve windows. And then four more windows in each house... so eight more windows.  Twelve plus eight... that's twenty windows!


20 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she spent fifteen bucks, right?  So, that means she gets five dollars back.


$5.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  That's a lotta stitches!  

So the body's 900, and the collar's a tenth of that, so that's 90.  Then the rosette's double the collar, so that's 180.  

Altogether, that's 900 plus 90 plus 180, which is 1170.  

That leaves 1800 minus 1170, which is 630 for both sleeves.  

So each sleeve takes 315 stitches. 


315
"
"Hmm, lemme see... she bought a whole lotta seeds! Twenty of them tomatoes, costin' forty bucks a pop. That's... uh... eighty-hundred dollars! And then eighty packets of celery, thirty bucks each...  carry the one... that's two thousand four hundred!  Add 'em together...  

3200 dollars! That's a lot of seeds! 



"
"Okay, so this Sean fella's got a lot to remember! His song's got 54 lines, that's a lot!  The first part of the play is double that, but he only says a third of those lines.  Then the second part's got six more lines than the song, and he says most of those.  

Let me see... carry the one...  

Hmm, I think he's gotta learn 138 lines. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... 80 cards... some got A's, some got B's, some got C's...  That leaves... uh...  9 cards with D's, I reckon. 


9 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He takes 3 minutes for each little hole, and he's doin' 30 of them, so that's... uh... 3 times 30...  carry the one... 90 minutes.

Then the big holes take 10 minutes each, and he's doin' 15 of those... so that's 10 times 15...  150 minutes.

Altogether, that's 90 plus 150...  240 minutes.

Now, how many hours is that?  There's 60 minutes in an hour, right? So 240 divided by 60...  that's 4 hours. 


4 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they's both gettin' older, right? So if they's 20 now, and ten years go by, they's gonna be 30! 


40
"
"Well, lemme see... Ruby's way older than Sam, like six times older.  And in nine years, Ruby's gonna be three times Sam's age.  Hmm... that means Sam's gotta be... six years old now. 


6
"
"Lemme see... he bought a bunch of popsicles, twenty of 'em, for a quarter each. So that's... lemme count... five bucks! And then he got four ice cream things for fifty cents each, so that's two bucks.  

Five plus two... that's seven dollars! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... them cobras got lotsa spots, twice as many as them mambas.  So a mamba got, like, 35 spots, right?  

If there's 40 cobras with 70 spots each, that's a whole lotta spots!  And 60 mambas with 35 spots...  

*counts on fingers*

Okay, so all them spots together...  that's a lot!  Half of 'em...  

*more counting*

Gotta be... 2450! 



"
"Okay, so Maddy's gotta feed a whole bunch of folks.  Let's see... twelve players, plus three grown-ups, that's fifteen.  And each player brings two friends, so that's another twenty-four.  Fifteen plus twenty-four is thirty-nine people.

Now, each pizza feeds three people, so she needs thirteen pizzas.  If each pizza is fifteen bucks, that's...  carry the one...  one ninety-five dollars! 


$195
"
"Hmm, lemme see... she uses 8 of them shiny rocks per necklace, right? And each one's a whole inch long.  So that's 8 inches of rocks. The whole necklace is 25 inches, so that means the beads gotta be 17 inches long.  Each bead's a quarter inch, so... that's a lotta beads!  Let's see... 17 divided by a quarter...  carry the one...  

68 beads! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... so they wrote a bunch of stories, right?  

Alani wrote 20, Braylen wrote 40, and Margot wrote 60. That's a lotta stories! Then they doubled 'em the next week. So Alani wrote 40 more, Braylen wrote 80 more, and Margot wrote 120 more.

If you add all those up...  20 + 40 + 60 + 40 + 80 + 120...  that's 360 stories! 


360
"
"Well, lemme see... Ann's nine, and her brother's twice that, so he's eighteen.  In three years, he'll be twenty-one. 


21
"
"Lemme see... she got five of them quarter things, so that's... uh...  a dollar and a quarter?  And two dimes, so that's... another twenty cents?  So she got a dollar and forty-five cents.  That pop costs fifty-five cents, so... she got... ninety cents left? 


90 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa stars!  Three rows of eight... that's a bunch. Then two rows of six...  Okay, so that's a lotta stars already.  The rest are in rows of five...  Let's see...  If we take away the eight star rows and the six star rows...  That leaves us with...  Eight rows of five! 


8
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  They got 80 of them heavy stones, and each one's 75 pounds. That's a lotta weight!  The truck can only hold 2000 pounds, so...  I guess you'd need three trucks to carry 'em all. 


3 

"
"Well, lemme see... the fast car goes 60, and the slow one goes half that, so 30.  If the fast one goes 480 miles, that's a long way!  If it goes 30 miles every hour, it'd take... hmm...  16 hours! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Ali got a lotta medals, 22! Izzy got less, like 5 less, so that's... 17?  Together they got 22 plus 17, which is 39.  But they only got 10 times less than all the medals, so that means there's gotta be way more! 39 times 10 is... 390!

390 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 8 packs of candy, 5 in each... that's a lotta candy!  The grownups get 6 each, so that's...  *counts on fingers* 24 candies gone.  Leaves 16 for the little ones.  

8 kids, 16 candies...  Each kid gets 2! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she makes 5 bucks every 10 minutes, right?  And she works for like, 3 hours, but takes a break for a half hour. So that's, uh... 3 times 60 is 180 minutes, minus 30... that's 150 minutes she's workin'.  

So, 150 divided by 10 is 15... and then times 5... that's 75 bucks!


$75 

"
"Okay, so Mike has 21 points, right? Jim has 3 less than that, so he's got 18. Tony's got double Mike, so that's 42.  

Now they get extra points if they got more than 20. Mike and Tony both got more than 20, so they each get one more.

Let's see... 21 + 18 + 42 = 81.  Plus one for Mike and one for Tony... that's 83!


83 

"
"Well, lemme see... He buys 15 oranges, right?  The big kid washes 8, and the little one washes 4. That's 12 oranges all together. So, he got 3 left over. 


3
"
"Hmm, lemme see... so he does a lotta stuff, right?  A hundred of them push-up things, fifty of them squat things, and twenty of them dumbbell things. Then the next day he does more push-ups, less squats, and more dumbbell things.  

That's a lot of countin'!  I think... I think it's like... three hundred and seventy, maybe?


370 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they eat 0.2 kilos each time, and they eat twice a day. So that's 0.2 times 2, which is 0.4 kilos each.  And there's 5 of 'em, so that's 0.4 times 5, which is 2 kilos gone every day.  Now, that big bag has 42 kilos, so it'll last...  21 days!  But that's not what they asked, they want to know how many weeks. There's 7 days in a week, so... 21 divided by 7 is 3 weeks.

3 

"
"Well, lemme see... he wants to sell a hundred and twenty crates, right?  He was closed two days, so that's not good. He sold twenty on the weekend, then fifteen, then twelve, then eighteen...  

*counts on fingers*

That's sixty-five crates he sold.  So he's, uh...  

*counts some more*

Fifty-five crates short! 


55
"
"Well, lemme see... she starts at 200 bucks, right? And then three other folks bid, makin' it go up 50 bucks each time. So that's 150 bucks more, right?  

So the desk costs her 200 plus 150... that's 350 bucks!


$350 

"
"Okay, so he goes 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so that's 60 miles a day.  He does that 5 days a week, so that's 300 miles a week.  And there are like, a bunch of weeks in a year, right?  Let's say 50. So that's 15,000 miles a year.

He pays 2 bucks a mile, so that's 30,000 bucks just for the miles.  Then he gives the driver an extra 150 bucks every month, so that's 1800 bucks a year.

So, all together, it's 30,000 plus 1800...  That's 31,800 bucks! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He worked out for 23 minutes on Sunday and 16 on Monday.  That's 23 plus 16... which is 39.  He wants to do double that on Tuesday, so that's 39 times 2...  

That's 78! 



"
"Well, you fold a big piece of paper in half, right? So it's just one piece. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she had fifty bucks, spent half on grub, so that's twenty-five gone. Then ten more on them rides...  

That's thirty-five all gone.  Fifty minus thirty-five...  

Gotta be fifteen left. 


$15
"
"Hmm, lemme see... she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice that many last year, so that's 45 times 2, which is 90 books.  That's a lotta books!  She sold 90 plus 45, so 135 books in total.  But she still got 50 left, so she sold 135 minus 50, which is 85 books in the second year.  Each book is 20 bucks, so 85 times 20 is... lemme get my calculator...  

$1700 



"
"Well, lemme see... he works ten hours a day, five days a week, so that's like, fifty hours a week.  And he makes ten bucks an hour, so that's five hundred bucks right there. Plus, he gets a three hundred dollar bonus every week 'cause his company's doin' good. So that's eight hundred bucks a week.  Now, April has four weeks, so... eight hundred times four... that's three thousand two hundred bucks!

$3200 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He wrestled 20 folks and won most of 'em.  If he won 80%, that means he lost to... 4 people, I reckon. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... they make sixty breads a day, right? And they sell most of 'em in the mornin'.  So, that leaves some left over.  Then they sell half of what's left in the afternoon...  I think it's ten breads. 


10 

"
"Well, Joey loses 8 pounds in a whole month, right? And Sandy takes four weeks to lose the same as Joey in just one week. So, it's gonna take Sandy a whole month too!

4 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Ice cream cheaper now, that's good! Two tubs, so that's... two dollars off each, so four dollars saved there. Milk cheaper too, fifty cents off each, and I'm gettin' four, so that's... two dollars saved on the milk.  Four plus two... that's six dollars saved in total!


$6 

"
"Well, lemme see... if they get an extra arm every three days, and it's been fifteen days, that's like... five arms, right?  And legs, they get one every five days, so that's three legs.  Five arms plus three legs... that's eight new parts! 


8 

"
"Okay, so Theo has six hundred bucks for his trip. He buys six fancy suits for a hundred bucks each, so that's six times a hundred, which is six hundred. Then he gets three suitcases for fifty bucks each, so that's three times fifty, which is a hundred and fifty.  His plane ticket is tricky, it's five times the price of a suit, plus seven hundred more. So that's five times a hundred, which is five hundred, plus seven hundred, so his ticket is twelve hundred bucks.

Now, let's see... he spent six hundred on suits, a hundred and fifty on suitcases, and twelve hundred on the ticket. That's... two thousand and fifty bucks total. He wants to save two thousand, so he has four thousand and fifty bucks left.  

That means he has two thousand and fifty bucks for gifts! 



"
"Well, lemme see... Three folks eat three eggs each, so that's nine eggs right there. Then there's two more folks eatin' two eggs each, so that's four more.  That's thirteen eggs every day.  In a whole week, that's... hmm... thirteen times seven...  

91 

"
"Quinn's thirty, Jane's a bit younger, like, three years younger. So Jane's twenty-seven.  Trent's older than Jane by five years, so he's gotta be... thirty-two! 


32
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Cera's 46 now, so six years ago she was 40. Noah was half her age then, so he was 20.  And Chile's people were 3000 times Noah's age back then, so that's 3000 times 20...  which is 60,000! But that was six years ago, and they said it was only half the people then. So now there's gotta be double that... 60,000 times 2 is 120,000!

120000 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  They got a whole lotta fellas on that team!  Twice as many on offense as defense, huh? And half as many on special teams as defense...  

Let's see... if we say there's 30 on defense, that's 60 on offense, and 15 on special teams.  That's 105 total!

30 



"
"Let's see... two families with six folks each, that's twelve. Then three families with four each, so that's another twelve.  So that's twenty-four people comin'. But eight got sick, and two more had somethin' else goin' on.  So, twenty-four minus eight, that's sixteen... then minus two more... that's fourteen!

14 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Solomon got 20 marbles, then he had 50 more, so that's 20 plus 50... that's 70 marbles.  His dad gave him some too, 2/5 of the 20 he bought, so that's...  *counts on fingers* ... 8 more marbles!

So now he has 70 plus 8, which is 78 marbles. Each one weighs 2 kgs, so... *counts on fingers again* ... 78 times 2 is 156 kgs!


156 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Six by four, that's like a big ol' bathtub, right? And it's five feet deep, so that's a lotta water!  If it costs a dime for every bit of water, I reckon it'd cost ya twelve bucks to fill 'er up. 


$12.00
"
"Well, lemme see... thirty boys... and three times that many girls... so that's like... ninety girls?  And a few kids who ain't boys or girls... maybe three?  So, thirty plus ninety plus three... that's a whole lotta kids!  Gotta be... 123! 



"
"Hmm, so they got 3 wires for every pole, right? And they need 45 wires... so that's like, 45 divided by 3...  which is 15 poles! 


15 

"
"Well, lemme see... There were 25 fellas and 15 ladies at first. Then some folks left, right?  And 22 fellas are still hangin' around.  Hmm... that means there's gotta be 8 ladies left. 


8
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  A book's four bucks, and the magazine's half that, so that's two bucks.  The pen's a dollar less than the magazine, so... that's gotta be one dollar.


$1 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Jam's got a bunch of pencils, right?  Three boxes and two extra. That's a lotta pencils!  Meg's got even more, like, almost fifty!  

If you put 'em all together, you'd need a whole lotta boxes to fit 'em.  I'd say... nine boxes, maybe? 


9 

"
"Well, lemme see... she puts in a bunch of ice, right? Each one makes it weaker by a little bit. And then she adds some cream too.  I reckon it's gotta be weaker by, like, 75 milliliters or somethin'. 


75 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... They got 7 new records, and you gotta give 2 old ones for each new one... so that's 7 times 2...  

14 

"
"Okay, so there's a hundred folks workin' there, right? And the young'uns, they get two thousand bucks a month.  That's two-fifths of 'em, so that's forty young programmers.  The older ones get four hundred more, so they're makin' two thousand four hundred. That leaves sixty of the older ones.

So, forty times two thousand is eighty thousand for the young guys. Sixty times two thousand four hundred is... lemme see... carry the one... that's one hundred forty-four thousand for the older ones.

Add those together, and you get... two hundred twenty-four thousand! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  They got on at the start, then more got on, then some got off, then more got on...  

Twenty people were left goin' to the next stop.  

If I count back, I think there were 14 at the start. 



"
"Okay, so Oscar had some candy, right? He ate some, gave some to his buddies, then got more.  He ate a few more, then a couple more.  Hmm... lemme see... I think he has 31 left. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... It's at 60%, so it needs 40% more.  It charges up a little bit every 3 minutes, right? So, that's like... a lotta minutes.  I dunno, maybe 2 hours? 



"
"Erin had some candy, then got more.  Then she gave some away.  Hmm... lemme see...  She has fourteen left. 


14
"
"Hmm, lemme see... they spent eighty bucks last time, so that's like four of them twenty dollar things. So they got four dollars off. This time they spent forty-three bucks, but they got four dollars off, and then the coupon took off another eight dollars 'cause it was double the reward thing. So that's twelve dollars off in total. Forty-three minus twelve... that's thirty-one dollars!


$31 

"
"Okay, so Job A pays fifteen bucks an hour for, like, a whole lotta hours, two thousand! But then they take out twenty percent for taxes, which is a bummer. Job B just says forty-two thousand a year, but they take out six thousand for somethin' called property tax, and then ten percent more.  

Hmm, lemme see... Job A is thirty thousand after taxes, and Job B is... thirty-two thousand four hundred after all that tax stuff.

So Job B is eight thousand four hundred dollars better.



"
"Hmm, let me see...  Lotsa castles in Scotland, eh?  Some are all busted up, right?  And some of them busted ones, nobody's watchin' over 'em.  Gosh, I dunno... maybe... 44? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Furniture United wants a bunch of money up front, then more money every month. Cozy Homes wants less up front, but then wants money for more months.  

I think... Cozy Homes is a little cheaper, by like a hundred bucks or somethin'.



"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got a whole lotta guns!  Let's see... eight plus ten plus one plus five... that's a bunch!  If they split 'em up even, I reckon each fella would get six. 


6
"
"Hmm, lemme see... he needs 30 for each batch of those suckers, and he's makin' eight of 'em... so that's 30 times 8...  carry the one... that's 240.  And then he needs 70 more for the fudge. So, 240 plus 70...  that's 310! 


310 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she buys 8 of them things for 8 bucks a pop. So that's 8 times 8, which is 64 bucks. Then it goes up by half, so that's like addin' 4 bucks to each one, right? So now they're worth 12 bucks each.  But then the next year they go down by a quarter, so that's like takin' away 3 bucks. So they're worth 9 bucks each.  She still got 8 of them, so 9 times 8 is... 72 bucks!


$72 

"
"Luke ate two, Thomas ate a whole bunch more, like six! John ate some too, but not as many as Thomas.  Hmm, lemme see... John ate three. That's one more than Luke.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 200 kids, split into three groups... Two groups are the same size, and the other one is smaller by 10.  

Gosh, that's a lot of kids!  

Let's see... if we take away 10 from 200, that's 190.  And if we split that in half, that's 95.  So maybe the smaller group has 95 kids?

Nah, that don't seem right.  

Wait a minute... if we take 10 away from 95, that's 85.  

Yeah, I think the smallest group has 60 kids.


**Answer:** 60 

"
"Well, lemme see... he's got 60 critters, right? And them chickens, they're runnin' around twice as much as them cows.  So, gotta be a whole lotta chicken legs!  

Hmm... if I use all my fingers and toes, that's 20... times that by 2 for the chickens... that's 40.  And then the cows, they got 4 each... so that's 20 times 4... which is 80.

Add 'em up, 40 plus 80... that's 120!  

 120 legs! 



"
"Well, he starts with three balls, then adds one more each week for four weeks, so that's... lemme see... three, four, five, six balls! But then he drops some, three of 'em! Two come back, but one's gone. So he's back to... five balls. 


5 

"
"Okay, so the pink frog is 50 pounds, right? And the beetle and toad are the same, so they're 50 too. The snake is bigger, 10 more pounds than the frog, so that's 60. The bird is smaller, 20 less than the frog, so it's 30.  

Now, all those animals together is 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds. But the box weighs 20 pounds too, so it's 190 + 20 = 210 pounds all together.


210 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... She got 24, then double that is...  *counts on fingers* ...48 more!  And then her momma gave her 15 more... so that's a lotta clothes!  *counts on fingers again*  That's 87 outfits! 


87
"
"Well, lemme see... Tyson runs a whole lotta meters, 5000 every day! His coach wants him to run even more, like, a fifth more.  That's a lotta extra runnin'!  So, if he runs that much more every day for a whole month, June, that's 30 days, right?  Hmm, gotta be a lot of meters... I think it's somethin' like 180,000 meters. 


180000 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Juice Box A is four bucks.  Juice Box B is five more than that, so that's nine dollars. Juice Box C is seven more than Juice Box A, so that's eleven dollars.  

Eleven minus nine is... two! 


2 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... forty tables with four legs... that's a lotta legs!  And fifty tables with three legs...  *counts on fingers*  Okay, so that's... uh...  310 legs! 



"
"Well, lemme see... she buys a whole bag, right? That's 36 cookies. Her son takes a bunch, like 4 every day, so that's 20 cookies gone. And her hubby eats one a day, so that's 7 more gone.  Hmm... 36 minus 20 minus 7...  That leaves her with 9 cookies. 


9
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Two shirts at thirty bucks each... that's sixty bucks, right? But they's on sale, forty percent off...  So, that's like... uh...  thirty bucks times forty...  carry the one...  that's twelve bucks off each shirt. So each shirt is eighteen bucks now.  Two of them... that's thirty-six bucks! 


$36
"
"Hmm, lemme see... they used to make a thousand bucks a day sellin' tractors. Now they make eleven hundred bucks a day sellin' them silos.  That's a hundred bucks more, right? So, that's like... ten percent more, I guess?


10 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she spends 25 bucks a week on food, and there's 4 weeks in a month, so that's 100 bucks right there. Then she spends another 20 on treats and 100 on medicine. So that's 100 plus 20 plus 100...  carry the one... that's 220 bucks a month!  Now, there's 12 months in a year, so 220 times 12...  

2640 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... yoga for an hour, then cookin' for, like, three hours?  Cheese tastin' is quick, maybe half an hour. Museum thingy is half the cookin', so an hour and a half? And then two hours for runnin' around.  That's a lotta stuff!  

Let's see... one, three, half, one and a half, and two...  

That's eight hours! 



"
"Well, lemme see... they need 30 for the daisies, and then double that for the roses, so that's 30 times 2, which is 60.  That's a whole lotta roses!  So, all together they need 30 plus 60, which is 90 pots.  But she already got 100, so she's got 10 left over. 


10
"
"Hmm, lemme see... She had 36 bucks, spent 11 on a sweater, and gave her brother 4...  That means she saved 21 dollars, I think.


$21
"
"Well, lemme see... he boated for 6 hours, and swam for half that, so that's 3 hours. Then he watched them shows, 3 of 'em at 2 hours each, so that's 6 more hours.  That's 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours right there.

And that's only 30% of his whole trip! So if we gotta figure out the whole thing, we gotta do some dividin'. 15 hours divided by 30%... hmm... that's 50 hours total!

Now, sightseeing was 40% of his trip. So we gotta do 50 hours times 40%, which is... 20 hours! 


20
"
"Okay, so she needs 400 bucks for the phone, right? And she already got 80 saved up.  Let's see... she makes 10 bucks an hour at one job and works 20 hours, so that's 200 bucks. Then she makes 5 bucks an hour at the other job and works 15 hours, so that's 75 bucks.  

So she made 200 plus 75, that's 275.  Add that to her 80 bucks, that's 355.  

Hmmm, 400 minus 355... she still needs 45 bucks! 


$45
"
"Well, lemme see... the shortest one's 6 feet, and the next one's 5 feet bigger, so that's 11 feet.  Put 'em together and that's 17 feet.  The big one's twice that, so...  carry the one...  34 feet! 


34
"
"Well, lemme see... Dean had 28 bucks, right? Those cars were 2 bucks a pop, so that's 6 times 2... hmm... carry the one... that's 12 bucks.  And the bears were a dollar each, so 5 times 1 is 5 bucks. So he spent 12 plus 5, which is 17 bucks.  That leaves him with 28 minus 17...  which is 11 bucks. Oh, but his momma gave him more! 11 plus 10... that's 21 bucks!


$21
"
"Well, lemme see... Morgan's got ninety bucks, right?  Mini-golf's five bucks a pop, and them go-karts are twenty bucks a go. Plus, she wants five bucks for tokens. So that's thirty bucks just for her, leavin' sixty bucks for her pals.  

Sixty bucks split up by thirty bucks a friend... that's two friends she can invite. 


2 

"
"Well, lemme see... She gets five bucks a day, right? And them lollipops cost a quarter each, so that's a dollar for all of 'em.  That means she saves four dollars every day.  So if she does that for five days, she's got twenty bucks saved up!


$20.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... Billy had ten bucks, right? And them gumballs cost a nickel a piece, so 40 of 'em would be two dollars. That means he had eight dollars left after buyin' the candy.  He spent half of that on the gumballs, so the candy cost four dollars.  If it's a dollar fifty a pound, that's gotta be... lemme see...  two and two-thirds pounds of candy.


2.67 

"
"Well, Carver's 45, right? And he's 5 years younger than double his son's age.  So, if we add 5 to 45, that's 50. That means double his son's age is 50.  So his son's gotta be 25. 


25
"
"Okay, so the train goes a bunch of miles, right?  First it goes 75, then 100, then 50 less than that last one.  So that's like... 175, and then 125 back.  That's a lot of miles!  It does that three times a day, so that's a whole lotta miles!  And it needs a fix-up every 18,000 miles.  Hmm... lemme see...  

It's gotta be like... 20 days, I think. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Rottweilers need a lotta stuffin', like 8 pounds! Chihuahuas are tiny, so they only need 2. Collies are in the middle, so maybe like 5 pounds?  

So, 4 chihuahua beds is 4 times 2 pounds, that's 8 pounds. And 3 collie beds is 3 times 5 pounds, so that's 15 pounds.  

Altogether, he needs 8 plus 15... that's 23 pounds!


23 

"
"Well, lemme see... he goes 200 miles, but then adds 10 more, so that's 210 miles.  He goes 70 miles an hour, so that's... uh... 3 hours there. Then he comes back 240 miles, but faster, 80 miles an hour... so that's also 3 hours.  So, 3 plus 3... that's 6 hours total. 


6
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa kids at that school.  Take away the girls, that leaves ya with the boys.  Some boys were sick, so...  I think there were 49 boys there. 



"
"Well, lemme see... Six girls, and there's twice as many boys... so that's like, twelve boys.  So, six plus twelve... that's eighteen kids! 


18
"
"Hmm, lemme see... she needs 42 points total, right? And she already got 15 and 18... so that's 33.  

42 minus 33...  that's 9! She needs 9 more points.


9 

"
"Well, lemme see... they kicked out 3 folks for not wearin' masks, right? And then some more for stealin', which was like, four times that many minus a few.  Then a bunch more for fightin' over stuff on sale.  That's a lotta folks!  If they kicked out 50 in total, I reckon they kicked out 'bout 19 for other stuff. 


19 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Erin got 14 points now, and that's three times more than Sara. Sara only got 8. So Erin musta had... 10 points before?  

10 

"
"Okay, so we got 44 seniors gettin' stuff.  Each one gets a picture thing for 20 bucks.  And they gotta put somethin' on it, like a fancy mark, that costs extra, like 20% more.  Two of them get pins for 5 bucks each.  And a quarter of them are like the big shots, the officers, and they get cords for 12 bucks.  

Let me see... that's a lotta numbers!  

*Picture things:* 44 times 20 is 880 bucks.

*Fancy mark:* 20 times 0.20 is 4 bucks more for each picture thing. So that's 44 times 4, which is 176 bucks.

*Pins:* 2 times 5 is 10 bucks.

*Officer cords:* 44 divided by 4 is 11 officers.  So that's 11 times 12, which is 132 bucks.

Now, add it all up: 880 + 176 + 10 + 132...  

That's 1198 bucks!



$1198
"
"Hmm, lemme see... so the wallpaper costs four hundred bucks, right? But if ya make it yourself, ya save some money, like twenty percent.  So, that's like... eighty bucks less, I think?  So, it'd cost three hundred and twenty bucks to make it yourself.


$320 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they sold 14 shoes on Friday, then twice that on Saturday, so that's 28.  Then Sunday they sold half of Saturday's amount, which is 14, but some folks brought 'em back... so it's 14 minus 6... that's 8.  So, all together, it's 14 plus 28 plus 8...  

50 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she dances one hour on Tuesdays, two on Thursdays... and Saturdays is double Tuesdays, so that's two more hours.  So, one plus two plus two... that's five hours! 


5 

"
"Hmm, so they bought a whole bunch of stuff, right? But some of it was broke.  They took the broke stuff back, so they didn't have to pay for that.  Let's see... they spent $400,000 at first, and 40% of that was broke... so that's like... a lot of money they didn't have to pay.  

So, they only paid for the stuff that worked, which is... $240,000. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Mary's got a whole lotta sheep, thirty of 'em! Half give a whole lotta milk, like two big jugs, and the other half give just one jug. So, that's fifteen sheep givin' two jugs each, which is thirty jugs! And fifteen sheep givin' one jug each, so that's fifteen more jugs.  

Thirty jugs plus fifteen jugs... that's forty-five jugs of milk! 


45 

"
"Well, she had a whole bunch of rolls, right?  Twelve, I think she said.  Then she gave some to her kids, six of 'em.  So that leaves, hmm, six rolls left.  She cut those up real small for the chickens, like eight pieces each.  So that's... lemme see... six times eight...  

48 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Forty kids, half like blue... so that's twenty.  That leaves twenty left. A quarter of them like green... so that's five.  That means fifteen like yellow! 


15 

"
"Well, lemme see... she sold 'em for four bucks a pop and made fifty-six dollars on Monday, so that's... fourteen apples, right? Then she picked a dozen more on Tuesday. And then double that on Wednesday, so that's... twenty-four more.  

So, fourteen plus twelve plus twenty-four... that's gotta be fifty apples, ain't it?


50 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Fifty socks, she washes ten pairs... that's twenty socks, right?  And then fifteen more... so that's thirty-five socks total.  

If she had fifty and washed thirty-five, she missed fifteen.


15 

"
"Rachel had some cookies, then got more.  Then her brother ate a bunch.  Hmm... lemme see...  I think she got 21 left. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... so Karan borrowed some money, right?  She gotta pay it back with extra 'cause of the interest thingy.  

If she pays the same amount each month for five months, it's like splittin' the whole thing up.  

Let's see... 3650 plus some extra for the interest... that's gotta be more than 3650, right?  

So, she's payin' back more than 3650, split into five parts...  

I think it's gotta be somethin' like... 1095 bucks each month. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Cho walked real fast for a long time, so he went far. Chloe walked slower and stopped early, so she didn't go as far.  Cho went way farther, I bet like... 67 kilometers more. 


67 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Axel got 50 silver and 80 gold... his friend Anna got double the silver, so that's 100 silver... and 40 more gold than Axel, so that's 120 gold...  

Altogether, that's a lotta silver and gold!  Let's see... 50 plus 100 is 150 silver... and 80 plus 120 is 200 gold...  

So, 150 plus 200... that's 350 pesos all together!


350 

"
"Well, lemme see... she spends 18 bucks to make the lemonade, right? And she sells each cup for a dollar.  She makes a whole lotta lemonade, like 36 cups! If she sells it all, she makes 36 bucks.  So, she makes 18 bucks profit, but she gotta spread that out over how long she's sellin' it.  If she sells 4 cups every hour, and she has 36 cups, that's like 9 hours. So, 18 bucks split up over 9 hours... that's 2 bucks an hour!


$2 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He sold most of it, and has 12.8 left...  That means he musta had a whole lotta land to start with!  I'd say 'bout 32 hectares, maybe? 



"
"Well, lemme see...  They got 52 folks in the choir, right? Half boys, half girls, so that's 26 girls. But then half the girls can't make it, so that's 13 girls gone.  And then them 3 teachers jump in to help. So, 13 girls plus 3 teachers... that's 16 people singin'!


16 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He got a 65, a 94, an 81, an 86, and a 74.  That's a lotta numbers!  

Let's see... add 'em all up...  65 plus 94 plus 81 plus 86 plus 74... that's 400! Now we gotta split that up by 5, 'cause he took 5 tests. 400 split by 5 is... 80!

So his grade is 80. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... six of them erasers at two dollars a pop... that's twelve bucks. And eight pencils at three dollars... that's twenty-four.  So, twelve plus twenty-four...  

36 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 66 to Ms. Thompson... and then a third of that to Mr. Yu...  That's like, 66 split into three groups, so... 22 for Mr. Yu.  So, 66 plus 22...  That's 88 messages!


88 

"
"Well, lemme see... David gets the bracelet for 30 bucks, right? And that lets him ride all the rides. Dasha gotta buy tickets for each ride, so that's 9 rides times 2 tickets each, which is 18 tickets.  And each ticket is 2 bucks, so that's 18 times 2, which is 36 bucks!  So David saves 36 minus 30... that's 6 bucks!


6 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she's got a lotta gifts!  Six for family, four for friends, and two for teachers... that's twelve gifts total. And she's got a whole bunch of ribbon, 144 inches!  If she wants to make a bow for each one, she can use...  twelve inches for each bow.

"
"Well, lemme see... they got 165 popsicles all together, right? And Betty's got 5 outta every 11, so that's like... hmm...  

*counts on fingers*

She's got 75 popsicles. Sam's gotta have the rest, so that's 90.  

90 minus 75... that's 15 more popsicles for Sam!


**Answer:** 15 

"
"Well, lemme see... He gets rid of that cable thingy that costs sixty bucks. Then he gets Netflix for ten bucks. And those other two, Hulu and Disney, they cost ten each, but he gets a deal 'cause he gets 'em together. So that's twenty bucks, but then he saves four bucks 'cause of the deal. So those two cost sixteen bucks.  Add that to Netflix, and that's twenty-six bucks total. So he saves, like, thirty-four bucks!


$34 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she writes for four hours, then records for two 'cause that's half the writin' time. Then she spends an hour and a half editin'.  So that's... four plus two plus an hour and a half... that's seven and a half hours total.

An hour and a half outta seven and a half...  that's gotta be...  20%? I think?


20 

"
"Well, lemme see... she got six rows and six... thingy-ma-bobs in each row, so that's a lotta spots for books, right?  Double that's like, a whole bunch more! And then she wants twenty more on top of that...  Hmm...  I reckon she needs a whole heap of books, maybe like... ninety-two? 


92 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Erica had 20 cards, then her daddy gave her a whole lotta more, 30 I think?  So that's 50 cards. She gave away a bunch, like 29, so that leaves her with...  21?  But then she got some more, 17 more!  So that's gotta be... 38 cards! 


38
"
"Hmm, lemme see... 12 slices... she gives away 4 to Bill and 3 to Mark... that's 7 gone... and she eats 2... so that's 9 gone...  

12 minus 9... that leaves 3! 


3
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Mark's got 50 bucks, and that bike's 300. So he needs... uh... 250 more dollars, right?

If he makes 10 bucks a day, that's like... 25 days of workin'. 


25
"
"Well, lemme see... she saw a whole bunch of spiders, like 90 of 'em! And then some crawly millipede things, but not as many as the spiders.  I reckon maybe 30 of those. And then them stink bugs, there were a lot of those too.  Hmm, lemme think... twice the millipedes, so that's 60, but then she said somethin' about takin' away 12... so that's 48 stink bugs.

Altogether, that's a lot of bugs! 90 plus 30 plus 48...  carry the one... that's 168 bugs! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Erica's 30, right? And Beth's older by 5, so Beth's 35.  Alice is older than Beth by 7... so Alice is 42.  That means Alice is 12 years older than Erica.


12 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Two glasses of milk, huh?  That's a lotta milk!  And each glass is 8 of them ounces... thingy... So that's 16 ounces all together.  Milk's got 3 of them calorie thingies per ounce... so...  carry the one...  

48! That's a lot of calories! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He works a lot, that's for sure! Four weeks a month, six days a week...  That's like, a whole lotta days!  And fifty bucks a day?  Not bad!  

If he works all year, that's gotta be... a lot of money.  I'm thinkin' maybe... fourteen thousand, four hundred dollars? 



"
"Well, lemme see... he needs four times the stuff, right? So that's like, twelve cups of that white powder stuff.  And milk, he needs four cups of that.  Flour comes in them two-cup bags, so he needs six of them. Milk comes in two-cup bottles, so he needs two of them.  That means he needs four more bags of flour than milk. 


4 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... that air conditioner uses a lotta juice, huh?  If he runs it 5 hours less, that's gotta save him some money on the electric bill.  

Let's see... 5 hours less times 900...  carry the one... that's 4500 somethin's.  

Now, they're talkin' about kilowatts, which is like, a bigger somethin'.  I think you gotta divide by a thousand or somethin'.  So, 4500 divided by a thousand... that's 4.5 somethin's.

And he does this every day for a whole month, which is 30 days. So, 4.5 times 30... that's 135 somethin's.

135 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Two zebras got seventeen stripes each, so that's... thirty-four stripes. Then there's one with thirty-six stripes, and another with... half of thirty-six... that's eighteen stripes.  So, thirty-four plus thirty-six plus eighteen... that's eighty-eight stripes all together.  And there's four zebras... so eighty-eight stripes split by four zebras...  

That's twenty-two stripes each! 


22
"
"Okay, so he needs enough for 20 folks, and each sandwich feeds 4.  That's like, 5 sandwiches, right?  Each one needs a pound of meat and cheese.  Meat's 7 bucks a pound, cheese is 3. So that's 5 pounds of meat at 7 dollars... lemme see... 35 bucks for the meat.  Then 5 pounds of cheese at 3 bucks a pound... that's 15 bucks.  So all together, it's 35 plus 15...  50 bucks! 



"
"Okay, so Allan has a bunch of cannolis, right? Forty to start. Then he gets more, sixty more! That's a lotta cannolis, a hundred!  Now, he has twice as much corn as cannolis at first, so that's eighty corns. But then he gets less corn, forty less than the cannolis he has now. So that's sixty corns.  

Altogether, he's got a hundred cannolis and sixty corns.  That's, uh... lemme see... a hundred plus sixty...  two hundred and forty! 


240 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He walked 5,000 steps goin' to and from school, and another 1,000 with his buddy. That's 6,000 steps already.  He needed 10,000, and only had 2,000 left, so he musta jogged for 2,000 steps. 


2,000
"
"Hmm, lemme see... that's a lotta words!  He reads fast though, so maybe... 20 minutes? 



"
"Okay, so they hired a bunch of folks in May, right? Forty of 'em, makin' fifteen bucks an hour for forty hours a week. That's like, a lotta hours!  Then in June, some of 'em left, a quarter of 'em, I think.  So, gotta figure out how much they paid everyone for both months.  

Hmm, lemme see...  

That's a lot of addin' and stuff.  I think it's somethin' like... $168,000. 


$168,000
"
"Well, lemme see... Sally had ten bucks, right? That taffy deal is tricky... two pounds for four-fifty, I reckon.  Them shells was a buck fifty, and them magnets, four of 'em at a quarter each, that's a dollar. So, she spent... uh... seven dollars total.  That leaves her with three dollars. 


$3.00
"
"Okay, so he buys fireworks for four hundred bucks, then more fireworks for double that, so that's eight hundred more.  That's twelve hundred all together.  But wait, he gets a deal, twenty percent off!  Hmm, twenty percent of twelve hundred... lemme see... that's two hundred and forty bucks off! So the fireworks are nine hundred and sixty now.  Oh, and he gets a big finale one for a hundred and fifty.  So, nine sixty plus a hundred and fifty... that's a thousand, one hundred and ten bucks!

$1110 

"
"Well, lemme see... she eats two a night, and wants 'em for a whole month, right?  That's like, thirty days. So that's two times thirty... sixty cookies!  A dozen's twelve, so...  that's five dozens, I reckon.

"
"Well, lemme see... If one outta a hundred of them blow up, that's 500 candles, right? And if 5 outta a hundred of *those* smell like a wet dog, that's...  25 candles. 


25
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  They're 30% off, so that's like, a few bucks cheaper, right?  Each one's 20 bucks, so four of them is 80 bucks. But they're on sale...  

I dunno, maybe like 60 bucks?



"
"Well, lemme see... Joanne got 30 apples from the big trees, and half that from the little ones, so that's 15.  Her sister got double the big ones, so that's 60, and triple the little ones, so that's 45.  That's a whole lotta apples already!  

They got 500 all together, and if you take away the big and little ones, that leaves 350 for the medium ones.  Joanne musta worked hard!


350 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa heads and humps!  If camels got two humps and dromedaries got one,  I reckon there's gotta be 56 dromedaries. 



"
"Well, lemme see... He went 200 clicks a day for four days, so that's 200 times 4, which is 800. Then he did a lot less for a couple days, like a third of that, so maybe 240?  Then he took a day off, so nothin'.  The rest of the trip he did 300 a day for seven days, so that's 300 times 7, which is 2100.  

Add it all up, 800 plus 240 plus 0 plus 2100... that's a whole lotta miles, 3140!


3140 

"
"Well, lemme see... Peter's locker is like, a quarter the size of Zack's, and it's 5 inches. So Zack's gotta be 5 times 4, which is 20 inches. And Timothy's is twice as big as Zack's, so that's 20 times 2... which is 40! 


40 

"
"Well, Stanley's comb fell a ways down, right?  He was way up high, like ten thousand feet! And the comb went down four thousand feet. So that puts it at six thousand feet.  Now, Oliver's down at three thousand feet.  So he gotta climb up three thousand feet to find that comb. 


3000
"
"Hmm, lemme see... He got 4000 from one bank, and then double that from the other, so that's 4000 times 2, which is 8000.  So that's 4000 plus 8000, which is 12000.  And he already had 5000, so that's 12000 plus 5000...  

That's 17000!


$17000
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Fifty cats on a rock, then four boats come and take some away... that's twenty cats gone. So, thirty left. Then, some run off after a mouse...  Let's see...  *counts on fingers*  That's... twelve cats left on the rock.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so he pays eight bucks a month for a while, then it goes up to twelve, then fourteen.  That's a lot of changin'!  

Let's see... six months at eight bucks is... uh... forty-eight dollars. Then eight months at twelve bucks is... ninety-six! And then another eight months at fourteen bucks is... one hundred and twelve.

So, all together, that's...  two hundred and fifty-six dollars! 


256
"
"Hmm, lemme see... those fancy pants were on sale, huh?  So the ripped ones were 28 bucks, and the jogger ones were 6 bucks cheaper... so 22 bucks.  He saved 6 bucks total, and a third of that was from the joggers... so 2 bucks.  That means he saved 4 bucks on the ripped ones.

So, the joggers were the same price as the ripped ones to start.


0 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got four big buses, those hold a lotta folks, like sixty each. Then there's them smaller ones, six of 'em, hold thirty each. And ten tiny vans, fifteen in each of those.  

Let's see... four times sixty... that's two-forty. Six times thirty... one-eighty. Ten times fifteen... one-fifty. Add 'em all up... two-forty plus one-eighty plus one-fifty... that's five-seventy!

So, five-seventy folks can go on the trip! 


570
"
"Well, lemme see... she makes 3 bird feeders and buys 3 more.  That's 6 in total.  Each one gets 20 birdies, but the ones she made are extra special, so they get 10 more birdies each. So that's 30 birdies for her feeders!  

So, 3 feeders with 20 birdies is 60 birdies. And 3 feeders with 30 birdies is 90 birdies.  

If you add those together, that's a whole lotta birdies! 60 plus 90 is 150.

150 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she got a bagel for four bucks, and the soup was a little more, like a quarter more, so that's... five bucks? And the cake was half the price of the bagel, so two bucks.  So, four plus five plus two... that's eleven dollars! 


11
"
"Well, lemme see... he wants a hundred bucks for that there amusement park, and he's got fifty left over after buyin' the ticket. So he made fifty bucks sellin' them cards, right?  If each card's a dollar fifty, that's thirty-three and a third cards. But you can't sell parts of cards, so he musta sold thirty-three.

Now, he kept a third of 'em, so them thirty-three cards is two-thirds of the whole pile.  Hmm...  that means he started with... fifty cards! 


50
"
"Well, lemme see... he made enough for half the folks to have two, so that's like 36 divided by 2, which is 18 folks gettin' two hot dogs.  That's 18 times 2, plus 18 more, so he had 54 hot dogs total. But then 40 people showed up, and they all wanted seconds!  So, 54 hot dogs divided by 2 is only 27 folks gettin' two. That means 40 minus 27 is... 13 folks didn't get seconds. 


13 

"
"Lemme see... Indras name has six letters, right? Her sister's name is four more than half of that... so half of six is three... and then you add four... that's seven!  So her sister's name has seven letters.  Six plus seven is thirteen!


13 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so she wants pots and pans for a hundred and twenty bucks, some bowls for twenty, and five of them thingymajigs for five bucks each.  That's twenty-five more bucks for the thingymajigs. So that's, uh... a hundred and forty-five dollars.  But wait, there's a sale! Twenty percent off!

It's a hundred and thirty-two dollars!


$132.00

"Well, Thaddeus done killed a whole lotta dragons, a hundred! Arthur, he got three-quarters of that, so... lemme see... that's like seventy-five dragons. Walter, he's a tough one, he got twice as many as Arthur, so that's a hundred and fifty! Now Bruce, he forgot his sword, so he only got one-fifth of what Walter got...  That's thirty dragons. 


30 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 15 gallons split into 5... that's 3 gallons each.  Josey needs a quarter of that... so, uh... that's like, less than a whole gallon.  A quarter of 3 is...  *counts on fingers* ...  3 quarters is 75 cents, so a quarter is... 6 pints? I think?


6 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He had five bucks, right? And he got three bags of chips, which is like, a dollar twenty. So that leaves him with... lemme count... three eighty-five.  He spent that on candy bars, which are seventy-five cents each.  So that's... five candy bars!

5 

"
"Well, she cut the cake into 8 pieces, and they ate 2, so that leaves 6 pieces left.  Each piece is a little bit, so if the whole cake was 20 ounces, and there's 6 pieces left, it's gotta be... hmm... lemme see... 15 ounces! 


15 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got a whole lotta oranges, right?  34 plus 22... that's a lot!  And they're sharin' with 6 friends... so that's 8 people all together.  If they split 'em up even, each person gets 7 oranges. 


7 

"
"Lemme see... he needs more onions, right? Double the onions, that's like, 4 pounds.  And those cost 2 bucks a pound, so that's 8 bucks for the onions. Then he needs two boxes of that stock stuff, and those are 2 bucks each, so that's 4 more bucks.  So all together it's 12 bucks for the soup.  He makes enough for 6 people, so each bowl costs 2 bucks.


$2 

"
"Well, lemme see... Wayne's drive is four minutes, and Bernadette's is four times longer, so that's like, sixteen minutes.  And she wants to be there five minutes before him, so...  

21 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  That room's a rectangle, right? So, it's like a big ol' box.  It's 3 yards long, but that's like, 9 feet, 'cause there's 3 feet in every yard.  And it's 360 square feet all together.

Now, to get around the whole room, you gotta add up all the sides.  That's the perimeter.  

*scratches head*

Let's see... 9 feet plus... somethin'... times 2...  

Aw, shoot, I dunno.  Math ain't my strong suit. 


98 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Elizabeth got one pack of red and two packs of clear, so that's like, one twenty and two twentys, right? That's sixty beads for her. Margareth got three packs of blue and four packs of red, so that's three twentys and four twentys... that's seventy twentys!  Seventy times twenty is... uh... a lot.  

Let's see... sixty beads for Elizabeth and a hundred and forty for Margareth... that's eighty more beads for Margareth.


80 

"
"Okay, so the house starts at 40 degrees. Then that oven makes it hotter, 5 degrees hotter every hour for 3 hours... so that's 15 degrees hotter.  Now it's 55 degrees. But then he opens the window, and it gets colder. It gets 2 degrees colder every 10 minutes, and the window's open for 30 minutes... so that's 6 degrees colder.  So it's 55 minus 6... that's 49 degrees.


49 

"
"Okay, so Jon takes a long time, right? Swimmin', bikin', runnin'.  James is faster swimmin', but slower on the bike.  Jon wins by ten minutes, so James gotta be slower overall.  Hmm... lemme see...  

I think James took 39 minutes for the run. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Movie C is an hour and a quarter, so that's 75 minutes, right? Movie B is 5 minutes longer, so that's 80 minutes. And Movie A is a quarter the size of Movie B... so that's gotta be 20 minutes. 


20
"
"Well, lemme see... that horse is fast!  He eats a half a bale of hay for every mile, right?  And he runs for half an hour at 32 miles an hour... so that's 16 miles, I reckon.

Now, each bale costs $3, and he eats 8 bales, so that's $24.  Michael has six fives, so he's got $30.

If he spends $24 on hay, he's got $6 left over. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she got a lotta eggs, like, 4 times 12, that's a whole bunch! Plus 2 more, so that's... a lot!  Each glass needs 5 eggs, so she can make 10 glasses.  If each tray holds 5, that's... 2 trays!

Let's see...  ten boxes times thirty-two cubic feet each... that's a whole lotta dirt!  

Hmm...  320 cubic feet... divided by two cubic feet per bag... that's 160 bags!

160 bags times twelve dollars...  carry the one...  that's gonna be $1920!  

Whew! That's a lot of money for dirt!


$1920

35 

"
"Well, lemme see... he's got a whole lotta feed there!  Two boxes of them sugar cubes, that ain't much.  Then a bunch of carrots, forty-two big bales of hay, and twenty sacks of oats.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she drinks three of them soda cans, and those are worth two cents each, so that's six cents. Then she drinks five water bottles, and those are worth three cents each, so that's fifteen cents.  So that's six plus fifteen, which is twenty-one cents every week.  Now, a month is four weeks, so she makes twenty-one times four...  carry the one... that's eighty-four cents!


84 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Toni has a lotta plants, way more than Frederick. Frederick only has 10, but Toni has a whole bunch more.  Shondra has less than Toni, though.  I think Shondra has... 9 plants.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Becky got them apples for, like, 45 cents a pop, right? And she saved a whole dollar! So that's, uh... 20 times 45 is 900... wait, no, 90 cents. Then take away that dollar she saved, so she paid 80 cents.

Now Kelly, she paid 50 cents an apple, so that's 10 bucks. But she got a discount, 10 percent off...  that's like a dollar off, right? So she paid 9 bucks.

So Kelly paid a whole dollar more than Becky.


$1.00 

"
"Okay, so each room has two sheets, right? And one big blanket thing.  Then there's four pillow things, 'cause it's two sheets times two. And then, lemme see... eight towels 'cause that's four pillow things times two. So that's, like, fifteen things in each room.

"Hmm, lemme see... Frank starts with 200 shoes, right? Then he gets a bunch more... 5 pairs on Monday, that's 10 more shoes. Then 15 pairs on Wednesday, so that's 30 more. And then a whole lotta shoes on Friday, 30 pairs, so that's 60 more!  

So now he's got a ton of shoes, like 200 plus 10 plus 30 plus 60... that's 300 shoes! But then he gets rid of a bunch on Saturday, 180 of 'em.

So, 300 minus 180... that's 120 shoes left.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... that shark's mighty big, ten feet! Them little fishies are only six inches each, so that's twelve inches all together.

"Hmm, lemme see... If three outta four kids have computers, and twenty don't, that means there's gotta be a whole lotta kids in that class.  I'd say there's probably 'bout eighty kids. 


80
"
"Hmm, lemme see... three weeks is like, a lotta days, right?  And he walks four days a week... so that's a lot of walkin'!  

If it takes 240 minutes to break in the shoes, and he's got a bunch of days to do it...  I guess he gotta walk for like, a little less than 3 minutes each day? 


2.86 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she spent 300 bucks on books, and each one cost 15 bucks. So that's like... 20 books, right?  And she's got 4 kids. So each kid gets 5 books.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 32 kids total... some are allergic to stuff...  Let's see... 9 dairy, 6 peanuts... and 3 of them are allergic to both, so...  that's 18 kids with allergies, right?  

So, 32 minus 18... that's 14 kids ain't allergic to nothin'!

 20 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Three groups of two hundred folks... that's a lotta people! And each group gets seven helpers... so that's like, twenty-one helpers in total.

That's a whole bunch of folks goin' on this trip!  

621 

"
"Okay, so the tickets cost a whole lotta money, five thousand each, so that's ten thousand right there.  The hotel's fancy 'cause it's a busy time, so it costs more, like, twenty percent more.  That's, uh, three hundred extra bucks a day.  So the hotel's eighteen hundred a day, and they're stayin' for three days, so that's... lemme see...  carry the one...  that's five thousand four hundred for the hotel.  

Add that to the plane tickets, and it's fifteen thousand four hundred dollars for the whole shebang!


$15400

"
"Hmm, lemme see... that new penny's lighter, right?  It's like, three outta four as heavy as the old one. So if the old one's 48, the new one's gotta be... 36, I think?  

So, 36 plus 48... that's 84!

"
"Well, lemme see... Luri's got three times more songs than Gabriel, so that's like, 20 times 3, which is 60 songs.  Gabriel can fit 100 songs, and he's got 20, so he can put 80 more on there. Luri can put 40 more on his.  So, Gabriel can add 40 more songs than Luri.


40

I dunno, maybe... negative ten?


-10
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He needs 12 bucks for the car and has 4 already. That means he needs 8 more. If he saves 2 bucks a day, it'll take him 4 days.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He got two of them trays, right? And each one holds, whatchamacallit, 24 eggs. So that's like, 24 plus 24, which is 48 eggs. But he got 64 eggs total.  So, 64 minus 48... that's 16 eggs left over. 


16
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  She buys a little pizza for 8 bucks, and the big one is like three of them, so that's... 8 times 3...  carry the one...  that's 24!  So the big one is 24 bucks.

32 



"
"Okay, so she buys two packs, right? That's eight razors 'cause they got four in each pack.  Those packs cost four bucks each, so that's eight bucks total. But wait, they got that buy one get one free deal goin' on, so she only pays for one pack. So that's four bucks. Then she got that two dollar coupon, so it's only two bucks for the razors.  

Eight razors for two bucks... hmm... lemme see... that's like a quarter a razor.  A quarter is twenty-five cents.


25 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  They got nine tall ones, right? And one little one.  So, they make a pile, like a big ol' cheerleader sandwich. Four on the bottom, then three, then two, and the little one on top.  That's a lotta cheerleaders!  Gotta be, like, super tall, right?  I'd say... 53 feet! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works 8 hours a day. So that's 5 times 8... which is 40 minutes a day.  And she does that for 5 days... so 40 times 5... that's 200! 


200 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Brett's fourteen, right? And in four years he's gonna be eighteen.  Angela's gonna be fifty-four then, 'cause that's three times eighteen. So, Angela's gotta be fifty now, 'cause fifty-four minus four is fifty.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He drives twice a day, so that's like, two times six dollars... plus two dollars...  for each day.  So that's eight dollars a day. And he does that for two weeks, which is fourteen days.  So, eight times fourteen...  carry the one... that's a hundred and twelve dollars!

They can make forty pies! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... so one place costs 200 bucks no matter what, but you gotta buy food on top of that. The other place is 25 bucks a person, but food's already in that price.  

I reckon you'd need 10 people to make it the same price.

"
"Well, lemme see...  He gets more sticks from that 2x8 wood, right?  And it's only a couple dollars more.  So he should buy four of them 2x8s.  That's a lotta popsicle sticks!  He can make 1600 of 'em! 



"
"Well, lemme see... he's got six dogs, right? And each dog needs four of them snowshoe thingies. So that's, uh... six times four...  carry the one...  that's twenty-four!  And each pair costs twelve bucks, so... twenty-four times twelve...  shoot, that's a lot of numbers!  

Let me get my calculator...  

$288.00

"Hmm, lemme see... she takes the bus twice a day, five days a week. That's ten times a week.  If each ride is two dollars and twenty cents, that's... uh... carry the two... twenty-two dollars a week.  But the pass is only twenty dollars. So she saves... two dollars! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Thirty cows plus twenty sheep... that's fifty.  Then the zoo has, uh, double the cows, so that's sixty more cows.  And the farm has half the sheep, so that's ten sheep.  So, sixty cows plus twenty sheep is eighty, and forty for the farm...  

That's a lotta animals!  

120 

"
"Well, Rose got a whole lotta onions and potatoes, like four times more than Sophia! She got 12 onions, so Sophia musta got 3, right? And she got 4 potatoes, so Sophia got just 1.  That's 4 things in total for Sophia.

"
"Well, shoot, that's a lotta weight to lose!  Let's see... 30 pounds is a whole bunch, and he's gotta do it by July?  Hmm...  If he burns 3500 of them calorie things to lose a pound, that's 30 times 3500...  carry the one... that's a whole lotta calories!

Now, how many days are there 'til July?  December's got, what, 31 days left? Then January, February...  man, that's a lot of countin'!  

Okay, let's just say it's about 200 days.  So he needs to burn all them calories in 200 days...  

Uh...  200 days...  

I dunno, maybe 525 calories a day?  That sounds about right.



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He makes 30 bucks a day, and there's 7 days in a week, so that's... uh... 210 bucks!  But then he spends a hundred, so... that leaves him with... 110 bucks! 



"

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Julie had five hundred bucks, right? She spent a fifth of that on clothes, so that's a hundred gone.  Leaves her with four hundred. Then she spends a quarter of that on CDs, so another hundred gone.  That means she's got three hundred left.


$300 

"

"Well, lemme see... she bought a bunch of bags, right? Eight packs of 'em, five in each pack. So that's a lotta bags! She paid four bucks for each pack, so that's... hmm... carry the one...  $320.  Then she sold 'em for eight bucks a pop.  So she made...  $320...  Nope, more than that!  She made $640!  

So, she made $640 - $320 = $320 profit! 


$320
"
"Hmm, lemme see... He throws a lotta punches, that's for sure.  25 every minute, and the fight goes on for a while... 5 rounds, each one 3 minutes long...

Carry the one...  

375 punches!  That's a lot of punches! 



"
"Suzanne made a whole lotta cookies, like 36! Josh made way less, like a quarter of what Suzanne made.  That's like 9 cookies. Kelsie, she's a baker, she made twice as many as Josh. So that's like 9 times 2, which is 18 cookies!


18 

"
"Okay, so Ali has four tens, that's forty dollars. And six twenties, so that's... lemme see... six times twenty is a hundred and twenty.  So he has a hundred and sixty dollars. He gives half to his sister, so that's eighty dollars gone.  He has eighty left.  He spends three-fifths of that on dinner... hmm... three-fifths of eighty...  Let's see... that's forty-eight dollars.

So he has thirty-two dollars left.


$32
"
"Well, lemme see... Rob takes 2 hours, right? That's like, 120 minutes.  Royce takes twice that, so that's 240 minutes. But then he takes 40 more minutes on top of that... so it's 280 minutes.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... three grandkids, huh?  So that's three hats, three scarves, three sweaters... oh, and mittens and socks too!  Let's see... that's a lotta wool!  

Two for a hat, four for a scarf... twelve for a sweater, that's a big one! One for mittens, two for socks...

"
"Well, Tony's a fast picker, he gets 6 quarts. Bobby's a little slower, he gets 5. Kathy, she's a real whiz, she gets 10! And Ricky, he's alright, he gets 8.  

Let's see... 6 plus 5 plus 10 plus 8... that's 29 quarts all together! 


29
"
"Hmm, lemme see... They made two hundred breads, sold a bunch, and some came back.  Let's see... two hundred minus ninety-three... that's a lotta breads gone! Then they sold more... thirty-nine more... so that's... a whole lotta breads gone!  

And then six came back... so they got a few back.  

I dunno, maybe... sixty-two? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He's got a lotta tulips!  Six red ones fit in a row, and he's got 36 red ones... so that's... uh... six rows of red.  Then he's got 24 blue ones, and eight fit in a row... so that's three rows of blue.  

Altogether, that's nine rows of flowers. 


9 

"
"Well, lemme see... she's got a whole lotta raisins, 27 cups! And each batch of them cookies needs, what was it, 3/4 of a cup?  Hmm... that's like almost a whole cup.  

If she splits the raisins up even, she'd have 9 cups for the cookies.  So, if each batch needs 3/4, she could make...  12 batches, I reckon. 


12
"
"Hmm, lemme see... so Ada uses 12 of them kilowatt thingies a day, and each one costs a dollar fifty. That's 18 bucks a day, right? Now she's addin' another thing that uses 2 of them, so that's 14 total. Fourteen times a dollar fifty... carry the one... that's 21 bucks a day. So she's spendin' 3 more bucks a day, and in a week, that's...  21 more bucks. 


$21.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... If one fella takes 5 days to do half a house, that means it takes him 10 days to do the whole thing, right?  So if you got 5 fellas, they could probably get it done in 2 days, I reckon. That's like, 48 hours.


48 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Ophelia has 20 sofas, right? And she needs two more chairs than sofas, so that's 22 chairs. Jenna has way more chairs, like three times more than Ophelia, so that's 22 times 3, which is... lemme count on my fingers... 66 chairs!  Jenna also needs two more sofas than chairs, so she has 64 sofas.  

Now, to get the total, we gotta add all the sofas and chairs together. 20 sofas plus 64 sofas is 84 sofas. And 22 chairs plus 66 chairs is 88 chairs.  So, 84 plus 88 is... 172!

172 



"
"Well, lemme see... He spent 48 bucks total, and the CD was 4 bucks. So that means the headphones were 44 bucks, right?  If he didn't get the headphones, he coulda bought a whole lotta CDs with that 44 bucks!  

44 divided by 4... hmm... that's 11 CDs! 


11 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He worked out four hours a week most of the time, right? So that's like, four times eight... thirty-two hours?  But then he did some extra time, five hours for two weeks, so that's ten more hours. And one week he did six hours... so add six more.  

Thirty-two plus ten plus six... that's forty hours! 


40
"
"Okay, so there's 48 folks on the bus. Then 8 get off, that's not so many.  But then a whole bunch more get on, like 8 times 5, that's 40! So now there's a lot, 80 people. Then more get off, 21 this time.  And only a couple get on, like 2. So I think there's 61 left on the bus.



"
"Well, lemme see... Jame's gonna be 27 in five years, so he's 22 now.  And in eight years, he'll be 30. His cousin's gonna be 55 then, 'cause twice Jame's age is 60, and then you take away 5.  So the cousin's 47 now. That means he's 25 years older than Jame. 


25
"
"Hmm, lemme see... He bought a computer for a grand and a hundred, right? And the printer was cheaper by four hundred bucks, so that's seven hundred for the printer.  That's eighteen hundred for the computer and printer together.  So the two monitors cost six hundred bucks.  That means each monitor cost three hundred dollars. 


$300
"
"Well, lemme see...  They split up into two groups, right? So ten kids in each group. Them boys found sixty shells each, so that's a whole lotta shells! Them girls, they found even more, like sixty plus... hmm... four times sixty is... lemme count on my fingers... that's 240! So the girls found 240 plus 60, which is 300 shells!  And since there's ten girls, they each found 30 shells. 


30 

"
"Well, George only got 3 candies left, but he ate 5. So he musta had 8 to start, right?  Nick had double that, so Nick had... lemme see... 8 times 2 is 16!

That's a lotta somethin's!  Let's see... 31 plus 50 plus... uh... 45... and then 62...

*more counting*

That's a whole lotta somethin's!  It's 188!


188 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she makes 72 a month, right?  And she done 18, then 21, then 15...  That's... uh... 54 in total.

So she needs to make 18 more to get to 72. 


18
"
"Well, lemme see...  Half the bill is 25 bucks, right? And she wants me to throw in an extra 10 bucks for the tip? So that's 25 plus 10...  

$35 

"
"Well, lemme see...  They split 18 bucks between three fellas, so that's 6 bucks each. The oldest guy gets 6, then adds 5 more, so he's got 11. Then he gets another 10, so that's 21! But then he spends 8, so he's down to 13.  He triples that, so...  carry the one...  that's 39 bucks!


$39 

"
"Well, lemme see... he wants to save a whole lotta money, that Elvis.  April's got 30 days, so that's 15 days in each half.  He wants to save half his money in the second half, so that's 1125 divided by 2... which is 562.50.  Now, he's gotta spread that over 15 days... so it's 562.50 divided by 15...  

Hmm, that's 37.50.  He gotta save 37.50 every day in the second half.


$37.50 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she buys three apples for a dollar fifty each, so that's... uh... four fifty. Then five oranges at eighty cents, so that's... four dollars. And six peaches at seventy-five cents, so that's... four fifty again.  

So all together that's, uh... thirteen dollars. She gave twenty, so her change is... seven dollars! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Jairus gets more money for each thing he does. He gets 80 cents, and Jenny only gets 50 cents. They both did 20 things... so Jairus gets more, right?  

Let's see... 80 cents times 20... that's 16 bucks! Jenny gets 50 cents times 20... that's 10 bucks.

So Jairus gets 6 more bucks than Jenny.


6 

"
"Well, lemme see...  If Jeff gets four times more than Brad, that's like, a lot more, right?  So, if they split a hundred bucks, and Jeff gets the big pile, he must get, like, eighty dollars.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, so that's 30 pounds gone.  If he weighs 70 pounds now, he musta weighed 100 pounds before.


100 

"
"Well, lemme see... James has 80 toys, and Jonathan wants five times that, so that's 80 times 5, which is 400 toys.  But Jonathan needs two more than that, so he's gotta have 398 toys already.

398 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... five notebooks at a dollar fifty each... that's like, seven fifty, right?  Two pens at a quarter each... that's fifty cents.  Calculator's twelve bucks, and the geometry thingy is ten. So that's, uh... seven fifty plus fifty plus twelve plus ten... thirty dollars!  But wait, they give a discount, ten percent...  That's... uh... three dollars off? So it's twenty-seven dollars!


$27 

"
"Lemme see... five burgers at four bucks a pop... that's twenty bucks. Fries are thirty cents each, so ten of them is three bucks. Drinks are two bucks a piece, so five of them is ten bucks.  

So that's twenty plus three plus ten... thirty-three bucks total.  She gave a fifty dollar bill, so she gets seventeen bucks back.


$17 

"
"Okay, so she sold a bunch of stuff, right?  Let's see... 30% of the first thousand is 300 bucks.  Then she sold another 1500, so that's another 150 bucks.  So, she made 300 plus 150... that's 450!

"Hmm, lemme see... He got two big packs of water, right?  And each pack has, like, a whole bunch of bottles, 24 I think? So that's 2 times 24...  carry the one... that's 48 bottles already.

Now he's got 70 people comin' over, and each one wants two waters. So that's 70 times 2...  that's a lotta water, 140 bottles!

He needs to buy 140 minus the 48 he already got...  that's...  92 more bottles! 


92 

"
"Well, lemme see...  If it takes Ray 16 minutes when it's cold, and twice that plus two more minutes when it's hot... that's a lotta minutes!  

So, three miles in the cold is 16 times 3, which is 48 minutes.  

Three miles in the hot is 34 times 3, which is 102 minutes.

That means it takes him 102 minus 48, or 54 minutes longer when it's hot.


54 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... he makes 2 bucks an hour, works 5 hours a day, so that's 10 bucks a day.  He works 4 days a week, so that's 40 bucks a week. He wants 80 bucks, so that's... two weeks, I think.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she starts with three thousand bucks, right? And she takes out a hundred every month.  That's like, twelve hundred a year, I guess? So two years is... two times twelve hundred... that's two thousand four hundred gone.  So she'd have...  three thousand minus two thousand four hundred...  

Six hundred dollars left.

"Lemme see... they spend three bucks on bread, and that makes ten sammiches. So each sammich costs thirty cents for the bread. Then they spend thirty bucks on cheese and stuff for ten sammiches, so that's three bucks more per sammich.  So each sammich costs three thirty, right?

"Okay, so she burns a lotta calories, right?  Aerobics is 500 each hour, so that's 1000 calories. Runnin' is 600, so that's another 600.  That's 1600 calories total.  She needs 100 ml for every 200 calories, so... lemme see... that's 800 ml! 


800
"
"Hmm, lemme see... so there's a whole lotta jelly beans, right?  

They got red, blue, and green ones.  The blue ones are the most, then the green ones are a little more than the blue, and the red ones are a little less than the blue.

If there's 4500 jelly beans all together, I betcha there's 30 more green ones than red ones. 



"
"Well, lemme see... he starts at 47, then goes up to 52, and then up another 5... so that's 57, right?  

Now, how do we find the average?  Add 'em all up... 47 plus 52 plus 57... that's 156.

Now divide that by 3 'cause there's three numbers... 156 divided by 3 is 52.


52 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so he loses weight with the Cheerios, right? And gains it with the donuts.  So, if he eats donuts for five weeks, that's like, a lotta weight, more than if he eats Cheerios. I think he'd be 2.5 pounds heavier with the donuts. 



"
"Okay, so Alex invited a hundred people, right? And each of them brings two friends, so that's a lotta folks!  That's 200 more people.  Then she calls up some friends, ten of 'em. And eight of those friends are bringin' their wives or husbands. So, lemme see... that's a whole bunch of people!  

318 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... that little Affenpinscher fella was ten pounds. The long Dachshund was twice that, so twenty pounds. That tiny Papillon was a quarter of the Dachshund, so five pounds. And that big ol' Mastiff, he was forty-four times the Papillon...  

That's a lotta pounds!  

220 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... them boots on Amazon are sixteen bucks plus four for shippin', so that's twenty.  eBay's got 'em for thirteen, but shippin's eight bucks 'cause it's double Amazon's. So eBay's twenty-one bucks.  That means they're five dollars more on eBay. 


$5 

"
"Well, lemme see... that beanstalk starts at 4 feet, right? And it gets twice as big every day. Mark's window is way up high, 20 feet. So, it'd be like... 4, then 8, then 16...  Shoot, that's already taller than the window!

3 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He eats 200 grams a day, and that's like two cups, right?  Each cup has 3 grams of somethin' called protein. So, two cups is... 3 plus 3, that's 6 grams a day.  A week is seven days, so... 6 times 7...  carry the one... that's 42!

"
"Well, lemme see... if Jerry's twice as old as he was five years back, that means he's gotta be ten now, right?  So in three more years, he'd be thirteen. 


13 

"
"Okay, so George needs two of them tooth things, right?  Each one costs two thousand bucks.  But one of 'em needs somethin' fancy, like a crown, that's another five hundred. So that's, uh, four thousand plus five hundred... four thousand five hundred.  He already paid six hundred, so he needs... lemme see... four thousand five hundred minus six hundred... that's three thousand nine hundred.

He makes fifteen bucks an hour.  So, three thousand nine hundred divided by fifteen...  Shoot, that's a lot of hours.  Gotta be... two hundred and sixty hours, I think. 


260 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  If one angle is like, double the smallest one, and another is triple the smallest one, that's gotta be a lot, right?  

So, if the smallest one is, say, 30, then the double one is 60, and the triple one is 90.  And 30 plus 60 plus 90 is 180, just like it's supposed to be!

So the biggest angle is 90.


90
"
"Lemme see... he's got a bunch of coins, right?  Let's see... quarters are worth, like, a lotta nickels, so that's good.  And he's got dimes too, those are worth somethin'.  Hmm...  I think he could buy a whole lotta gumballs, maybe like... 69? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Five doggies got four legs each, so that's twenty. Two kitties got four legs each, so that's eight. Ten birdies got two legs each, so that's twenty.  

Twenty plus eight plus twenty...  carry the one... that's forty-eight legs! 


48
"
"Hmm, lemme see... He starts with 8 pounds, then adds half of that, so that's like 4 more pounds.  So now it's 12 pounds, but then he takes 2 away...  That makes it 10 pounds. 


10
"
"Lemme see... he gets 5 games first, then buys one a month for a whole year, so that's 12 more. Plus 5 for Christmas, so that's 22 games.

Then the next year he gets even more, 2 a month, so that's 24 more. Plus 5 for Christmas again, so that's 51 games.

Last year he gets a lot more, 4 a month, so that's 48 more. Plus 5 for Christmas, so that's a whole lotta games, 104! 


104 

"
"Well, lemme see... It goes 1200 miles in 3 hours, right? So that's like 400 miles every hour, I guess.  If it needs to go another 2000 miles, that's a lot more, huh?  

Let's see... 2000 miles... divided by 400 miles an hour...  That's gotta be 5 hours, ain't it?


5 

"
"Okay, so Ruiz makes a lotta chocolate, right?  He does 120 pounds in two hours. That Marissa lady, she's pretty good too. She makes, like, three-quarters of what Ruiz does in an hour.  So if they work all day, which is 12 hours, lemme see...  

*counts on fingers*

They make a whole bunch! It's gotta be over a thousand pounds, I bet.  

...

1260 pounds! That's a lot of chocolate! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He spent 8 bucks one day, then double that the next, so that's 16. Then four times that, so... lemme grab my fingers... 16 times 4 is 64.  

So he spent 8 plus 16 plus 64, which is... carry the one... 88 bucks total.

If he started with 100, and spent 88, that leaves him with... 12 dollars! 



"
"Lemme see... he sold a lotta lemonade! Fifteen cups every hour for four hours, that's sixty cups! And each one was fifty cents, so that's... hmm...  carry the one... thirty dollars! Then he sold ten cups every hour for two hours, so that's twenty cups.  Those were sixty cents each, so that's... twelve dollars!  

Thirty plus twelve... that's forty-two dollars!


$42.00
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He drives a lot, that's for sure.  So the tires go 'round and 'round a whole bunch.  If they can go 'round a whole bunch of times before they're done, and he drives a whole bunch every month...  I reckon it'd take him about 6 years before he needs new tires. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... that big shampoo bottle costs 24 bucks, right? And it says you get a whole lotta washes outta it, like 120 if you use two squirts. But Jackie's only usin' one squirt each time. So, that means she gets twice as many washes, right?  That's 120 times 2, which is 240 washes.

So, if she gets 240 washes outta that bottle, and it costs 24 bucks, each wash costs a dime, right?  'Cause 240 washes divided by 24 bucks is 10 cents a wash.

And since she's only usin' one squirt, each squirt costs a dime too!

40 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Joe's got 50 bucks, right?  That shirt's 25, but it's on sale, so that's cheaper. And the shorts are 35, but they're on sale too.  

Let's see... 25 plus 35 is 60, but it's on sale, so it's less than that.  

I dunno, maybe he'll have like 8 bucks left?


$8.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... he makes four of them dozens a day, right? And each one takes a quarter pound of butter. So that's... uh... one pound a day, I guess?  And a week is seven days... so he needs seven pounds of butter. 


7 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  That's a lotta meters!  So Monica's street is 150, and it costs a whole lotta money to fix it up, like 194 bucks for every one of them meters.  Lewis' street is way longer, like 490 meters.  That's, like, three times longer! So it's gonna cost way more to fix his street.  

Let me count on my fingers...  

...

It's gotta be, like, 65 thousand somethin' dollars more.


$65960 

"
"Okay, so this John guy gets a bunch of money, right?  A hundred thousand dollars for five months.  But then it takes him way longer, like ten times longer! And every month after those first five, he needs more money, like half again as much.  

So, lemme see... that's a lotta months, fifty in total.  And he needs more money for forty-five of 'em.  That's a lot of extra cash!  

Hmm, if it's half again as much, that's like... fifty thousand more each month. So, that's a hundred and fifty thousand dollars every month for forty-five months.  

Let me grab my calculator...  

*fumbles with calculator*

Okay, so that's... seven million, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars!  That's a lot of money for fightin' cancer, huh?



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  One guy ate six ounces, another ate eight little pieces, and the big fella ate a whole pound, which is like, a lotta meat!  That's gotta be... uh... thirty ounces, I think?

93000 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He washes clothes twice a week, right? And each time it uses up a whole lotta water, like 20 big jugs.  Each jug costs him 15 cents.  So, if he washes twice a week, that's... a lot of jugs in a year.  

Let's see...  *counts on fingers*  

I think it's somethin' like... $312. 



"
"Lemme see... she got the tank for ten bucks. Rocks was five bucks, coral was six, fish was ten, and food was two.  

So that's... uh... thirty-three dollars! 



"
"Well, lemme see... it started at 3 inches, then got twice as big, so that's like... 6 inches. Then it grew some more, 4 inches I think?  So that's 6 plus 4...  

10 

"
"Well, lemme see... He sells 15 big ol' kilos every hour, and he works a whole ten hours a day. That's a lotta meat!  That bull's mighty big, 750 kilos, huh?  

Let's see... 15 times 10 is 150. So he sells 150 kilos every day.  

Hmm... 750 divided by 150...  That's 5 days, I reckon. 


5 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa seats, four rows, eighteen in each row... that's a lotta seats!  Some bigwigs sittin' up front, then some parents, then the rest is kids.  

Let's see...  *counts on fingers*  Four rows times eighteen... that's seventy-two!  Then the bigwigs take up...  *counts again* eighteen seats.  So that leaves... *counts some more* fifty-four seats.  Parents take up... *counts again* eighteen.  So that leaves... *counts again* thirty-six for the kids!


**Answer:** 36 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  So each corner has six thingy-ma-bobs with four lights each... and there's four corners... so that's a lotta lights!  But some are busted, twenty of 'em.  

Let's see...  *counts on fingers*  That's gotta be...  44 lights workin'. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... them DVDs can be played a whole bunch of times before they break, right? One's been played a bit, the other not so much.  If you add up how many times each one can still go, that's gotta be the answer.  

1509 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He went twice a week for six weeks, so that's like... twelve times, right? And each time he was there for two hours, so that's twenty-four hours total.  If each hour costs a hundred and twenty-five dollars...  carry the two...  that's gonna be a lot of money!  

Three thousand dollars! 



"
"Well, lemme see... he had 20 sticks, right? And he chews one every couple hours at school, so that's like 4 sticks gone. Then one on the way home and one after dinner, so that's 6 gone total.  Leaves him with 14.  Then he gives half to his sister, so that's 7 gone.  He's got 7 left, I think. 


7
"
"Hmm, lemme see... she's gonna be 16 in 12 years, so that means she's 4 now.  So in 4 more years, she'd be... 8!

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  That baseball coach got 9 baseballs, right? And they cost 3 bucks a pop. So that's... uh... 27 bucks.  

The basketball coach got 8 basketballs, and those are fancy, costin' 14 bucks each. So that's... 112 bucks!

Dang, the basketball coach spent a whole lotta more!  It's like... 85 bucks more, I think.

Nah, gotta be more than that...  

...

72! That's gotta be it! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... ten cars a day for three days, that's thirty cars. Then it was four less each day, so six cars a day.  There's four more days in the week, so that's...  six times four... twenty-four more cars.  Thirty plus twenty-four... that's fifty-four cars! 


54
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He's 40 inches now, and needs to be 48 inches. That's 8 more inches. He grows 2 inches every year, so... that's 4 years!

"
"Okay, so he sold ten cars for twenty-five thousand each, right?  That's a lotta money!  So that's two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.  But the company had to pay somethin' for the cars first, right?  Thirty percent of twenty-five thousand is... lemme see...  That's seventy-five thousand for all the cars.  So they made a hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars profit.  And he gets ten percent of that?  That's... seventeen thousand five hundred dollars!  

 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Big wave, lotsa surfers...  Only some stay up, right?  If a quarter stay up, that's like 25 folks.  And if most of them are ladies, then not so many guys stay up.  I'd say maybe... 10 guys? 


10
"
"Okay, so the diamond thingy is two thousand bucks. The gold one is like, a little less than that, four-fifths of it, so that's... lemme see...  *counts on fingers*  sixteen hundred!  And the silver one is cheaper, four hundred less than the gold, so that's twelve hundred.  

So, all together, that's two thousand plus sixteen hundred plus twelve hundred...  *counts on fingers again*  That's four thousand eight hundred dollars!


$4800 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He got 16 of them snowflake ones. Then he got 3 more of them truck ones, so that's 16 plus 3... that's 19.  And then he got 9 less of them flower ones, so that's 19 minus 9... which is 10.  So he got 16 plus 19 plus 10...  carry the one... that's 45!

"
"Naomi caught a whole lotta fish, seventeen! Darren got way less, like six less than her.  Tommy did better than Darren though, he got three more than him.  So lemme see... that's gotta be fourteen fish for Tommy. 


14 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He pays sixty bucks for ten classes, right?  And his folks say it can't be more than ten bucks a class.  So, if it's more than ten a class, they're done.  

Let's see... ten bucks a class times ten classes is a hundred bucks.  So he can spend forty more bucks before they say no more.  That means he can miss... four classes! 



"
"Well, Jewel does 50 folks a day, and Julie's twice as fast, so she does a hundred.  That's 150 folks a day all together.  A week's got seven days, so that's 150 times 7... lemme see...  carry the one...

So, five apples... that's like a little more than four, so maybe... six dollars? And five oranges... that's more than three, so maybe... six dollars for them too?

Six plus six... that's twelve dollars! 


$12.00
"
"Well, lemme see...  He's diggin' a hole that's six feet long, four feet wide, and three feet deep.  So that's like, a lotta dirt!  If it takes him three seconds to move a chunk of dirt, I reckon it'll take him a while.  

Let's see... six times four times three... that's... uh... seventy-two chunks of dirt.

Seventy-two chunks times three seconds each...  carry the one...  that's two hundred and sixteen seconds!

"
"Okay, so the truck starts at 30,000 bucks.  Then he wants a bunch of stuff, right? The king cab thing is 7500 extra.  Leather seats are, lemme see, a third of that, so 2500.  Runnin' boards are 500 less than the seats, so 2000. And the lights are 1500.

So, add all that up... 7500 plus 2500 plus 2000 plus 1500... that's 13500 in extras.

Now add that to the truck price... 30,000 plus 13500... that's 43,500 dollars for the whole shebang! 



"
"Okay, so he makes 20,000 a month, right? And he gets a raise of 5%, so that's like... 1000 bucks more?  So now he makes 21,000 a month. Plus, he gets a bonus of half his salary, so that's another 10,000! So every month he makes 31,000.

"Okay, so he buys ten fancy suits, right? Those cost a lot, like seven hundred and fifty bucks each!  That's a whole lotta money, seven thousand five hundred already! Then he gets ten pants too, but those are cheaper, like a fifth of the suit price. So, one fifty each, that's fifteen hundred for the pants. And shirts! Three for every suit, so thirty shirts total. Those are sixty bucks a pop, so that's eighteen hundred for the shirts.  

Add it all up, seven thousand five hundred plus fifteen hundred plus eighteen hundred... that's ten thousand eight hundred dollars! Whew!

Let's see... 12 times 4 and a half... that's like 12 times 4, which is 48, and then half of 12 is 6, so 48 plus 6 is 54!  Alisa went 54 miles.

Stanley... 10 times 2 and a half... that's like 10 times 2, which is 20, and half of 10 is 5, so 20 plus 5 is 25.

Now we gotta add 'em up... 54 plus 25... that's 79!

They biked a total of 79 miles. 



"
"Well, lemme see... he digs fast in the dirt, 4 feet every hour. That's a lotta dirt!  He's gotta go through a whole bunch of it, 24 feet. So that's gonna take him... hmm... 6 hours, I reckon.

Now the clay's tougher, he only digs half as fast.  So that's 8 feet of clay, and he's only doin' 2 feet an hour. That's gonna take him 4 hours.

So, all together, it's 6 hours plus 4 hours... that's 10 hours!

"Well, lemme see... he needs two cupcakes for each person, right?  And there's him, the teacher, and all them kids... that's a lotta folks!  Hmm...  25 kids plus him and the teacher... that's 27 people.  So 27 times 2...  carry the one...  that's 54 cupcakes!

Then the next day, they went up to thirty bucks each!  But they had a sale, ten percent off.  So, that's... uh...  six hundred bucks before the sale, and then take off sixty bucks... that's five hundred and forty dollars.

So, five forty minus three ninety-eight...  carry the one... that's one hundred and forty-two dollars more on Wednesday.


**Answer:** 142 

"
"Okay, so she made 400 bucks from the red hats, and that's only half of what she made from the green ones. So the green hats musta brought in 400 times 2, which is 800 bucks.  That means she made 400 plus 800, so 1200 bucks that month.

The next month she did pretty good too, like three-quarters of what she made the first month. So that's 1200 times 3, then cut it in 4, which is 900 bucks.

Altogether, over the two months, she made 1200 plus 900, so that's 2100 bucks! 


2100
"
"Well, lemme see... He gets a free hour, so that's good.  He rides for four hours, but only pays for three. The first one's fifteen bucks, and then the rest get more expensive.  Double the first one, so thirty bucks each.  That's fifteen plus thirty plus thirty...

"
"Well, lemme see... she needs enough for each person to have three of them little egg things, and she's got sixteen folks comin' over. So that's sixteen times three...  carry the one... that's forty-eight of them.  And she needs a whole egg for every two of them little ones. So that's forty-eight divided by two... which is twenty-four eggs. Now, how many dozens is that?  Hmm... a dozen's twelve, right? So twenty-four divided by twelve... that's two dozen. 

2 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 15 pages is a whole lotta writin'! If she done a third of it, that's like... 5 pages, right?  So she gotta write, like, 10 more pages, I guess.

"
"Okay, so he buys a plane for a whole lotta money, right?  150,000 smackeroos! Then he gotta pay 5,000 every month just to park the darn thing. And then he uses twice that much on gas, so that's 10,000 more.  So every month it's 15,000 bucks.  A whole year is 12 months, so that's 15,000 times 12...  carry the one...  that's 180,000.  

Now add that to the price of the plane... 150,000 plus 180,000...  that's a lot of zeros!  330,000 dollars!

 

"
"Well, lemme see... she cooked the rice for 30 minutes, and the pork took 20 minutes longer than that, so that's 50 minutes.  Beans took half the time of the rice and pork together, so that's 30 plus 50, which is 80, and half of that is 40.  So all together, it took 30 plus 50 plus 40...  carry the one... that's 120 minutes! 


120
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Almonds are ten bucks a pound, and walnuts are fifteen.  So, half a pound of almonds is five dollars, and a third of a pound of walnuts is also five dollars. That's ten dollars total for the first one.

The second one is trickier. A fifth of a pound of almonds is two dollars, and the walnuts are still five dollars. So that's seven dollars total.

Ten minus seven... that's three dollars more for the first one.

"
"Well, lemme see...  If each sheep has four legs and each goose has two, and there's 70 legs total... hmm...  That's a lotta legs!  And 20 heads...  Gosh, that's a lot of animals!

"Hmm, lemme see... He gives out 600 papers, right?  And 198 go to one place, and 209 to another.  So that's... a lotta papers!  

If you take those two piles away from the big pile, you get 193 left over.  That's gotta be for the other place!


193 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He goes to class four times a week, and each time it's two hours, so that's like, eight hours a week, right?  And he does that for six weeks, so that's a whole lotta hours... eight times six is... forty-eight!  

He learns a new recipe every hour and a half, so... that's like, thirty-two recipes, I think?


32 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa teachers, huh?  So, most of 'em teach history, right?  That leaves the rest for math.  They sleep a lot, those teachers, six hours a day!  So, if there's sixty math teachers...  carry the one...  that's a lotta sleepin'!  

360 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Aurelia has a hundred and twenty bucks. Kassidy has less, but it's like three-quarters of what Aurelia has. So, Kassidy has ninety bucks. Rayna has even more, like sixty bucks more than Kassidy, so she's got a hundred and fifty.

If they put all their money together, that's a whole lotta money!  It's three sixty bucks!  If they split it even, each person gets a hundred and twenty bucks. 


$120
"
"Hmm, lemme see... four quarters times twelve minutes... that's, uh... forty-eight minutes.  And then they played five more minutes?  So that's... fifty-three minutes total, I guess?


53 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 20 outta 50 is management, so that's like, a bunch. And only some of them are the big bosses...  I think it's 3, yeah, 3 big bosses. 


3
"
"Hmm, lemme see... 5 spoons of flour, plus 3 spoons of sugar, plus a little bit of salt... that's, uh... 8 spoons and a bit more for each one.  So, for 16 muffins, that's a lotta spoons!  Gotta be...  132 spoons, I think. 



"
"Well, lemme see... they got 3 plus 5 plus 4... that's 12 pounds of candy all together.  And there's 3 of 'em sharin'. So, each one gets 4 pounds. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... he buys seven of them A candies, and those are fifty cents each, so that's... uh... three-fifty?  Then ten of them B candies at seventy-five cents... that's... seven-fifty?  So all together it's... eleven dollars.  He gave the man fifteen bucks, so he gets four dollars back.


$4.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she had a lotta good days, then some bad ones, then some in the middle.  Then more good ones...  I think she got two good days left. 


2 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Janey got 21 books, right? And she got, like, a bunch more than Sally.  It says she got 3 more than double what Sally got. So, if we take away 3 from Janey's books, that's 18.  And then, if we cut that in half, that's gotta be how many Sally got. 18 cut in half is 9.

So Sally got 9 books. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... that bamboo grows real fast, huh?  30 inches a day!  It's already 20 feet tall, so that's a lotta inches already...  Gotta be, like, 240 inches, right?  So, to get to 600 inches, that's...  360 more inches it needs to grow.  

If it grows 30 inches a day, that's...  12 days! 



"
"Okay, so James has 4 toys for 4 doggies. Then 8 more doggies come, so that's 12 doggies total. He needs 12 toys, right?

But then, whoa, there's twice as many doggies! That's 12 times 2, so 24 doggies! He needs 24 toys now.

But wait, 3 doggies go bye-bye. So that's 24 minus 3, which is 21 doggies.

He needs 21 toys. 


21
"
"Hmm, lemme see... they put in $1200 all together. Dylan put in a bunch, like, more than half. Then Frances put in a good chunk too. So Skyler musta put in the rest, which ain't gonna be much.  I'd say... $240? 



"
"They got 20 plus 44, that's 64.  They wanna get to 100, so they need 36 more.

36 

"
"Karen makes double what Lorie makes, so she makes 10 times 2 which is 20 bucks an hour.  She works 3 hours a day so that's 20 times 3 which is 60 bucks a day.  Two days is 60 times 2 which is 120 bucks.


120 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... If six spuds make a whole lotta hash browns, then ninety-six spuds gotta make a whole heap more!  I'd say... 576 hash browns! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Eight grown-ups is a lotta weight, that's for sure.  Each one's like, eighty somethin' kilos, right? So that's, like, a whole bunch of kilos.  And Jack's gotta get on too.  That elevator's only supposed to hold so much, though.  I bet they're gonna be over by, like, twenty kilos or somethin'.


20 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Katarina got 68 cookies, and Max got more than her. Cookie Monster got less than Max, and Summer got a whole bunch more than Max.  

Let's see... 68 plus... uh... carry the one...  

*counts on fingers*

They got a lotta cookies, like, almost 300! 


298
"
"Hmm, lemme see... so she made it longer by half, then added some lace...  That's tricky.  If it's 140 now, and she added 20 with the lace, that's 120 before the lace, right?  And half of that would be... 60?  So it was 60 to start?

**60** 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He mows the whole yard in an hour, that's 60 minutes.  Rabbit mode is faster, only 40 minutes. So half the yard in slow mode is 30 minutes, and half in fast mode is 20.  Add those together... 50 minutes! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... they walked for 6 minutes, then another 13... that's 19 minutes total.  They got 30 minutes to get there, so...  that leaves 'em with 11 minutes. 


11
"
"Hmm, lemme see... she buys apples for four bucks, then bananas for two bucks a pound, and she gets two pounds of them... so that's four more dollars. Then oranges, two pounds at three dollars a pound... that's six dollars.  

So, four plus four plus six... that's fourteen dollars! 


14
"
"Let's see... Greta made 30 cookies, and Celinda made a whole lotta more, like double! That's 30 times 2, which is... hmm... 60!  So that's 30 plus 60, which is 90 cookies all together. But they ate some, 10 of 'em. So, 90 minus 10... that's 80 cookies left. 


80
"
"Well, lemme see...  There's two twins, so they're the same age, right? And three triplets, so they're all the same age too.  One twin's older than one of the triplets by 7 years.  If all their ages add up to 44... hmm...  

That older twin must be 13, I reckon. 



"
"Well, lemme see... he's got three things to do, right? Math, readin', and history. That's an hour right there, I reckon.  And he's got three hours 'til dinner. So... that's two hours left for a nap, I guess?  

Two hours is... hmm... 120 minutes! 


120 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... five lollipops and four candies cost three dollars and twenty cents.  Each lollipop is forty cents, so that's two bucks for the lollipops. That leaves a dollar twenty for the candies. So each candy is thirty cents.

Now, ten lollipops would be four bucks, and ten candies would be three bucks.  That's seven bucks total!


$7.00 

"
"Hmm, let me see... Rong saves 20 coins every month, right? And Neil saves more, like, a lot more.  

It says Neil saves 2/5 more... that's like, a little more than half of Rong's coins, I think. So maybe Neil saves, like, 30 coins a month?

They save for ten years, so that's a long time!  

*counts on fingers*

Twenty coins a month times twelve months is 240 coins a year.  And ten years is... 2400 coins for Rong!

Neil saves more, so he's gotta have, like, way more than that.

*scratches head*

This is hard! I dunno, maybe they have, like, a whole bunch of coins?  Like, more than 5000? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... two shots at twenty bucks a pop, that's forty right there.  Then that heartworm thingy is, what, sixty percent of the whole shebang?  So, that's gotta be... uh...  carry the one...  

He ends up payin' sixty-four bucks.  If he had a hundred and twenty-five, that means he's got... sixty-one dollars left over. 


$61
"
"Lemme see... so you got them bananas, apples, and oranges all in one box, right?  

Them apples are fifty cents each, and the bananas are a dollar 'cause they're double the apples. Them oranges are fancy, they're three bucks a pop!

So you got five bananas, that's five bucks. Twelve apples, so that's six bucks. And seven oranges, so that's twenty-one bucks.

Add it all up, and that's thirty-two bucks for the whole box.


$32.00
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  She got a bunch of red squares, then some more blue ones, then even more green ones, and then less white ones...  That's a lotta squares!  I dunno, maybe... 68? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... 42 grownups and 15 little ones... that's a lotta folks!  She got 8 tiny chairs, and those big chairs are five times more... so that's 40 big ones.  That's 48 chairs total.  But she needs one for each person, right?  So 57 people minus 48 chairs... she needs 9 more chairs! 


9 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Half of 50 deer is 25, right?  And 20 percent of them bucks is...  uh...  that's like, a fifth, right? So 25 divided by 5 is... 5!

5 

"
"Okay, so lemme see... Adam's got 50, Betty's got more than him, like way more, she's good.  Marta's got a bunch too, and Tom's got less than Betty.  They need 400 to go on a trip, but they don't have enough yet.  Hmm...  I think they need like, a lotta more points.  

145 



"
"Well, lemme see... She got three kids, and they each got three little ones.  So that's nine of 'em, right? And then each of them got three more little ones...  So that's a whole lotta babies!  Gotta be... 27, I think. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Greta gets 2400 bucks, right?  She saves half of that for later, so that's 1200 gone. Then she spends some on her car, like 480 bucks, I think?  So, that's 1200 plus 480... that's 1680 she spent.  

If she started with 2400 and spent 1680, she's got 720 left over. 


$720.00
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Twenty pencils, but four are gone... that leaves sixteen.  Two pencils make a pair, so...  I think there's eight pairs.


8 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... They got a whole lotta fireworks, fifteen boxes with twenty in each... that's a bunch!  And Hannah sees, like, forty percent of 'em, so that's... a lot less.  Then she shoots off her own, three boxes with five each... so that's more fireworks!  

Let's see...  *counts on fingers*  

I think she sees... 135 fireworks! 



"
"Okay, so there's Aiden and his buddies, right?  That's a whole lotta folks, like twenty of 'em. They each get two drinks and three of them snacky things.  So that's a bunch of stuff to buy!  If each drink and snack costs two bucks, lemme see...  carry the one...  that's gotta be two hundred dollars, I think.


$200 

"
"Let's see... Gissela's truck holds 4000 pounds, and Gordy's is bigger by 800, so that's 4800.  Together they got 4000 plus 4800, which is 8800 pounds.  That means Gary's truck must hold the rest, so 11600 minus 8800...  

That's 2800 pounds!


2800
"
"Well, lemme see... 

There's 8 fellas, right? And they each ate one more than the ladies.  The ladies ate 3 each, so the fellas ate 4.  That's 8 fellas times 4 dumplings... hmm... carry the one... that's 32 dumplings.

Now the ladies ate 6 times 3, which is 18 dumplings.

So, all together, that's 32 plus 18...  

50 dumplings! 



"
"Well, lemme see... they split a hundred bucks, right?  Gerald got more 'cause he had the bigger number.  He spent ten on a book, so he's gotta have less now.  Hmm...  I'd say he's got about fifty bucks left.


50 

"
"Well, lemme see... that cat's real speedy, huh?  If it goes 15 feet in a second, that turtle's gotta be way slower.  Hmm... 15 split by 5... that's 3. So the turtle goes 3 feet every second.  Now, 40 seconds times 3 feet...  carry the one... that's 120 feet! 


120 

"
"Well, they need to raise a whole lotta money, like six thousand three hundred bucks! They already got two thousand one hundred, so that's good.  Hmm, lemme see... if they get seven hundred bucks every hour, how many hours is that?  

Let's see... six thousand three hundred minus two thousand one hundred... that's four thousand two hundred.  

Four thousand two hundred divided by seven hundred...  carry the one... that's six hours! 


6
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Colorado City takes a big chunk of the river water, right? Like, 40%. And most of that, they use for factories and stuff, 'bout 80%. So, that leaves... not much for other things, I guess.  

I'd say maybe... 8%? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  She makes twelve bucks a day, and there's seven days in a week, so that's... eighty-four dollars a week.  Two weeks is double that, so...  

168 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they make a lotta ice cream, that's for sure.  Two hours for a hundred quarts of chocolate, and four hours for fifty quarts of vanilla...  

If they keep goin' for, like, two whole days, that's a lot of ice cream!  Gotta be...  3000 quarts, I reckon. 



"
"Lemme see... five croissants at three bucks a pop... that's fifteen.  Then four of them cinnamon things at two-fifty each... so that's ten.  Three of them quiche things at four bucks... twelve bucks. And thirteen of them blueberry muffins at a dollar each... thirteen bucks.  

So that's fifteen plus ten plus twelve plus thirteen... that's fifty bucks.  But he gets ten percent off 'cause he's got that fancy card.  

Hmm... ten percent of fifty... lemme see... that's five bucks off.  So fifty minus five... that's forty-five bucks.


$45.00 

"
"Well, lemme see...  Ice cream's a dollar fifty a scoop, and she gets one free if she buys two.  So, three scoops is four fifty, and she's got six bucks.  She could get three scoops! 


3 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they both start with a hundred, right? Ginger eats more candy each day, so she's gonna have less left. Amy eats less, so she'll have more.  I think Amy has 14 more pieces than Ginger after two weeks. 


14 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He needs 24 tiles for every one of them square foot thingies. And his bathroom's got 36 of them. But he only wants to do two outta three of it. So... that's like...  24 times 24, I think?  

576 

"
"Well, lemme see... he paid 20 bucks just to get in, right? And then it's a dollar fifty for each pound of them blueberries. He got 30 pounds, so that's... carry the one... 45 bucks for the berries.  Plus that 20 bucks to get in, that's 65 bucks total.

Now, if he bought 'em at the store, it's 2.50 a pound. So 30 pounds times 2.50... that's 75 bucks!

So he saved 10 bucks by pickin' 'em himself.


**Answer:** 10 

"
"Well, lemme see... they wanted 500 computers, right? And each one was gonna cost 700 bucks. But then the price went up by 10%, so that's like... 70 extra dollars each. So now each computer is 770 bucks.  

If they buy 500 of them at 770 bucks a pop, that's...  *counts on fingers* ... 385,000 dollars! 


$385,000
"
"Lemme see... six eggs, that's a lotta eggs!  Eggs is like, seventy-five each, so that's a whole bunch of calories right there. Cheese is a hundred and twenty per ounce, and he used two ounces, so that's more calories. And the ham, that's forty per ounce, and he used two of them too.  

So, uh...  lotsa calories! I'd say, like, seven hundred and seventy, maybe?


770 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... six pencils at fifty cents each... that's three dollars. And eight erasers at a quarter... that's two dollars. So that's five dollars total.  If I gave 'em a ten dollar bill, I should get five dollars back.


$5.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... So a hundred folks want the Google job, right?  Only some get to talk to 'em, then even less get the job, and even *less* take it.  

I reckon... two people end up takin' the job. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... She gave away 3 sacks plus 4 sacks, that's 7 sacks.  Each sack has 25 of them kilos, right? So, 7 times 25...  carry the one... that's 175 kilos!


175 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she got 3 of them Coco Crunch things and 5 of them Fruit Loops... that's a lotta cereal!  She got 4 last week, so...  I think she got 4 more this week.

"
"Well, lemme see... Helga's a fast one, huh?  She taps her feet real quick, like a hummingbird's wings!  

So, she taps 300 times with one foot and 250 with the other, that's a whole lotta tappin'!  But then she slows down when she puts her arms up, only 200 taps each foot then.  

She dances for 5 minutes, but only holds her arms up for 2 of them.  

Gosh, that's a lot of numbers!  Let me count on my fingers...

*counts on fingers for a long time*

Hmm, I think she taps her feet a total of 2450 times. 


2450
"
"That pothole's a real pain!  If he fixes it himself, he spends $120 on that fine thingy and then needs three of them buckets of goo for $25 each. So that's $120 plus $75, which is $195.  But if he don't fix it, his car's gonna cost him $450!  So he saves... lemme see... $450 minus $195...  

$255 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... they had a bunch of chairs, right?  Some for grownups and some for the little ones.  They took some to the fix-it guy, so now there's less.  

I think they got... 160 chairs left. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... five pizzas, that's a lotta pizza! Each one has twelve slices, so that's...  *counts on fingers* sixty slices total.  Bryce and two buddies ate most of theirs, like, two-thirds of it. That's a lot! And the other two guys ate, uh, three-quarters of theirs.  

So, how much is left?  *scratches head*  I dunno, maybe... eighteen? 


18
"
"Hmm, lemme see... the cat takes 30 minutes to eat them sausages, right? And the dog's faster, so it takes less time...  two-thirds of 30... that's like, 20 minutes, I think. So, together that's 30 plus 20, which is 50 minutes.  

Now, to find the average... that's like splittin' it in half, so 50 divided by 2...  

25 



"
"Well, Topher's shoe is mighty big, like, a whole lotta inches!  It's 8 feet and 4 inches, so that's gotta be, like, a hundred inches, right?  

Now, Bobby's shoe is way smaller.  It says Topher's is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's.  Hmm... so if we take away 10 inches from Topher's shoe, that's like, 90 inches.  And that 90 inches is 9 times the size of Bobby's shoe.

So, Bobby's shoe is 90 inches divided by 9... which is 10 inches!

 
10
"
"Well, lemme see... she broke a quarter of the student cars, so that's like, 64 divided by 4, which is 16 cars.  And each of them has 4 windows, so that's 16 times 4, which is 64 windows. Then she broke 3/4 of the teacher cars, so that's 3/4 of 32, which is... hmm... lemme see... 24 cars. And those have 2 windows each, so that's 24 times 2, which is 48 windows.  So, all together, she broke 64 plus 48 windows... which is 112 windows! 


112
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  She got a whole lotta thread!  Let's see...  Blue thread... that's the light blue and the dark blue, right?  So that's 15 plus 45... that's 60 spools of blue.  

Out of all her thread, 60 of 'em are blue.  That's gotta be...  a lot!  I'd say... 40%?  Yeah, 40% sounds about right. 


40
"
"Hmm, lemme see... So, they started with a whole lotta folks, right? Five thousand! And by lunchtime, a bunch had voted, like, two outta every five.  That's a lot! Then more voted by four o'clock, two outta every three of the ones left.  

So, I reckon there's gotta be, like, a thousand folks still waitin' to vote, maybe?


1000 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He chews 4 a day, and that's for 30 days... so that's a lotta gum!  A pack has 15, right?  So, I guess he'd need like... 8 packs? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  They need enough for all them kids and grownups to get their s'mores.  Let's see... nine kids want two each, so that's... uh... eighteen! And six grownups want one each, so that's six more.  So that's twenty-four s'mores in all.

Each box has enough for eight s'mores, so they need... three boxes! 


1 

"
"Dora's fifteen, right? Her daddy's way older, like, double her age plus some more.  Maybe thirty-eight? And her momma's a little younger than him, so maybe thirty-four?  

So, fifteen plus thirty-eight plus thirty-four... that's a lotta years!  Gotta be eighty-seven, I think.


87 

"
"Well, lemme see... twenty bucks split between four kids... that's like... five bucks each, right? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Two books weigh two pounds each, so that's four pounds. Then there's a four pound book and a three pound book.  And the history book is double the three pound one, so that's six pounds.  

Alrighty, four plus four plus three plus six...  That's seventeen pounds! 


17 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... A got 20 votes outta 100, right? And B got way more than that, like, half again as much. So that's like... 20 plus another 10, so 30 votes for A and B together.  That leaves 70 votes for C, I reckon.


70 

"
"Boris has a whole lotta apples, a hundred! Beck's got way less, like, 23 less.  Then Boris gives Beck some, ten of 'em.  Hmm, lemme see... I think Beck still has less, but not by as much.  Maybe... 3 less?


3 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... he uses 4 ounces for the big ones, and he makes 3 of those, so that's 12 ounces gone. Then the medium ones are 2 ounces each, and he makes 7, so that's another 14 ounces.  And the little ones are only half an ounce, and he makes 8, so that's 4 more ounces.  

Altogether, that's 12 plus 14 plus 4, which is 30 ounces.  He started with 32, so he has 2 ounces left. 


2 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Clara's got a whole lotta books, twenty of 'em! Steven's got way less, but Alice has more than him.  If Clara's got double Steven's, that means Steven's got ten.  Alice has six more than Steven, so she's got sixteen.  That means Clara's got four more books than Alice. 


4 

"
"Well, lemme see... a gallon's five bucks, and that's two dollars more than a half-gallon, so a half-gallon's three bucks.  Ten gallons is fifty bucks, and sixteen half-gallons is... hmm... carry the one... forty-eight bucks.  So, all together, that's... ninety-eight dollars! 


98
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Fifty kids in the class, right? Ten like bakin', five like shootin' hoops... that leaves a bunch for video games and music.  If ten like music, 'cause that's double the basketball folks, then...  

...that means twenty-five like video games! 



"
"Well, lemme see... He scared off some birds, right?  So there's less than 12. Then more came, so it's gotta be more than what was left.  I'd say there's 'bout 28 birds now. 


28 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 80 kids in two classes, that's 40 in each class, right?  And 40% are girls... so that's like, a lotta girls.  If 40% are girls, then the rest gotta be boys.  So, 40 minus... somethin'...  

Let's see...  *counts on fingers* ... 24 boys in each class! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... She had two pieces, then got three more... that's five! Then she had a whole bunch more, fifteen I think?  She ate some, then her friend took some...  I dunno, maybe eight?


**Answer:** 8 

"
"Well, lemme see... she's got a whole lotta critters to groom!  Eight doggies, five kitties, three birdies, and a dozen horses... that's a lot!  If she does 'em all this week, that's seven days... so I guess she'd do 'bout four a day? 


4 

"
"Okay, so he buys three packs of cards for, like, a lotta money, right?  1800 bucks each, so that's... lemme see... 1800 times 3... 5400 bucks!  

Then he gets two good cards, one for 4000 bucks and one for a thousand.  So that's 4000 plus 1000... 5000 bucks!

He also gets a bunch more cards, 30 of 'em, and they're worth 50 bucks each.  So that's 30 times 50... 1500 bucks!

So he made 5000 plus 1500... 6500 bucks!

But he spent 5400 bucks first, so he made 6500 minus 5400...  1100 bucks profit!


$1100
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Two grownups at twenty-six bucks a pop, that's fifty-two. Two kids at twelve bucks, that's twenty-four more. So that's seventy-six dollars total for the first place.

The second place is fourteen for the grownups, so twenty-eight bucks. Ten for the kids, so twenty more. That's forty-eight dollars.

Seventy-six minus forty-eight...  That's twenty-eight dollars they save! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He sells a whole lotta tomatoes, 500 a day!  And he's gettin' 'em cheaper now, that's good.  He used to pay 50 cents each, now it's 40 cents. So he saves 10 cents on every tomato.  That's 500 tomatoes times 10 cents...  carry the one... that's 50 bucks a day!  And a week's got 7 days, so he saves 50 times 7...  

$350 



"
"Well, lemme see... Sean's got 56, right? And Carl's got four times that, so that's like 56 times 4... hmm... lemme count that out on my fingers...  That's 224! And Cal's got double Sean, so that's 56 times 2... which is 112.

And a month has, what, four weeks? So that's 500 times 4...  2000 chairs a month!

Now, two months is just double that, so... 2000 times 2...  

That's 4000 chairs!

"
"Well, lemme see... they got 33 folks votin', and twice as many liked the new rule than didn't.  Hmm... that's a tough one...  

Let's see... if we split 'em in half, that's 16 and a half each way. But we need twice as many for the ""yes"" side... so it's gotta be more than 16...

I reckon it's 22! 



"
"Lemme see... so she needs 11 of the littlest shirts. Then double that for the next size up, so that's 22.  Then 4 less than that is... lemme count... 18.  Half of that is 9. And then 6 more than that is... 15.  

So, 11 plus 22 plus 18 plus 9 plus 15...

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Jayden has seventy bucks, and his sister gives him some more...  That's ninety split in half, so forty-five more dollars.  So he's got seventy plus forty-five, which is a hundred and fifteen.  But the camera costs two hundred, so he needs...  Eighty-five more dollars!

"Lemme see... Leila got three cucumbers, and they's two dollars each, so that's six bucks. Jack got five tomatoes at a dollar each, so that's five more. And Chase got one lettuce for three dollars.

"Hmm, lemme see... George got 200 bananas, right? And he got more pears, like, way more.  He got 45% more pears... that's a lot!  So, if we add them all up, it's gotta be a whole bunch of fruit. I'm thinkin' it's gotta be close to 500 fruits, maybe even more!


490

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they sold 5 of each of them vanilla ones, so that's 5 times 4, which is 20.  And they sold 2 of each fruity one, so that's 2 times 8, which is 16.  

20 minus 16 is... 4!

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Anthony had a whole bunch of pencils, right? He gave half to Brandon, so that's like... 25 gone. Then he gave some more to Charlie, like, three-fifths of what was left.  That's gotta be...  10 pencils left for Anthony, I think.

He's gonna have 276 wheels left over.

"Hmm, twenty percent off a thousand dollar laptop... lemme see...  That's like, two hundred bucks off, right? So it'd be eight hundred dollars. 



"
"Okay, so Mike's got a lotta movies, right?  Six hundred!  A third of 'em are in those sets, like all the Star Wars ones or somethin'.  Those are cheaper, like six bucks less than a regular movie.  Regular movies are ten bucks, so those sets are four bucks each.  

Then there's some old movies, like, forty percent of the rest. Those are five bucks each.  

So, lemme see... two hundred movies in sets, times four bucks... that's eight hundred bucks.  Then, four hundred movies left, and forty percent of those are old, so that's, uh... one sixty movies times five bucks... that's eight hundred bucks too!

And the rest are regular price, so two forty movies times ten bucks... that's two thousand four hundred bucks.

Now, add it all up... eight hundred plus eight hundred plus two thousand four hundred... that's, uh... three thousand eight hundred sixty-six dollars and sixty-seven cents.

"Lemme see... he got six pounds of them peaches at two dollars a pound... so that's twelve bucks. Then he got eight pounds of plums at a dollar a pound, so that's eight more. And six pounds of them apricots at three dollars a pound... that's eighteen bucks.  

So, twelve plus eight plus eighteen...  carry the one... that's thirty-eight dollars! 



"
"Well, lemme see... they drove for a long time, like 6 hours, and went 50 miles every hour. So that's a whole lotta miles already! Then they walked for an hour and a half, but slower, like 20 miles every hour.  

So, 50 miles an hour times 4 and a half hours is... hmm...  carry the one... that's 225 miles! And then 20 miles an hour times an hour and a half is 30 miles.

Add those together, and that's 255 miles!

Ava's better at jumpin' on them bad guys, and she gets more berries too. But Emma finishes faster.  

Hmm... I dunno, it's hard to say who'd win without knowin' how many bad guys they jump on and stuff. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got four pizzas for sixty-four bucks, and two of 'em cost thirty dollars already.  So that leaves, uh... thirty-four dollars for the other two.  If they cost the same, that's... seventeen dollars each!

"
"Well, lemme see... Bob had some orange and white fishies, right? He got a bunch more from the store.  Now he's got twice as many orange ones. Hmmm...  That means he musta bought a whole lotta white ones to make the orange ones double the white ones.  I'd say he bought 4 white fishies. 


4 

"
"Well, lemme see... he drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home, so that's 10 miles a day.  He does that five days a week, so that's 50 miles total.  If his car gets 10 miles to the gallon, he's usin' 5 gallons a week.  Gas is 3 bucks a gallon, so that's...  carry the one... 15 dollars. 


$15
"
"Hmm, lemme see... ten twenties is like ten times twenty dollars, so that's two hundred bucks. And she spent three-fifths of that, so that's... uh...  carry the one...  that's a hundred and twenty dollars. Now, them quarters... one hundred and forty quarters is... lemme see...  that's thirty-five dollars. So, all together, she spent...  two hundred minus eighty... plus thirty-five...  that's a hundred and fifty-five dollars!


155 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... he got 5 tomato plants and each one gives him 22 tomatoes, so that's a lotta tomatoes!  Then he got 8 eggplant plants and each one gives him 4 eggplants.  So, that's a bunch of eggplants too!  Let's see... 5 times 22 is...  carry the one... 110 tomatoes! And 8 times 4 is... 32 eggplants.  Now we gotta add them together... 110 plus 32...  that's 142!

142 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so they sold a bunch of TVs, right? Some fancy ones, some old ones, and some in the middle.  If they sold 40 in total, and a quarter were the fancy ones and an eighth were the old ones... that's gotta leave a lot for the middle ones, huh?  

I'd say they sold 'bout 25 of them middle ones. 



"
"Well, lemme see... the trip costs three hundred bucks, and the school's payin' half, so that's a hundred and fifty.  John's got fifty, so he's still short a hundred.

"
"Well, it's mighty cold at night, that's for sure.  If it's 45 degrees in the day and 33 degrees colder at night, that's only 12 degrees!  Gotta get that fire goin'!  It takes about 5 degrees to warm things up with each log, so I reckon he needs 4 logs to keep them pipes from freezin'.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... ninety folks gotta split into groups of nine, so that's ten groups, right?  Some of 'em, like three outta every five groups, brought back two seashells each person.  So, six groups brought back shells.  Each group had nine folks, so that's... uh...  carry the one...  

108 seashells!

"
"Well, lemme see... she makes 20 bucks an hour, right? And she worked 8 hours, so that's 20 times 8, which is 160 dollars.  But she worked 3 extra hours, so that's 3 times 20... hold on... 3 times 20 is 60.  But wait, they said somethin' about gettin' paid more for those extra hours...  It's like, 50% more, I think? So that's 60 plus half of 60, which is 30. So that's 60 plus 30, which is 90.  

Now we gotta add that to the 160 from the regular hours... so 160 plus 90 is... 250! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Twelve lady lions, that's a lotta lions!  Half that many boy lions, so that's six. And fourteen little baby lions, aww!  Let's see... twelve plus six plus fourteen...  That's a whole bunch of lions!  Thirty-two!

"Hmm, lemme see... they start with 200 folks, and add 20 more each month, so that's like... 60 more after three months, right?  So 260 people in total.

"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa kids, lotsa teachers, each kid gets a tree, teachers get two...  That's a lotta trees!

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 30 hours is a lotta time!  Half an hour a day for two weeks... that's like, 14 days, right? So that's 7 hours. Then two hours a day for a whole week, so that's another 14 hours.  

That's 21 hours total... so she needs 9 more hours.

"Hmm, lemme see... so there's a bunch of kids, right? Some passed, some didn't.  

Third grade, lotsa kids passed, like, more than half. Fourth grade, not so much. Fifth grade, they did pretty good, way better than fourth.

If you add up all the kids who passed, and then divide that by all the kids, I betcha that'll tell ya how many passed overall.

...

I think it's 70%. 



"
"Well, lemme see... he's got two bags o' them shiny bits, right? And each bag has a whole lotta 'em, like 72. So that's 72 times 2, which is... uh... 144 shiny bits.

Now, he needs 12 bits for every inch, and his mosaic thingy is gonna be 3 inches tall. So that's 12 times 3... which is 36 bits for every inch.

Hmm... 144 bits divided by 36 bits per inch...  that's gotta be 4 inches long! 


4 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they had 10 quarts left, and some folks drank a bunch.  Four drank a quart and a half each, so that's like 6 quarts gone. Then 16 folks drank 2 quarts each, so that's 32 quarts!  

That's a lotta tea!  So 6 plus 32 is 38 quarts they drank. Add the 10 left over, and that's 48 quarts total.  

Now, how many gallons is that?  I know there's 4 quarts in a gallon... so 48 divided by 4...  

That's 12 gallons! 


12 

"
"Well, lemme see... He had a hundred, then sold a bunch more, so that's...  carry the one...  He needs to sell fifty more.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got 35 marshmallows, right? And they each made 9 s'mores, so that's 18 s'mores total.  They dropped some on the ground too, so there's less now.  I guess they could make like, 7 more s'mores each?

"Okay, so Jack plays for a long time, 20 minutes for a quarter. His buddies, they ain't so good, so they only get half that, 10 minutes. But one of 'em's a real whiz, he gets to play 30 minutes! They play for 4 whole hours, that's a lotta time!  

Let's see... Jack uses 12 quarters, the bad guys use 24 each, so that's 48 quarters total. The good guy uses 8. Add 'em all up, that's 68 quarters.

Now, each quarter's a quarter, right? So 68 quarters is... lemme see... $17.00! 


$17.00

"
"Well, lemme see... Joe's got twice the cars as Robert, and Robert's got 20. So Joe's got 40 cars. He sells some, like, 20% of 'em, that's 8 cars gone. Then he gives his mama twice that, so that's 16 more gone.  

Hmm, 40 minus 8 is 32, then 32 minus 16 is... 16!

Joe's got 16 cars left. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got a hundred and seventy-five thousand bucks, and some big shots gave fifty thousand. So that leaves...  a lotta money from the kids.

"
"Well, lemme see... she walked for 8 hours one day, and then half of that the next, so that's 4 more hours.  That's 12 hours total.  Now, there's 60 minutes in an hour, so 12 times 60...  carry the one... that's 720 minutes!


720 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He started with 50 cars, then saw 20 more, so that's 70 cars. But then half of 'em left, so... that's like 35 cars gone.  So there's 35 cars left.

35 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... he does 30 of them things a day, and each one has 5 little jobs that pay a buck twenty each. So that's like... 6 bucks a pop, right?  And he does that 30 times, so that's... uh... carry the one... 180 bucks a day!  Now, if he does that for a whole week, seven days, that's...  180 times 7...  

1260 bucks! 



"
"Well, Sasha got 14 points the first time. Then she did worse the second time 'cause it was at Julie's place. Julie got 10 points the first time, so Sasha only got 4 the second time.  So, 14 plus 4... that's 18 points!

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she got a lotta cans of food. Eight of them cat ones, and each one has eleven cans inside. So that's a whole bunch of cat cans! Then she got six of them dog ones, and each of them has six cans.

That Becca must have a lot, probably 'round 153 cards, I reckon. 



"
"Let's see... she had 5 green ones, and then double that in blue, so that's 10.  Then one less pink than blue, so 9 pink. And then a third of the pink ones in yellow, so 3 yellow.  

That's a lotta eggs!  5 plus 10 plus 9 plus 3...  

27! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... that book cost her 32 bucks, right? And she only gets some of that back, like 3/4 of it... so that's, uh... 24 bucks back?  Then there's that shippin' thing... 35 cents a pound, and it's a heavy book, 4 pounds... so that's a buck forty. Plus, it's far away, 20 miles, and they charge 8 cents a mile... so that's another 1.60.  

Altogether, that's 3 bucks for shippin' and 8 bucks she loses... so she's out 11 bucks?

"Hmm, lemme see... she makes a lotta TikToks, like, almost 20 a week. And those are four minutes each, so that's a bunch of time right there. Plus she sings, which takes two whole hours! And don't forget the makeup, she does that every day, takes like, a quarter of an hour.  

So, if she does all that every week for a whole month, that's gotta be, like, a lot of hours. I dunno, maybe like... 18 hours? 



"
"Okay, so she gotta pay the $129 first, right?  Then she got two extra mirrors, so that's another 30 bucks. One more chandelier is 15 more. And dang, 10 more pictures is 150 bucks!  

Let me add that up...  

129 plus 30 plus 15 plus 150... that's 324 dollars!


$324.00
"
"Well, lemme see... Eva's got 20 bucks. Anthony's got 10 more than her, so that's 30 bucks. Roy's got 40% more than Anthony... hmm... that's like, a little more than a third more, right? So, Roy's gotta have...  around 42 bucks, I reckon.


$42.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Pompei lifts one inch, right? Saskay lifts way more, like twelve times more! So that's twelve inches. Kagiyami's even stronger, four times more than Saskay, so that's... uh... forty-eight inches! And Naruto, he's the strongest, ten times stronger than Kagiyami... so that's... forty-eight times ten...  uh... four hundred and eighty inches!

But that's in inches, right?  My buddy Joe says there's twelve inches in a foot. So four hundred and eighty divided by twelve...  that's forty feet!

40 

"
"Well, lemme see... He goes 8 miles every hour, right? And he rides for 4 hours, then a bit more.  So that's 8 times 4... which is 32. Then he rides for 6 more hours, so that's 8 times 6... which is 48.  

Now we gotta add those together... 32 plus 48...  

That's 80 miles! 



"
"Well, lemme see... Three kangaroos takin' 18 hours, huh? That's a long time!  If you got four turtles goin' half as fast, it's gonna take 'em way longer.  I'd say... maybe... 27 hours?  Turtles ain't exactly known for their speed, ya know?


27 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Kora made 20, and Rory made 20 more than that, so Rory made 40.  Jada made twice as many as Rory, so she made 80.  If you add them all up, that's 20 plus 40 plus 80...  That's 140 dishes! 



"
"Well, lemme see... the laptop's four hundred bucks after she trades in her old one. She got a hundred and fifty from her job, and her momma's givin' her eighty.  She still needs fifty more, so she musta had... fifty dollars in her purse already. 


$50
"
"Hmm, lemme see... He cut up three big apples, and those make a lotta slices, like five each. So that's fifteen slices right there. Then he did five little apples, and those make three slices each, so that's fifteen more.  He ate fifteen, so... that leaves fifteen slices left, I think. 


15
"
"Well, lemme see... he gets 5 jugs from each cow, and he's got 3 cows, so that's 15 jugs already. He wants 25 jugs, so he needs 10 more jugs.  That means he needs 2 more cows 'cause each one gives 5 jugs.


2 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  They got three glue sticks, right? One's almost gone, one's got a good chunk left, and the other's in the middle.  If they was brand new, they'd be 12 millimeters long.  So, gotta figure out how much ain't used up...

Let's see...  That's 10 millimeters, plus 4, plus 6...  

That's 20 millimeters! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He needs ten thousand for the car and eight hundred for the phone... so that's, uh... ten eight hundred?  

He's got five thousand from work and two hundred from his brother... so that's five two hundred...

Ten eight hundred minus five two hundred...  carry the one... that's five six hundred!

He still needs five six hundred dollars. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... She gave him four of them twenties, so that's like eighty bucks, right? And the hat was seventy... so she got ten dollars back, I think.


$10
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Two twenties is forty bucks, right?  Those squirt guns are two dollars a pop, so that's twelve bucks. And the water balloons are three bucks each, so that's nine bucks.  

Forty minus twelve minus nine...  That's nineteen dollars left!


$19
"
"Okay, so Jack got 60 dishes, right? And he got twice as many dishes as socks, so he musta had 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter's got double the socks Jack has, so that's 30 * 2 = 60 socks for Peter.

Peter's dishes are half of Jack's, so he's got 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Altogether, they got 60 + 30 = 90 socks and 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.

That means they got 90 + 90 = 180 socks and dishes all together. 


180
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Twenty kids in the class... Five are good at just numbers, eight are good at just talkin' fancy... So that's thirteen kids right there.  That leaves seven who must be good at both, I reckon.  So, twelve kids are good at numbers, I think.


12 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... two hours is a long time, right?  So, each group gets ten minutes, and there's a ten minute break.  That means there's, like, a hundred and ten minutes for the groups.  So, a hundred and ten divided by ten... that's eleven groups! 


11
"
"Hmm, lemme see... she puts in 300 bucks, right? And every year she gets, like, 3/4 of that back? So that's 225 bucks extra each year.  Three years of that is...  carry the one... 675 bucks!  So she's got her 300 plus the 675... that's 975! 


$975
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  They got lotsa shirts, some white, some with flowers. Some white ones got collars, some don't. Some flower ones got buttons, some don't.  

I think... there's more flower shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars.  I'd say... 10 more. 


10 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He got 900 eggs, and each tray holds 30... so that's... uh... 30 trays full.  And he sells each tray for 2.5 bucks... so that's 30 times 2.5...  

Carry the one...  

That's 75 dollars! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He had 55 on one farm and 45 on the other, so that's a whole lotta goats! He sold some from each farm, 10 from one and then double that from the other...  That's 20 goats, right? So now he's got less goats, but how many?  

Let's see... 55 minus 10 is 45, and 45 minus 20 is 25.  So that's 45 goats plus 25 goats...  

That's 70 goats left!


70 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He buys two shoes every month, right? And that adds up to, like, a whole lotta money in a year.  If he spends 2640 bucks on shoes every year, and he gets 24 pairs, that means each pair costs...  about a hundred and ten dollars, I guess?


$110 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Three green baskets is 75 bucks, right?  'Cause they're 25 each.  And the red ones are 18, but you get 2 bucks off each one, so that's... lemme see... 16 each?  So three of them is 48 bucks.  

So, 75 plus 48... that's 123 bucks! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... 90 rooms, and they gotta clean half... so that's like 45 rooms, right?  Each room takes 20 minutes, so...  that's a lotta minutes!  Let's see... 45 times 20...  carry the one...  that's 900 minutes!  Now, how many hours is that?  There's 60 minutes in an hour, so... 900 divided by 60...  that's 15 hours!

15 

"
"Well, lemme see... they build twelve houses the first year. Then they build a whole lotta more the next year, like three times as many, so that's... uh... thirty-six more?  So that's forty-eight houses already! Then the third year they build double what they got, so that's like... ninety-six more?  

So, all together, they build a whole bunch, like a hundred and forty-four houses! 


144
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

So, you're younger than your brother by a few years, older than your sister by a couple. Your momma's a bit older, like three times your brother's age, but not quite. And all of you add up to 87 years?

Gosh, that's a lot of numbers!  

Let me think... I'd say you're probably 'bout 11 years old. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... 27 kids times 2 glue sticks each... that's a lotta glue sticks!  They come in packs of 8, so...  I guess he'd need like, 7 packs?  Yeah, 7 packs should be enough. 


7 

"
"Well, lemme see... It started with 4000 gallons, then doubled to 8000 'cause of the rain. Then it went up by another 6000... so that's 8000 plus 6000...  

14000 

"
"Well, lemme see... ten folks get sick, and each one makes six more sick every day. So, that's like... a whole lotta folks gettin' sick real fast!  After three days, I betcha it's gotta be, like, a whole bunch!  

Maybe... 3430? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Forty people gave Rafaela twenty bucks each, so that's...  *counts on fingers*  eight hundred dollars! Julieta got a little less, like ten percent less, so... that's eighty bucks less. So Julieta got seven hundred and twenty.  If you add those together... that's fifteen hundred and twenty dollars!


$1520 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... She had 12 oranges, gave 2 each to her three girls, so that's 6 gone. Then her boy got 3, so that's 9 gone in total.  That leaves her with 3 oranges. 


3
"
"Well, Claire gets one shiny badge every month, right? Amber's slower, takes her twice as long, so she only gets one every two months.  Wendy's a real go-getter, she gets three badges every month!  So in a whole year, Wendy's got a whole bunch more than Amber.  Let's see... Wendy's got 3 times 12, which is 36 badges. Amber only gets 6.  That means Wendy has 30 more badges than Amber. 


30 

"
"Okay, so she bakes bread for five hours, right? Two breads each hour, that's ten breads. Each bread has eight slices, so that's eighty slices all together.  Each slice is fifty cents, so... lemme see... eighty times fifty cents...  

That's forty dollars! 


$40.00
"
"Hmm, lemme see... She got 70 shiny gold ones, and 30 more than that in silver... so that's like... 70 plus 30...  that's a hundred!  So she got a hundred coins all together. 


110 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  600 burritos, 50 kids, 10 each... that's 500 burritos right there.  Plus the teacher ate 20, so that's 520 gone.  600 minus 520...  that leaves ya with 80 burritos leftover. 


80
"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got 12 red ones, and 2 less green ones... so that's 10 green.  Then they got 3 times the green ones in blue... so 30 blue ones!  That's a lotta cars!  12 plus 10 plus 30 is... 52.  

So if they got 75 in total, that means they got 23 yellow ones. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... They got 85 books all together, right? Sofie's got a bunch more than Anne, and Anne's got less than Fawn.  

Gosh, this is tricky...  I think Fawn must have... 28 books! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... She got 5 pounds of them regular potatoes, and the sweet ones were twice that, so that's 10 pounds.  Then them carrots, they was 3 pounds less than the sweet ones... so that's 7 pounds. 


7 

"
"Well, lemme see... 30 kids times 4 cups each... that's a lotta jello!  Hmm, 1 box makes 10 cups... so he needs...  carry the one...  12 boxes!  And each box is a buck twenty-five... so that's...  12 times 1.25...  

$15.00 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Five phones at seven hundred bucks a pop... that's a lotta money!  So he gives the guy four thousand...  

Let's see...  *counts on fingers*  Four thousand minus three five hundred... that's five hundred bucks back!


$500 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they spend 400 bucks a month, right? And Madeline pays most of it, like 60 bucks outta every 100. So Keenan pays the rest, which is like 40 bucks outta every 100.  That means he pays 160 bucks a month, I think.  Now, there's 4 weeks in a month, so he pays 160 divided by 4...  

That's 40 bucks a week. 


$40
"
"Hmm, lemme see... sixty pieces, huh? He ate a bunch the first day, like, more than half. Then ten more the next day.  And then some more on the third day, but I dunno how much 'cause it was some weird fraction.  

Let's see...  *counts on fingers*  

I think he ate...  48 pieces? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Seven sodas cost 21 bucks, so one soda's gotta be 3 bucks, right? And four waters cost 8 bucks, so one water's 2 bucks.  Three sodas would be 9 bucks, and two waters would be 4 bucks.  So, all together, that's 13 bucks.


$13.00
"
"Hmm, lemme see... David has twelve dollars and forty-eight cents.  Those bolts are real cheap, only three cents each.  So sixteen of 'em would be... uh... carry the one...  That's forty-eight cents for all the bolts.  

So, if he spends forty-eight cents, he'd have... twelve dollars left. 


$12.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she makes 33 bucks for 3 hours, right? So that's like... 11 bucks each hour. If she walks dogs for a whole lotta hours, like 12, that's 11 times 12...  carry the one...  that's 132 bucks!


$132 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Paul had some marbles, then got more, then lost some...  

He started with 52, got 28 more, so that's 52 plus 28... which is 80!  

Then he lost a quarter of 'em...  A quarter of 80 is 20, I think.

So he had 80 and lost 20... that leaves him with 60 marbles.


60 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so she gets most of the easy ones right, like 8 outta 10 of them little bubble ones. And almost all the true or false, like 18 outta 20.  But them long answer ones, she only gets 3 outta 5.  

So, uh, if each little bubble one is worth one point, and the true/false too, that's 8 + 18 = 26 points. And them long ones are worth 5 points each, so 3 times 5 is 15.

Add it all up, 26 + 15 = 41 points!


41 

"
"Well, lemme see... he wants to make two thousand bucks, right? And he's sellin' them chickens for fifty bucks a pop.  He's got a whole lotta chickens, three hundred, but he's only sellin' some of 'em, like, three outta every five.  So that's, uh...  carry the one...  one eighty chickens he's sellin'.  

That's one eighty times fifty... hmm... nine thousand dollars! But he wants to make two thousand on top of what he paid for 'em. So he musta paid seven thousand for all them chickens.


$7000 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Julie sold a bunch, 14 I think. Them boys sold the rest, so that's like... 32 minus 14...  that's 18 glasses for both of 'em.  So each boy sold 9.  Julie sold 5 more than Micah, I reckon.


5 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she spent four hundred on her hair, that's a lot! Then a quarter of that on her nails, so that's a hundred. And then three quarters of the nail price on her toes, so that's seventy-five.  

Altogether, that's... uh... four hundred plus a hundred plus seventy-five...  

Five seventy-five! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... She gets 20 times 2 dollars, that's 40 bucks. Then she spends 20 times 1.5 dollars, so that's 30 bucks.  

40 minus 30... that's 10 dollars left! 


$10
"
"Well, lemme see... she's gonna be 18 in 10 years, so she's 8 now.  Three times 8 is 24, so she gotta wait 'til she's 24. That's another 16 years.

16 

"
"Lemme see... she got five packs o' bacon for ten bucks, so each pack's two dollars.  Chicken's twice that, so that's four bucks a pack. She got six of them, so that's twenty-four dollars. Strawberries are four bucks a pop, and she got three, so that's twelve bucks. Apples are half the price of strawberries, so they're two bucks a pack. Seven packs is fourteen dollars.  

So, all together that's ten plus twenty-four plus twelve plus fourteen, which is sixty dollars. If she had sixty-five bucks, she got five dollars left. 


$5
"
"Well, lemme see... she played for 65 minutes, and that extra 15 minutes at the end was a bonus, right? So, take that away, and it was 50 minutes long.  But that was double her normal show, so her regular shows are 25 minutes. 


25
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Argo had a bunch of toys, right? He gave a lotta them away.  Let's see... 200 minus 40, that's... uh... 160. Then he gave away more... 160 minus 80... that's 80. Then 30 more gone... 80 minus 30... that's 50!

50 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they make a whole lotta chimichangas!  Tuesdays and Wednesdays they make 125 each day, so that's 125 plus 125, which is 250. And on Fridays, they make double, so that's 250 times 2, which is 500!  

So they make 500 chimichangas on those three days. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He's got 50 of them singin' thingamajigs, right? And a fifth of 'em don't fit.  That's like, 10 of 'em, I reckon. So he's got 40 left.  If you put two together, that's 20 pairs.

20 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Six birds in the bushes... then some more flyin' around, that's like, four more I guess. And then a bunch more eatin', like, a whole lotta birds!  I dunno, maybe thirty-four? 


34 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... She had 55, ate some... that leaves... uh... 50!  Then she split 'em up... 5 jars... so that's... 10 in each jar, I think. 


10
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Those daisies sure are pretty with all their petals.  I think... I think the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. 


15
"
"Hmm, let me see...  Mrs. Smith has a whole lotta plants! A quarter of 'em are inside, so that's like, 25, right?  Then, most of the rest are outside, so that leaves not so many for flowers.  I'd say maybe a quarter of 'em are flowers too? 


25 

"
"Well, lemme see... that whatchamacallit thing spins real fast, like 121 meters a second! And it goes eleven times faster than that other thingy, the thingamabob. So the thingamabob is goin' slower, right?  And the whirligig is five times faster than that thingamabob...  

Hmm...  I think the whirligig goes 55 meters a second. 


55
"
"Hmm, lemme see... she buys two carrots, a salad for six bucks, and a yogurt. Yogurt's half the price of the salad, so that's three bucks.  So the salad and yogurt together cost nine dollars. That leaves two dollars for the carrots.  Two carrots for two dollars... gotta be a dollar each, right?


$1 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, so that's like... 40 hours a week, right? And they gave him a raise, so now he makes $12 an hour.  So, 12 times 40...  carry the one... that's $480! 


$480
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Tasha made 80 bucks, right? And she mowed lawns for some folks. Joe paid her 6 bucks each time.  But she mowed Kamala's lawn a bunch more times than Joe's, and Alba's even more than Kamala's.  

Gosh, I dunno how much she made from lemonade.  I'm not good with numbers like that. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Martin weighs 55, and Carl's bigger by 16... so Carl's 71.  Then Christian's 8 more than Carl, so he's 79.  Harry's 5 less than Christian, so that makes him... 74! 

74 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He rents it out ten times a month, for three hours each time, so that's thirty hours total.  And he gets twenty-five bucks an hour, so that's... thirty times twenty-five...  carry the one... that's seven hundred and fifty dollars! But his car payment is five hundred, so he makes... two hundred and fifty dollars profit! 


$250
"
"Martha got 5 more notebooks, and now she has 7.  That means she had 2 before.  Joseph had 6 notebooks, 'cause he had 3 times what Martha had at first.  So Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph.


1 

"
"Well, Dijana rowed 50 miles, and Anis rowed a bit more, like, a fifth more. So that's like... 10 more miles, right?  So Anis rowed 60 miles.  If you add them together, that's 110 miles! 


110
"
"Well, lemme see... she bakes a hundred cookies, right? But her hubby eats some, so there's less.  Six nephews, so ya gotta split 'em up.  Hmm...  I think each nephew gets sixteen cookies. 


16
"
"Well, lemme see... Denise read ten pages one day and then, like, fifteen more the next day. That's a whole lotta pages!  Daniel only read thirteen pages, so Denise read way more. I think she read fifteen more pages than him.


15 

"
"Well, lemme see... he's got enough for four big bowls or eight little bowls, right?  He and his wife are big bowls, and the kids are little bowls. So that's two big bowls gone, and two little bowls gone. That leaves four little bowls left for the kids. So each kid gets two bowls! 


2 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... five notebooks at a dollar fifty each... that's like, seven fifty, right?  And the pen's fifty cents. So, seven fifty plus fifty cents... that's eight dollars!


$8.00
"
"Hmm, lemme see... she makes four little masks with two yards of stuff, so that's... half a yard per mask.  Twenty little masks would be...  ten yards!  

And the big ones, she uses two and a quarter yards for three, so that's...  about three quarters of a yard each. Eight big ones...  that's six yards.

So, ten plus six...  that's sixteen yards she needs. 


16
"
"Hmm, lemme see... she saw nine movies three times each, so that's a lotta movies!  And she spent 216 bucks...  

Let's see...  carry the one...  

Eight dollars a ticket! 



"
"Well, Harold sleeps a whole lotta time, ten hours! Then he works, but not as much as he sleeps, like two hours less. And he walks his dog for a bit too, one hour.  Hmm, lemme see... that's a lot of time gone already.  So if there's 24 hours in a day, and he's sleepin' and workin' and walkin' for most of it... I guess he's got like 5 hours left to do whatever he wants. 


5
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Tim had seven blue boxes and nine red boxes. He took three blue ones fishin' and, uh... a third of his red ones, so that's three red ones too.  So he used up six boxes total.  That leaves him with... ten boxes left.

10 

"
"Well, Sarah has 9 books, and Joseph has double that, so that's 9 times 2, which is 18. But then he lost some, 2 of 'em. So he's got 18 minus 2... lemme see... that's 16! 


16
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Dean had 30, gave 6 to Jamie, and then 10 to Donald...  That's a lotta marbles goin' out!  So, 30 minus 6, that's 24... then minus 10 more...  

14 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Duncan's sixty now, so eight years ago he was fifty-two.  That's twice as old as Adam was four years ago, so Adam was twenty-six then.  That means Adam's thirty now.  In eight more years, he'll be thirty-eight! 


38 

"
"Well, lemme see... Farmer Brown's got 200 acres, right? And Smith's got, uh... twice that's 400, and then some more... 500! So, all together, that's 200 plus 500...  

700 

"
"Well, lemme see... he makes 20 cents for each thingy he puts in a box, right? And he does, like, 40 of them each hour 'cause he don't do as many as 50. So that's 8 bucks an hour.  And if he works all day, that's 8 hours times 8 bucks...  

That's 64 bucks! 



"
"Well, lemme see... he drinks one bottle every half hour, right? And that hard sudoku takes him, like, an hour and a half, times four... so that's six hours, right?  

Six hours times two bottles an hour... that's twelve bottles! 


12 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He throws two at the red ones, and three at the yellows...  He used 58 pieces all together, and 20 were red...  So that's 40 pieces for the red ones...  That leaves 18 for the yellows...  If he uses 3 for each yellow, that's gotta be 6 yellow balloons.


6 

"
"Well, he drives a hundred miles a day, and a month has thirty days, so that's three thousand miles a month, right?  And he needs a tune-up every thousand miles... so that's gotta be three tune-ups. 


3 

"
"Well, lemme see... He works five hours on Tuesday, then double that on Wednesday, so that's ten hours. Then Thursday he works two hours less than Wednesday, so that's eight hours.  

Five plus ten plus eight...  carry the one... that's twenty-three hours! 


23
"
"Well, lemme see... they got a cake for 11 bucks, some balloons for, uh, lemme count... 3 bucks, and two ice creams for 7 each, so that's 14 more bucks.  That's 11 plus 3 plus 14, which is 28 bucks total.

So their momma musta given 'em each 14 bucks. 



"
"Kira got a bunch of fruit, see? Apples, bananas, and oranges.  Lola ate some, but there's still a lotta fruit left.  I'd say... twelve? 


12 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... six playin' tennis, and double that playin' volleyball... so that's twelve more.  Then there's a whole bunch playin' soccer, sixteen boys and twenty-two girls...

"
"Hmm, lemme see... thirty kids sellin' lollipops at eighty cents a pop, and they each sold ten... so that's... uh... three hundred lollipops!  

They made two-forty outta that, but they spent a buck fifty on the lollipops themselves.  So, two-forty minus a buck fifty... that's ninety bucks!

"Lemme see... he's got 3 kitties, and 3 times that many doggies, so that's 9.  Then he's got 2 less bunnies than doggies, so that's 7 bunnies.  Fish are 3 times the bunnies, so that's 21 fishies. And his gerbils are 1/3 the fishies, so that's 7 gerbils.  

Add 'em all up... 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets!

"
"Well, Abby eats two slices a day, and Josh eats a whole lotta more, like double! So that's four slices for him.  Together, that's six slices gone every day.  Hmm, a loaf has 24 slices... so that's... four days, I reckon!

"
"Well, lemme see... she starts at 5 and goes to 10, so that's 5 years.  And she gets one a month, so that's like... a whole lotta shells!  Hmm... 5 times 12 is 60.  

60 

"
"Well, lemme see... she got 27 cups and makes 3 rows, so that's 9 cups in each row.  And she puts the same amount of chamomile and mint in each row... so that's gotta be 4 and a half cups of each.

4.5 

"
"Well, lemme see... he goes up and down twice in 8 hours, right?  So that's 24 berries split in half...  

12 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... They got a big ol' pool with lotsa water, right?  They take half of it to fill up a tank. Then they use some of that water every day for their garden.  If they use 500 gallons a day for 6 days, that's a lotta water gone!  

Let's see... 500 times 6...  carry the one... that's 3000 gallons gone.  So if they started with 5000 gallons, they got 2000 left.


2000 

"
"Well, lemme see... Colby's got a hundred and fifty bucks for movies, right? He already spent some on movies and snacks, but I ain't good with all them numbers.  He wants to see a movie tonight, get some popcorn and candy, and that'll cost him twenty bucks. So, I guess he can see just one more movie.


1 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so he bakes a lotta those little rolls and muffins, right?  Those big ones are packed with calories, but these are mini, so they gotta be less.  

If a big roll is 600, a little one is 200. And a big muffin is 450, so a little one is 150.

He made 200 little rolls, so that's 200 times 200... which is 40,000.

And 300 little muffins times 150... that's 45,000.

Add those together, and you get 85,000 calories! 


85000
"
"Well, lemme see... she got 39 on Monday, then double that on Tuesday and Wednesday, so that's 39 times 2, which is 78.  Then she did that again on Wednesday, so that's another 78.  Then she got 48 on Thursday and 57 on Friday.  

Let's see... 39 plus 78 plus 78 plus 48 plus 57...  carry the one... that's 300!

Now, how many days was that?  One, two, three, four, five...  

300 divided by 5 is... 60! 


60
"
"Hmm, lemme see... the bus goes real fast, like 60 clicks an hour for 5 hours. That's a ways! The car's slower, 30 clicks an hour for 8 hours.  So the bus went further, gotta be... 60 miles more, I reckon.


60 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... She got 31 blocks, plus 8 fuzzy things, and 9 rings... that's a lotta toys!  She got 62 in all, so that means there must be... 14 bouncy balls! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... so they're all together 100 years old, right? And Paul's a bit older than John, by 10 years.  Peter's age is like, Paul and John's ages added up.  

That means Peter must be 50! 



"
"Let's see... Maria gave her friends 2 balloons each, and she had one. So that's 8 for her friends plus 1 for her, makin' 9. Then her momma gave everyone 3 more.  So that's 3 times 5 people, which is 15 more balloons.  Add those together, 9 plus 15, and you get 24 balloons! 


24
"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got 10 folks givin' 5 boxes each, so that's a whole lotta boxes!  Plus they got 10 more...  Shoot, that's a lot of stuff!  They can fit two boxes on each table, and they already got 15 tables...  

They gonna need a bunch more tables, I reckon.  Probably 'bout 15 more, I'd say. 


15 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Zoey spits forty seeds ten feet each, so that's... uh... four hundred feet! Sydney spits thirty-five seeds twelve feet each, so that's...  uh... four hundred and twenty feet!  

Altogether, that's eight hundred and twenty feet.  

So, I guess the average is... four hundred and ten feet? 


410 

"
"Well, lemme see... that Widgeteer thing makes a whole lotta widgets, like 60 every hour! The other one, the WidgetMaster, only does 45.  And each widget sells for 6 bucks, right?

So, if the Widgeteer runs all day and all month, that's a lotta widgets!  I bet it makes way more money than the other one.  Gotta be at least... hmm... a whole bunch!  

I'd say...  64,800 more dollars! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... so he stays for, like, almost a whole day, right?  But he don't wanna pay for the whole day.  He stays 17 hours, but the first 12 are cheaper.  So that's 1000 pesos for the first part. Then it's 70 pesos for each extra hour, so that's 5 extra hours times 70 pesos... that's 350 pesos more.  So all together it's 1000 plus 350... that's 1350 pesos.  

But if he paid for the whole day it would be 1600 pesos. So he saves... 1600 minus 1350...  

He saves 250 pesos! 



"
"Lemme see... them goats eat 5 pounds each, and there's 15 of 'em, so that's 75 pounds right there. Them sheep, they eat a bit less, somethin' like 7 pounds each, and there's 12 of 'em... so that's 84 pounds.  Add those together, and you get 159 pounds of hay. 


159
"
"Hmm, lemme see... He makes 50 bucks an hour and worked 6 hours, so that's 300 bucks. Then he spends 50 on gas, so he got 250 left.  He buys pencils for 50 bucks, so now he got 200. He puts 100 in the bank, so he got 100 left.  Those pens cost 25 bucks each, so he can buy 4 of them.

"
"Lemme see... Craig spelled a whole bunch of big words, twenty of 'em, and each one had fifteen letters. That's a lotta letters! His brother did good too, he had fifty more letters than Craig.  So, gotta add up all them letters...

"Hmm, lemme see... 8 kids in a line, 7 lines... that's a lotta kids! And there's 5 schools doin' it?  Gosh, that's gotta be... a whole bunch!  I'd say... 280 kids, maybe? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  That teacher's got a lotta juice!  Nine of them coupon things, and each one gets ya a hundred bottles... so that's a whole bunch!  Then she gives each kid two bottles...  Let's see... 29 kids times two bottles...  That's... uh... a lot.  

So she started with a whole bunch, gave away a bunch, and now she's got...  I dunno, maybe like... 842 bottles left?  Could be more, could be less, I ain't good with numbers.


842 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... forty bucks to come over, plus thirty-five bucks for every hour, and she was there for two and a quarter hours...  that's like two hours and fifteen minutes, right?  So that's seventy bucks for the workin'.  And then sixty bucks for the stuff she needed.  

Forty plus seventy plus sixty...  carry the one... that's one hundred and seventy-eight seventy-five! 


$178.75
"
"Okay, so he buys ten of them music thingies, right?  And they cost fifteen bucks each, so that's a lotta money, like a hundred and fifty dollars! But then they's on sale, forty percent off, so that's like... uh...  somethin' less.  Then he sells some back, five of 'em, for forty bucks each, so that's two hundred bucks!  So he made some money, I think?  

Let's see...  two hundred minus the hundred and fifty... that's...  a hundred and ten bucks!


$110 

"
"Lemme see... she got six yams at a dollar fifty each, so that's... hmm... nine dollars. Then ten sweet potatoes at two bucks a pop, that's twenty. And four carrots at a dollar twenty-five, so... five dollars.  

Add it all up, nine plus twenty plus five... that's thirty-four dollars! 


$34.00
"
"Okay, so this fella James is swimmin' across a big ol' lake, right? Twenty miles! That's a long way. He swims pretty good, two miles every hour. He goes for a while, like, sixty percent of the way, then takes a break on a little island. He rests for half the time he was swimmin', then gets back in and finishes the rest.  

Hmm, lemme see... that's a lot of figurin'.  I think it took him seventeen hours to get across. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Sam had 70 loaves, and the bakery has way more, like seven times more... but then they got 40 less...  

So, it's gotta be a big number... lemme count on my fingers...  

450! That sounds about right. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... She had fifteen, then lost some...  That's less now, right?  But then she got more...  I think she has thirteen stickers left. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... so he sells them papers, right? Ten percent of the five dollar ones, that's... uh... fifty cents each, so six of them is... three dollars! And the other ones, he gets twelve cents on each, so ten of them is... a dollar and twenty cents each, so that's twelve bucks!  

Three plus twelve... that's fifteen dollars! 



"
"Well, Deanna's 26, and Marcus is 5 years younger than her, so he's 21.  Leo's twice as old as Marcus, so that makes him... lemme see... 21 times 2 is 42!


42 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Bahati got the most points, right? And he got 20 more than Azibo.  So Azibo got less than Bahati.  Dinar got even less than Azibo.  They all added up to 45 points...  

I think Azibo got 5 points. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  If a whole bunch of pages make up an inch, and the book's an inch and a half thick... that's gotta be a lotta pages!  I'd say... 150 pages! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... he staples 30 papers every 15 minutes, right?  And he works a long time, from morning til night, that's like... a whole lotta time!  

If I had to guess, I'd say he staples a whole bunch, maybe like... 1800 papers? 



"
"Well, lemme see... She sleeps from 10 at night till 6 in the mornin', that's a long time, right?  So that's like, 8 hours.  But she got up in the middle of the night, so gotta take some time off.  And she woke up early too, so even less sleep.  Hmm... I'd say she probably slept for, like, 7 hours and a bit?  Maybe around 420 minutes? 



"
"Well, lemme see... He's got two dozen cups, that's like, a whole lotta cups, right?  Two dozen is, uh... twenty-four!  And he's got two-thirds that many spoons, so that's... hmm... sixteen spoons.  Then he gives away six spoons, so he's got ten left.  

So, he's got twenty-four cups and ten spoons, that's... thirty-four things! 


34 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so they got a big ol' hospital with a thousand beds, but only a fifth of 'em are full. That's like, 200 beds, right?  

Then they're bringin' in 50 new folks every day.  Two weeks is fourteen days, so that's 50 times 14...  carry the one... that's 700 more people!

So now they got 200 plus 700... that's 900 beds full.  

That leaves 100 beds empty. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Sixteen emails a day, huh? Seven are for work, so that leaves nine.  Two-thirds of them go to family, so that's... six?  That means three go to her boyfriend. 


3 

"
"Well, lemme see... that little Aliya is 3, right? And Shawna's like, three times older than her, so Shawna's gotta be 9.  Shawna's daddy's way older, like five times older than Shawna... so that's 45! 


45
"
"Well, Courtney said there were 48 people, but Kelly said she was off by a bit. Kelly said Courtney counted too high by 20%.  Hmm, so if Courtney counted 48, and that's 20% too high, then there musta been less than that.  I'd say about 38 people were there. 


38 

"
"Well, lemme see... Jason had 2 balls.  Jeffrey had less than Jason, so maybe just 1? And Jordan had more than Jason, so maybe 4?  That's 1 plus 2 plus 4...  

7 

"
"Well, they dug a whole bunch of holes, see?  First day, ten. Then thirteen more. Then eight. But they filled in two 'cause they kept fallin' in! So that's... lemme see... thirty-one minus two... twenty-nine holes.

The map said there was four times as many holes by the time they found the treasure as there was after the first day. So... twenty-nine holes divided by four... hmm... that's gotta be 'bout seven holes on the first day.

So they dug twenty-two more holes on the fourth day! 


22 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Amora and Lainey got 70 chips each, so that's 70 plus 70, which is 140.  Then Collins got more, 15 more, so that's 140 plus 15...  carry the one... that's 155! 


225 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so he spends 400 bucks on stuff, right? And the tickets cost way more, like half again as much... so that's like... another 200 bucks, I guess?  So the tickets are 600 bucks.


$600
"
"Okay, so they caught a whole bunch of Pokemon, right?  339 of 'em!  Alex got more than Stan, and Stan got less than Adelwolfe times four, but not by much.  Hmm... lemme see...  

Stan musta caught 147 Pokemon. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  20 minutes per show, and half that many shows... so that's like, 10 shows, right?  And 10 shows times 20 minutes each...  carry the one...  that's 200 minutes!


200 

"
"Well, lemme see... she flies south for a right long time, then back north a bit, then south again.  That's a lot of flyin'!  

I reckon it's gotta be... 374 miles. 



"
"Okay, so Greta made 12 brownies, then got 6 more.  Her friends had a bunch, like 48!  Then they ate some, like 18.  Hmm... lemme see... that's a lotta brownies!  

Let's see... 12 plus 6 plus 48... that's 66!  Then take away the 18 they ate...  

That leaves her with 48 brownies! 



"
"Hmm, Nani's eight, right? His brother's older, twice as old, so that's sixteen.  His sister's younger, like, a couple years less than Nani, so maybe six?  

So, eight plus sixteen plus six... that's thirty! 


30 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He's got a lotta racquets to do!  

Let's see... 3 with that gut stuff, that's 3 times 15...  carry the one... that's 45 minutes.

Then them polyester ones, 5 of 'em, times 22... that's a lotta minutes, 110!

And the fancy ones, 4 times 18...  that's 72.

Now we gotta add all that up... 45 plus 110 plus 72...  

*counts on fingers*

That's 227 minutes!  Whew! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He buys two phones at full price, that's 600 times 2, so 1200 bucks. Then the other two are half price, so 600 divided by 2 is 300 each.  So those two are 300 times 2, which is 600.  Add those together, 1200 plus 600... that's 1800 dollars!


$1800 

"
"Well, lemme see... Carlton's team has 13 fellas, and Zeke's got 7 more than that, so that's... 20 fellas on Zeke's team.  Now, if ya add 'em all up, 13 plus 20... that's 33 players in total!


33 

"
"Well, lemme see... he's got a fence that's fifteen feet long and ten feet wide, right?  So that's like, a whole lotta fence! And he needs two of them wood things for every foot.  Hmm...  

*counts on fingers*

That's a lotta wood things, gotta be a hundred, I think! 


100 

"
"Well, lemme see... she had a whole bunch of oranges, right? Twelve boxes! Then she gave some away, like four boxes.  So that leaves her with eight boxes. She kept a couple for herself, so she sold six boxes.  Each box has twenty oranges, so that's...  carry the one...  six times twenty is a hundred and twenty oranges! 


120 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... America's got a whole lotta states, right?  Like, way more than we do.  India's got a bunch too, but not as many.  I think if you add 'em all up, it's gotta be... a lot! Maybe like... 79? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He needs eighteen bucks for that dictionary thing, thirteen for the dinosaur book, and eight for the cookin' one. That's, uh... thirty-nine dollars all together.

He's got fourteen bucks already, so he's short twenty-five.  If he makes five bucks an hour, he gotta work five hours to get that much. 


5 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Robert's got a whole bunch o' cherries, thirty! And Richard's got ten less than him, so that's twenty.  That leaves ten for Jerry.  Robert's got twenty more cherries than Jerry, I reckon.


20 

"
"Okay, so Sunny sold gingerbread and apple pie, right?  

On Saturday, he sold ten gingerbread. Apple pie, he sold less of those, four less than the gingerbread. So, six apple pies.

Sunday, he sold more gingerbread, five more than Saturday, so that's fifteen gingerbread. And fifteen apple pies too.

Gingerbread's six dollars a box, apple pie's fifteen.  

Lemme see... ten gingerbread on Saturday is sixty dollars. Apple pies, six times fifteen is ninety dollars. That's one hundred fifty dollars on Saturday.

Sunday, fifteen gingerbread is ninety dollars. Fifteen apple pies is two hundred twenty-five dollars. That's three hundred fifteen dollars on Sunday.

So, all together, one fifty plus three fifteen... that's four sixty-five dollars! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she uses a whole bottle every two days, right?  So eight days is like four bottles. 


4 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... the blue car's a hundred bucks, right? And the red one's cheaper, like, way cheaper.  Forty percent cheaper... that's a lotta cheaper!  So the red one's gotta be, like, sixty bucks?  So both together, that's a hundred plus sixty...  

$160 

"
"Okay, so Emil's gonna be 24, right? And that's when he's half his dad's age, so his dad's gonna be 48.  And Emil's gonna be twice as old as his brother then, so his brother's gonna be 12.  

But we want to know how old they are *now*.  Emil's 19 now, so his dad's 43 (cause 48 minus 5 is 43) and his brother's 7 (cause 12 minus 5 is 7).

So, 43 plus 7 is 50.


50 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Mama gave her 20 shiny beads. Her sister gave her some more, 10 more than Mama, so that's 30. And her friend, she gave her double what Mama did, so that's 40.  

Now, if you add all them up... 20 plus 30 plus 40... that's 90 beads! 


90
"
"Well, lemme see... Joe got 3 pounds on Thursday, then 3 times that on Friday, so that's 3 times 4, which is 12 pounds.  Then half of that on Saturday, so 12 divided by 2 is 6 pounds.  That's a whole lotta crawfish!  So, 3 plus 12 plus 6 is 21 pounds.  If each servin' is 3 pounds, he got 21 divided by 3, which is 7 servings. 


7 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 30 kids in the class, and 20 outta them play football. So that's 6 kids.  Then, some of the rest are cheerleaders or in the band, like, a quarter of 'em.  That's gotta be another 6 kids. So, 6 plus 6...  

12 kids are leavin' early. 



"
"Well, lemme see... Sophie's got size five boots, and Charlie's are way bigger, like five times bigger! So that's, uh... 5 times 5...  that's 25!  

So Charlie's got size 25 boots. Now, if you add them together, that's 30. And then you gotta split that in half 'cause there's two of 'em. 30 split in half is... 15!

15 

"
"Okay, so Pat's got this flower bed, right? It's real long, like a hundred somethin' feet.  And she wants to put flowers all in it.  Each flower needs a little space, like a foot and a half, and she already has some flowers.  

Let's see... she needs to buy more flowers, and each one costs six bucks.  Hmm...  I'm not so good with numbers, but I bet it's gonna be a lot of money!  

I think she'll spend...  $162. 



"
"Well, lemme see... Edgar eats a whole lotta pretzels, eighteen a day! His brother eats half that, so that's like... nine pretzels a day.  A week's got seven days, so nine times seven... hmm... carry the one... that's sixty-three pretzels! 


63 

"
"Lemme see... she needs 3 of them flower things and 2 of them vine things for each basket.  So that's 5 baskets times...  carry the one...  that's 15 flower things and 10 vine things.  Now, the flowers cost 3 bucks each, so that's 45 bucks. And the vines are 2.50 each, so that's 25 bucks.  Add those together...  that's 70 bucks!


$70.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got 30 pounds of dirt, right? Sunflowers take a lotta dirt, 3 pounds each, and they're plantin' 4 of 'em. So that's 12 pounds gone already. Carnations ain't as thirsty, only 1 and a half pounds each, and they got 10 of those. That's 15 pounds more.  So that's 12 plus 15, that's 27 pounds gone.  Leaves 'em with 3 pounds for roses. Each rose needs 1 pound, so they can plant 3 roses. 


3 

"
"Well, lemme see... she makes two thousand bucks a month, right? And she saves a quarter of that for shoes, so that's five hundred dollars.  Now, them shoes cost a grand a pop, so... she could buy six pairs a year. 


6
"
"Well, lemme see... she peels 'em six at a time, so 90 shrimp... that's... uh...  carry the one...  15 minutes for peelin'.

Cookin's a bit trickier. She does 30 in 10 minutes, so 90... that's three times as much, so three times the time... 30 minutes.

So, 15 minutes peelin' plus 30 minutes cookin'... that's 45 minutes all together. 


45 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... it cools down 2 degrees every hour on low, so after 3 hours, that's 6 degrees cooler. Then it gets colder faster, 3 degrees every hour, for 4 hours, so that's another 12 degrees cooler.  That's 18 degrees cooler in total! But then it warms up a bit when it's off, 2 degrees every hour for 2 hours, so that's 4 degrees warmer. So it's still 14 degrees cooler than it started.


14 

"
"Well, lemme see... that Halley's Comet thing comes around every 75 years, right? And the dad saw it when he was 30.  His son saw it when he was three times older than that... so that's 3 times 30, which is 90.  

So the son was 90 when he saw it.  But that's more than one time the comet came around, ain't it?  Hmm... 90 divided by 75 is... well, it's a little more than one. So the son musta been 75 the first time he saw it.


75 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... he pays electric and gas every month, so that's two checks a month. Church is twice a month, so that's like four checks a month. And the yard guys come every three months, so that's... uh... four checks a year I guess?

So, two plus two plus four plus four... that's twelve checks a month! Times twelve months...  carry the one...  that's a whole lotta checks!

"
"Well, lemme see... that first plane goes to Greece a lot, like three outta every four times.  The other times it goes to France or Germany, but I dunno how many.  That other plane only goes to Poland, and it flies way less, like half as much as the first one.  Hmm... if the Poland plane flies 44 times, the first one flies 88 times.  So, if it goes to Greece 66 times, that leaves 22 times for France and Germany.  

So, I guess the first plane goes to France 11 times. 



"
"Well, Tobias howls for 20 seconds, and Chikote howls for twice that, so that's 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two put together, so that's 20 plus 40, which is 60 seconds.  Add 'em all up, 20 plus 40 plus 60, and you get 120 seconds.  That's 2 minutes, I think. 


2 

"
"Well, lemme see... Adam got 6 bucks from his momma and his daddy gave him double that, so that's 6 times 2, which is 12 more dollars.  That's 6 plus 12, so 18 bucks from his folks.  The pants cost 30 bucks, so he had to use 30 minus 18 of his own money.  That's 12 dollars.


$12
"
"Hmm, lemme see... they all add up to 20 years, right? Akbar's 3, Alessandro's 4, and Helene... she's a tricky one.  But if they all averaged out to 5 years old, and Helene's older, she must be 10!

So, 3 plus 4 plus 10 is 17. That leaves 3 years for Wilfred. 


3
"
"Well, lemme see... Walter got 500 bucks from his neighbors and then another 1500 from the internet thingy. That's a whole lotta money already!  His lawyer's gonna give three times that, so that's like... a lot more!  And then his friend chips in 200 bucks too.  

Hmm, so the lawyer's gonna give...  6000 bucks! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  A hundred folks brought cookies, fifteen each... that's a lotta cookies!  They gave half to the church, right?  And each church person got fifteen cookies...  So, if we divide the cookies the church got by how many each person got...  

...There were fifty people at the church. 


50
"
"Well, lemme see...  There's two grownups and four little ones, right? And the grownups get double the watermelon.  So, if you cut the watermelon into, say, six pieces, each kid gets one, and each grownup gets two.  That means each grownup gets a quarter of the whole thing, don't it?

25 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Doc's at the clinic for nine hours. He spends a lotta time with those folks stayin' there, like twenty minutes each. And he's got ten appointments, each takin' half an hour.  Nine folks stayin' there... that's a lot of checkin' up on!  

Let's see... that's three hours for the folks stayin' there and five hours for the appointments. That's eight hours total.  So he's got one hour left for his papers, I reckon.


1 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  She gotta make the batter, then bake it, then let it sit, then put the icing on.  That's a lotta time!  If she wants it ready by 5, she better start way early, like maybe around 2 o'clock. 


2:00 pm
"
"Hmm, lemme see... they sold a whole lotta chocolate, that's for sure!  Eight boxes all together, and they got 64 bars...  

So, if ya split 'em up even, that's 8 bars in each box. 


8 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they charge 25 bucks just to use the place, then 1.50 for each kid every time.  They got 10 kids comin' in 3 times a week. So that's 30 bucks a kid each week, right?  And 30 times 10 is 300.  But they gotta pay that 25 bucks each time too, so it's 300 plus 25 times 3, which is 75. So that's 375 a week.  A month is like 4 weeks, so 375 times 4 is... 1500!

 1500 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Peter's got 4 boxes o' chocolates, and Martha's got 7. Peter's got 64 chocolates all together, and Martha's got 56.  

So, Peter's got more chocolates in each box, right?  Let's see... 64 divided by 4 is 16.  Martha's got 56 divided by 7, which is 8.

So Peter's got 8 more chocolates in each box than Martha.


8 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  There's 50 porcupines, and three-fifths of 'em are ladies. So that's... uh... 30 lady porcupines.  Each lady has 4 babies every month, so that's 30 times 4... which is 120 babies every month!  

In a whole year, that's a lotta babies! 120 times 12 months...  carry the one... that's 1440 babies!

So, you add all them babies to the 50 you started with...  1440 plus 50...  that's a whole mess of porcupines! 1490! 


1490 

"
"Okay, so they got this big ol' pool, right?  Four feet deep, twenty-five feet long, and fourteen feet wide.  They gotta figure out how much water that is, then times it by somethin' like six, I think.  Then it's ten cents for every bit of water they put in.  

Let's see... that's a lotta water!  Probably gonna cost 'em a pretty penny to fill that thing up.  Hmm... I'd say it's gonna be over five hundred bucks, for sure. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got 9 red ones... and 5 more blue than that... so that's... 14 blue ones!  And then the yellow ones are 3 less than the blue... so that's 11 yellow ones.  Altogether, that's a whole lotta sticks!  9 plus 14 plus 11...  carry the one...  34 sticks! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Matteo went 55 miles every hour for 4 hours, so that's... uh... 220 miles!  Shandy went 45 miles every hour for 10 hours, so that's... 450 miles!  

450 minus 220...  That's 230 miles farther!


230 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa kids at that school, huh?  

Okay, so half are older, right? That's like, 1500 kids. And some of them are boys, like, a quarter. So that's... uh... 375 boys?  

Then the other half are younger, so that's another 1500. And half of them are boys too, so that's 750 boys.

Now, to get the girls...  

Hold on, lemme count on my fingers...

1500 older kids minus the 375 boys is... 1125 girls!

And 1500 younger kids minus the 750 boys is... 750 girls!

So, all together, there's gotta be... 1875 girls! 



"
"Bethany runs ten laps, Trey runs more than her, like, four more. Shaelyn runs way less than Trey, like half. And Quinn runs even less than Shaelyn.  Hmm, so Bethany runs more than Quinn, I think it's... 5 more laps. 


5 

"
"Okay, so they got this big ol' tank, right? Holds a whole lotta water, 18,000 gallons! Wanda and Ms. B, they're tryin' to fill it up in two days.

First day, Wanda pumps in a quarter of the tank, that's like, 4500 gallons, I think. Ms. B, she pumps in less, like, three-quarters of what Wanda did, so that's, uh... lemme see... 3375 gallons.

Next day, Wanda pumps in less than the day before, two-thirds of it, so that's 3000 gallons. Ms. B, she's tired, only pumps a third of what she did the first day, so that's 1125 gallons.

Altogether, they pumped in a whole bunch, 12,000 gallons! But the tank's big, so they still need... hmm... 6000 more gallons to fill it up. 



"
"Okay, so Maria's power bank was losin' juice, right?  It was goin' down 9% every hour for a while, then it slowed down to 7% an hour.  After all that, she only had 28% left.  

Hmm, that's tricky.  Let me see...  It's like, if it lost a bunch, then some more, and ended up with 28%, gotta figure out what it had at the start.  

I dunno, maybe... 17.65%?  That sounds about right.



"
"Okay, so she makes 10 bucks an hour plus 15 in tips, so that's 25 bucks every hour.  She works a whole lotta hours, 40 a week!  That's a thousand bucks a week!  She needs 20% of 10,000 for the car, so that's 2,000 bucks.  Hmm, so she needs to save for two weeks.


2 

"
"Lemme see... he got ten bucks, right?  Peaches and pears is fifty cents each, so that's a dollar fifty for the peaches and two bucks for the pears. Kiwis is a dollar each, so that's two bucks more. Apples is seventy-five cents each, so that's three seventy-five, which is three dollars and seventy-five cents.  

Hold on, lemme add that up... one fifty plus two plus two plus three seventy-five... that's nine twenty-five!

So he got seventy-five cents left. Plums is a quarter each, so he can get three of them! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  She had a whole lotta sweets, fifteen packs! And each pack had, like, sixty of 'em. She kept a couple for herself, so that's, uh...  Let's see, fifteen minus two... thirteen packs left.  Thirteen times sixty... that's a lot of countin'!  

So, she gave 'em to ten friends, right?  So, thirteen times sixty...  carry the one...  that's seven hundred and eighty sweets for her friends.  

Now, how many each?  Seven hundred and eighty... divided by ten...  

That's seventy-eight sweets each! 


78 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so the carrots start at a hundred and twenty bucks, right? And they go up by 5 every year... so after one year, they'd be a hundred and twenty-six. Then another five the next year, so a hundred and thirty-two... and then another five, so... about a hundred and thirty-seven dollars, I guess? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she put 72 pictures in 8 albums, so that's like 9 in each one.  She had 3 albums of just her face, so that's 3 times 9...  that's 27 selfies! And 2 albums of portraits, so that's 2 times 9, which is 18 portraits.  So, 27 plus 18...  that's 45 selfies and portraits all together.


45 

"
"Well, lemme see... He reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, right?  So if he reads 18 pages, that's like... six sets of 3 pages.  So it's gotta be 10 times 6... that's 60 minutes! 


60
"
"Hmm, lemme see... so they started with a hundred folks, then some left early, some stayed late...  More came in later, then even more after dinner.  Gosh, that's a lot of folks comin' and goin'!  

Let's see...  I think there's... 113 guests now. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He got four bananas, then six more... that's ten.  And then on Friday, he got a whole bunch more, like three times the first day... so that's twelve more!  Ten plus twelve...  carry the one... that's twenty-two bananas! 


22
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa questions!  So, she's good at the easy ones, gets most of those right.  The rest are harder, but she gets half of those.  That's gotta be...  36, I think? 


36
"
"Well, lemme see... she sells the big ones for, like, three times the price of the little ones, right? And she sold twice as many little ones.  She made a hundred and twenty bucks total.  Those little guys are four bucks each.  Hmm...  

Let's see... if she sold, like, six of the big ones, that'd be...  carry the one... eighteen bucks.  Nah, too low.  Twelve big ones?  That's thirty-six bucks.  Okay, so she sold twelve big ones.  That means she sold twenty-four little ones 'cause she sold twice as many of those.


24 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they eats 5 plus 4 plus 2... that's 11 sandwiches a day.  And there's 7 days in a week... so that's 11 times 7...  

*counts on fingers*

77 sandwiches! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she sold a whole lotta cookies, 80 of 'em for a buck each. That's 80 bucks right there! Then she sold cupcakes, 60 of 'em for 4 bucks a pop. So that's... lemme grab my fingers... 60 times 4...  carry the one... that's 240 bucks!

So she made 80 plus 240... that's 320 bucks! But she gave some to her sisters, 10 bucks each, and she got two sisters... so that's 20 bucks gone.

320 minus 20... that's 300 bucks left! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... They hid a hundred eggs, and them twins found a whole bunch, thirty each! That's sixty eggs right there.  And ten were left over, so...  the friends musta found thirty eggs. 


30 

"
"Well, lemme see...  One dwarf digs up 12 pounds a day with just his hands. With a fancy iron thingy, he gets double that, so 24 pounds. Then with a steel one, it's even more, like, half again as much as the iron one. So that's... lemme see... 24 times 1.5... that's 36 pounds a day!

Now, if one dwarf gets 36 pounds a day, in a whole month, that's 36 times 30...  carry the one... that's 1080 pounds!

And if you got 40 dwarves all diggin', that's 1080 times 40...  that's a lotta pounds!  

43200 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  They got 2 for 3 bucks, and 4 for 6 bucks... so that means each one costs a dollar fifty, right?  So 8 of them would be... 8 times a dollar fifty...  

$12.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He buys a new bed for three thousand bucks, but gets a thousand for his old one. So that's two thousand he still owes.  Ten percent of that each month...  carry the one...  that's two hundred dollars a month.


$200 

"
"Okay, so Sally had a whole bunch of balloons, right?  Some red ones, some green ones, and some yellow ones.  Then some popped, and she let go of some yellow ones.  Then she found some blue ones!  She took some of those blue ones with her.  

Hmm... lemme see... I think she had 27 balloons when she got to school. 


27
"
"Hmm, lemme see... so there's a fifty-fifty shot he gets a sub, and subs don't care 'bout homework.  If his regular teacher comes, there's a chance she'll give everyone more time. And even if she don't, he might be able to lie about his dog eatin' it.  

So, I'd say there's a pretty good chance he don't gotta do it.  Maybe like, 30% chance he's gotta do it. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got 6000 spots, but the smarty-pants grads and teachers take up 950 plus 300, so that's 1250 gone.  That leaves... uh... 4750 for everyone else.  If there's 950 grads, that means each one gets 5 tickets for their folks. 


5
"
"Well, lemme see...  He eats a whole bunch of them big ones, 75.  Then he can eat double that of the medium ones, so that's like 150, right? And them little ones, you gotta eat three to be like one medium one. So... that's a lotta little beans!  It's gotta be... 450! 



"
"Well, lemme see... she works six hours a day for three days, so that's like... eighteen hours total, right?  And she gets fifteen bucks a day, so that's forty-five dollars. But then she gotta pay for parking, three bucks a day, so that's nine bucks gone.  So she makes thirty-six dollars.  

Now, how much is that per hour?  Hmm... thirty-six dollars split up into eighteen hours...  Gotta be two dollars an hour, I reckon.


$2 

"
"Lemme see... he buys three books at sixteen bucks a pop, so that's... uh... forty-eight dollars. Then he gets three pencils for six dollars each, so that's eighteen dollars.  

Forty-eight plus eighteen...  carry the one... that's sixty-six dollars! 


66
"
"Hmm, lemme see... he's got a long driveway, that's for sure.  24 feet, that's like, a whole lotta soda!  If he puts one every 3 feet, that's a bunch of sodas.  And it takes him 5 seconds to do each one...  

Let me count on my fingers...  

35 seconds! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Two boxes of apples, forty in each... that's a lotta apples!  He puts eight in each pack... so...  I dunno, maybe ten packs? 


10 

"
"Lemme see... she buys two of them fancy Parmesan cheese things at eleven bucks a pop, so that's twenty-two dollars right there. Then she gets three of them mozzarella ones at six dollars each, so that's eighteen more.  Twenty-two plus eighteen is forty.  If she started with fifty, she got ten dollars left.


$10 

"
"Okay, so this Jim guy goes to school for four years, right? That's a lotta time! He borrows fifty thousand bucks each year, so that's like two hundred thousand in total.  And he was makin' twenty-five thousand a year before, but now he's makin' seventy-five thousand, which is way better!  But he missed out on makin' a hundred thousand while he was in school. So, he needs to make three hundred thousand to catch up.  If he's makin' seventy-five thousand a year, it'll take him four years to make that much. 


4 

"
"Well, lemme see... the bed's six by eight, right?  So he needs it bigger, two feet more on each side.  That's like, ten feet long and twelve feet wide, I guess.  So, that's ten times twelve...  

...that's a lotta fabric, gotta be a hundred and twenty feet! 


120 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so they done delivered a whole lotta letters, huh?

Monday was 425, right? Then Tuesday was, like, a little more than a fifth of that, plus some extra.  And Wednesday was, like, double Tuesday, plus a few more.

Gosh, that's a lot of countin'!  I think it's somethin' like... 736 letters all together. 



"
"Lemme see... 10 folks want the chicken thingy at 6 bucks and some change... so that's like... a lotta money. And then 6 want the pasta, which is a little cheaper.  Hmm...  I dunno, maybe around a hundred bucks? 



"
"Well, lemme see... He lost 5 bucks first, then won 11, I think?  Then he lost some more, like 16 somethin'.  So, I guess he lost a whole bunch that day.  

About 7 dollars and some change, I reckon. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... 26 countries, and each one has 5 towns with a thousand folks in each... so that's like... a lot of people!  

Let's see... 5 towns times a thousand... that's 5000 people in each country. And there's 26 countries... so...  carry the one...  

It's gotta be a big number... 130,000! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Xavier was 4 feet, that's like, 48 inches, right?  And he grew 3 more inches, so that's 51 inches. Cole was 50 inches and grew 2 inches, so he's 52 inches now.  

52 minus 51... that's just 1 inch!


1 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got $1920 all together, right?  The second guy got more than the first, and the third guy got double the second.  That's a lot of numbers!

Let's see... if the first guy got, say, $400, the second would get $480, and the third would get $960.  

Add those up, and it's $1840... not quite enough.

Maybe the first guy got a bit more... how about $420? Then the second guy gets $500, and the third gets $1000.

That's $1920!  So the first guy got $420.


$420
"
"Well, lemme see... they worked for three weeks, that's like, a lotta days, right?  And they only worked part of each day, like less than half.  Hmm...  I dunno, maybe... 189 hours? 



"
"Well, lemme see... he got 19 balls total, right? And the third set was half of the second set.  That means the second set musta been a good amount, 'cause half of it made up some of the 19.  

If the first set was 4 more than the second, and they all add up to 19... hmm...  I'd say he got 10 balls in the first set. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... so the car cost 20,000 bucks, right? And it loses 21% of its value every year.  So, like, in 2008 it's worth less, then even less in 2009, and even less in 2010.  

That's a lotta losin'!  I'm bad at numbers, but I think it'd be somethin' like... 9860 bucks in 2010.


9860.62 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Half the books are in English, so that's 25. And some are in German, 10%...  that's like, a few.  So the rest gotta be Spanish, right?  There's 50 books total, so...  25 English, a few German...  that leaves, like, 20 for Spanish, I guess?


20 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  She drove a bunch, but still gotta go a ways.  I'd say she's gotta drive 'bout 655 more clicks. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she drinks 8 cups a day, and a gallon's got, like, a whole bunch of cups... 16, I think? So, if she drinks 8 every day, that's half a gallon, right?  And if she does that for a whole month, that's like... 30 days times half a gallon...  

That's gotta be 15 gallons! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... so there's 120 folks on the train, right? Then more get on, then some get off, then more get on again...  and then even more get off.  

That's a lot of folks movin' around!  

Let me count on my fingers...  

...

I think there's 110 left on the train at the end. 


110
"
"Lemme see... she bought a shirt for ten bucks.  The shorts were five more than that, so fifteen bucks. The shoes were half off, so forty-eight divided by two is... uh... twenty-four dollars. And the socks were eight bucks but she got two dollars off, so six bucks.  

So, ten plus fifteen plus twenty-four plus six... that's fifty-five dollars! 


55
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  You got a big ol' kitchen, 200 squares they say.  And them tiles, they're a dollar a piece, right?  Well, you gotta cover the whole floor, so that's...  200 times 12...  carry the one...  that's gonna be $2400! 



"
"Well, lemme see... so his insurance went up 'cause he had a wreck, right?  They said it was 60% more, and it used to be $120 a month.  So, that's like... a whole lotta extra money.  

Hmm...  60% of 120...  that's like, uh...  carry the one...  $72 more each month!  So now it's $192 a month.

Now, how much is that a year?  There's 12 months in a year, so...  $192 times 12...  that's $2304 a year!  

Dang, that's a lot for insurance!


$2304 

"
"Well, lemme see... he washes four little beds and one big one, right?  His machine only takes two little ones at a time, so that's two washes for them. And the big one gets its own wash. So that's three washes a week.  Now, there's, like, fifty-two weeks in a year, so...  carry the one...  that's a whole lotta washes!  Gotta be... 156! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... they watch four movies on Saturday, and then half that on Sunday, so that's two.  That's six movies every weekend.  So in four weeks, that's like... six times four...  

24 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He had a hundred stickers, then got fifty more... and then double that this year?  So that's a hundred more, right?  Plus the first hundred he had... that's gotta be two hundred and fifty stickers!


250 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... She feeds 'em 60 grams each, twice a day, so that's 120 grams a day for each kitty.  Three kitties is 360 grams a day total.  So, 720 grams would last...  *counts on fingers* ...two days? No, wait... four days! 


4 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... four pizzas, eight slices each... that's a lotta pizza! Becky ate ten, and she had three more than Jake, so Jake ate seven. Silvia ate double Jake, so she had fourteen.  Ten plus seven plus fourteen...  carry the one... that's thirty-one slices! 


31 

"
"Well, Betsy took longer than Donovan, right?  If they did it in 98 minutes total, and Betsy took longer, lemme see...  

Hmm, lemme try... 98 minus...  say... 20?  That's 78.  Nah, that don't seem right.  

How about... 98 minus 30? That's 68.  Still too low.

Okay, 98 minus 40... that's 58!  Yeah, that sounds about right.


58 

"
"Lemme see... she gotta pay for the cast, that's two hundred bucks. Then the doctor, he charges a lotta money, three hundred bucks an hour! But she was only there for half an hour, so that's... lemme see...  one-fifty.  Then there's them pain pills, thirty of 'em at four bucks a pop, so that's... uh... one hundred and twenty. And don't forget the parking, two hours at six bucks an hour, so that's twelve.  

Add it all up... two hundred plus one-fifty plus one twenty plus twelve... that's four eighty-two dollars! 


482
"
"Hmm, lemme see... 80 emails a day, and he don't gotta answer 20 of 'em... so that's like, 60 he does answer each day, right?  And in a whole week, that's like... 60 times 5...  

300 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  They had a bunch of classes come on Monday, then double that on Tuesday, and then triple that on Wednesday.  Then some more on Thursday and Friday.  Gosh, that's a lotta kids!  Let's see... carry the one...  

247 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He got a hundred three times, so that's like three hundred... and then eighty on the last one...  

That's... uh...  380 all together.  So I guess it's 95? 


95 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they ate a lotta pizza!  The glee club ate most of theirs, and the football team ate even more!  I think... I think there's about 14 pizzas left. 


14
"
"Okay, so he's sendin' out a whole lotta coupons, right?  Them small ones, he's doin' 700 of 'em.  And the big ones, he's doin' double that, so that's 1400.  

Now, them small ones cost a nickel each to mail, so that's 700 times 5 cents... lemme see...  carry the one... that's 35 bucks.

Them big ones cost 15 cents each, so 1400 times 15 cents...  that's a lotta countin'...  okay, that's 210 bucks.

So, all together, he's spendin' 35 plus 210...  that's 245 bucks on mailin' all them coupons.


$245.00
"
"Okay, so Sidney had some meatball subs, right? He had less than ten, like seven. Then that Mark fella ate some, four of 'em. So Sidney got more, three more.  

Hmm, lemme see... that's a lotta meatballs. I think it's... 36 meatballs! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He had 20 big trucks, right? And each one had 20 tons of that fertilizer stuff. But some of them broke down, like, a quarter of them. So, that's 5 trucks that didn't make it.  That leaves 15 trucks that got to the farmers.  

If each truck has 20 tons, then 15 trucks would have...  carry the one... 300 tons! 


300 

"
"Well, lemme see... he needs six dozen croissants, and that's a lotta croissants!  One pound of butter for each dozen, so that's six pounds he needs.  Butter's four bucks a pound, right?  But wait, there's a deal! Buy one, get one half off.  So, that's like... three pounds at full price, and three pounds half off.  Hmm... three times four is twelve bucks.  And half of four is two, so three times two is six bucks.  Twelve plus six... that's eighteen dollars!


$18.00
"
"Okay, so Kayla got a bunch of friends comin' to her party, right?  Let's see... she got 25 from school, 7 dance friends, and 13 family folks. That's a lotta people!  But 4 of 'em can't make it. So, that's 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41 people at the party.

Now, the movie place costs 125 bucks just to start, and then it's 6 bucks more for every extra person after the first 20.  So, 41 people minus the first 20 is 21 extra folks. That's 21 times 6 bucks, which is 126 bucks.

So, the whole thing costs 125 plus 126, which is 251 bucks! 


251
"
"Well, lemme see... Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so that's like, 15 bucks, right? And Riza spent a third, which is 20 bucks. So Maggie has 45 left, and Riza has 40.  

If you add those together, they got 85 bucks left.


85 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 315 bananas for a whole week...  That's a lotta bananas!  

The first monkey eats 10 a day, and the second one eats 4 more than that, so that's 14.  

So, together they eat 24 bananas a day.

If there's 315 bananas for the whole week, that's 45 bananas a day for all the monkeys.

So, the third monkey eats 45 minus 24, which is 21 bananas a day.


21 

"
"Well, lemme see... he did half of that big puzzle, so that's like, 250 pieces, right? And then he did a whole other one, so that's 500 more.  So, uh... 250 plus 500... that's a lotta pieces!  

750 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she buys a whole bunch of roses, right?  Fifteen of 'em.  Some cost two bucks each, and a bunch costs fifteen bucks.  She's got twenty-five bucks, I think.  So, she spends twenty-one bucks on the flowers.  That leaves her with four bucks.  Now, quarters are worth a quarter each, so... that's sixteen quarters.


16 

"
"Lemme see... six milkshakes at five-fifty each... that's thirty-three bucks.  Nine burger things at eleven bucks a pop... that's ninety-nine. And twenty sodas at a dollar-fifty... that's thirty.  

So, thirty-three plus ninety-nine plus thirty...  

That's one hundred and sixty-two dollars! 



"
"Okay, so the first train comes in 10 minutes and hangs around for 20. Then another one comes 30 minutes after the first one leaves, but that one only stays for 5 minutes.  The third one shows up an hour after the second one leaves, and it takes off right away.  The one Paul wants comes 20 minutes after that one leaves.  

So, lemme see... 10 plus 20 is 30. Then add 30, that's 60. Then add another hour, which is 60, so that's 120. Then add 20 more minutes... that's 140 minutes.

Paul waits for 140 minutes. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she's got 120 toothpicks already, right? And she needs 200. So that's... 80 more she needs. She gets 10 a week, so... that's 8 weeks, I think. 


8 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so the watch was two thousand bucks, right? But Rogers got it for less, like, three quarters of the price.  That's fifteen hundred, I think. Then he sold it to his buddy for more, like, one hundred and twenty percent of what he paid. So that's eighteen hundred.

So the buddy saved two hundred bucks, right? Two hundred outta two thousand... that's gotta be, like, ten percent off, ain't it?


**Answer:** 10 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  If one spring makes a jellyfish every second, and there's five springs, that's like, a whole lotta jellyfish!  And four hours is a long time...  I'd say they'd make a whole bunch, maybe like... 1200? 



"
"Well, lemme see... Binkie got 90, and Frankie did way better.  Twice Binkie's score is like 90 times 2, which is 180. But Frankie got 15 more than that, so...  that's 195!


195 

"
"Well, he walked 4 miles to the store, but then had to walk all the way back home, which is another 4 miles.  That's 8 miles total, right?  And he walks 4 miles every hour. So, it took him 2 hours to get to the store.

2 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so she buys a whole lotta bananas, right? Ten bunches, that's a lot!  If she buys 'em one by one, it'd be like, 40 bananas times 80 cents... that's a lotta money! But the bunches are cheaper, only 3 bucks a pop. So she saves some dough, for sure.  

Let's see... 32 bucks for singles, minus 30 for the bunches...  

She saved 2 bucks! 



"
"Well, lemme see... they got 100 feet all together, right? And Harry's gettin' a whole lotta more than Sam, 60 feet more!  So, if we give Harry his extra 60 feet, that leaves us with 40 feet.  Sam gets the rest, so that's 20 feet for Sam. 


20
"
"Hmm, lemme see... that croc grows 8 inches in 4 years, so in 13 years...  that's like, three times longer, right? So maybe... 24 inches? 



"
"Okay, so Marcel sells them fancy bikes, right?  Let's see... them Trekking ones are $450 each, and he sold a whole bunch, half of all the bikes! That's 150 of 'em, so that's 150 times 450... hmm, carry the one... that's $67,500!

Then he sold some BMX bikes, them little ones.  Those are half the price of the big MTB ones, which are $500. So BMX are $250. He sold 15% of the bikes as BMX, which is 45 bikes.  So that's 45 times 250...  that's $11,250.

And the rest were MTBs, which are $500 each. He sold 105 of those. So that's 105 times 500...  that's a lot of zeros... $52,500!

Now, let's add it all up: $67,500 plus $11,250 plus $52,500...  

That's $131,250! Marcel made a lot of money selling bikes! 



"
"Well, lemme see... the farmer makes 5 bales every hour, and he works for 6 hours, so that's 5 times 6... which is 30 bales.  The truck takes away 3 bales every hour for 6 hours, so that's 3 times 6... which is 18 bales.  So, if you take away 18 from 30, you get 12.

12 

"
"Well, lemme see... he goes to class a whole lotta, eight times a day! That's like, forever!  And each one's forty minutes, so that's... uh... carry the one... a bunch!  He does that five days a week, so that's a whole lotta minutes right there. Then he does some more learnin' on the weekend, like a hundred minutes each day.  So, add all that up, and it's gotta be, like, thirty hours or somethin'.  

30 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He drops it from way up high, right?  Three floors, that's like... a lotta feet.  And it bounces back up, but not all the way.  Two-thirds, huh? So it goes up less each time.  

Let's see... three floors is a lot, so the second bounce... gotta be less than half of that, right?  I'm gonna say it goes up 32 feet on the second bounce. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  The first kid's six feet tall, right?  So that's a lotta inches...  Let's see, six times twelve is... seventy-two.  Then the next one's taller by two inches, so that's seventy-four.  The third one's shorter by five, so that's sixty-nine.  And the last one's taller by three... so that's seventy-two again!

72 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they sold a whole lotta apples, two thousand! And they put ten in each bag, so that's... a lot of bags.  If each bag costs five bucks, they musta made a good chunk of change.  I'd say... a thousand dollars? 


$1000 

"
"Well, lemme see... them Allosaurus ate 270, and that was just half of what was left. So before them sneaky raptors got there, there was 270 times 2, which is 540.  But that was only half of what the big T-Rex left behind. So the triceratops musta had 540 times 2, which is 1080! 


1080
"
"Okay, so he's got four walls, right? Two big ones, ten by eight, that's like, eighty each, so that's one sixty. Then two smaller ones, five by eight, so that's forty each, so eighty more.  That's two forty all together.  

Now, each can of paint does twenty feet, so he needs, lemme see... twelve cans!  And each can is twelve bucks, so that's...  carry the one... one forty-four dollars! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Ellen messed with some sodas, right?  She took one, her brother took a few...  So there's, like, a couple left that are all fizzy.  I'd say her friend's got a one in four chance of gettin' sprayed.  

25% 

"
"Well, lemme see... one train's goin' sixty miles an hour, the other's goin' half that, so thirty.  They're goin' for three hours... so the fast one goes 180 miles, and the slow one goes 90.  That's 270 miles apart, I reckon.


270 

"
"Okay, so Billy helps two folks every hour, and he does that for three hours a day.  That's six people a day, right?  

Now, lemme see... March has 31 days, and then there's 19 more in April, so that's 50 days total. But he takes some days off, like 20% of them.  Hmm, 20% of 50... that's 10 days off.

So he works 40 days.  If he helps six people each day, that's...  carry the one... 240 people! 


240 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa cars and buses, huh?  Each bus had a whole bunch of folks, like, thirty-five! And the cars, they had three people each.  So, if you add up all them folks from the buses and cars...  that's gotta be a lot of people at the weddin'!  

480 

"
"Well, lemme see... Mike's 24, and Martha's a bit younger, like 4 years. So Martha's 20.  And Jeff's older than Martha by 10 years, so Jeff's gotta be 30! 


30
"
"Hmm, lemme see... that big slide is 300 feet, and they go down it at 60 feet every minute. So that's... 300 divided by 60...  that's 5 minutes.

The other one is shorter, 240 feet, but they go faster, 80 feet a minute. So that's 240 divided by 80... that's 3 minutes.

So the big one takes 2 minutes longer. 


2 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... he takes a half hour lunch every day, right? And two fifteen minute breaks, so that's like, another half hour.  So an hour total each day.  Five days is like... five hours? 


5 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they ran 52 miles all together, right? And Amber did 8. Micah did way more, like 3 times more than Amber... so that's like 8 times 3...  carry the one...  that's 24 more miles! So Micah did 24 plus 8, which is 32 miles.  That means Ahito did the rest, so 52 minus 32...  that's 20 miles!


20 

"
"Okay, so she starts with eighty-five bucks on her card, right? Then she takes somethin' back, so it's eighty-five minus fifteen, which is seventy.  Then she buys a pan thingy, it was twenty bucks but on sale for twenty percent off, so that's four bucks off. So the pan is sixteen bucks.  And the towels were thirty bucks but ten percent off, so three bucks off, makin' them twenty-seven bucks.  So the pan and towels together are sixteen plus twenty-seven, which is forty-three bucks.  So she adds that to the seventy she had, makin' it seventy plus forty-three, which is a hundred and thirteen bucks.


$113.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  So some jellyfish are big, some are small, and the big ones turn blue under the light. Six of 'em turned blue, huh?  That means there must be a whole bunch of jellyfish in there! I'd say there's gotta be at least 90. 


90
"
"Well, lemme see... Chris is 4, right? And Ben's twice that, so he's 8.  Caroline's three times older than Ben, so that's... hmm... 8 times 3...  That's 24! 


24
"
"Well, lemme see... she wants to save up for 20 years of livin' after she stops workin', right? And she needs 40% of her paycheck each year to do that.  She makes a hundred thousand now, so that's 40,000 she needs every year.  So she needs 800,000 dollars total, 'cause 40,000 times 20 is 800,000.

She saves 20% of her paycheck, so that's 20,000 a year.  

Hmm... if she saves 20,000 a year, it'll take her 40 years to save up all that money. 


40 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He's got a hundred of them centimeters things, right? And he cuts it into four pieces, then cuts each of them pieces into five more pieces...  That's a lotta cuttin'!  

I think each little piece would be five centimeters long. 


5 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... If 40 outta every 100 kids are boys, and that's 240 boys, then there must be a whole lotta girls too!  

Let's see... 240 boys is like 40 outta 100, so that means there's gotta be 600 kids in total, right?

So, if there's 240 boys, then there's gotta be 360 girls! 


360
"
"Hmm, lemme see... she spent nineteen bucks on pots and twenty-six on dirt, so that's... forty-five dollars. But then she had a coupon for seven bucks off, so... that makes it thirty-eight dollars. 


$38
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Six ladies, some wearin' four inch heels, some wearin' two.  That's... uh... three times four is twelve, and three times two is six... so that's eighteen inches all together.  

Eighteen inches split between six ladies...  Gotta be three inches each, right?


3 

"
"Well, lemme see... she wants to walk a whole lotta miles, like, nine thousand somethin'. And she walks a bunch every day, like, two hundred and fifty miles! But that ain't enough, she gotta walk more.  

If she walks that much every day for the whole month, she'll only walk seven thousand five hundred miles. So she needs to walk, like, eighteen hundred more miles.

That's a lotta extra walkin'!  If she spreads it out over the whole month, she gotta walk sixty more miles every day. 


60 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Three red ones at nine bucks a pop... that's twenty-seven.  Then eleven blue ones at five bucks... so that's fifty-five.  And a whole bunch of green ones, twenty-five at three bucks... that's seventy-five.  

Add it all up... twenty-seven plus fifty-five plus seventy-five...  

That's one hundred and fifty-seven dollars!


157 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got 12 big bags o' apples, right? Peter wants a quarter, so that's like... 3 bags? And Paul wants a third, so that's 4 bags.  That's 7 bags gone.  So James gets the rest, which is 5 bags. 


5 

"
"Brrr, it was cold!  It was two degrees, then got way colder, like, eight degrees colder!  But then the sun came up and it got a little warmer, like three degrees warmer.  So I guess it was minus three degrees then?


-3
"
"Hmm, lemme see... He had 21 bucks, then got 11 more... that's 32!  Then he spent 5 on a comic, so 32 minus 5... that's 27. Then he spent 19 on a puzzle... so 27 minus 19...  

8 bucks! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... She had 16 bucks, spent 4, so that's 12 left. Then she buys two books and has 2 bucks left...  So she spent 10 on the books.  If they both cost the same, that's 5 bucks a book!


$5 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  They had 50 kids in class last year, and this year there's more, right?  20% more...  That's like... a fifth more, I guess?  So maybe... 60 kids this year?



"
"Hmm, lemme see... It blinks a whole bunch in five minutes, so it blinks a lot every minute.  If it blinks even more times, it'll take longer, right?  I'd say... 9 minutes. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa guppies and goldfish... Tate got more girl fish than boy fish. I counted it up, and there's 5 more girl fish. 


5
"
"Amalia mowed the lawn for 4 hours. Megan walked the dog, and that took her longer, like 6 hours I think. Dior did laundry, and that took a long time, maybe 8 hours? So, if you add all that up, it's 4 plus 6 plus 8, which is 18 hours. 


18
"
"Well, he goes there and back, so that's double the drivin'.  He goes 70 miles an hour for 2 hours, so that's 140 miles one way. Double that's 280 miles. And he does that twice a month, so... lemme see...  carry the two...  that's 560 miles! 



"
"Well, Sofie walks a whole lotta miles, ten each day for a whole week! That's like, seventy miles! Brian's gotta walk half that, so... hmm... lemme see...  

35 

"
"Well, lemme see... they got 400 toys to make, right? And five folks workin' on 'em. Two of 'em make six toys every hour, so that's twelve toys an hour from those two.  Another two make four toys an hour, so that's eight toys from them.  That's twenty toys every hour from four folks.

They work ten hours, so that's two hundred toys already made.  But they still need twenty more to finish the order, so that means they need to make 180 more toys.

So that fifth fella, he gotta make 18 toys every hour to get 'er done! 


18
"
"Let's see... Kory's dog is a big fella at 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is like a quarter of that, so that's 15 pounds. His other dog is half, so that's 30 pounds.  Add 'em all up, Kory's dog plus Elijah's two, and you get 105 pounds. 


105
"
"Hmm, lemme see... Kris got 7 stickers from someone, and he already had 9, so that's 16 stickers.  That means Luis had 16 times 2, which is 32 stickers.  And Luis got those from Seth, who had double that, so Seth had... 32 times 2...  64 stickers! 


64
"
"Hmm, lemme see... he's got three big bags, and each one's got ten of them ounces... so that's thirty ounces all together.  And each ounce has thirty of them little candies, right? So that's a whole lotta candies, like nine hundred!  If he puts ten in each little bag, he can make ninety of them. 


90 

"
"Well, lemme see... that Alfie sure flies a lot!  If the Earth is 40,000 kilometers all the way around, half of that is... hmm... 20,000 kilometers!  And Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. So, it'd take him... 50 days! 



"
"Well, lemme see... that fancy car is way fast!  The second fastest one is like, five times faster than a normal car, which goes 120. So that's 5 times 120... hmm... that's 600! And the fastest one is even faster, like a whole lot faster, 1.25 times faster. So that's...  carry the one... 750!  That's gotta be it!


750 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Liam's sixteen now, so two years ago he was fourteen.  That means Vince was seven back then. So now Vince is... nine! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... they painted a whole lotta eggs!  Camden and that Sarah girl did 30 together, but Camden did more, like 12 more. So Camden did, uh... 21 eggs?  And Arnold and Madeline did the rest, which is 26.  So Arnold did 13, I think.  That means Camden did 8 more than Arnold. 


8 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 200 crayons, 8 in each box... that's a lotta boxes!  Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce... so that's 9 ounces per box, right?  

200 crayons divided by 8... that's 25 boxes.  So 25 boxes times 9 ounces... that's 225 ounces!  

But wait, it wants the answer in pounds, and there's 16 ounces in a pound... so 225 divided by 16...  

That's 14 pounds!  



"
"Well, lemme see... that's a mighty big tree!  He can use most of it, 'cept for the tippy top and the bottom.  He makes them logs four feet long, and then chops 'em up into planks.  Five planks from each log, he said.  And he sells each plank for a buck twenty.  Hmm...  Let me count on my fingers...  

...

He makes ninety-six dollars! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Valerie makes 5000 bucks a month, and that's half what her brother makes. So her brother makes 5000 times 2, which is 10,000 bucks. Together they make 5000 plus 10,000, so that's 15,000. Their momma makes double that, so she makes 15,000 times 2, which is 30,000.  Add it all up, 5000 plus 10,000 plus 30,000... that's 45,000 bucks!


45000 

"
"Well, lemme see... she walks 2 miles on the beach and that takes her 40 minutes.  So, that's like 20 minutes a mile.  Then she walks another mile on the sidewalk, but she's faster there.  Hmm...  If she's twice as fast, that's like 10 minutes for that mile. So, all together, it's 40 minutes plus 10 minutes... that's 50 minutes!


50 

"
"Well, lemme see... she saves 4 bucks a week, right? And she's been doin' that for 8 weeks, so that's 4 times 8... hmm... carry the one... that's 32 bucks she's got.

She wants 60 bucks, so she needs 28 more.  

If she saves 4 bucks a week, that's 7 more weeks to get to 60.


7 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Three trees with seven birdies each... that's a lotta birdies!  Then two more trees with four birdies... and one more with just three.  Gosh, I gotta count 'em all up...  

*counts on fingers*

Thirty-two! There's thirty-two birdies in all those trees. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  If he gets a whole bunch more, he has 60.  But if he loses some, he has less.  So it's gotta be less than 60...  I think it's 26. 


26
"
"Well, lemme see... that Donny's a picky drinker, huh?  Needs his water just so.  

So he's got one jug that's kinda cold, right?  33 degrees.  Not gonna cut it.  But he mixes in some from another jug, just a little bit, and BAM! It's good to go.

That other jug gotta be pretty darn hot to make up for that cold one.  I'd say it's gotta be at least 68 degrees, maybe even hotter! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens, right?  Then he gets more cows and chickens every day for three weeks.  That's a lotta animals!  

Let's see... 20 cows a day for three weeks... that's like... a whole bunch! And 10 chickens a day... that's a lot of clucking!  

I dunno the exact number, but it's gotta be a lot more than he started with.  Probably... 700 animals? Maybe? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... he buys four of them bagel packs, right? And each one costs ten bucks. So that's forty dollars. But then he gets some money off, ten percent they said.  That's like, four dollars off, I think. So it's thirty-six dollars now.  And he gets thirty-six bagels, cuz each pack has nine. So each bagel costs a dollar, I guess.


$1.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Gomer ate some mashed potatoes, right?  He ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so that's like... 18 scoops?  And it takes, like, a few potatoes to make a scoop, somethin' like that.  I dunno, maybe 3 potatoes for 2 scoops?  So, if he ate 18 scoops, that's a lotta potatoes...  

Let's see... 18 times... 1.5...  

That's 27 potatoes! 


27
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He eats three a day for a whole month, that's like, thirty times three... ninety eggs! Then he eats five a day for another month, so that's five times thirty... one fifty!  Add those together, that's a lotta eggs... two forty!  Now, how many dozens is that?  A dozen's twelve, right? So two forty divided by twelve...  

20 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa jelly beans!  So there's 17 green ones, and double that in red, so that's... 34 red ones.  That's a lotta red!  So that's 17 plus 34, which is... 51.  So if there's 60 all together, that means there's 60 minus 51... which is 9 blue ones!


9 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 5 trees, 6 lemons each... that's a lotta lemons!  So, 5 times 6 is... 30!  But that's just for one year. A decade is like, ten years, right? So 30 times 10...  carry the one... that's 300 lemons! 


300 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so there's 5 fellas for every 9 ladies on the bus, right? And there's 84 folks in total.  If 20 ladies get off, that means there's gotta be...  *counts on fingers* ... 34 ladies left on the bus.

"Hmm, lemme see... Faraday sells sunflowers for two bucks a pop and them fancy bouquets for eight bucks.  Each bouquet has a whole lotta sunflowers, like twelve of 'em. He makes twenty-six bucks from the single sunflowers and fifty-six from the bouquets every day.  

So, over three days, he makes a lotta money from sunflowers, right?  I'd say he sold a whole bunch, maybe like... twelve sunflowers? 


12 

"
"Well, lemme see... He's got a hundred bucks, right? And each rock costs five. So he can buy twenty rocks.  He sells 'em for seven each, but only sells, what was it, sixty percent?  Hmm... that's twelve rocks. Twelve times seven is eighty-four.  So he made eighty-four bucks, but spent a hundred.  That means he lost... sixteen dollars! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... she draws 5 big pictures a day, so those'll take her 9 days.  The medium ones, she does 6 a day, so that's 6 days. And the little ones, 7 a day, so that's 7 days.  

Altogether, that's 9 plus 6 plus 7...  carry the one...  that's 22 days! 



"
"Well, lemme see... three dozen eggs is a whole lotta eggs!  That's like, three times twelve, right? So that's... thirty-six eggs. And she's got four kids.  So if ya split 'em up even, each kid gets nine eggs.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He went 110 miles then another 140, so that's a whole lotta miles, right?  Like 250 miles! And he did it in 2 hours plus 3 more, so 5 hours total.  

That means he went 50 miles each hour. 


50
"
"Hmm, lemme see... so he's got one ticket with a one in five chance, right? And the other one's way better, like three times better. So that's like, three outta five?  So if both hit, that's gotta be...  12%, I think? 



"
"Well, lemme see... Jim got 27, and that's 5 more than Carlos, so Carlos got 22.  Carrey got half of what Carlos got, so that's 11.  Add 'em all up, 27 plus 22 plus 11 is 60.  Then they split 'em even, so each gets 20. 


20 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He eats four carrots each day, right? So that's like, four times five, which is twenty. And then on the weekend he eats five each day, so that's ten more.  Twenty plus ten... that's thirty carrots! 


30 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Five minutes plus... uh... sixty percent of five... that's like, a little more than half, right? So, maybe like eight minutes for the second song?  That makes thirteen minutes total, I think. 


13 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He buys 'em for 20 bucks and sells 'em for 40, so he makes 20 bucks on each one.  He bought 2 on Monday, so that's 20 bucks times 2, which is 40 bucks. Then he bought 4 on Tuesday, so that's 20 bucks times 4, which is 80 bucks.  Add those together and he made 40 plus 80, which is 120 bucks!

"Hmm, lemme see... so they make a lotta juice, right?  Like, enough for a whole bunch of folks to get some energy. But they wanna make enough for everyone to get ALL their energy from the juice.  

That's a lot of juice!  Gotta figure out how much more they need to make.  

Let's see... 2300 people need a whole lotta energy, way more than what the juice gives 'em now.  

I reckon they gotta make a whole heap more bottles, like...  7300 more, maybe? 



"
"Well, lemme see... She's got eight babies, right? And three-quarters of 'em wear purple, so that's like six babies. The rest wear blue, so that's two.  

Now, half the purple babies got bows, so that's three babies with bows. And the blue babies both got bows too, so that's five babies with bows total.

So, if you see a baby with a bow, there's a... hmm...  three outta five chance it's wearin' purple.  That's like, 60%, I think?


60 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got a whole bunch of papers, right?  

So, they got a bunch on Monday and Tuesday, then some more on Thursday and Friday.  That's a lotta papers! If they got 5168 all week, and we know how many they got on some days, we gotta figure out how many they got on Wednesday.

Let's see... 5168 minus the ones from the other days...  

That's gotta be... 1125! 



"
"Okay, so this fella Abraham had some land, right?  He sold half of it for fifty bucks. Then he sold some more, like a quarter of what he had left, for thirty bucks.  He sold the rest for three bucks a piece.  Hmm, lemme see... that's a lotta numbers!

I think there's still 9 eggs hidin'.

"
"Okay, so this John guy picks up trash from a bunch of apartments.  The first two got 200 apartments each, so that's 200 plus 200, which is 400.  Then the last one is way bigger, like 60% more than those two put together.  So that's like, 400 times 0.60, which is 240 more apartments.  So that last one has 400 plus 240, which is 640 apartments.

Now, he goes to all those apartments three times a week, so that's a lot of trash!  He gets 40 cents for each apartment every time he goes, so let's see... 400 plus 400 plus 640 is 1440 apartments.  And he goes three times a week, so that's 1440 times 3, which is 4320 times.  

So he makes 4320 times 40 cents...  carry the one... that's $1728.00 a week!  That's a lot of money for pickin' up trash!



$1728.00

I think the red one is 20 long. 



"
"Well, Ronnie had five bucks, right? And Rissa got three times that, so she had fifteen. They both gave some to their little sister, and Rissa still had most of her money, like four-fifths.  That means Ronnie must have only two dollars left.

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  It's half yellow, so that's like 6 pints, right?  And the rest is split between the other colors. So that's 6 pints split three ways...  That's 2 pints each!

"Well, lemme see... she sees 3 on Monday. Then double that on Tuesday, so that's 6. Then double that on Wednesday, so 12. Then double that on Thursday, so 24. And double that on Friday, so 48.

93
"
"Hmm, lemme see... so you get more pods for the same price, right?  That's good!  If you get 100 pods for a dollar, and now you get more...  I think you could do like, 10 washes for a dollar, maybe?

"Okay, so he takes out a bunch of twenties, right?  Like, fifty of 'em. Then he loses some, ten I think? So that's, uh, forty left. He spends half, so that's twenty gone.  Leaves him with twenty. Then he gets three times more, so that's sixty of those twenties.  That's a lotta money!  He changes 'em all to fives, so... hmm... lemme see...  

That's a lot of fives!  Gotta be... two hundred and forty, I think.


**Answer:** 240 

"
"Team A got 4 goals first, and the other team got 2 less, so that's 2 goals. Then, the other team got 8 goals, and Team A got 2. So, Team A got 6 in total, and the other team got 10. That's 16 goals all together!

"Hmm, lemme see... so Marcellus bought a whole lotta milk, right?  Four thousand gallons! But some of it went bad, like, a lotta it. Two outta every five gallons, he said.  So that's... a lot of bad milk.

$5600 

"
"Okay, so Wendy's way older than Colin, right?  Like, in seven years, she's gonna be five times as old as Colin will be then. And then, way down the road, in 25 years, Colin's gonna be a third of Wendy's age now.  Hmm... that's tricky.

Let me see... Colin must be, like, 20 now. Yeah, that sounds about right.


20 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He's got 27,000 bucks and three schools. So that's 9,000 for each school, right?  And each hundred books cost 500 bucks.  So if he spends all 9,000 at one school, that's like 18 sets of 100 books.  

So he can buy 1800 books for each school! 


1800
"
"Well, lemme see... Two apples fall, one bonks the fella on the head. He grabs 'em both, tosses one back up, and bam! Five more come down. He grabs those, keeps one, chucks the other back up, and six more fall. He grabs all them apples, and that's a whole lotta apples!

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Digimon's been around for a while, right?  John's 28 now, and he was twice as old as Jim when that came out... so Jim musta been, like, half John's age back then.  That'd make him... 14?  Nah, wait...

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she works a lot, like 7 and a half hours each day, six days a week.  That's a lotta work! And she makes a dollar fifty an hour. So, that's... lemme grab a pen and paper...  

Okay, so that's 11 dollars and 25 cents a day. Times six days, that's 67 dollars and 50 cents a week.  

Now, April has four weeks, so that's 270 dollars a month. Oh, and she gets an extra 10 bucks for comin' to work every day. So, that's 280 dollars total!

$280.00 

"
"Lemme see... he gets three bucks for laundry, a dollar fifty for his room, seventy-five cents for the trash, and fifty cents each time he does the dishes.  He did dishes six times, so that's three bucks. Laundry once, so that's three more. Trash twice, so that's a dollar fifty. And his room once, another dollar fifty.  

Add it all up... three plus three plus one fifty plus one fifty... that's nine dollars!

So, 50 plus 40 plus 80 plus 150...  carry the one... that's 320 people! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Five packs of red, and twice that in black... so that's ten packs of black.  That's a lotta pens!  Five plus ten is fifteen packs.  And each pack has five... so fifteen times five...

The next day he planted ten more White Oaks, so that's thirty now. And them Pines, he planted even more, like fifty of 'em!  

So, all together, I reckon he planted... hmm...  carry the one...  that's a whole bunch of trees!  One hundred and forty, I think! 



"
"Well, lemme see... Fred had a whole bunch of root beer, right?  Then his kids drank some, then his wife messed up and spilled some, and then his buddy drank some too.  By the time the party came around, there was only 8 gallons left.  And since there were 4 folks at the party, they each got 2 gallons.

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa fishies!  A third of 'em are red, so that's like... 20 somethin'?  Then some of the rest are blue...  Maybe 'round 20 of them too?  So, like, 20 plus 20... that's 40 fishies!

"
"Hmm, lemme see... She had two of them eyeshadow thingymajigs with four colors each, so that's eight colors. Then she had three sets with six colors each, so that's eighteen more.  That's a lotta colors!  Twenty-six in all. But her sister took one of the eyeshadow thingymajigs, so that's four less.  So twenty-two left. And she used up some from one of the sets... half of six is three, right? So she's got nineteen left.


19 

"
"Well, Mattison's a short fella, ain't he?  Let's see... his house is seven times taller than him, so that's like... a whole lotta inches! And the first floor's three times his height, so that's a bunch too.  Hmm... if you take away Mattison and the first floor from the whole house, that's gotta be the second floor, right?  

So I'm thinkin' it's 180 inches. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... They found a whole lotta shells, 700!  The Alphas got a bunch, like, 40% of 'em. That's a lot! Then The Finders got most of the rest, 60% of what was left. So the Gogetters, they gotta have what's left over, right?  

Let me count on my fingers...  

168 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... four dogs, huh?  One needs a mile, another needs four, and the third needs three.  They gotta walk three miles each on average, so that's twelve miles total.  If you add up the first three, that's eight miles.  So the last dog must need... four miles! 



"
"Well, lemme see... He got a loan for, like, 40% of his house, which is worth a whole lotta money, 250,000 big ones! So that's 100,000 bucks he got. Then he used most of it, 60%, to pay off what he owed.  That's 60,000 gone. So he had 40,000 left over. 


$40,000
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He caught three big ol' fish, right?  One was fifty-six somethin's, another was forty-six somethin's, and the last one was twenty-six somethin's.  They said each somethin' is worth fifty cents.  So, gotta add up those somethin's first... that's, uh... one twenty-eight somethin's!  Now, times that by fifty cents...  Carry the one...  That's sixty-four dollars!


$64.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she buys 'em for 72 bucks, right? And she sells 'em for, what's that, 11 eighths of that?  That's like, a bit more than 72.  So, if she sells 'em for more than she buys 'em, she makes a profit, right?  I'd say she makes... 27 bucks profit. 



"
"Well, lemme see...  He runs it on low for three days, so that's like, three liters gone, right? Then medium is double low, so that's six liters more. And high is double medium, so that's... lemme see... twelve more?  

So, three plus six plus twelve... that's twenty-one liters! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... they had a whole bunch of packs of balloons, like ten of 'em. And each pack had, like, thirty balloons, I think?  So that's a lotta balloons!  But then they had some left over, only twelve.  So they musta thrown... a whole lotta balloons!  

288

"Hmm, lemme see... 14 plus 14 plus 14, that's 42.  So that's 56 all together for one of them thingy-ma-bobs.  Now, 8 of them...  carry the one...  that's 448! 


448 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Ali's class is big, holds a whole lotta kids, 120! John's got two classes, but they're smaller, like a slice of Ali's.  If Ali's is cut into 8 pieces, each of John's is one piece. So, each of John's classes is 120 divided by 8, which is 15 kids.  Two of those is 15 times 2, that's 30 kids.  

So, all together, it's 120 plus 30... that's 150 kids! 



"
"Okay, so he borrows 300 bucks, right? And he gotta give back a little extra, 2% they said.  That's like, 6 bucks more. So now he owes 306 bucks total.

He pays 25 bucks every month for 11 months, so that's 275 bucks.  

That means he still owes 31 bucks at the end.

There's actually 900 red ones in there.  How far off was his guess?

Hmm, lemme see...  That's a lotta jelly beans!  I dunno, maybe... 36? 



"
"Okay, so the bus starts with 20 folks. Then 40 more get on, so that's 60. Then some more get on, like, half the number from before, so that's 20 more. Now there's 80 people. Then they double, so that's 160.  The bus holds 200, so you gotta fit 40 more people on there.

40 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... She goes three times a year, so that's 3 times 5 years... that's 15 times.  And each time it cost two dollars, so that's 15 times 2... that's 30 bucks.

But then it goes up by, uh, a whole lotta percent... 150%!  So now it's 2 plus... carry the one...  that's 5 dollars a pop!

She goes for three more years, so that's 3 times 3... 9 times.  And 9 times 5 is... 45 dollars.

So all together, it's 30 plus 45... that's 75 dollars! 


75
"
"Well, lemme see... they got 10 kids in each grade, and only 8 can go in the room at a time. So, that's like, two groups from each grade, right?  And there's four grades... so that's eight groups total.

Each group gets 45 minutes, so that's like... eight times 45...  

*counts on fingers*

That's 360 minutes! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... four tables at twenty bucks a pop... that's eighty dollars.  Then two roof things for ten each... so that's twenty more. Eighty plus twenty...  

  

100 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He's got a big ol' board, right? Forty feet long.  And he wants to chop it up so one piece is way bigger than the other.  Four times bigger, he says.  

That means if the little piece is, say, 8 feet, the big one's gotta be 32 feet.  'Cause 8 times 4 is 32. 

So the big piece is 32 feet. 


32
"
"Well, lemme see... he makes 16 meatballs outta each pound o' meat, and he wants 80 meatballs... so that's 80 divided by 16... which is 5 pounds o' meat.  He puts two spoonfuls o' that fancy seasoning in every pound, so that's 5 times 2...  

10 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... five windows, each one's 35 inches... so that's like, 35 plus 35 plus 35 plus 35 plus 35...  carry the one...  that's 175 inches.  But he needs double that, right? So, 175 times two...  that's 350 inches of fabric! 


350
"
"Hmm, lemme see... so it's a quarter for each minute, right?  But then it gets cheaper after a bit.  So, that's like, 16 times a quarter, which is four bucks. Then it's 20 more minutes at 20 cents a pop... so that's...  carry the one...  four more bucks!

So, eight bucks total. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... It rained two inches already, and they say tomorrow it's gonna rain more.  They said it'll be like double that, plus one more inch. So, double two inches is four, and then add one more... that's five inches!

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she bakes some cupcakes, right? And then she makes way more brownies, like, three times more but takes away two.  Then she gotta have enough for everyone in her class, five kids times two treats each...  

That's a lotta treats!  I think she made 3 cupcakes. 



"
"Okay, so she gets the manicure and pedicure, that's 35 plus 40, so 75 bucks.  But wait, they take off 20 bucks 'cause she's doin' both. So that's 75 minus 20, which is 55.  Then she wants them fancy nails, 3 bucks a pop, and she got ten fingers, so that's 30 more bucks.  So all together, it's 55 plus 30, which is 85 dollars.


$85 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she gets 3 magazines that come 12 times a year, so that's a lotta magazines!  Then she gets one that comes 6 times. And another one that comes 4 times as much as the 6 one... so that's 6 times 4...  carry the one...  that's 24!  So all together, she gets a whole bunch, like 36 plus 6 plus 24...  

66 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Samantha has 27, and Shelley has more... 12 more... so Shelley has 39.  And Kim has less than Shelley... 8 less... so Kim has 31.

"
"Okay, so Charlie makes $80 for each lesson, right? But he gives some lessons cheaper to veterans.  He takes off a quarter of his money, so that's like $20 off. So for veterans, he makes $60.

He does four regular lessons, so that's 4 times $80, which is $320.

Then he does two lessons for veterans, so that's 2 times $60, which is $120.

If you add those together, it's $320 plus $120, which is $440.


$440
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa numbers there.  Add 'em all up... that's 630 somethin'. Now, how many numbers was that? Nine, right? So, 630 somethin' divided by nine...  That's gotta be... 70!

"
"Well, lemme see... Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used a whole bunch more, like 5 times more, to make juice. That's a lotta grapes! Then their momma used some for pies, 12 grapes for each one, and she made 4 pies.  Hmm, that's a lot of countin'.  I think they musta started with, like, 84 grapes. 


84

Carry the one...  

Five hundred and twenty dollars!

The bottom one holds double that, so that's forty. And the top one holds five less than the bottom, so that's thirty-five.  All together, that's, uh... fifty-five books per bookcase. She's got a hundred and ten books, so she needs... two bookcases!

She needs to get...  uh...  35 right on the second one, I think.

375 

"
"Let's see... they got 4 people, one flashlight each, so that's 4. Then each room needs two flashlights, and there's 8 rooms, so that's 16 more.  

Now the candles... some rooms got 4 little candles, some got 5 bigger ones.  Hmm... half the rooms is 4 rooms, so that's 16 little candles and 20 big ones.  

Altogether, that's a whole lotta candles and flashlights!  I think it's 40.

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Five minutes for the first one, then the next two take twice as long, so that's ten minutes each.  Then the last two are half the first one, so two and a half minutes each.  

So, five plus ten plus ten plus two and a half plus two and a half...  That's thirty minutes! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... 20 helmets... and half as many robots... so that's 10 robots. And half as many helmets as footballs, so that's 40 footballs.

30
"
"Hmm, lemme see... 20 plants is a lot!  Some need half a cup, some need a whole cup, and some need just a little bit.  

Let's see... four plants need half a cup, so that's like two cups total. Then eight plants need a whole cup each, so that's eight cups.  And the rest need a quarter cup... that's eight plants, so that's like two more cups.

So, two plus eight plus two... that's twelve cups!

"
"Well, lemme see... Phineas hopped 100 yards, and that took him 5 minutes 'cause he's a fast hopper. Then he swam 100 yards, and that took him 10 minutes 'cause swimmin's slower. So, all together, it took him 15 minutes to get home. 


15

"Hmm, lemme see... He needs 56 of them sticks, and they come 8 in a pack.  So that's... uh... seven packs, I think.  And each pack is two bucks, right? So seven times two...  carry the one... that's fourteen dollars!

"
"Lemme see... she takes five shirts, two pants, and a skirt every week.  Shirts cost five bucks a pop, the skirt's six, and pants are eight.  So that's... lemme add that up... 25 for the shirts, 16 for the pants, and 6 for the skirt.  That's 47 bucks every week.  

Now, she does this for five weeks, so it's 47 times five...  

That's 235 dollars! 



"
"Well, lemme see... he talks real fast now, like 3 times faster!  So if he talks 150 words a minute, now he talks 375 words a minute!  That's a lotta words!

If you add all that up, 50 plus 70 plus 140 plus 240...  carry the one... that's 500 people! 


500
"
"Well, lemme see... he starts with 20, then gets 3 times that, so that's like 60 more. Then it's 4 times the first amount, so that's 80. Then it slows down to half, so that's 40. And then some more pop from the heat, like 10 more.  

So, 20 plus 60 plus 80 plus 40 plus 10...  

That's 210 pieces! 



"
"Lemme see... he needs 4 gallons of regular lemonade, and that takes a whole lotta lemons.  Each gallon needs 6 lemons for the juice, so that's 4 times 6... which is 24 lemons.  

Then his buddy wants an extra gallon, but super sour. That's like double the lemons, so that's another 12.

So, all together, he needs 24 plus 12... that's 36 lemons!

"Well, lemme see... He drove west for 5 hours, then back east for 8.  That's a lot of drivin'! If he goes 18 miles every hour, that's... hmm... 5 times 18 is 90 miles west. Then 8 times 18 is 144 miles east.  So he went further east, right?  

144 minus 90... that's 54! He's 54 miles from home. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... that boat started at nine thousand bucks, right?  First year it lost, like, a third of its value... so that's, uh... three thousand?  So it's worth six thousand now.  Then it loses another third... so that's another two thousand gone.  Now it's at four thousand somethin'.  Last year it loses twenty percent... that's, like, eight hundred bucks?  So the boat's worth... lemme see...

And she took the bus a bunch of times, seven times I think. Each bus ride was, like, ten percent of the hotel, so that's eight bucks a ride. Seven times eight... that's fifty-six.  So, two-forty plus fifty-six...  

Two ninety-six! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Mazie had a bunch of marbles, right?  Fifty-two! And she gave some to Dallas, but he lost some.  He only has twenty-one now, but he lost four, so he musta had twenty-five before.  That means Darla got the rest... so that's like, fifty-two minus twenty-five...  

27 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Two grownups at twelve bucks a pop, that's twenty-four.  Little one's ticket is eight bucks.  Popcorn's three bucks each, so that's six.  Add it all up... twenty-four plus eight plus six...  That's thirty-eight dollars!
