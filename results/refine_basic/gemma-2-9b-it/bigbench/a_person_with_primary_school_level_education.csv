"Let's figure this out!

We know the flutist lives in the second house.  

The person with tulips lives right next to the guitarist, and the person with lilies lives right next to the person with carnations.

Hmm...  If the flutist is in the second house, and there's someone else between the flutist and the pianist, the pianist must be in either the fourth house.

So, the tulips must be in the first house!


The answer is **(C) 1**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We have three houses, and each has someone living there.  They each like different fruits, drinks, colors, play different instruments, and have different toys.

*  Someone likes green and lives in the first house.
*  Someone eats kiwis and lives in the first house.

Hmm, that means the person who likes green and the person who eats kiwis are the same person!

Let's see...

* The root beer person lives before the grape person.
* The TV person lives before the root beer person.
* The water person lives before the root beer person.

So, it looks like the order is water, TV, root beer, grapes.

* The cellist and the gameboy person live next to each other, but there's one house between the cellist and the gameboy person.
* The percussionist doesn't live in the second house.

Thinking about all of this... I think the cellist lives in **house number 2**. 



"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see...

We know some people live in certain houses and like certain things.  

*  Someone eats kiwis in house number 5.
*  The person who likes red lives in house number 2.
*  The person who likes red and the cricketer are next to each other.

Hmm...  I need to think about the other clues and see if I can figure out where the person who likes green lives.  


Let me see...  (pauses to think)

I think the person who likes green lives in **house number 4**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We know some people live in different houses and like different things.  

* Someone lives in the first house and likes apples.
* Someone in the third house wears high heels.

Hmm, let's see...

* The truck driver lives next to the SUV driver, but the truck driver is also to the right of the tea drinker. That means the tea drinker must be in house number 2!

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5!  

(A) 5 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We have three houses, and each house has someone living in it.  

* One person plays soccer, one plays basketball, and one swims.
* One person eats bananas, one eats mangos, and one eats oranges.
* One person has tulips, one has lilies, and one has daffodils.

Here are some clues to help us:

1. The soccer player lives to the left of the person who eats oranges.
2. The swimmer and the person with daffodils live next to each other.
3. The person with tulips lives to the right of the person who eats mangos.
4. The person with daffodils lives to the right of the person who eats oranges.

Hmm... let me think...

If the swimmer and the daffodils are together, and the daffodils are to the right of the oranges, then the swimmer must be in house 2 or 3.

Since the soccer player is to the left of the oranges, the soccer player can't be in house 3.

That means the soccer player must be in house 1, and the oranges are in house 2.

So the daffodils must be in house 3!


**The answer is (C).** 




"
"Let's figure this out!

We know the violinist lives in the first house.  

Hmm, the person with tulips and the phone live next to each other, but not in the first house.  

And the history book person lives to the right of the tulips.

So, the tulips must be in the last house!


**The answer is (A).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it.  Each person has different things: a gameboy, a phone, and a computer. They also have different flowers, play different instruments, and have different pets.  

Here's what we know:

* Someone who likes birds doesn't live in the first house.
* The person who likes mystery books lives in the second house.
* Someone who likes birds doesn't live in the third house.
* The person who likes history books lives next to the person with lilies.

* The person who likes fish doesn't live in the first house.
* The person with a gameboy lives next to the person with roses.
* The person who plays the cello doesn't live in the third house.

Hmm... let me think.  

Since the mystery book person is in the second house, and the gameboy person lives next to the rose person, the gameboy person must live in the **first** house! 


**So the answer is (A).** 
"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.  

We have five houses, and each person has something different: fruit, a pet, a device, and flowers.  We need to find out which house the person with the phone lives in.

Hmm, let's look at the clues:

*  Someone with carnations lives to the right of the fish person.
*  The radio isn't in the fourth house.
*  The dog owner lives right next to the lilies.
*  The horse person lives to the left of the grape person.
*  The gameboy person lives right next to the rose person.
*  The daffodils aren't in the first house.
*  There's one house between the apple person and the orange person.
*  There are two houses between the banana person and the cat person.
*  The computer isn't in the fifth house.

*  The radio and carnations are next to each other.
*  There's one house between the banana person and the carnations person.

Let me think...  I need to write down all the clues and see if I can figure out where everyone lives! 


This is a lot of information! It might take me a while to figure it out.  

"
"Hmm, let's think about this!

One person wears sandals and the other wears boots.  One person likes mysteries and the other likes history books.  One person drives a convertible and the other drives a truck.

We know the person with the convertible lives right next to the person who likes history books.  And the person with the boots doesn't live in the first house.

So, maybe the person with the sandals lives in the first house! 

The answer is **(A)**! 



"
"Let's figure this out!

We know the golfer lives in the first house.  

The swimmer lives right next to the person who likes romance books.  

The mystery book person lives right next to the history book person.

The basketball player doesn't live in the last house.

Hmm... that means the basketball player must live in the last house!


So the answer is **(C)**. 
"
"The mystery book reader lives in house number 3!  

That's what it says in one of the clues.  
"
"Let's think about this puzzle!

We know these things:

* Someone has a phone, someone has a computer, and someone has a gameboy.
* Someone likes yellow, someone likes blue, and someone likes green.

And here are the clues:

1. The green person lives right next to the gameboy person.
2. The gameboy person lives right next to the computer person.
3. The yellow person doesn't live in the middle house.

Hmm... if the gameboy person is next to the computer person, and the green person is next to the gameboy person, then they must all be together in a line!

Since the yellow person can't be in the middle, they must be in one of the other houses.  

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We have four houses, and each has someone living there.  They all like different colors, drinks, and books.  

Here's what we know:

* Someone who likes root beer lives in the third house.
* Someone who likes red lives in the third house too!

Hmm, that means the root beer lover likes red!

We also know:

* The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
* The history book buff doesn't live in the last house.
* The romance book lover doesn't live in the first house.
* The mystery book reader doesn't live in the last house.

Let's see...  

(Thinking hard)...

I think the coffee drinker lives in house **(B) 4**! 



"
"Let's figure this out!

* We know the fantasy book person lives in the first house.
* Pizza wasn't eaten in the first house.
* The green person lives next to the radio person.
* The fish person doesn't live in the first house.

Hmm... that means the green person and the radio person must be in the second house!  

So the cat person must live in the second house too!


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"This is a tricky puzzle!  Let's see if we can figure it out.  

It says there are five houses, and each house has a different person living in it.  Each person likes different things, like different pets, books, food, colors, and drinks.  We have to use the clues to figure out who lives in which house and what they like.

Hmm, the clues are a bit confusing.  Let's start with the easy ones.  We know the dog owner lives in the second house. That's a good start!

Let me know if you want me to keep trying!  It's a bit hard to do all this in my head. 

"
"The person who eats kiwis lives in house number 1!  

That's what clue number 8 says.  
"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

We know there are five houses, and each person has different things: fruit, lunch, and flowers.  

*  Someone has roses, someone has daffodils, someone has tulips, someone has carnations, and someone has lilies.
*  Someone ate oranges, apples, grapes, kiwis, and mangos.
*  Someone had grilled cheese, stew, fried rice, spaghetti, and pizza.

We have some clues to help us figure out who lives where!

* The person who had grilled cheese and the person who had stew live right next to each other.
* The person who had grilled cheese lives right next to the person with tulips.

Hmm... that's a lot of ""right next to""!  

We also know that the person with tulips doesn't live in the last house, and the person with daffodils doesn't live in the last house either.

If we keep thinking about these clues and putting them together, we can figure out where everyone lives!

"
"Let's figure this out!

* We know the cat lover is in the first house.

* The tulip person lives right next to the dog person.  

* The daffodil person doesn't live in the second house.

* There's one house between the horse person and the carnation person.

* The lily person lives after the horse person.

Hmm... thinking... thinking...

If the cat person is in the first house, and the tulip person is next to the dog person, then the tulip person must be in the second house.  That means the dog person is in the third house!

Since the daffodil person isn't in the second house, they must be in the fourth house.

The lily person lives after the horse person, and the only place left for them is the fourth house. That means the horse person must be in the third house.

The only pet left is the fish, so the fish person must be in the first house!


The fish enthusiast lives in house **(C) 1**. 
"
"Let's think about the clues!

* One person has a phone and lives in the first house.
* The person with boots doesn't live in the second house.
* The person with horses and the person with a radio live next to each other.

Hmm... if the phone is in the first house, and the boots aren't in the second house, that means the boots must be in the first house!  

And since the horses and radio are together, they must be in the second house.

So, the person with the high heels must live in the second house!


The answer is **(A) 2**.

Hmm...  Let me think...

If the fantasy book lover is in the third house, the history book lover must be in the second house.  

The apple eater can't be in the third house, so they must be in the first house. That means the person in running shoes is next to them.

The mango eater is next to the sandal wearer, and the banana eater is to the right of the fantasy book lover.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* One person lives in each house.
* One person ate stew and the other ate spaghetti.
* One person likes white and the other likes red.
* One person drinks water and the other drinks milk.
* One person wears running shoes and the other wears loafers.

And here are the clues:

1. The person wearing running shoes doesn't live in the first house.
2. The person who likes white lives right next to the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live right next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live right next to each other.

Hmm...  Let me think...

If the person wearing running shoes doesn't live in the first house, they must live in the second house.

And if the person who likes white lives next to the person who ate spaghetti, they must be in the first and second houses.

The baseball player and the spaghetti eater live next to each other, so they must be in the first and second houses too!

The person who drinks water and the spaghetti eater live next to each other, so they must be in the first and second houses too!

So, the person wearing loafers must live in the **first house**!




**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Hmm, this is a tricky one!  Let's see...

*  The root beer lover doesn't live in the middle house.
*  The person who likes oranges also doesn't live in the middle house.

That means the root beer lover could live in the first house or the last house!  We need more clues to figure out for sure.

"Let's think about this puzzle!

* Someone ate spaghetti in the first house.
* The person with loafers doesn't live in the first house.
* Fried rice wasn't eaten in the second house.
* The person with boots lives right next to the person who ate fried rice.

Hmm... if the person with boots is next to the fried rice person, they can't be in the last house.  That means the person with loafers must live in the second house!

* One person drives a convertible and the other drives a minivan.

"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

We know:

*  There are five houses, and each has someone living in it.

"
"Let's think about the clues!

* One person plays the guitar and the other plays the cello.

* One person has a dog and the other has a fish.

The clue says the cello player lives next to the gameboy player.  

And the clue says the dog doesn't live in the first house.

* Someone with a gameboy lives in house number 3.
* The minivan is in house number 1.

Hmm...  

* The phone is next to the SUV, but not the gameboy.
* The radio is past the gameboy.

That means the SUV can't be in house 3 or 4.  

* The computer isn't in house 1.

So, the SUV must be in house number 2!


**Answer: (D) 2**

* Daffodils aren't in the fourth house.
* Roses are next to carnations.

Hmm...  Let's see...

If the phone is next to the TV, and tulips are in the third house, then the phone must be in the first house and the TV in the second.

Since lilies are to the right of the phone, they must be in the fourth house.

And if roses are next to carnations, and lilies are in the fourth house, then the roses must be in the third house and the carnations in the fourth!

* There's one house between the person who owns horses and the person wearing boots.

*  Since the cricketer is in house 2 and the person wearing loafers lives next to them, the person wearing loafers must be in house 1.
*  The bird keeper is in house 1, and there's one house between them and the person wearing sandals, so the person wearing sandals must be in house 3.
*  The baseball player lives to the right of the person wearing sandals (house 3), so they must be in house 4 or 5.

* Stew is before spaghetti.
* Root beer is after sandals.
* Water is after grilled cheese.
* Running shoes are before stew.
* High heels and water are next to each other.
* Grilled cheese isn't in the first house.

Hmm...  Let's try putting some things together.  Maybe the first house has grilled cheese and water, since they have to be next to each other and water is after grilled cheese.

And since running shoes are before stew, and stew is before spaghetti, maybe the order looks like this:

1. Grilled Cheese, Water
2. Running Shoes
3. Tea
4. Stew, Spaghetti

But wait! We also know root beer is after sandals.  That means sandals can't be in the last house.  

Let's try this:

1. Sandals, Grilled Cheese, Water
2. Running Shoes
3. Tea
4. Stew, Spaghetti, Root Beer

That fits all the clues!

We know:

* Someone has a radio in house number 3.

"Hmm, let's think about this!

One person likes science fiction books and the other likes history books.  

The person who ate fried rice lives next to the science fiction fan, but on the right.

* We know the pianist lives in the first house.
* The root beer lover lives next to the horse owner, so the horse owner can't be in the first house.
* The person who likes white doesn't live in the second house.

Hmm... that means the horse owner must live in the second house!  And since the root beer lover is next to the horse owner, the root beer lover must also live in the second house.

So, the dog owner must live in the first house!

"Let's think about this puzzle!

We know:

* Someone eats apples, someone eats oranges, and someone eats mangos.

* The mango eater lives in the house right before the apple eater (house number 2).
* The coffee drinker doesn't live in the middle house (number 2).
* The coffee drinker lives right next to the milk drinker.

So, since the coffee drinker can't be in house 2, they must be in house 1.  And if the coffee drinker is in house 1, the milk drinker must be in house 3!

*  One person wears boots, one wears running shoes, and one wears loafers.
*  One person has carnations, one has tulips, and one has lilies.
*  One person likes red, one likes green, and one likes white.

3. The person who likes white lives right next to the person with tulips.
4. The person with carnations lives in the first house.
5. The person with boots doesn't live in the third house.
6. The history book person lives to the right of the person with tulips.
7. The person with tulips lives to the left of the person who likes red.

The answer is **(A) 3**. 


"
"Let's figure this out!

* We know the person who likes water lives in the first house.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know:

* Someone in the first house wears loafers.
* The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

"
"The yellow person lives in house number 1!

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We have three houses, and each has a different person living in it.  

* One person has a computer, one has a radio, and one has a TV.
* Each person has different flowers: carnations, roses, or tulips.
* And they each play a different sport: golf, soccer, or tennis.

Here are the clues:

1. The tennis player lives to the left of the person with the TV.
2. The golfer doesn't live in the middle house.
3. The person with the computer and the person with the tulips live next to each other.
4. The person with the radio lives to the right of the person with the roses.
5. The person with the radio lives to the right of the person with the TV.

Hmm... let me think...

* If the tennis player is to the left of the TV, the TV can't be in the last house.
* The golfer can't be in the middle house, so they must be in house 1 or 3.
* The computer and tulips are together, so they must be in houses 1 and 2.
* The radio is to the right of the roses and the TV, so the radio must be in house 3.

So, the person with the computer lives in **house 2**!

* The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
* Baseball and basketball are right next to each other.
* Daffodils are in the fifth house.
* There are two houses between the sandals and the cellist.

Hmm... that's a lot! Let me see...

If the daffodils are in the fifth house and running shoes are next to them, then the running shoes must be in the fourth house.

Since the cricketer is in the fourth house, the carnations must be in the fifth house.

The violinist is in the second house, and sandals are next to tulips, so the sandals must be in the first house.



So the answer is **(E) 1**.

*  The person with grilled cheese lives in house number 2.
*  The person with high heels lives next to the fish person.

Hmm...  We also know the person eating grapes and oranges live next to each other.  And the person eating oranges lives to the right of the person wearing boots.

Let me think...  

(After some thought and drawing some pictures)

I think the person eating oranges lives in house number **(B) 4**!

"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out. 

We know there are four houses, and each house has someone living in it.  They each like different colors, ate different foods for lunch, and have different favorite fruits and drinks.

We have some clues to help us figure out who lives where.  Let's see...

*  The root beer lover and the milk drinker live next to each other.
*  The pizza eater lives right next to the tea drinker.
*  There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater.
*  There's one house between the person who likes red and the person who likes yellow.
*  There's one house between the person who eats mangos and the person who eats oranges.
*  The pizza eater lives right next to the person who likes yellow.
*  The person who eats oranges lives right next to the person who eats apples.
*  The person who ate stew doesn't live in the third house.
*  The person who ate stew lives right next to the person who only drinks water.
*  The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who ate stew.
*  The person who eats apples lives to the right of the person who ate pizza.

Hmm... this is a lot of information!  We need to think carefully about how these clues fit together. 

Let me think...  

(After some time thinking)

I think the person who eats apples lives in **house number 4**! 



"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see...

We know someone lives in each house, and they all have different things: shoes, food, books, and cars.  

* The person with the convertible lives in the first house.
* The truck driver lives right before the mystery book reader.
* Running shoes are right before high heels.
* The fantasy book person lives right before the fried rice eater.

Hmm... that's a good start! Now we need to use the other clues to figure out where everyone else is.  It's like a big puzzle!

Let me think...  

(After some time thinking)

I think the person who had pizza lives in house **(A) 4**! 



"
"Hmmm, let's see!  

We know the mystery book reader is in house number 4 and the saxophonist is also in house number 4.  

The saxophonist and the violinist are best friends and always sit next to each other.  Since the saxophonist is in house 4, the violinist must be in house 3!


So the answer is (C)! 
"
"Let's figure this out!

We know:

* The TV is in house number 4.
* The person with loafers is in house number 2.
* The phone isn't in house number 2.
* Boots are to the left of loafers.
* The radio and sandals are two houses apart.

Hmm...  If boots are before loafers (house 2), boots must be in house 1.  

Since the TV is in house 4, the radio can't be in houses 1, 2, or 4. That means the radio must be in house 3.

And if the radio is in house 3, the sandals must be in house 1.

That leaves house 2 for the phone and house 4 for the TV.


So, the gameboy must be in house 1!

**Answer: (C)** 
"
"The person wearing high heels lives in house number 2!  

That's what the clues tell us.  
"
"Let's think about the clues!

*  One person wears loafers and the other wears high heels.
*  The person in loafers doesn't live in the first house.
*  The mystery book reader doesn't live in the second house.

Hmm... that means the person in loafers must live in the second house! 

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see...

We know there are four houses and each person has different things: flowers, a device, shoes, and lunch.  

* Someone has tulips, someone has carnations, someone has daffodils, and someone has roses.
* Someone has a phone, a TV, a radio, and a gameboy.
* Someone wears boots, running shoes, high heels, and sandals.
* Someone ate stew, pizza, fried rice, and spaghetti.

The clues tell us some important things about who lives where.  We need to figure out which house the pizza person is in!

Let me think... hmm...


(After some thought and careful consideration of the clues)

I think the pizza person lives in **house number 2!** 



"
"Let's think about the clues!

* Someone in house #1 eats mangos.
* The roses are to the left of the lilies.
* The sax player doesn't live in house #1.

Hmm... if the mangos are in house #1 and the roses are to the left of the lilies, then house #1 must have the roses!  That means the lilies are in house #2.  

And since the sax player isn't in house #1, they must be in house #2.

So, the person eating apples must live in house #2!


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"The coffee drinker lives in house number 4!  

I know this because it says so in one of the clues.  
"
"Let's figure this out!

We know:

* Someone has tulips, someone has roses, and someone has lilies.
* Someone drives a sedan, someone drives an SUV, and someone drives a truck.

Here's what we can figure out:

* The tulips aren't in the last house.
* The SUV is right next to the lilies.
* The sedan and roses are right next to each other.
* The roses aren't in the middle house.

Hmm...  Let me think...

If the roses aren't in the middle, and the sedan and roses are together, they must be in the first house!  

And since the SUV is next to the lilies, they must be in the second house.

That means the truck must be in the last house!


So the answer is **(C)**! 




"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see...

We know the person with tulips lives in house number 5.  And the person with lilies lives in house number 4.  

Hmm, there are lots of clues about who lives next to who.  We need to figure out where everyone goes!

*  The person with roses and the person who likes milk live next to each other.
*  The person with carnations lives right before the pianist.
*  The fantasy book lover and the root beer lover are buddies and live next to each other.
*  The history book lover lives right before the percussionist.

I think if we keep putting the pieces together, we can find out where the milk lover lives! 


Let me think...  (takes a moment to ponder)

I think the milk lover lives in house number **(D) 4**! 



"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see...

We know:

* Someone who likes yellow lives in the first house.
* Someone who likes kiwis lives in the first house.
* The person with the convertible lives in the last house.

Hmm... that means the first house has yellow and kiwis!

We also know the SUV isn't in the second or third house.

And the person with the banana lives next to the SUV!

Let me think...  

(After some more thinking and drawing)

I think the basketball player lives in house number **3**! 



"
"Let's figure this out!

We know:

* Someone who likes green lives in the last house.
* Stew is next to the romance book lover, and stew is on the left.
* Yellow and green live next to each other.

So, the last house is green, and the house before it must be yellow.

The person who likes grilled cheese doesn't live in the middle house.

The fantasy book person lives after the stew person.

Hmm... that means the first house must be blue!


**Answer: (C) 1** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it.  They each have different things: flowers, a musical instrument, a car, a pet, and a favorite color.

Here's what we know:

* Someone with tulips and a bird keeper live next to each other.
* The person who plays drums and the truck driver don't live right next to each other, there's another house in between.
* The sedan driver lives right next to the fish lover.
* The person who likes yellow lives in the last house.
* The horse owner and the person with roses don't live right next to each other, there's another house in between.
* The horse owner and the person who likes blue live next to each other.
* The person with carnations lives in the first house.
* The cellist doesn't live in the last house.

Hmm... that's a lot of clues!  Let me think...

I think the bird keeper lives in **house 2**. 



"
"Let's figure this out!

* We know the fantasy book person lives in the first house.
* The cellist also lives in the first house.
* The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red.  

So, the first house has the fantasy book person, the cellist, and the person who likes green. That means the mystery book person must live in the second house!


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"This is a tricky puzzle!  Let's see...

We have five houses and lots of clues about the people who live there.  It's like a big game of hide-and-seek!

*  We know some people live next to each other, like the person with mangos and the person with oranges.
*  We also know some people don't live near each other, like the tennis player not being in the fourth house.

We need to use all the clues to figure out where everyone lives. It's like putting together a big puzzle!

Hmm...  I need to think really hard about all the clues.  

(After some time thinking)

I think the swimmer lives in **house number 3**! 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* The golfer lives in the middle house, number 2.
* The history book person lives in the first house, number 1.

Hmm... the swimmer and the science fiction person live in the other houses, and there's one house between them.  

That means the swimmer must live in house 1!


So the answer is **(A)**. 
"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out. 

We know there are four houses and each person has something different: a sport, food, fruit, pet, and a book they like.  

We have some clues to help us.  Let's see...

* The swimmer is next to the person who likes apples.
* The romance book lover is to the right of the swimmer.
* The fantasy book person is next to the horse owner.
* Fried rice isn't in the last house.
* The cat lover is next to the spaghetti eater.

* The banana eater is next to the soccer player.
* The bird keeper lives in the third house.
* The science fiction book person is next to the pizza eater.
* The grape eater is before the fantasy book person.
* Pizza is before the baseball player.

Hmm... this is a lot of information!  We need to think carefully about where everyone lives and what they like.  

I'm going to need a little more time to think about all these clues and figure out where the stew eater lives.  



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* One person ate fried rice and the other ate spaghetti.
* One person likes history books and the other likes romance books.
* One person has a cat and the other has horses.
* One person wears sandals and the other wears running shoes.

And here's what we also know:

* The person with sandals lives next to the person with horses.
* The history book person lives next to the spaghetti eater.

Hmm... let me think...

If the sandals person is next to the horses person, that means they live in houses 1 and 2.

And the history book person is next to the spaghetti eater... so maybe the history book person is in house 2?

That means the fried rice person must be in house 2!


So the answer is **(B)**! 





"
"Let's think about the clues!

* One house has lilies and the other has daffodils.
* One person plays the flute and the other plays the saxophone.
* One person drives a convertible and the other drives a sedan.

The clue says the sedan is to the left of the lilies.  That means the sedan can't be in the house on the right.

Since the flute player isn't in the first house, they must be in the second house.

So, the lilies must be in the second house!


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see...

We know:

* The carnations are in house number 4.
* The rose is in house number 3.

Hmm...  We also know the mystery book reader isn't in the first or fourth house, and the tennis player is to the right of them.  

And there's a house between the daffodils and the rose... so the daffodils must be in house number 2!

Let me think...  I need to figure out where the romance book lover lives.  

(After some more thinking and drawing)

I think the romance book lover lives in house number 2! 


**So the answer is (A).**

I need to think... maybe if I draw little pictures of the houses and write down the clues...


(After some time of thinking and drawing)

Aha! I think the tulips are in house number **(E) 2**! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We have three houses, and each has someone living in it.  They each have different shoes, ate different foods for lunch, drive different cars, play different sports, and have different flowers in their house.

Here's what we know:

* Someone in the third house drives a minivan.
* The golfer lives in the first house.
* The person wearing boots lives right next to the minivan driver.

Hmm... that means the person in the second house wears boots!

Let's keep going!

"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see...

We know the saxophonist lives in the third house.  And the flutist lives in the second house. Hmm...

The coffee drinker is next to the percussionist, and the coffee drinker is also next to the pizza eater.  That means the coffee drinker, percussionist, and pizza eater are all close together!

**(A) 1** 
"
"Let's think about this puzzle!

We know:

* Someone who likes red lives in the last house.
* The person who plays the percussion instrument lives in the middle house.

Since the middle house is taken by the percussionist, the basketball player must be in the first house!

* The tea drinker lives next to the cricketer.
* The person who ate pizza lives next to the dog owner.
* The basketball player lives in the first house.

Hmm... that means the tea drinker must live in the second house and the cricketer in the third house!  And since the pizza eater is next to the dog owner, the pizza eater must be in the first house and the dog owner in the second house!


So the answer is **(A) 2**.

We know there's a violinist, a flutist, and a pianist.  And they each like a different fruit: kiwis, grapes, and oranges.

* The pianist and the kiwi person live next to each other.
* The flutist lives past the violinist.
* There's one house between the grape person and the kiwi person.
* There's one house between the violinist and the kiwi person.

If we put the clues together, it looks like this:

Violinist - Grapes - Kiwi - Pianist

So the pianist lives in **house number 3!**  



"
"Hmm, let's think about this!

The kiwi eater lives in the first house.  That means the fantasy book person can't live there.

"
"Let's think about this!

The pianist plays music on a piano, and the cellist plays music on a cello.  The pianist lives next to the cellist, so the pianist must live in house number 1 and the cellist in house number 2.

* The person with tulips lives to the left of the person with loafers.
* The person with sandals doesn't live in the last house.
* The person with running shoes and daffodils live next to each other.
* Tulips are to the right of daffodils.

Hmm... let me see...  If tulips are to the right of daffodils, and tulips are before loafers, that means daffodils and running shoes must be in the first two houses!

Since carnations are in the last house, boots must be in the house before that.

* Boots are next to high heels.
* Boots are to the left of stew.

If boots are next to high heels, and high heels aren't in the third house, they must be in the second house. That means boots are in the first house!

Since spaghetti and stew aren't in the second house, and we know someone in the first house has boots and likes white, the person in the second house must have fried rice and like green.

We know:

* Spaghetti is eaten before fried rice.
* Fried rice is eaten after the science fiction books person.
* Fried rice is in the middle house.
* The fantasy books person is also in the middle house.

So, the middle house has both fried rice and fantasy books!  That means the grilled cheese person must be in the last house.

Hmm... if the person in high heels lives next to the person in sandals, and the grape eater and sandal wearer are together, then the high heels must be in house 1 and the grapes and sandals are in house 2!

It's like a big puzzle with lots of pieces!  

*Thinking hard*

I think the person who ate a banana lives in **(C) 3**. 



"
"Let's think about this!

We know one person plays drums and the other plays guitar.  One person had pizza and the other had grilled cheese.  And one person has a dog and the other has a bird.

The clue says the person who had grilled cheese lives next to the bird.  So the bird can't live in house number 2.

The clue also says the drummer doesn't live in house number 2.

That means the drummer lives in house number 1 and the bird lives in house number 2!  

So the person who had pizza must live in house number 2.


The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"The bird keeper lives in house number 3!  It says so right in one of the clues.  


"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see...

We know the cat lover lives in the first house.  Hmm...  

* The person with the loafers doesn't live in the second house.
* The second house doesn't have the percussionist, fantasy book lover, or history book lover.

That means the second house is a bit of a mystery!

We also know the fish lover is somewhere to the right of the banana eater, and the flutist is to the right of the fish lover.  

And the orange eater is to the right of the pianist.

It's like a puzzle where we have to put the pieces together!  

Let me think...  

(After some more thinking)

I think the science fiction book fanatic lives in **(C) 3**! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know someone is eating grapes in the second house.  Hmm...

*  The person who likes red lives past the person with kiwis.
*  Green and red like to be right next to each other.
*  White and red have one house between them.

That's tricky!  Let me think...  

(After some thought and maybe drawing a little picture)

I think the person with the kiwis lives in house **1**! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know:

* One person had stew, and the other had fried rice.
* One person has horses, and the other has a cat.
* One person ate oranges, and the other ate apples.
* One person likes mystery books, and the other likes science fiction.
* One person wears running shoes, and the other wears sandals.

And here are the clues:

1. The person in running shoes lives to the right of the person who ate oranges.
2. The mystery book reader lives right next to the cat lover.
3. The mystery book reader and the stew eater live next to each other.

Hmm... let me think...

*  If the mystery book reader is next to the cat lover, they must be in houses 1 and 2. 
*  And since the mystery book reader and stew eater are next to each other, the stew eater must be in the same house as the mystery book reader.

So, the stew eater is in house 1 or 2.  

*  The clue about the running shoes and oranges tells us the running shoes are to the right of the oranges.

That means the stew eater must be in **house 1**!




**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Let's figure this out!

* We know the root beer person is in the first house.
* The water person is in the second house.

Hmm... the daffodil person is next to the phone person, and the water person is in the second house. So, the daffodils must be in the first house!

The TV isn't in the second house, and it's next to the tulips. That means the TV must be in the third house!

So, the milk person must be in the third house!


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We have three houses, and each house has someone living in it.  They each have different shoes, drinks, fruits, and toys.

*  The person with loafers lives in the first house.
*  The person with the phone lives before the person who eats mangos.
*  The person who eats grapes lives right next to the person who only drinks water.
*  The person with boots doesn't live in the last house.
*  The person who eats kiwis lives right next to the person who likes milk.
*  The person with boots lives after the person with the gameboy.
*  The person who eats kiwis doesn't live in the first house.

Hmm... let me think...

(After some thought and maybe drawing some pictures)

I think the person with the computer lives in house **(A) 3**! 



"
"Let's figure this out!

We know there are three houses and three people, each with a different sport, flower, and pet.

* The golfer doesn't live in the last house.
* The fish person lives before the horse person.
* The golfer and baseball player are neighbors.
* The carnations and horse people are neighbors.
* The carnations person lives before the baseball player.
* The rose person lives before the daffodil person.
* The cricketer doesn't live in the last house.

Hmm... that's a lot of clues!  Let me see...

If the golfer isn't in the last house, and the carnations and horse people are neighbors, maybe they are in the first two houses?  And since the carnations person is before the baseball player,  it has to be:

Carnations - Horse -  (Golfer, Cricketer, or Baseball)

Oh! And the golfer and baseball player are neighbors, so it has to be:

Carnations - Horse - Golfer - Baseball

Now, the rose person is before the daffodil person... that means they must be in the last two houses!

So the answer is:

Carnations - Horse - Golfer - Baseball - Rose - Daffodils

The horse person lives in house number **2**!




**Answer: (C) 2**
"
"Let's figure this out!

We know the orange person is in house number 1.  

The horse person is in house number 3.

The truck driver lives right next to the convertible driver.  

The mango person and the convertible driver live next to each other.

Hmm... that means the truck driver must be in house number 2!


So the answer is **(A)**. 
"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see if we can figure it out.

We know there are five houses, and each person has a different job, likes a different book, and ate something different for lunch.

I think the drummer lives in **house number 4**! 



"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see...

We know some people live in different houses and they each have different things they like.  

* Someone lives in the first house and drives a sedan.
* The romance book lover lives in the third house.
* The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house too, and the person who likes green lives right next to them.

Hmm... that means the person who likes green lives in the second house!

We also know the romance book lover lives to the right of the person who drives a convertible.  

Let's keep thinking!  


(I'm still working on figuring out where the person who eats mangos lives!) 

"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see...

We know:

* Someone who likes green lives in the third house.
* Someone has a radio in the third house.

Hmm...  That means the person who likes green also has a radio!

We also know:

* The percussionist and the guitarist are neighbors.
* The percussionist lives next to the person who likes white.

Let's see... maybe we can put those together!

There are a lot of clues about who lives where, and what they like. We need to be careful and think about each clue! 

It might take a while, but if we keep looking, we'll find the answer! 



"
"Let's figure this out!

We know:

* One person likes tea, and the other likes root beer.
* One person plays the cello, and the other plays the guitar.
* One person has a cat, and the other has horses.
* One person likes mystery books, and the other likes history books.

Here's what we can learn from the clues:

* The cello player lives next to the mystery book reader.
* The history book reader lives next to the cat person.
* The root beer lover and the guitar player live next to each other.

Hmm...  If the cello player is next to the mystery book reader, they must be in houses 1 and 2.

And since the root beer lover and guitar player are together, they must be in house 2.

That means the history book reader and cat person are in house 1!

So, the person with the horses must live in **house 2**! 


**(B)** 
"
"Let's think about this puzzle!

* We know someone has a dog, someone has a cat, and someone has a bird.
* We also know someone has roses, someone has tulips, and someone has carnations.

Hmm... the clue says the carnations person lives to the right of the bird person. That means the bird person can't live in the last house.

And the clue says the dog person doesn't live in the middle house.

So, the bird person must live in the first house, and the dog person must live in the last house.

The last clue says the tulips person lives to the right of the dog person.  

That means the tulips person must live in the middle house!


The answer is **(B) 2**. 
"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see...

We know the swimmer lives in the last house (number 4).  

Hmm, the person with high heels lives before the person with tulips. And the tulips are right next to the cricketer.  

Oh! The person with loafers doesn't live in the second house or the third house.  

Let me think...  

I think the person with loafers lives in house number **1**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Someone eats mangos in the first house.
* The horse person doesn't live in the first house.
* The banana person doesn't live in the third house.
* The horse person doesn't live in the second house.
* The banana person lives right next to the dog person.

Hmm...  That means the banana person must be in the second house, and the dog person is in the third house!

The bird person and the kiwi person live next to each other.  Since the banana person is in the second house, the bird person and kiwi person must be in houses 2 and 3.


So the bird keeper lives in **house 2**! 



"
"Let's figure this out!

We know the mystery book reader lives in the first house.  

The romance book lover doesn't live in the last house, and neither do the horse owner.  

The bird keeper lives right next to the history book buff.  

Hmm... that means the bird keeper and history book buff must live in the second and third houses.

So, the romance book lover must live in the second house!


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"The coffee drinker lives in house number 2!  It says so right in one of the clues.  


"
"The person eating a banana lives in house number 3!  

I know this because it says the soccer player lives in house number 3 and the person eating a banana also lives in house number 3. 



"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see...

We know the soccer player lives in the middle house.  Hmm...

* Stew is somewhere to the right of the high heels.
* The stew is also somewhere to the left of the history book reader.
* The rose bouquet is right next to the spaghetti.

That means the rose bouquet can't be in the middle house because the soccer player is there.

* The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the rose bouquet.

So, the rose bouquet must be in the first house, and the golfer is in the third house.

* The daffodils are one house away from the golfer.

That means the daffodils must be in the second house.

* The person with the carnations must be in the house that's left!


So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"This is a tricky puzzle! Let's see...

We have three houses, and each person has something different: a musical instrument, shoes, a device, and a car.  

*  Someone plays the flute, someone plays percussion, and someone plays the cello.
*  One person wears boots, one wears high heels, and one wears loafers.
*  One person has a gameboy, one has a phone, and one has a television.
*  One person drives a convertible, one drives a minivan, and one drives a truck.

2. The truck and the gameboy are next to each other.
3. The minivan and the cello are next to each other.
4. The high heels and the television are next to each other.

"
"Let's figure this out!

We know the person with lilies lives in the middle house (number 2).  

Then we know the rose bouquet is next to the coffee drinker, and the SUV is next to the coffee drinker too. So, they must be together!

Also, the truck is to the right of the minivan and the truck is to the right of the root beer lover.

Putting it all together, it looks like this:

* House 1: Root Beer - Truck
* House 2: Lilies
* House 3: SUV - Rose - Coffee 


The coffee drinker lives in house 3! 

**So the answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Someone in the third house has a gameboy.
* The person who likes red lives in the second house.
* The person who likes grapes lives to the right of the person who likes red.
* There's one house between the person who eats apples and the person who wears sandals.

Hmm... that means the person who eats grapes must be in the third house!

And since the person who likes red is in the second house, the person who eats apples must be in the first house.

The person with the phone lives right next to the person with the running shoes.  

So, the person with the phone must be in the first house!


**Answer: (C)**

"The bird keeper lives in house number 2!  It says so right in one of the clues.

We know the saxophonist lives in the first house.  And the golfer lives next door!

Hmmm... the tea drinker and the person who likes grapes live next to each other, and so do the baseball player and the person who likes grapes.  

That means the tea drinker and the grapes must be in the first house, and the baseball player and the grapes must be in the second house.

The only fruit left is mangos, so the person who likes mangos must live in the second house!
