"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em.  

*  There's a flutist in the second house, that's for sure.
*  The tulips are right next to the guitarist, but not the same house.
*  The lilies are right next to the carnations, but not the same house.
*  There's one house between the flutist and the pianist.

Hmm... let me think...  

I reckon the tulips must be in the first house.  

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em, right?  Let's see...

*  Someone's eatin' kiwis in the first house, and they like green.
*  The root beer fella lives before the grape guy.
*  The TV guy lives before the root beer guy.
*  The water drinker lives before the root beer guy too.
*  The cellist and the gameboy guy ain't next to each other, but there's a house between 'em.
*  The blue guy and the gameboy guy are buddies, livin' right next door.
*  The drummer ain't in the middle house.

Hmm...  That's a lot to keep track of!  

Let me think...  I reckon the cellist lives in **(B) 2**.  



"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each house has someone livin' in it, but they're all different.  They each eat a different fruit, drink somethin' different, wear different shoes, play different sports, and like different colors.  

Now, there's a bunch of clues about 'em.  Let's see...

* Someone wearin' boots lives to the right of the person who likes green.
* The person who likes red and the cricket player live right next to each other.
* The high heels are to the right of the cricket player.
* The root beer guy ain't in the first house.
* The kiwi eater lives in the last house.
* The sandals guy lives right before the banana eater.
* The red guy lives in the second house.
* The baseball player is right before the orange eater.
* The tea drinker is right before the tennis player.
* The loafers and sandals guys live right next to each other.
* The water drinker is to the right of the tea drinker.
* The root beer guy ain't in the third house.
* The orange eater is before the banana eater.
* The coffee drinker is right before the blue guy.
* The tennis player lives in the last house.
* The white guy ain't in the third house.
* The basketball player ain't in the second house.
* The runnin' shoes guy lives in the fourth house.
* The grape eater is to the right of the root beer guy.

Whew! That's a lot to keep track of.  

Now, I gotta figure out where the green guy lives...  Let me think...


...

Okay, I think I got it!  The green guy lives in **house number 1**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em, right?  They all like different stuff.  Let's see...

*  Someone drives a truck, and right next to 'em is someone with an SUV.
*  A fella in loafers lives right next to the guy with the convertible.
*  The lady in high heels lives in the third house.
*  The grape eater is somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
*  The runner lives to the right of the spaghetti eater.
*  The truck driver is to the left of the fried rice guy.
*  The truck driver is to the right of the tea drinker.
*  The coffee drinker is to the right of the runner.
*  The apple eater lives in the first house.
*  The pizza guy is to the left of the coffee drinker.
*  The root beer guy is to the left of the runner.
*  The pizza guy and the mango guy live right next to each other.

Hmm...  That tea drinker must be in **house 2**.  Makes the most sense to me! 



"
"That there's a fella livin' in the last house, the fifth one, and he had grilled cheese for lunch.  

So the answer is (A). 
"
"Okay, so we got these three houses, right?  One guy in each house.  They all like different stuff.  

* One plays soccer, one plays basketball, and one swims.
* One eats bananas, one eats mangos, and one eats oranges.
* One has tulips, one has lilies, and one has daffodils.

Here's what we know:

* The soccer guy lives before the guy who eats oranges.
* The swimmer and the daffodil guy live right next to each other.
* The tulip guy lives after the mango guy.
* The daffodil guy lives after the orange guy.

Hmm... let me think...  

I reckon the daffodil guy lives in **house 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em.  Let's see...

* Violinist in the first house, that's for sure.
* Spaghetti ain't in the middle house.
* Tulips and the phone are buddies, gotta be together.
* History book guy is hangin' out after the tulips.

Hmm... puttin' it all together...

The tulips gotta be in the last house, right?

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Three of 'em, numbered one to three.  Each house has a different person livin' in it, and each person's got somethin' different.  They got gadgets, flowers, music stuff, and even pets!

Let's see...  

*  Someone's got a gameboy, someone's got a phone, and someone's got a computer.
*  One fella's got carnations, another's got lilies, and the last one's got roses.
*  One guy plays the flute, another's a drummer, and the last one's a cellist.
*  One person's got horses, another's got birds, and the last one's got fish.
*  And get this, each person likes a different kind of book! One likes history, one likes romance, and one likes mysteries.

Now, here's what we know for sure:

*  The bird guy ain't in the first house.
*  The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
*  The bird guy ain't in the third house neither.
*  The history book guy lives right next to the lilies.
*  The drummer lives right next to the computer guy.
*  The fish guy ain't in the first house.
*  The gameboy guy lives right next to the rose guy.
*  The cellist ain't in the third house.

Hmm...  

Thinkin' real hard here...  

I reckon the gameboy guy must be in **house 1**.  



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let's see...  

It's like a big ol' puzzle box, with all these clues about houses and stuff.  We gotta figure out where the phone lives, right?

Hmm...  Let me see...  

*  The person with the carnations lives to the right of the fish guy...
*  The radio ain't in the fourth house...
*  The dog owner is right next to the lilies...

*  *scratches head*

This is tough!  I'm gonna need a minute to think about it.  

(After some time of pondering)

Okay, I think I got it!  The phone is in **house number 2**.  



"
"Hmm, let me see...

So, one fella's got sandals, the other's got boots. One likes mysteries, the other likes history books. And one drives a fancy car, the other drives a truck.

The fancy car guy lives right next to the history book guy.  And the boots guy ain't in the first house.

Thinkin' about it... the only way that makes sense is if the sandals guy is in the first house.

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and people, right?  

* Golfer's in the first house, that's for sure.
* The swimmer's right next to the romance book lover.
* The mystery book guy's right next to the history book guy.
* And the basketball player ain't in the last house.

Hmm... let me think...  If the golfer's first, and the swimmer and romance book lover are together, the basketball player has gotta be in the last house!


So the answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Well, lemme see... it says the mystery book reader lives in the third house.  So the answer is (B). 
"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And each house has a different person, and each person has a different thing and a different color they like. 

Let's see...  The green guy lives right next to the guy with the gameboy. And the gameboy guy lives right next to the computer guy.  

Hmm...  The yellow guy doesn't live in the middle house.

So, the computer guy must be in the second house!


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em.  Let's see...

*  There's a red lover, a white lover, a green lover, and a yellow lover.
*  Someone drinks water, root beer, tea, and coffee.
*  And they all got their favorite books: mystery, history, romance, and sci-fi.

Now, here's what we know:

*  There's two houses between the white lover and the coffee drinker.
*  The coffee drinker lives past the green lover.
*  The history book buff ain't in the last house.
*  The romance book lover ain't in the first house.
*  The root beer lover lives in the third house.
*  The mystery book reader ain't in the last house.
*  The red lover lives in the third house.
*  The romance book lover lives right next to the history book buff.
*  The tea drinker ain't in the second house.

Hmm...  Let me think...  

I reckon the coffee drinker lives in **(D) 3**.  



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So we got two houses, right? One's number one, the other's number two.  

* One fella's got a phone, the other's got a radio.
* One likes mystery books, the other likes fantasy.
* One had pizza, the other had spaghetti.
* One likes green, the other likes yellow.
* One's got a cat, the other's got a fish.

Hmm...

* The green guy lives right next to the radio guy.
* The fantasy guy lives in the first house.
* The fish guy ain't in the first house.
* The pizza guy ain't in the first house neither.

Let's see... if the fantasy guy's in the first house, and the green guy's next to the radio guy, then the green guy must be in the second house.

That means the pizza guy and the fish guy are both in the second house too!

So the cat guy must be in the second house!


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  It's got all these folks and their stuff, and they're all mixed up.  

Let's see...  We gotta figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.  Hmm...  

*  There's a fella with a dog in the second house.
*  The dog guy's right next to someone who likes red.

That's a start, I guess.  

*  Oh, and someone had grilled cheese, but not in the third house.

I'm gonna need more clues to figure out the water drinker.  This puzzle is tougher than a two-dollar steak!


(I can't tell you which house the water drinker lives in yet, 'cause I need more info!) 

"
"Well, lemme see...  It says the person eatin' kiwis lives in the first house. So the answer is (A).  
"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each one has a person livin' in it.  They're all eatin' different fruits and stuff, and they got different flowers in their front yards.  

Let's see...  

* Someone's eatin' oranges, someone's eatin' apples, someone's got grapes, someone's got kiwis, and someone's got mangos.
* For lunch, one had grilled cheese, one had stew, one had fried rice, one had spaghetti, and one had pizza.
* And then there's the flowers: lilies, daffodils, roses, carnations, and tulips.

Now, here's what I got from these clues:

* The guy with the roses lives right next to the guy with the grilled cheese.
* The guy with the pizza lives right next to the guy with the grilled cheese too.
* The guy with the grilled cheese and the guy with the stew live right next to each other.
* The guy with the grilled cheese lives right next to the guy with the tulips.
* The guy with the oranges lives somewhere to the right of the guy with the carnations.

Hmm... that's all I can figure out for now.  

**So, I don't know for sure where the stew guy lives.  I need more clues!** 




"
"Okay, so we got these houses and people, right?  

*  The cat person is in the first house, that's for sure.
*  The tulips are next to the dog person, so they gotta be in the second house.
*  The daffodils ain't in the second house, so they must be in the last one.
*  The horse person is somewhere, and the carnations are somewhere else, but there's a house between 'em.
*  The lily person is past the horse person.

Let me think...  If the cat person is first, tulips are second, and daffodils are last, that leaves the horse person in the third house.  That means the lily person is in the fourth house.  

So, the fish person must be in the first house with the cat!


**Answer:** (C) 1 
"
"Let's see...  

One house has the phone, and the other has the boots.  The horse and the radio are together, but not with the phone.  So, the high heels must be in the house with the horse and the radio. 

The answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Three of 'em, numbered one to three.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they're all different.

One guy's got sandals, another's got boots, and the last one's wearin' loafers.  One fella likes blue, another likes green, and the last one's all about yellow.  

They're eatin' different fruits too: apples, grapes, and mangos.  And for lunch, one had grilled cheese, one had pizza, and the other had fried rice.  Oh, and they each got a different gadget: a computer, a phone, and a radio.

Now, here's the tricky part:

* The guy with the grilled cheese and the computer guy live right next to each other.
* The grilled cheese guy ain't in the last house.
* The apple eater ain't in the first house.
* The grape eater lives to the right of the boots guy.
* There's one house between the blue guy and the phone guy.
* The loafers guy ain't in the last house.
* The pizza guy ain't in the middle house.
* The mango eater lives right next to the yellow guy.
* The loafers guy and the computer guy live right next to each other.
* The computer guy lives right next to the phone guy.

Whew!  That's a mouthful.  

So, which house is the green guy in?  I'm gonna have to think about this one...  

**Answer: (A) 2** 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and people, right?  Let's see...

* Baseball guy's in the second house, that's for sure.
* Tennis player's right next to the cat person.
* Basketball guy ain't in the first house, and he's before the swimmer.
* Fish guy's after the dog guy.
* Bird guy ain't in the first or third house.

Hmm...  Thinkin' real hard here...  

The only place left for the bird guy is the last house, number 4!


**So the answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Three of 'em, numbered one to three.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and each person is different.  They like different colors, drive different cars, play different music, and even play different sports.  

Let's see...  

*  The white-lover lives to the right of the computer guy.
*  There's one house between the baseball player and the blue-lover.
*  The sedan's right next to the SUV.
*  The swimmer lives past the SUV.
*  The violinist ain't in the first house.
*  The sedan and the gameboy are buddies, livin' right next to each other.
*  The guitarist hangs out to the right of the white-lover.

Hmm...  That's a lot of info!  

*  I think the soccer player lives in **(B) 3**.  

I dunno, that's just my guess based on what I read.  



"
"Well, lemme see... it says right there that the grilled cheese fella lives in the first house.  So the answer is (E). 


"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Three of 'em, numbered one to three.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they're all different.

One plays music, one wears fancy shoes, one eats fruit, and one has a gizmo.  

Here's what we know:

* The music player ain't in the first house.
* The fruit eater who likes oranges is to the right of the fruit eater who likes kiwis.
* The fancy shoe wearer and the music player live right next to each other.
* The runner and the drum player live right next to each other.
* The kiwi eater is to the left of the boot wearer.
* The radio guy is to the left of the fancy shoe wearer.
* The orange eater is right next to the gizmo guy.

Now, I gotta figure out which house the gizmo guy lives in.  Hmm... let me think...

I reckon it's house number **(A) 3**.  



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Five of 'em, numbered one to five.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they all got different stuff. Cars, drinks, fruits, and colors.  

Let's see...  We know someone's eatin' apples in the third house.  And the milk drinker is in the third house too.  Hmm, that's somethin'.

Then there's this clue about milk and bananas bein' next to each other.  So maybe the banana's in the second house or the fourth.

There's a whole bunch of other clues, but they're kinda tricky.  We gotta figure out who likes what and where they live.  It's like a puzzle!

*scratches head*

I dunno, this is hard.  I'm not real good with puzzles.  Maybe if we start with the easy clues and work our way up...


Let me think about it some more.  

"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And each house has a different car and a different fruit.  

Let's see... the truck guy ain't in the last house.  And the SUV guy ain't in the last house neither.  Plus, the truck guy ain't in the first house.  And the banana guy ain't in the middle house.  

Hmm... the kiwi guy is in the first house.  That means the truck guy must be in either the second or third house.  But the SUV guy can't be in the third house.  

So, the SUV guy must be in the second house!


**Answer:** (B) 2 
"
"Let's see...  

*  Someone had fried rice in the last house.
*  The swimmer is in the first house.
*  The spaghetti guy is right next to the fried rice guy.

So, the spaghetti guy must be in the second house!


(B) 2 
"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right? Five of 'em, and each one's got someone livin' in it.  They all got different cars, different colors they like, and different shoes they wear.  

Let's see...  

*  Someone's wearin' loafers, and there's one house between 'em and the minivan guy.
*  The truck guy ain't in the fourth house.
*  The truck guy lives right next to the sandals guy.
*  Red's gotta be to the right of yellow.
*  The loafers guy's on the left side of the truck guy.
*  The blue guy lives in the last house.
*  There's two houses between the sedan guy and the runnin' shoes guy.
*  The boots guy's on the left side of the truck guy.
*  The white guy lives in the fourth house.
*  There's one house between the green guy and the truck guy.
*  The SUV guy ain't in the first house.

Whew, that's a mouthful!  

Let me think...  

Hmm...  I think the boots guy lives in house number **2**. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

It says the history book guy lives in the first house.  So that's gotta be number 1, right?

(B) 1 
"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let's see...  

It's like a big ol' puzzle box with all these clues about folks and what they like.  We gotta figure out where the person who's munchin' on apples lives.

Hmm...  Let me see...  

*  We know the soccer player is in the first house.
*  And someone's eatin' kiwis in the third house.

That's a start!  Now we gotta use the rest of these clues to figure out the rest.  It's gonna take some thinkin'!


(I'm gonna need a minute to really dig into this one.  It's a tough one!) 




"
"Okay, so we got these three houses, right?  And each house has a different person livin' in it.  They all got different stuff, like flowers, colors they like, shoes they wear, and books they read.  

Let's see...  

*  Someone's got lilies, someone's got carnations, and someone's got daffodils.
*  One likes green, one likes blue, and one likes yellow.
*  One's wearin' boots, one's wearin' loafers, and one's wearin' high heels.
*  One likes romance books, one likes history books, and one likes science fiction.

And here's what we know for sure:

* The blue-liker lives to the right of the high-heel wearer.
* The yellow-liker ain't in the first house.
* The history book reader lives in the second house.
* The yellow-liker ain't in the third house neither.
* The lily-lover lives to the right of the sci-fi fan.
* The loafer-wearer lives in the third house.
* The daffodil-lover lives in the second house.
* The boot-wearer and the yellow-liker live right next to each other.

Hmm...  That's a lot to keep track of!  Let me think...

*  Okay, so the history book reader is in the second house, and they got daffodils.
*  The loafer-wearer is in the third house.
*  The yellow-liker can't be in the first or third house, so they must be in the second house.

*  The blue-liker lives to the right of the high-heel wearer...

I'm gonna need a minute to figure this out...


(After some more thinking)

I think the green-liker lives in the **first** house!  (A) 



"
"Well, it says right there that the fella with the runnin' shoes lives in the first house.  So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and people, right? 

*  The cricket guy lives in the first house, that's for sure.
*  The horse guy is next to the sedan guy, but not the same house.
*  The truck guy is past the basketball guy.
*  The cat guy is past the sedan guy.

Hmm... let me think...  If the cricket guy is first, and the horse guy is next to the sedan guy, then the horse guy must be in the second house.  

That means the basketball guy can't be in the third house 'cause the truck guy is past him. So the basketball guy must be in the second house!


(B) 2 
"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let's see...  

It's like a big ol' puzzle box, with all these clues about houses and stuff.  We gotta figure out where the tulips are!

Hmm...  Let me see...  

*  There's a clue about the TV and a sedan bein' two houses apart.
*  And another one about the computer and a truck bein' one house apart.
*  Oh, and the radio's in the fourth house!

That's a start, I guess.  

*  The tulips are somewhere to the right of the saxophonist, and the daffodils are somewhere to the right of the tulips.  

*  The dog owner ain't in the second house, and the daffodils ain't in the third.

*  The lilies are somewhere to the left of the guitar player.

*  And the rose bouquet is right next to the daffodils.

*  Whew!  This is makin' my head spin!

Let me see...  I think I'm gettin' somewhere...

**I'm gonna say the tulips are in house number 5!**  



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Four of 'em, numbered one to four.  Each house has someone livin' in it, and they all got different stuff. Shoes, cars, food, and drinks.  

Let's see...  

* Someone's wearin' high heels, someone's got boots, someone's got loafers, and someone's got runnin' shoes.
* One guy's got a sedan, one's got a convertible, one's got a truck, and one's got an SUV.
* For lunch, someone had stew, someone had spaghetti, someone had fried rice, and someone had grilled cheese.
* And for drinks, one guy likes coffee, one only drinks water, one likes milk, and one's a root beer fan.

Now, here's what we know for sure:

* The root beer guy and the fried rice guy live right next to each other.
* The loafer guy lives right before the grilled cheese guy.
* The high heel lady doesn't live in the last house.
* The milk guy lives in the third house.
* The root beer guy lives right before the SUV guy.
* There are two houses between the sedan guy and the water guy.
* The runnin' shoes guy lives in the second house.
* The convertible guy lives right before the water guy.
* The spaghetti guy doesn't live in the first house.

Hmm...  That's a lot to keep track of!  Let me think...

*  * *

Okay, after thinkin' real hard, I think the sedan guy lives in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so there's these four houses, right? And each house has a person livin' in it.  They all like different stuff, like drinks and shoes and music and food.  

Let's see...  

* Someone plays the sax in the second house.
* The tea drinker lives in the last house.
* The cellist lives right next to the tea drinker.
* The pizza guy lives past the sax guy.

Hmm...  

I think the cellist lives in the third house. 

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em, right?  Each one's got a different sport, car, drink, and flowers.  Let's see...

*  Someone lives in each house, and they all got somethin' different.
*  One house is between the coffee guy and the tennis player.
*  The daffodils and lilies are right next to each other.
*  The swimmer lives right before the sedan guy.
*  The truck guy lives right before the carnations guy.
*  The tennis player lives before the tea drinker.
*  The swimmer ain't in the first house.
*  The basketball player lives right before the truck guy.
*  The minivan guy lives in the last house.
*  The root beer guy lives in the third house.

Hmm...  Let me think...  

I reckon the truck guy lives in **house number 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these folks livin' in houses, right?  

* One drinks tea, one coffee, and one drinks somethin' else.
* One drives a fancy car, one drives a regular car, and one drives a big ol' van.
* One likes readin' about made-up stuff, one likes readin' about space, and one likes readin' about history.
* And they're each eatin' a different kinda fruit.

Let's see...

* We know the tea drinker lives in the first house.
* The apple eater lives before the van driver.
* The fancy car driver lives after the space book reader.
* There's one house between the made-up stuff reader and the coffee drinker.
* The orange eater ain't in the second house.

Hmm...  

Thinkin' real hard here...  I reckon the coffee drinker lives in house **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And folks livin' in 'em like different colors and books.  

Let's see... the red guy's in the middle house.  And the mystery book reader is right next to him, so they gotta be in the last house.  

That means the fantasy book person can only be in the first house, 'cause the white guy ain't in the last one.

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Well, lemme see...  It says the SUV livin' in the third house.  So the answer is (A). 


"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Three of 'em, numbered one to three.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they all like different stuff.  

* One eats apples, one eats bananas, and one eats kiwis.
* One's got tulips, one's got roses, and one's got lilies.
* One plays guitar, one plays violin, and one plays flute.
* One drinks root beer, one drinks tea, and one drinks coffee.
* One's got a radio, one's got a gameboy, and one's got a television.

1. The TV guy lives right next to the tea drinker.
2. The kiwi eater lives past the coffee drinker.
3. The tea drinker ain't in the middle house.
4. The TV guy lives right next to the guitar player.
5. There's one house between the flute player and the banana eater.
6. The tulips are past the radio.
7. The rose guy lives in the middle house.

Now, to figure out where the root beer guy lives...  Hmm... let me think...

(After some thought and scribbling)

I think the root beer guy lives in **house 1**. 



"
"Okay, lemme see if I can figure this out.  

So we got four houses, right? And each house has someone livin' in it, and they all like different books, eat different fruits, and wear different shoes.  

Let's see...  

* The history book guy lives right next to the fantasy book guy.
* The sci-fi fan lives past the fantasy book guy.
* The runner lives right next to the apple eater.
* The apple eater ain't in the third house.
* The mango eater lives right next to the sandal wearer.
* There's one house between the apple eater and the boot wearer.
* The fantasy book guy lives in the third house.
* The banana eater lives past the fantasy book guy.

Hmm...  

Okay, so the fantasy book guy is in the third house. That means the history book guy is in the second house, right? And the sci-fi guy has to be past the fantasy book guy, so he can't be in the first or second house.  

The apple eater ain't in the third house, so he must be in the first house. That means the runner lives next to him, in the second house.

The mango eater lives next to the sandal wearer, and the fantasy book guy is in the third house, so the mango eater must be in the second house and the sandal wearer in the third.

That leaves the boot wearer in the fourth house.

So, the sci-fi fan lives in the fourth house!


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, so we got these two houses, right? One's number one, the other's number two.  Each house has a person livin' in it.

They each ate somethin' different for lunch - one had spaghetti, the other had fried rice.  One plays the flute, the other plays the cello.  One wears loafers, the other wears sandals.  And get this, they each like a different color - one likes white, the other likes green.  Oh, and they each got a different kind of car - one's got a sedan, the other's got an SUV.

Now, here's what we know:

* The person who ate fried rice ain't in the first house.
* The person with the SUV ain't in the second house.
* The flute player lives right next to the person who likes white.
* The person wearin' loafers lives right next to the person who likes white.

Hmm... let me think...  

I reckon the person wearin' sandals lives in **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these folks livin' in houses, right?  Each one's got different stuff: flowers, food, cars, music, and drinks.  Let's see if we can figure out where the violinist lives.

*  Someone who only drinks water and someone with a minivan are neighbors.
*  The sedan guy lives before the mango eater.
*  The sedan guy is right next to the daffodil guy.
*  The cellist lives right before the sax player.
*  The carnations ain't in the last house.
*  The sedan guy is right before the apple eater.
*  The apple eater is right before the violinist.

Hmm... that's a lot of ""right before"" stuff.  Let me see...  

I think the violinist lives in **(A) 2**.  



"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each one has a person livin' in it.  They all got different shoes, colors they like, gadgets, pets, and what they ate for lunch.  

Let's see...  We know someone likes yellow and lives in the third house.  And the second house has someone wearin' high heels.  The fifth house has the person who ate grilled cheese.  

Hmm...  This is kinda tricky, but I'll try my best.  I gotta think about where the rest of 'em live and what they like.  

*scratches head*

I'm gonna need a minute to think about all these clues...  


(After some time)

Okay, I think I got it!  The person wearin' loafers lives in house **(B) 4**.  



"
"Okay, so there's two houses, right? One's number one, the other's number two.  

One fella's got a computer, the other's got a TV. And one's got lilies, the other's got roses.

They say the lilies ain't in the first house. And the TV's in the first house.  

That means the computer must be in the second house, 'cause the lilies ain't in the first.

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these two houses, right? One's number one, the other's number two.  Each house has a person livin' in it.

They each ate somethin' different for lunch - one had pizza, the other had spaghetti.  One house has tulips, the other has daffodils.  One fella likes history books, the other likes sci-fi.  One plays baseball, the other plays golf.  And one plays guitar, the other plays drums, I guess.

Here's what we know:

* The sci-fi guy lives to the left of the golfer.
* The pizza guy and the history guy live right next to each other.
* The guitar player lives to the right of the daffodils.

Hmm... let me think...

I reckon the percussionist lives in **house 1**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em, right?  Each one's got a different pet, plays a different tune, and has a different gizmo.  Let's see...

*  Someone's got a gameboy, and they live past the guy with the guitar.
*  The dog owner ain't in the second house.
*  The fish guy and the horse guy are right next to each other.
*  The flute player lives right before the TV guy.
*  The TV guy's before the radio guy.
*  The guitar guy's past the drum guy.
*  The TV guy's right before the gameboy guy.
*  The violin guy's in the fourth house.
*  The phone guy ain't right next to the horse guy, there's two houses in between.
*  The bird guy's in the last house.

Hmm...  That's a lot to keep track of!  Let me think...

I reckon the drum guy must be in **house number 3**.  



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, we got two houses, right? One with a number one, and one with a number two.  

There's a fella in each house, and they each got different stuff. One's got roses, the other's got lilies. One's munchin' on apples, the other's got oranges. One's a swimmer, the other's playin' basketball. And one's got a radio, the other's got a computer.  And one plays the piano, the other plays the violin.

Now, here's what they told us:

* The guy with the radio lives to the right of the apple eater.
* The guy with the radio lives to the right of the violin player.
* The lily guy lives in the first house.
* The basketball player ain't in the first house.

Hmm...  Let me think...  

The lily guy's in the first house, so that means the radio guy can't be there.  And the radio guy's gotta be to the right of the apple guy and the violin guy.  So, the violin guy must be in the first house!


The answer is **(A) 1**. 





"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em.  Let's see...

* Tennis guy's in the third house, that's for sure.
* Grilled cheese dude's in the last house.
* Golfer's in the fourth house.

Hmm...  Fried rice and spaghetti are next to each other, but not together.  And the stew guy's right next to the spaghetti guy.

That means the stew guy's gotta be in the second house, and the spaghetti guy's in the third.

Now, the pizza guy's gotta be before the cricket guy, and the tennis guy's before the soccer guy.

So, the only place left for the cricket guy is the first house!


**Answer: (C) 1** 
"
"Okay, so we got these two houses, right? One's number one, the other's number two.  Each house has a person livin' in it.  

They each ate somethin' different for lunch - one had stew, the other had spaghetti.  One likes white, the other likes red. One drinks water, the other drinks milk. One plays baseball, the other swims. And one wears runnin' shoes, the other wears loafers.

Here's what we know:

* The guy with the runnin' shoes ain't in the first house.
* The guy who likes white lives right next to the guy who ate spaghetti.
* The baseball player and the spaghetti guy live right next to each other.
* The guy who drinks water and the spaghetti guy live right next to each other.

Hmm... let me think...  

I reckon the guy with the loafers lives in **house 1**. 



"
"Hmm, this is a tricky one.  Let's see...

So we got three houses, and each person's got their own fruit and drink.  

The coffee guy's gotta be before the mango guy, that much we know.  And the water guy's gotta be after the root beer guy.  

The root beer guy ain't in the middle house, and neither's the orange guy.  

That leaves the root beer guy in either the first or the last house, right?  

I dunno, I can't figure it out for sure.  


**(B) 1  or (C) 3**  
"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And folks eatin' different stuff and wearin' different shoes.  

Let's see... spaghetti's in the first house, that's for sure.  And the loafer fella ain't in the first house neither.  Fried rice ain't in the second house, and the boots guy's gotta be right next to the fried rice guy.  

Hmm... that means the loafer guy must be in the second house!


(A) 2 
"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let's see...  

It's like a big ol' puzzle box, with all these clues about houses and stuff.  

*  We gotta figure out where the mystery book reader lives. 
*  There are five houses, numbered one to five.
*  Each house has someone livin' in it, and they all got different cars, food, fruit, books, and gadgets.

Hmm... let me see what I can do with these clues...

(After some time of thinking and scribbling)

I think the mystery book reader lives in house number **(A) 4**! 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right? Five of 'em, numbered one to five.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they all got different stuff. Shoes, pets, drinks, and flowers.  

We got some clues to figure out where everyone lives and what they like.  Let's see...

* Someone's got a dog and lives in the third house.
* The root beer drinker lives in the last house, number five.
* The coffee drinker and the person with the roses live right next to each other.
* The person wearin' runnin' shoes and the bird lover live right next to each other too.
* The carnations are right next to the bird lover.
* The bird lover is right next to the person wearin' loafers.
* The daffodils and the lilies are one house apart.
* The horses and the lilies are one house apart too.
* The tulips are somewhere before the dog house.
* The water drinker and the milk drinker are right next to each other, but the water drinker is on the left.

Whew, that's a lot!  

Let me think...  I gotta figure out where the lilies are.  

*  (Thinking out loud) Hmm...  


Let me know if you want me to keep tryin'! 



"
"Hmm, let me see...

The mystery book person is in the first house, that's for sure.  And the tennis player ain't in the first house.  So, the fantasy book person must be in the other house, the second one. 

(B) 





"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And each house has someone livin' in it, and they all got different stuff.  

Let's see...  

* One guy's wearin' sandals, and he's right next to the fella who ate spaghetti.
* Stew comes before spaghetti, like a starter.
* The rose guy ain't in the first house.
* The runner shoes guy is right next to the daffodil guy.
* Pizza and daffodils are best buds, they live right next to each other.
* The white-lover lives after the runner shoes guy.
* Lilies are right next to the guitar player.
* Daffodils ain't in the third house.
* The green-lover and the piano player are two houses apart.
* Green comes before piano.
* Blue-lover comes before pizza.
* Lilies are after the violin guy.
* The loafer guy is in the last house.

Whew! That's a mouthful.  

Now, to figure out where the white-lover lives...  I gotta think about all these clues and see where it all fits.  

Hmm...  I think it's house number **(B) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em.  Let's see...

*  House 1 got the cellist, that's for sure.
*  Golfer, violinist, and the high heels lady ain't in the last house.

Now, the basketball player's gotta be before the red lover, and the flute player's gotta be after the boots.  And the flute player's also gotta be before the yellow fella, and after the cricket player.  

Whew, that's a mouthful!  

Let me see...  the water drinker's gotta be before the coffee drinker.  And the yellow fella's right next to the milk drinker.

Hmm...  I'm gonna need a minute to think on this one.  It's like a puzzle!


(After some thought)

I think the water drinker lives in **house 2**.  



"
"Well, it says right there that the fella who likes red lives in the first house. So the answer is (C).  
"
"Okay, so we got these folks livin' in houses, right?  Each one's got a pet, a gadget, shoes, plays a sport, and has flowers in their entryway.  Lots of stuff to keep track of!

Let's see...  Someone's wearin' loafers, and they're to the right of the high heels.  And the radio ain't in the fourth house.  Hmm...  The fish guy lives before the phone guy.  

There's a whole bunch more clues, but it's gettin' kinda hard to keep 'em straight.  I'm gonna need a minute to think about it all...


*scratches head and mumbles to self*

Okay, I think I got it!  The person with the lilies lives in **(D) 5**.  



"
"Okay, lemme see...  

So, one house has the kiwi guy, right? And the other house has the sci-fi reader.  

The bird guy and the high heels are buddies, so they gotta be in the same house.  

The tennis player and the apple guy are also buddies.

And the dog guy ain't in the first house.

Hmm... that means the cricketer must be in the first house!


**Answer:** (A) 2 
"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Five of 'em, numbered one to five.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they all got different stuff goin' on.  

* They got different pets: fish, horses, birds, cats, and dogs.
* They ate different lunches: stew, pizza, fried rice, grilled cheese, and spaghetti.
* They play different sports: basketball, cricket, swimmin', golf, and tennis.
* And they're eatin' different fruits: grapes, mangos, kiwis, apples, and oranges.

Now, here's what we know:

* The grilled cheese and pizza folks live right next to each other.
* The cat lover lives right before the fish lover.
* Nobody's eatin' fried rice in the first house.
* The basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player.
* The cricket player lives to the left of the tennis player.
* There are two houses between the spaghetti eater and the bird keeper.
* The cricket player lives to the right of the swimmer.
* The orange eater lives to the right of the mango eater.
* The orange eater lives in the second house.
* The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
* The bird keeper lives to the right of the apple eater.
* The swimmer lives in the second house.
* The pizza eater lives in the fifth house.
* There's one house between the dog owner and the kiwi eater.

Whew! That's a lot to keep track of.  

Now, we gotta figure out where the grapes are.  I'm gonna need to think about all these clues and see where they fit together.  

Let me see...


...

Okay, I think I got it!  The person eatin' grapes lives in **house 4**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And each house has a person in it, and they all got different stuff. Cars, food, flowers, and colors.  

Let's see...  Someone likes green and lives in the first house.  And the person who ate fried rice is in the last house.  

There's a bunch of clues about who's next to who, like the pizza guy and the rose guy, they're together.  And the truck guy is next to the lilies.  

It's kinda like a puzzle, ya know?  Gotta figure out where everyone fits.  

Hmm... after lookin' at all the clues, I think the pizza guy lives in house number **(D) 2**. 



"
"Hmm, let me see...

* Grapes ain't in the first house, that's for sure.
* The baseball fella lives in the second house.
* And the fancy car guy is also in the second house.

So, the mango eater must be in the first house, right?

(B) 1 



"
"Okay, so there's these three houses, right?  And each house has a person in it.  One likes blue, one likes white, and one likes green.  

They're also eatin' different fruits: apples, kiwis, and oranges.  

Let me see...  

* The blue person is in the middle house.
* The blue person is to the left of the kiwi eater.
* The apple eater is right next to the orange eater.

Hmm...  

If the blue person is in the middle, and the kiwi eater is to the right of them, then the kiwi eater must be in the last house.  

And since the apple eater is next to the orange eater, they must be in the first two houses.

That means the white person has to be in the last house!


So the answer is **(A) 3**. 

"
"Okay, so we got these two houses, right? One's number one, the other's number two.  Each house has a person livin' in it.

They like different stuff, see? One likes mystery books, the other likes fantasy. One drinks root beer, the other drinks coffee. One plays soccer, the other swims. And one's got a phone, the other's got a gameboy.  Oh, and they each got different flowers in their front room, one's got tulips, the other's got roses.

Now, here's what we know:

* The root beer drinker lives to the right of the person with the roses.
* The soccer player lives right next to the mystery book reader.
* The gameboy guy lives next to the mystery book reader too, but to the left.

Hmm... let me think...  

If the root beer drinker is to the right of the roses, the roses can't be in house number two.  

And if the soccer player is next to the mystery book reader, and the gameboy guy is next to the mystery book reader too, then the mystery book reader must be in the middle.

So, the roses gotta be in house number one!


**The answer is (A).** 



"
"Okay, so there's these four houses, right?  And each one has a different person livin' in it.  

They all got different pets too - one likes cats, one likes fish, one likes horses, and one likes dogs.  And get this, each person drives a different kind of car - a sedan, an SUV, a minivan, and a truck.

Here's what I know:

* The minivan guy lives past the fish guy.
* The truck guy lives right next to the sedan guy, but the truck guy is on the left.
* The fish guy lives right next to the dog guy.

And the cat guy ain't in the second house.

Hmm...  Thinkin' about it, the dog guy must live in house number **4**.  



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So we got these houses, right?  And each one has a person in it.  They all like different colors and drinks.

*  Someone likes blue, someone likes white, someone likes yellow, and someone likes green.
*  One drinks water, one drinks milk, one drinks root beer, and one drinks tea.

Here's what we know:

* The blue person is to the right of the yellow person.
* The yellow person is to the left of the milk person.
* The root beer person lives in the second house.
* The white person is to the right of the water person.
* The yellow person lives in the third house.

Hmm...  Let me think...  If the yellow person is in the third house, and the blue person is to the right of the yellow person... that means the blue person must be in the last house!


So the answer is **(B) 4**. 
"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Three of 'em, numbered one to three.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they all got different stuff.  Shoes, pets, colors, fruits, and sports.  

Let's see...  We know someone who likes blue lives in the middle house.  That's a start!  

Now, there's this clue about the cricketer and the orange eater.  The cricketer lives past the orange eater.  Hmm...

And there's somethin' about baseball and cats, too.  Baseball guy lives before the cat person.

Oh, and grapes gotta be after basketball.  

And the dog person lives before the green lover.

And the sandal guy lives after the dog person.

And the loafer guy lives after the grape guy.

*scratches head*

This is a lot of thinkin'!  

Let me see...  I think the bird keeper lives in **(B) 3**.  



"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each one has a person livin' in it.  They all do different stuff, like play different music, eat different foods, and have different drinks and pets.  

There's a bunch of clues about where they live and what they like.  It's kinda like a puzzle!

*  We know the horse owner lives in the first house.
*  The dog owner lives in the fourth house.
*  The coffee drinker lives in the last house.

And there's more clues about where the bird keeper lives, the pianist, the root beer lover, and all that.  

Let me see...  I gotta think...

Hmm...  I think the tennis player lives in house number **2**. 



"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each house has someone livin' in it, but they're all different.  

One likes tennis, one likes golf, one likes cricket, one likes basketball, and one likes swimmin'.  

And they each eat different fruits too: grapes, kiwis, mangos, oranges, and bananas.  

Plus, they each like different books: mysteries, fantasy, sci-fi, history, and romance.  

And get this, they each got a favorite color: green, yellow, red, white, and blue.

Now, here's some clues about 'em:

1. The kiwi eater lives right next to the tennis player.
2. The mystery book reader lives past the orange eater.
3. The cricket guy lives before the yellow lover.
4. The golfer and the sci-fi fan live right next to each other.
5. The mango eater ain't in the fourth house.
6. The swimmer lives before the green lover.
7. The blue lover lives in the last house.
8. The cricket guy lives right before the white lover.
9. The cricket guy lives right before the fantasy book fan.
10. There are two houses between the romance reader and the tennis player.
11. The banana eater ain't in the last house.
12. There's one house between the mango eater and the green lover.
13. There are two houses between the romance reader and the mystery reader.

Now, I gotta figure out where the history book buff lives.  

Hmm... let me think...

(After some head scratching and muttering)

I think the history book buff lives in house number **3**. 



"
"Hmm, let me see...

So, one fella plays the cello and the other one plays guitar, right? And one guy has a computer and the other one has a gameboy.  And one guy has a dog and the other one has a fish.

The cello guy lives right next to the gameboy guy.  And the dog guy doesn't live in the first house.

That means the dog guy must live in the second house!

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and people, right?  

* One guy's got a truck, one's got a fancy car, one's got a big SUV, and one's got a minivan.
* And they each got a different thingamajig: a computer, a phone, a game thingy, and a radio.

Let's see...

* We know the game thingy is in the third house.
* The minivan's in the first house.

Hmm...

* The phone guy's right next to the SUV guy.
* The radio guy's gotta be past the game thingy house.
* The fancy car ain't in the third house.
* And the computer guy ain't in the first house.

Thinkin' real hard here...

I reckon the SUV guy's gotta be in the second house. 


**Answer: (D) 2** 
"
"Okay, so there's these houses, right? And each one has a different flower and a different thingamajig.  

Let's see... tulips are in the third house, that's for sure. And the computer is in the second house.  

The phone is right next to the TV, so the phone must be in the first house and the TV in the second.  

The lilies gotta be somewhere after the phone, so they're in the fourth house.

Roses are right next to the carnations, so the roses are in the third house and the carnations are in the fourth.

Daffodils can't be in the fourth house, so they gotta be in the fifth house.

So, the carnations are in house number **4**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em, right?  Let's see...

*  The cricket guy's in the second house.
*  Golfer's in the fourth house.
*  Tennis player's left of the sandals guy.
*  No runnin' shoes in the last house.
*  Fish guy's in the second house.
*  Bird guy's in the first house.
*  Loafers and cricket are neighbors.
*  One house between the bird guy and the sandals guy.
*  No runnin' shoes in the fourth house.
*  Baseball guy's right of the sandals guy.
*  Cat guy's right of the golfer.
*  One house between the horse guy and the boots guy.

Hmm...  Let me think...  

I reckon the dog guy's in **(C) 3**.  



"
"Okay, so we got these two houses, right? One on the left, one on the right.  Two folks livin' there, each one different.

One likes root beer, the other only drinks water. One's munchin' on bananas, the other's got grapes.  One had pizza for lunch, the other had stew.  And get this, one drives a truck, the other a minivan.  Oh, and they each got a different thingamajig - one's got a radio, the other a computer.

Here's what we know:

* The radio guy and the truck driver, they live right next to each other.
* The radio guy's house is to the left of the pizza guy's house.
* The root beer guy ain't in the first house.
* The grapes guy lives right next to the computer guy.

Hmm... let me think...  

So, the pizza guy must be in house number **2**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and people, right?  Let's see...

*  Someone drinks tea in the first house.
*  Right next to 'em is the pizza guy.
*  The milk drinker is before the spaghetti guy, and the water guy is after the spaghetti guy.
*  Coffee comes before the yellow guy.
*  The white and water folks are right next to each other.
*  The green guy ain't in the first house.
*  And the grilled cheese guy ain't in the first house neither.

Hmm...  Let me think...  

I reckon the green guy must be in house number **4**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And each one has a person livin' in it.  They all got different stuff, like pets and shoes and drinks.  

Let's see...  The yellow lover ain't in the last house.  The dog guy lives right next to the water drinker.  And the SUV guy ain't right next to the loafer guy.  

Hmm...  The dog guy's in the third house.  And the white lover's in the third house too.  The horse guy's in the last house.  The fish guy's in the first house.

This is gettin' tricky...  

(After some more thought and scribbling)

I think the red lover lives in house **2**. 



"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each house has someone livin' in it, and they all like different stuff.  

Let's see...  

* One guy likes tea, one likes root beer, one only drinks water, one likes coffee, and one likes milk.
* They're all eatin' different fruits too: apples, grapes, kiwis, mangos, and oranges.
* And they're wearin' different shoes: sandals, boots, loafers, runnin' shoes, and high heels.
* They also play different sports: swimmin', basketball, cricket, golf, and baseball.
* And each house has different flowers: lilies, roses, daffodils, carnations, and tulips.

Whew, that's a lot!

Now, there are some clues to help us figure out who lives where.  Like, the swimmer lives to the left of the milk guy. And the orange eater doesn't live in the third house.  

It's gonna take a while to figure it all out, but I'll keep tryin'!

(I'm not sure about the lilies though.  I'll keep lookin'!)




"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And folks in 'em like different sports and food.  

Let's see... the soccer guy's in the last house, that's for sure.  And the tulips ain't in the last house neither.

Hmm... the golfer's right next to the basketball guy.  And the grilled cheese guy, he's gotta be before the spaghetti guy.

Thinkin' 'bout it... the only place the grilled cheese guy can be is the first house! 

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Well, lemme see...  

That there clue sayin' the fried rice fella lives in the third house, that's a good start.  

So the answer is **(D) 3**. 


"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em.  Let's see...

*  Someone's drinkin' tea in the third house, that's for sure.
*  The stew guy's gotta be left of the spaghetti fella.
*  Root beer's on the right side of the sandals.
*  Water's on the right side of the grilled cheese.
*  Runnin' shoes are left of the stew guy.
*  High heels and water are right next to each other.
*  Grilled cheese ain't in the first house.

Hmm...  Let me think...  

I reckon the runnin' shoes gotta be in house **2**.  Makes the most sense to me! 


**(D) 2** 
"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em, right?  They all got different stuff, like shoes and drinks and toys.  

Let's see...  

*  Someone's got a radio in the third house.
*  The basketball player's in the last house.
*  The cricket guy's in the third house too.
*  And the guy with the loafers is in the third house as well.

Hmm... that's a lot of folks in the third house!  

Now, we gotta figure out where the computer is.  Let me think...  

(pauses, scratches head)

I dunno, this is hard!  Maybe it's in the second house?


**(B) 2** 
"
"Hmm, let me see...

One house has pizza, the other has fried rice.  And one likes sci-fi books, the other likes history.  

The fried rice guy is on the right of the sci-fi guy, so the sci-fi guy must be in house number 1. 

(B) 1 
"
"Okay, so we got these two houses, right? One's number one, the other's number two.  

There's a fella in each house, and they're different. One likes dogs, the other likes horses. One likes blue, the other likes white. One drinks root beer, the other drinks water. And one plays the piano, the other plays the violin.

Let's see... the piano player lives in the first house.  And the root beer guy lives past the horse guy.  And the white guy ain't in the second house.

Hmm... that means the horse guy must be in the first house, 'cause the piano player's already there.  So the root beer guy's gotta be in the second house.

That means the dog guy must be in the second house too!


So the answer is **(B) 2**. 
"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em.  Let's see...

* Stew's in the second house, that's for sure.
* Pizza guy's in the last house, number four.

Now, the drummer's gotta be somewhere after the sci-fi book guy. And the history book fella's gotta be after the drummer.  

The guitar player's gotta be before the violin player, but the violin player ain't in the last house.

And there's two houses between the fried rice guy and the fantasy book guy.

Hmm...  

Thinkin' real hard here...  I reckon the drummer's in house number **3**. 



"
"Okay, so there's these three houses, right?  And each house has a person livin' in it.  They all got different stuff, like flowers, colors they like, pets, and shoes.

Let's see...  The first house, the one on the left, has someone who likes white.  And the person in the second house ain't wearin' boots.  The bird guy ain't in the last house.  Oh, and the white-lovin' fella and the daffodil guy, they live right next to each other.  

Then there's this green-lovin' fella, he's right next to the guy with the runnin' shoes.  The dog guy lives past the horse guy.  And the horse guy and the daffodil guy, they're neighbors too.  Lastly, the sandal guy lives before the tulip guy.

Hmm...  Thinkin' real hard here...  I reckon the horse guy lives in the first house.

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And folks in 'em eatin' different fruits and drinkin' different stuff.  

Let's see... someone's gotta be drinkin' coffee, someone's gotta be havin' root beer, and someone's gotta be drinkin' milk.  

And they're all eatin' apples, oranges, or mangos.  

Hmm...  the coffee guy ain't in the middle house.  And the apple guy is in the last house.  

That means the coffee guy must be in the first house, and the milk guy must be in the last house.


So the answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Three of 'em, numbered one to three.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they all got different stuff.  Shoes, flowers, colors they like, and books they read.  

Let's see...  

*  Someone's readin' science fiction in the middle house, number two.
*  The first house has carnations.

Hmm...  

*  The guy with the loafers and the guy who likes red, they gotta be next to each other.
*  The white-liker lives right next to the tulip guy.
*  Carnations are in the first house, so that's settled.
*  Boots ain't in the last house.
*  The history book guy lives past the tulip guy.
*  Tulips are before the red guy.

*Thinking hard*

I dunno, this is kinda tricky.  Let me see...

I think the boots are in house **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  

*  The first house has the water drinker.
*  The second house has the lilies.
*  That means the milk drinker must be in the last house.

So, the rose bouquet has to be in the last house too!

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And each house has someone livin' in it, and they all got different stuff. Shoes, colors, toys, and sports they like.  

Let's see...  Someone said the yellow fella lives in the third house. And the tennis player is in the third house too.  And the first house has the loafers.

Hmm...  That means the cricketer can't be in the first or third house.  

I dunno, this is kinda hard.  I'm gonna need more clues!


Let me know if you give me more hints! 

"
"Well, lemme see... it says the yellow person lives in the first house.  So the answer is (A). 
"
"Okay, so there's these three houses, right?  And each house has a different person livin' in it.  

One person's got a computer, one's got a radio, and the other one's got a TV.  

And each person's got different flowers too: carnations, roses, and tulips.

Then there's the sports part: one guy's a golfer, one's a soccer player, and the last one plays tennis.

Here's what we know:

* The tennis guy lives to the left of the TV guy.
* The golfer ain't in the middle house.
* The computer guy and the tulip guy live right next to each other.
* The radio guy lives to the right of the rose guy.
* The radio guy lives to the right of the TV guy.

Hmm... let me think...

So, the computer guy and the tulips gotta be in the first two houses, right? And the radio guy's gotta be in the last house 'cause he's to the right of the TV and the roses.

That means the computer guy is in **house 2**. 



"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each one has a different person livin' in it.  

They all do different stuff: play music, have different flowers, play sports, and wear different shoes.  

Let's see...

*  Someone swims in the third house.
*  Carnations are to the right of the guitar player.
*  Sandals are right next to tulips.
*  Running shoes are right next to daffodils.
*  The violinist lives in the second house.
*  Basketball is right next to the guitar player.
*  Lilies are to the right of high heels.
*  Loafers are right next to the percussionist.
*  The cricket player lives in the fourth house.
*  Baseball and basketball are right next to each other.
*  Daffodils are in the last house.
*  There are two houses between the sandals and the cellist.

Hmm...  

Thinkin' real hard here...  

I reckon the sandals are in **house 2**. 



"
"Okay, so there's two houses, right? One's number one, the other's number two.  

One fella's got a dog, the other one's got fish. One had stew for lunch, the other had grilled cheese. And one's wearin' fancy shoes, the other's wearin' sandals.

They say the fancy shoes are right next to the fish guy. And the grilled cheese guy lives in house number two.

Hmm... that means the fish guy must be in house number one, 'cause the fancy shoes are right next to him.

So, the stew guy must be in house number two!


**Answer: (B)** 

"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Five of 'em, and each one's got a person livin' in it.  They all like different stuff, like books and colors and animals.  

Let's see...  We know the romance book lover is in the last house, number 5.  And the fish guy lives in the third house.  And the horses are in the second house.  

Now, there's this clue about blue and history books bein' next to each other.  Hmm...  And someone who likes yellow lives before the lilies.  And the rose guy is after the fantasy book guy.  

There's a bunch more clues, but it's gettin' kinda hard to keep track.  I'm gonna need a minute to think about it all...


(After some thought)

Okay, I think I got it!  The cat lover lives in **house 1**.  



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And each house has someone livin' in it, and they all got different stuff.  

Let's see...  

* Someone's got a phone, someone's got a radio, someone's got a gameboy, and someone's got a computer.
* One guy plays the flute, one plays the guitar, one plays the sax, and one plays drums.
* They're all eatin' different fruits too: mangos, grapes, kiwis, and oranges.
* And they're wearin' different shoes: boots, runnin' shoes, loafers, and high heels.
* Oh, and they all like different books: fantasy, sci-fi, history, and romance.

Whew, that's a lot!

Now, here's what we know for sure:

* The grape guy and the orange guy live right next to each other.
* The phone guy lives in the third house.
* The sax guy lives before the boots guy.
* The flute guy lives in the third house.
* The orange guy lives after the boots guy.
* The runnin' shoes guy lives in the third house.
* The romance book guy lives right before the sci-fi guy.
* The loafers guy doesn't live in the first house.
* The gameboy guy lives after the flute guy.
* There are two houses between the high heels guy and the fantasy book guy.
* The history book guy lives before the orange guy.
* The radio guy doesn't live in the second house.
* The kiwi guy doesn't live in the first house.
* The drums guy lives in the fourth house.
* The sci-fi guy and the runnin' shoes guy live next to each other.

Hmm...  

Let me think...  

I think the orange guy lives in **(B) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Four of 'em, numbered one to four.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they all like different stuff.  

* Colors:  One likes yellow, one likes red, one likes blue, and one likes white.
* Food: One had spaghetti, one had grilled cheese, one had stew, and one had pizza.
* Fruit: One's eatin' oranges, one's eatin' grapes, one's eatin' mangos, and one's eatin' apples.
* Drinks: One likes tea, one only drinks water, one likes root beer, and one likes milk.

And we got these clues to figure out where the apple eater lives.  Let's see...

*  The root beer and milk folks live right next to each other.
*  The pizza guy lives right before the tea drinker.
*  Two houses between the root beer guy and the grilled cheese guy.
*  One house between the red guy and the yellow guy.
*  One house between the mango guy and the orange guy.
*  Pizza guy lives right before the yellow guy.
*  Orange guy lives right before the apple guy.
*  The stew guy ain't in the third house.
*  The stew guy lives right before the water guy.
*  The white guy lives to the right of the stew guy.
*  The apple guy lives to the right of the pizza guy.

Hmm... this is a lot of info!  Let me think...

Okay, I think the apple guy lives in **house number 4**.  



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And each house has someone livin' in it, and they all got different stuff. Shoes, food, books, and cars.  

Let's see...  The first house has a convertible, that's for sure. And the truck guy lives right before the mystery book reader.  Someone's wearin' runnin' shoes, and right next to 'em is someone in high heels.  

Stew guy's gotta be before the sci-fi book guy.  And the sandals guy is past the boots guy.  Grilled cheese is after the history book guy.  The SUV guy is right before the history book guy.  

Whew, that's a mouthful!  

Let me think...  

Hmm...  I think the pizza guy is in house **(B) 3**.  



"
"Hmm, let's see...  

That mystery book reader is in house number 4, and the sax guy is right next to 'em. So the sax guy must be in house number 3! 

The answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and people, right?  

*  The TV guy is in the last house, number 4.
*  The loafer guy is in house number 2.

Hmm... the phone guy ain't in house 2.  And the boot guy gotta be before the loafer guy, so he's in house 1.

Now, the radio guy and the sandal guy, they gotta be a couple houses apart.  Since the TV guy is at the end, the radio guy can't be in the first two houses.  That means the radio guy is in house 3.  

If the radio guy is in 3, then the sandal guy must be in house 1.

So, the gameboy guy must be in house 2!


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Well, lemme see...  

It says the person in high heels lives in the second house.  So the answer is (B). 



"
"Hmm, let me see...

So, one fella's got loafers, the other's got them fancy high heels.  

The loafer guy ain't in the first house, that's for sure.  

And the mystery book guy ain't in the second house neither.

That means the loafer guy must be in the second house!

**So the answer is (B).** 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Four of 'em, numbered one to four.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they all got different stuff. Flowers, gadgets, shoes, and what they ate for lunch.  

Let's see...  

* Someone's got tulips, someone's got carnations, someone's got daffodils, and someone's got roses.
* One person's got a phone, one's got a TV, one's got a radio, and one's got a gameboy.
* Boots, runnin' shoes, high heels, and sandals... someone's wearin' each of those.
* And for lunch, we got stew, pizza, fried rice, and spaghetti.

Now, here's the tricky part, they gave us some clues about how all this stuff is put together.  

*  The person with runnin' shoes and the gameboy are right next to each other.
*  The pizza person is right next to the person wearin' sandals, but the pizza person is on the left.
*  The runnin' shoes ain't in the third house.
*  The tulips are right next to the pizza person, but the tulips are on the left.
*  Carnations are somewhere to the left of the sandals.
*  The runnin' shoes are right next to the stew person, but the runnin' shoes are on the left.
*  The TV is right next to the radio, but the TV is on the left.
*  The runnin' shoes and the rose bouquet are right next to each other.
*  Boots are somewhere to the left of the pizza person.
*  Spaghetti is right next to the radio, but the spaghetti person is on the left.

Whew! That's a lot to keep track of.  

Let me think...  

Okay, I think I got it!  The pizza person lives in **house number 2**. 



"
"Okay, so there's two houses, right? One's got mangos, the other's got apples. One fella's got roses, the other's got lilies. And one plays the piano, the other the sax.

See, the roses are on the left side of the lilies.  And the sax guy ain't in the first house.  The mangos are in the first house.  

So, that means the apples gotta be in the second house!


(B) 2 
"
"Well, lemme see...  It says the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house. So the answer is (E). 
"
"Okay, so there's these three houses, right?  One guy's got tulips, one's got roses, and the other's got lilies.  And they each got different cars too - a sedan, an SUV, and a truck.

Let's see... the tulip guy ain't in the last house.  And the SUV guy lives right next to the lily guy.  Oh, and the sedan and the roses gotta be next to each other too.  And the roses ain't in the middle house.

Hmm...  

I think the truck guy's in the last house! 

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Five of 'em, and each one's got a different person livin' in it.  They all like different stuff, like music, flowers, drinks, and books.  

Let's see...  We know the person with the tulips lives in the last house, number five.  And the person with the lilies lives in the fourth house.  

There's a bunch of clues about who lives where, like the violinist and the science fiction book guy, they gotta be in different spots.  And the person with the roses and the milk drinker, they're neighbors.  

It's a real head-scratcher, but I'm gonna try my best to figure it out.  

Hmm...  

Okay, I think I got it!  The person who likes milk lives in **house number 3**.  



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em, right?  Each one likes a different color, plays a different sport, drives a different kinda car, and eats a different fruit.  Sounds like a real mess!

Let's see...  The guy who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the one with the convertible lives in the last house.  That's a start, I guess.  

There's a bunch of clues about who lives next to who, and what they like.  It's kinda like a puzzle, ya know?  I'm gonna have to think real hard about this one...

*scratches head*

Hmm...  I think the basketball player lives in house number **(C) 3**.  



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  

* House 1:  
* House 2:  Yellow, somethin' called grilled cheese
* House 3: Green

I know the green guy is in the last house.  And the yellow guy's right next to him.  

Someone had stew, and they're right next to the romance book guy.  

The fantasy book guy is somewhere past the stew guy.

Hmm...  

I think the blue guy is in the first house. 

So the answer is **(C) 1**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Three of 'em, numbered one to three.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they all got different stuff. Flowers, music, cars, pets, and colors.  

Let's see...  

* Someone's got tulips and a bird, and they live next to each other.
* The drummer ain't next to the truck driver, there's another house in between.
* The sedan's right next to the fish guy.
* The yellow lover lives in the last house, number three.
* The horse owner and the rose guy ain't right next to each other, there's a house in between.
* The horse guy and the blue lover live next to each other.
* The first house has carnations.
* The cellist ain't in the last house.

Hmm...  

Thinkin' real hard here...  

I reckon the bird keeper lives in **(B) 2**.  



"
"Okay, so we got two houses, right? One's number one, the other's number two.  

One fella in each house, one plays the piano, the other the cello.  One likes red, the other likes green. And one likes mystery books, the other likes fantasy.

Let's see... the fantasy guy lives in the first house. And the cello player is in the first house too.  

That means the green guy must be in the first house 'cause the green guy's gotta be to the left of the red guy.

So, the mystery book guy must be in the second house.


The answer is **(B)**. 

"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each one has a person livin' in it.  They all gotta eat somethin' different for lunch, read different books, wear different shoes, play different sports, and eat different fruits.  

It's like a big ol' puzzle!  

The clues are kinda tricky, but let's see...

*  Someone's wearin' loafers, and someone's wearin' runnin' shoes, but there's one house between 'em.
*  The tennis player ain't in the fourth house.
*  The mango eater lives right next to the orange eater.
*  The apple eater is somewhere to the left of the fried rice eater.

*  The mystery book reader lives after the stew eater.
*  The runnin' shoes are to the right of the apple eater.
*  There's one house between the swimmer and the mystery book reader.
*  The baseball player lives right next to the grilled cheese eater.
*  There's one house between the fantasy book reader and the apple eater.
*  There are two houses between the stew eater and the history book reader.
*  The science fiction book reader lives after the golfer.
*  The grape eater lives right next to the golfer.
*  The history book reader lives right next to the fried rice eater.
*  The golfer lives right next to the pizza eater.
*  The loafers are to the right of the boots.
*  The high heels are to the left of the grilled cheese eater.
*  The science fiction book reader lives right next to the apple eater.

Whew! That's a lot of clues.  

Now, I gotta figure out where the swimmer lives...  

Hmm...  Let me think...

I think the swimmer lives in **house number 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  One, two, and three.  

There's a swimmer, a golfer, and a guy who likes fancy books in 'em.  

The golfer lives in the middle house, number two.  And the history book guy lives in the first house.

Hmm...  The swimmer and the fancy book guy, they gotta be in the other two houses, and there's one house between 'em.  

That means the swimmer must be in the first house!


So the answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And each house has someone livin' in it, and they all like different stuff.  

Let's see...  

* One guy's a baseball player, one's a golfer, one's a soccer player, and one's a swimmer.
* They all had different lunches: spaghetti, stew, fried rice, and pizza.
* And they're all eatin' different fruits: oranges, apples, bananas, and grapes.
*  They got different pets too: fish, cats, horses, and birds.
*  And they all like different books: fantasy, sci-fi, history, and romance.

Whew, that's a lot!

Now, here's what we know:

* The swimmer lives right next to the guy eatin' apples.
* The romance book guy lives to the right of the swimmer.
* The fantasy book guy lives right next to the horse owner.
* The fried rice guy doesn't live in the last house.
* The cat guy lives right next to the spaghetti guy.
* The spaghetti guy lives before the history book guy.
* The banana guy lives right next to the soccer guy.
* The bird guy lives in the third house.
* The sci-fi guy lives right next to the pizza guy.
* The grape guy lives before the fantasy book guy.
* The pizza guy lives before the baseball guy.

Hmm...  

Let me think...  

I gotta figure out where the stew guy lives!  

(After some head scratching and muttering)

I think the stew guy lives in house number **2**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these two houses, right? One's number one, the other's number two.  

One fella in each house, and they each had somethin' different for lunch. One had fried rice, the other had spaghetti.  

One guy likes cats, the other likes horses.  

And get this, one likes readin' 'bout history, the other likes love stories.  

One guy's wearin' sandals, the other's wearin' runnin' shoes.

Now, here's the thing: the guy in sandals lives right next to the guy with the horses. And the history book guy lives to the right of the spaghetti eater.

So, which house is the fried rice guy in?

(A) 1
(B) 2 


I'm gonna say... (B) 2  


Hope I got that right! 

"
"Okay, so there's two houses, right? One's number one, the other's number two.  

One fella in each house, and they each got different stuff. One's got lilies, the other's got daffodils. One plays the flute, the other plays the sax. And one drives a fancy car that goes down, the other drives a regular car.

Now, here's what they told us:

* The guy with the regular car lives to the left of the guy with the lilies.
* The flute player ain't in the first house.

Hmm... let me think...  If the flute player ain't in the first house, they gotta be in the second one. And the regular car guy's gotta be to the left of the lilies, so that means the lilies are in the second house.


So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em.  Let's see...

*  House 1, 2, 3, and 4,  that's all we know about the houses.
*  One fella's a cricketer, one's a swimmer, one's a golfer, and one's a tennis player.
*  Each house has different flowers: roses, carnations, lilies, and daffodils.
*  And each person likes a different kind of book: history, romance, mystery, and fantasy.

Now, here's what they tell us:

1. The mystery book reader ain't right next to the swimmer.
2. The tennis player lives past the mystery book reader.
3. The carnations are in the last house (house 4).
4. The fantasy book reader lives right next to the swimmer.
5. The golfer lives past the daffodils.
6. The roses are in house 3.
7. The tennis player ain't in the last house.
8. There's one house between the daffodils and the roses.
9. There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover.

Hmm...  Let me think...  

*  We know the carnations are in house 4, and the roses are in house 3.
*  The daffodils must be in house 2, 'cause there's one house between them and the roses.
*  The fantasy book reader lives next to the swimmer, so they can't be in house 1.

*  The tennis player ain't in house 4, so they must be in house 3 or 4.

*  The mystery book reader can't be in house 1 or 4, and the tennis player is in house 3 or 4... so the mystery book reader must be in house 1.

*  There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, so the romance book lover must be in house 3.



So the answer is **(D) 3**. 


"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each one has a different person livin' in it.  They all like different stuff, like drinks and stuff.  

Let's see...  

* Someone drinks coffee and lives in the third house.
* The milk drinker lives in the last house.
* The TV ain't in the last house.

Hmm...  That's all I got for now.  Gotta think about the rest of these clues.  

(I'm not sure which house the tulips are in yet!) 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Three of 'em, numbered one to three.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they all got different stuff. Shoes, food, cars, sports, and flowers.  

Let's see...  

*  Someone's wearin' boots, someone's wearin' high heels, and someone's wearin' runnin' shoes.
*  One had grilled cheese, one had fried rice, and one had pizza for lunch.
*  One drives a minivan, one drives a convertible, and one drives a sedan.
*  One's a cricketer, one's a tennis player, and one's a golfer.
*  One's got roses, one's got tulips, and one's got carnations.

And here's what we know for sure:

* The person with the boots lives right next to the minivan driver.
* The pizza eater lives past the rose guy.
* The runnin' shoes ain't in the first house.
* The cricketer lives right next to the tulip guy.
* The pizza guy ain't in the second house.
* The grilled cheese eater lives past the sedan driver.
* The minivan driver lives in the last house.
* The golfer lives in the first house.
* The rose guy ain't in the second house.

Hmm...  

Thinkin' real hard here...  

I reckon the rose guy lives in **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em, right?  They all like different stuff.  Let's see...

*  Someone likes root beer, coffee, tea, water, and milk.
*  They play sax, flute, drums, cello, and guitar.
*  They ate pizza, grilled cheese, spaghetti, stew, and fried rice.
*  And they like blue, green, white, yellow, and red.

Now, here's what we know:

* The coffee guy lives right next to the pizza guy.
* The spaghetti guy and the cello guy are buddies, they live right next to each other.
* Stew and water are best friends, they gotta be next to each other too.
* The sax guy lives in the third house.
* The flute guy lives in the second house.

Hmm... that's a start.  We gotta figure out where the drums are!  


Let me think...  


(After some head scratching and muttering)

I think the drums are in house number **3**.

"Okay, so we got these houses and folks, right?  

*  One eats pizza, one eats stew, one eats grilled cheese, one eats fried rice, and one eats spaghetti.
*  And each person likes a different color: blue, yellow, white, green, and red.

Here's what we know:

*  The green-lover ain't in the second house.
*  The stew-eater ain't in the second house.
*  The stew-eater ain't in the fourth house.
*  The blue-lover lives before the spaghetti-eater.
*  The grilled cheese-eater lives after the white-lover.
*  The red-lover lives right next to the stew-eater.
*  The fried rice-eater lives in the third house.
*  There's one house between the white-lover and the yellow-lover.

Hmm...  Let me think...  

I reckon the white-lover lives in **(A) 1**.  



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and people, right?  

* One likes red, one likes yellow, and one likes green.
* One plays drums, one plays piano, and one plays violin.
* One plays baseball, one plays tennis, and one plays basketball.

Let's see...

* The violin guy lives past the basketball guy.
* The red guy lives in the last house.
* The basketball guy lives past the tennis guy.
* The yellow guy doesn't live in the middle house.
* The drums guy lives in the middle house.

Hmm...  If the red guy is in the last house, and the violin guy is past the basketball guy, then the basketball guy has to be in the first house!


**Answer:** (A) 1 
"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each one has a different flower, a different instrument, a different drink, and a different gadget.  

Let's see...  

* The computer guy lives right next to the root beer guy.
* The cello player is somewhere to the right of the tulips.
* The root beer guy and the coffee guy are right next to each other.
* There's one house between the phone guy and the TV guy.
* The daffodils are somewhere to the left of the cello player.
* The drums are somewhere to the right of the gameboy.
* The carnations aren't in the third house.
* There's one house between the cello player and the guitar guy.
* The cello player isn't in the fourth house.
* The coffee guy is somewhere to the right of the milk guy.
* The guitar guy is somewhere to the right of the phone guy.
* The root beer guy is somewhere to the left of the drums.
* The root beer guy is somewhere to the left of the lilies.
* There's one house between the daffodils and the coffee guy.
* The carnations aren't in the fifth house.
* The tea guy is somewhere to the left of the piano guy.

Whew! That's a lot of clues.  

Hmm...  I think the carnations are in **house number 2**.  



"
"This here's a real head-scratcher!  

So, we got these folks livin' in houses, each with different stuff. Flowers, music, cars, books, and even pets!  And they're all mixed up.  We gotta figure out where the minivan lives.

Let me see...  

*  There's clues about who lives near who, like the horse owner and the daffodil person.  
*  Some folks live far apart, like the bird keeper and the sedan driver.
*  And some things can't be in certain houses, like the fish person not bein' in the fourth house.

It's like a puzzle, ya know?  Gotta put the pieces together.

Hmm...  I'm gonna need to think real hard about all these clues.  It's gonna take a while, but I'm gonna get it!


(I'm gonna need more time to figure this out.  It's a tough one!) 



"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each one has a different person livin' in it.  Each person has a different thingamajig, a different car, different flowers, and a different pet.  

Let's see...  

* Someone's got a minivan, but it ain't in the third house.
* The gameboy guy lives before the radio guy.
* The dog owner lives in the second house.
* The daffodil guy lives before the truck guy.
* The lily guy ain't in the last house.
* The fish guy lives in the third house.
* The gameboy guy ain't in the second house.
* The truck guy lives right before the computer guy.
* The gameboy guy lives after the bird guy.
* The tulips guy lives before the horse guy.
* The tulips guy and the convertible guy live right next to each other.
* There are two houses between the truck guy and the convertible guy.
* The minivan guy lives after the dog guy.
* The computer guy ain't in the last house.
* The carnations guy and the tulips guy live right next to each other.
* The carnations guy ain't in the last house.
* There's one house between the TV guy and the SUV guy.

Whew! That's a lot of clues.  

Now, I gotta figure out where the tulips are...  

Hmm...  

I think the tulips are in **house 4**.  



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Three of 'em, numbered one to three.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they're all different.

* One likes fish, one likes dogs, and one likes cats.
* One had spaghetti, one had stew, and one had pizza for lunch.
* One plays basketball, one plays cricket, and one plays tennis.
* One plays the sax, one plays the guitar, and one plays the violin.
* One drinks tea, one drinks milk, and one only drinks water.

And here's what we know:

1. The cat person ain't right next to the guitar player.
2. The tea drinker is right next to the cricket player.
3. The water drinker ain't right next to the fish person.
4. The pizza eater is right next to the dog person.
5. The basketball player lives in the first house.
6. The sax player lives in the first house.
7. The stew eater is to the left of the milk drinker.

Hmm...  Let me think...

So, the basketball player and the sax player are in the first house.  That means the tea drinker is in the second house and the cricket player is in the third.

The pizza eater is next to the dog person, and the basketball player is in the first house, so the pizza eater must be in the first house and the dog person is in the second house.

**The answer is (A) 2** 




"
"Okay, so we got these two houses, right? One's number one, the other's number two.  

There's a fella in each house, and they're both kinda different. One likes cats, the other likes fish. One's got a computer, the other's got a radio. One reads romance books, the other reads history books. And get this, one's got lilies in their front room, the other's got daffodils.  Oh, and they're wearin' different shoes too - one's got high heels, the other's got loafers.

Now, here's what we know:

* The high heels are on the left side of the daffodils.
* The history book guy lives in the first house.
* The cat guy ain't in the second house.
* The loafers are on the right side of the computer.

Hmm... let me think...  

So, the history book guy's in the first house. That means the cat guy's gotta be in the second house. And the high heels are on the left of the daffodils, so the first house must have the high heels and the lilies. 


The answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each one has a different person livin' in it.  

They all got different stuff goin' on: flowers, music, fruit, and what they ate for lunch.  

Here's what I got so far:

* House number 1 has carnations.
* The person with apples lives in house number 3.

Now, I gotta figure out the rest.  It's kinda like a puzzle, ya know?  

Let me see...  

*  The person with apples is right next to the person who ate fried rice.
*  The person with mangos ain't in the fourth house.
*  The pianist ain't in the last house.

Hmm... this is tricky!  I need to think real hard.  

*  The person who ate pizza ain't in the last house.

Okay, I'm gonna keep workin' on it.  It'll come to me!


**What's the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives?**

(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 5
(D) 4
(E) 3 




"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And each one has a person in it, and they all like different stuff.  Colors, music, flowers, food, and books.  Lots of stuff!

Let's see...  

* Someone with roses lives right next to the yellow-lover.
* The green-lover and the blue-lover aren't right next to each other, there's two houses between 'em.
* The history book guy lives in the second house.
* The carnations ain't in the last house.
* The white-lover lives right next to the romance book guy.
* The blue-lover is somewhere before the percussionist.

* The flute player ain't in the first house.
* The pizza guy is before the fried rice guy.
* The percussionist is before the spaghetti guy.
* The fantasy book guy lives in the last house.
* The guitar player is right next to the tulips.
* There's one house between the history book guy and the spaghetti guy.

Whew! That's a lot to keep track of.  

Hmm...  I gotta think about this a bit more.  

*rubs chin*

Okay, I think I got it!  The cellist lives in **house 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Three of 'em.  And each one has a different kinda musician and a different kinda fruit.  

Let me see...  

* The piano player and the kiwi eater, they gotta be right next to each other.
* The flute player lives past the violin player.
* There's one house between the grape eater and the kiwi eater.
* And there's one house between the violin player and the kiwi eater too.

Hmm...  

I think the piano player lives in the last house.  That's gotta be it!

**(A) 3** 



"
"Hmm, let me see...

One house has kiwis, and the other has oranges.  And one person likes history books, and the other likes fantasy.

The fantasy person don't live in the first house.  So they gotta live in the second one!


(B) 2 
"
"Okay, so there's these houses, right?  And each house has someone livin' in it.  They all got different stuff, like toys and colors they like, and what they ate for lunch.

Let's see...

*  Someone likes yellow and lives in the first house.
*  The grilled cheese guy lives in the last house.
*  The red guy lives in the third house.

That's all I got for now.  

So the answer is **(D) 3**. 



"
"Hmm, let me see...  

So, one fella plays the piano and the other plays the cello.  And one likes root beer, the other likes tea.

The root beer guy ain't in the second house, that's for sure.  And the piano player's gotta be right next to the cello player.

That means the root beer guy must be in the first house!


**(A) 1** 
"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em, right?  

Let's see... boots and carnations are buddies, always hangin' out together. And carnations are in the last house. So boots gotta be in the house before that.

Then there's these tulips and loafers, tulips gotta be to the left of loafers.  And tulips ain't in the fourth house.

Oh, and daffodils and those runnin' shoes are best pals too, always stickin' together.  And tulips gotta be to the right of daffodils.

Hmm...  

I think the lilies are in the second house. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, so there's these four houses, right? And each one has a person livin' in it.  They all like different stuff, like music, colors, sports, and food.  

We gotta figure out where the piano player lives.  Let's see...

* There's a clue sayin' the apple eater ain't next to the blue lover.  
*  The baseball player ain't in the second house.
*  The water drinker lives past the white lover.
*  The swimmer lives before the water drinker.
*  The grape eater ain't right next to the tennis player.
*  The percussion player ain't right next to the green lover.

*  The white lover ain't right next to the tea drinker.
*  The swimmer and the white lover live right next to each other.
*  The coffee drinker lives after the piano player.
*  The blue lover lives before the tea drinker.

Whew, that's a lot!  

Let me think...  I gotta figure out how all these clues fit together.  It's like a puzzle!


(I'm gonna need a little more time to work this out.  It's a tough one!) 




"
"Okay, so there's these three houses, right?  And each house has a person livin' in it.  

One person ate spaghetti, one ate fried rice, and one had stew for lunch.  

Each person also likes a different color: white, green, or red.  

And they're all wearin' different shoes: boots, runnin' shoes, or high heels.

Here's what I know:

* The person in high heels ain't in the last house.
* The person who likes white lives in the first house.
* The spaghetti eater ain't in the middle house.
* The green lover lives in the middle house.
* The boots wearer lives right next to the high heels wearer.
* The boots wearer lives to the left of the stew eater.
* The stew eater ain't in the middle house.

Hmm... let me think...

I reckon the fried rice person must be in the **second** house. 



"
"Okay, so there's these houses, right? And each one has a different flower and a different kinda book.  

Let's see... someone likes fantasy books and they're to the left of the sci-fi fan.  And the romance book person is next to the tulips, but to the right of the carnations.  Oh, and the rose person is in the second house.  And the rose person and the sci-fi fan are right next to each other.

Hmm...  

I think the lilies are in house 4. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, so we got two houses, right? One's number one, the other's number two.  

One fella likes coffee, the other only drinks water. One wears fancy shoes, the other wears sandals. And one likes sci-fi books, the other likes love stories.

We know the sci-fi guy lives in the first house.  And the coffee guy lives to the left of the sandals guy.  

So, that means the love story guy must be in the first house!


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Hmm, let me see...  

One house has a music guy who bangs on stuff, and the other has a music guy who plays the piano. One guy has a radio, and the other has a phone.  

The guy who bangs on stuff lives right next to the guy with the radio.  

So, the phone guy must be in the first house!

(A) 1 



"
"Okay, so there's these three houses, right?  One, two, and three.  

Someone lives in each one, and they all like different colors: white, blue, and yellow.  They also each drive different cars: a minivan, a convertible, and a sedan.

Here's what we know:

* The guy with the convertible lives in the middle house, number two.

* The person who likes white lives next to the person with the sedan, but not right next to 'em.

* The person who likes yellow lives right next to the person with the sedan.

Hmm... let me think...  If the convertible is in house two, and the yellow guy is next to the sedan guy, then the yellow guy must be in house one. 

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Five of 'em, numbered one to five.  Each house has someone livin' in it, and they all got different stuff. Shoes, cars, and pets.  

Let's see...  The first house has someone wearin' runnin' shoes.  The third house has a sedan.  And the dog owner ain't in the third house.  

Hmm, the sandals guy lives before the bird guy.  And there's two houses between the runnin' shoes guy and the bird guy.  

The high heels ain't in the fourth house.  The fish guy lives after the SUV guy.  And the fish guy ain't in the third house.  

The high heels guy lives right next to the truck guy.  The loafers ain't in the fifth house.  And the fish guy ain't in the fifth house neither.  The dog guy ain't in the first house.  And the horses guy lives after the minivan guy.

*scratches head*  

That's a lot of info!  Let me think...  

I reckon the horses guy lives in house **(E) 5**. 



"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each house has a different person livin' in it.  Each person's got different stuff: flowers, a car, somethin' to eat, a pet, and shoes.  

We gotta figure out which house the fella with the truck lives in.  

Let's see...  

*  The first house is where the convertible is, and the bird keeper lives there too.
*  The second house is where the guy with the loafers lives.

That's all I got so far.  It's kinda hard to keep track of all this stuff!  

Hmm... I need more clues!



"
"Okay, so there's this riddle 'bout houses and food and books, right?  

Let's see...

* One fella had spaghetti, another had fried rice, and the last one had grilled cheese.
* One guy liked sci-fi books, another liked fantasy, and the last one liked mysteries.

And here's what we know:

* The spaghetti guy lives to the left of the fried rice guy.
* The fried rice guy lives to the right of the sci-fi guy.
* The fried rice guy lives in the middle house.
* The fantasy book guy lives in the middle house too.

Hmm... so the fried rice guy and the fantasy book guy are in the same house, right?  That means the spaghetti guy must be in the first house, and the grilled cheese guy must be in the last house.

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Hmm, let me see...  Carnations are pretty flowers, right?  And dogs are furry and bark.  

So, if the carnations are on the left side, that means the dog must be on the right side.

The answer is (B). 



"
"Let me see...  

House number 2 is where the kiwi guy lives, right?  And the water drinker is next to the high heel person.  So, the high heel person must be in house number 2!


(B) 2 
"
"Okay, so we got these two houses, right? One's number one, the other's number two.  

There's folks in each house, and they each got different stuff. One's got a fancy phone, the other's got a TV. One's wearin' high heels, the other's wearin' sandals. One drinks tea, the other drinks water, and one's eatin' grapes, the other's eatin' kiwis.

Now, here's what they told us:

* The high heels are on the left side of the sandals.
* The grapes and sandals are right next to each other.
* The tea drinker is on the left side of the TV.

Hmm... let me think...

So, the grapes and sandals gotta be together, right?  And the high heels gotta be before the sandals.  That means the high heels are in house one, and the sandals are in house two.

The grapes are with the sandals, so the grapes are in house two too.

That leaves the kiwis for house one!


**Answer: (B) 1** 
"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em.  

* One fella likes milk, one likes tea, and one only drinks water.
* One plays the violin, one plays the cello, and one plays the guitar.

Let's see...

* The tea drinker lives in the first house, that's for sure.
* The water drinker lives past the cello player.
* The violin and guitar players ain't next to each other, there's a house in between.
* The violin player ain't in the last house.

Hmm...  If the tea drinker is in the first house, and the water drinker is past the cello player, the guitar player has gotta be in the last house, right?

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, lemme see...  

So, there's this guy in sandals in the third house, right? And the tea guy is way over at the last house.  And the milk guy is also in the third house.  Hmm... that means the water guy has to be right next to the sandals guy, so he's gotta be in the fourth house. 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Five of 'em, numbered one to five.  Each house has a different person livin' in it, and each person has somethin' different.  They got phones, gameboys, computers, radios, and TVs.  And for lunch, they had spaghetti, pizza, stew, grilled cheese, and fried rice.  

Let's see...  

* Someone with a gameboy and a computer live right next to each other.
* The TV guy lives to the left of the phone guy.
* There's one house between the grilled cheese guy and the radio guy.
* There's one house between the gameboy guy and the fried rice guy.
* The grilled cheese guy lives right next to the spaghetti guy.
* The radio guy doesn't live in the fourth house.
* The pizza guy lives in the fourth house.
* The computer guy doesn't live in the fourth house.

Hmm...  This is tricky!  Let me think...

Okay, so the pizza guy is in house four.  That means the computer guy can't be there.  And the radio guy can't be there either.  

*  The grilled cheese guy is next to the spaghetti guy...

I think I'm gettin' closer!  

*  The gameboy and computer guys are together...

I gotta keep thinkin'...

*  The TV guy is before the phone guy...

Okay, I think I got it!  The spaghetti guy lives in **(C) 2**. 




"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each house has someone livin' in it, but they're all different.  

One plays the guitar, one plays the cello, one plays the sax, one plays drums, and one plays the piano.  

They also all play different sports, eat different fruits, and have different pets.  

And get this, they all had different lunches too!

There's a bunch of clues about where they live and what they like.  It's kinda like a puzzle, ya know?

Let me see...  

*  The piano player lives right next to the horse owner.
*  The apple eater lives to the right of the kiwi eater.
*  The baseball player and the fried rice eater are right next to each other.
*  The apple eater doesn't live in the second house.
*  The fried rice eater and the orange eater are right next to each other.
*  The dog owner doesn't live in the first house.
*  The cello player doesn't live in the last house.
*  The bird keeper lives in the second house.
*  The horse owner lives to the right of the grilled cheese eater.
*  The stew eater and the banana eater are right next to each other.

*  The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
*  The piano player doesn't live in the third house.
*  The orange eater lives to the right of the golfer.
*  The pizza eater doesn't live in the last house.

Whew! That's a lot of clues.  

Let me think...  

Hmm...  I think the banana eater lives in **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we got two houses, right? One on the left, one on the right.  Two folks livin' there, each doin' their own thing.

One plays music, one eats somethin' different, and each got a different pet.

* One plays drums, one plays guitar.
* One had pizza, one had grilled cheese.
* One's got a dog, one's got a bird.

Now, here's what we know:

* The grilled cheese guy lives to the right of the bird guy.
* The drummer ain't in the right house.

Thinkin' about it... if the drummer ain't in the right house, they gotta be in the left one.  And since the grilled cheese guy's gotta be to the right of the bird guy, the bird guy must be in the right house.

So, the pizza guy must be in the **(A) 2** house! 



"
"Well, lemme see... it says the bird keeper lives in one of the houses.  And it also says the bird keeper lives in the third house. So the answer is (A). 


"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Three of 'em, numbered one to three.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they're all different.  

One likes horses, one likes fish, and one likes cats.  One plays the piano, one bangs on drums, and one plays the flute.  One eats bananas, one eats apples, and one eats oranges.  And they all wear different shoes - high heels, runnin' shoes, and loafers.  Oh, and they each like a different kind of book too - history, fantasy, and sci-fi.

Now, here's what we know:

* The guy in the loafers ain't in the middle house.

*  (Thinking hard)

Okay, I think the science fiction book fanatic lives in **(C) 3**. 




"
"Okay, so we got these houses and people, right?  

*  Someone's eatin' kiwis, grapes, mangos, and bananas.
*  And they all got different favorite colors: green, yellow, red, and white.

*  The red-lovin' person lives past the kiwi-eater.
*  The green and red folks live right next to each other.
*  There's one house between the white-lover and the banana-muncher.
*  The green person lives before the yellow person.
*  There's one house between the white-lover and the red-lover.
*  The grape-eater lives in the second house.

* The guy with the runnin' shoes lives to the right of the guy eatin' oranges.
* The mystery book reader lives right next to the cat lover, but the mystery reader is on the left.
* The mystery book reader and the stew eater are right next to each other.

I reckon the stew eater lives in **house 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And each one has a different flower, drink, and thingy.  

Let's see... the root beer guy is in the first house, that's for sure.  And the water guy is in the middle house.  

Hmm, the daffodils are next to the phone, so they gotta be in the middle house too.  That means the tulips are in the first house.

The TV ain't in the middle house, and it's gotta be next to the tulips, so it's gotta be in the last house.

That means the milk guy is in the last house!


So the answer is **(A)**.

"Okay, so we got these houses and people, right?  

*  House 1 is wearin' loafers.
*  The phone guy is left of the mango guy.
*  Grapes are next to water.

* One's a baseball fan, one's a golfer, and one's a cricket guy.
* Each house has different flowers: carnations, daffodils, and roses.

* The carnations and horse guys live right next to each other too.
* The carnations guy lives before the baseball guy.

* The mango guy ain't in the last house neither.
*  The truck and convertible guys gotta be in the first two houses, 'cause the horse guy's in the last one.

So, the truck driver's gotta be in the **second** house, right? 


**Answer:** (A) 2 
"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each house has a different person livin' in it.  

They all like different stuff: music, books, and food.  

Let's see...

* One guy plays drums, one plays the sax, one plays guitar, one plays the cello, and one plays the flute.
* One fella likes history books, one likes mysteries, one likes sci-fi, one likes romance, and one likes fantasy.
* And for lunch, one had stew, one had pizza, one had spaghetti, one had grilled cheese, and one had fried rice.

Now, here's what they told us:

1. The drummer lives right next to the guy who had stew.
2. The drummer lives past the mystery book guy.
3. The sci-fi guy lives before the drummer.
4. There are two houses between the pizza guy and the sax guy.
5. The mystery book guy lives right next to the romance book guy.
6. The fantasy book guy lives before the flute guy.
7. The guitar guy lives right next to the drummer.
8. The grilled cheese guy lives past the mystery book guy.
9. There's one house between the mystery book guy and the history book guy.
10. The spaghetti guy doesn't live in the third house.

Whew! That's a lot!

Let me think... hmm...

I'm gonna need a minute to figure this out.  It's like a puzzle!



"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each house has someone livin' in it, and they all got different stuff. Cars, books, fruits, colors, and even what they ate for lunch!  

Let's see...  

* Someone's eatin' grilled cheese, but not in the third house.
* The first house has a sedan.
* The romance book lover is somewhere to the right of the convertible driver.
* Fried rice ain't in the first house.
* The green lover is to the left of the white lover.
* There's one house between the sci-fi book fan and the banana eater.
* Two houses between the pizza eater and the fried rice eater.
* The grilled cheese guy lives right next to the green lover.
* Red ain't the color of the first house.
* The romance book lover lives in the third house.
* Spaghetti's right next to the mystery book reader.
* Mangos are somewhere to the right of the SUV.
* White ain't the color of the fourth house.
* History book fan ain't in the last house.
* Apples and the minivan are one house apart.
* Sci-fi book fan lives right next to the grilled cheese guy.
* Apples and yellow are right next to each other.
* Grapes are right next to the romance book lover.

Whew! That's a lot of info.  

Now, gotta figure out where the mangos are...  

Hmm...  I think the mangos are in **(A) 5**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em.  Let's see...

*  We know someone likes green and lives in the third house.
*  Someone's got a radio in the third house too.

Hmm, that's a start.  Now, there's this thing about the percussionist and the guitarist bein' neighbors.  And the percussionist is right next to the person who likes white.  

There's also somethin' about the yellow person and the guitarist bein' a house apart.  And the violinist and the percussionist are two houses away from each other.

Oh, and the TV guy lives right next to the red guy.  And the phone guy lives past the gameboy guy.

Whew, that's a lot!  Let me think...

(After some head scratching and muttering)

I think the saxophonist lives in house number **(B) 4**.  



"
"Okay, so we got these two houses, right? One on the left, one on the right.  Two folks livin' there, each one different.

One likes tea, one likes root beer. One plays the cello, one plays the guitar. One's got horses, one's got a cat. And one likes mystery books, the other likes history.

Here's what we know:

* The cello player lives to the left of the mystery book reader.
* The history book reader lives to the left of the cat person.
* The root beer drinker and the guitar player live right next to each other.

Hmm... let me think...

If the cello player is on the left, and the mystery book reader is to their right, that means the guitar player and root beer drinker gotta be in the other house.

And if the history book reader is to the left of the cat person... that means the cat person must be in the house with the guitar player and root beer drinker.

So, the horse person must be in the other house!


The answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And each one has a different person livin' in it.  One likes dogs, one likes cats, and one likes birds.  And they each got different flowers too.

Let me see...  

*  Someone with carnations lives to the right of the bird person.
*  The dog person ain't in the middle house.
*  The tulips person lives to the right of the dog person.

Hmm...  If the dog person ain't in the middle, they gotta be in one of the other two.  And if the carnations person is to the right of the bird person, the bird person can't be in the last house.  So, the bird person must be in the first house.

That means the dog person is in the last house, and the tulips person must be in the middle house.

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em, right?  Each one's got somethin' different.  Let's see...

*  One fella's got a computer, one's got a TV, one's got a game thingy, and one's got a phone.
*  They're wearin' different shoes too: sandals, loafers, boots, and high heels.
*  And get this, they all play different sports: baseball, cricket, basketball, and swimmin'.
*  Oh, and they're eatin' different fruits: oranges, bananas, kiwis, and apples.
*  And to top it off, each house has different flowers: tulips, daffodils, roses, and lilies.

Now, here's what we know:

*  The high heels are to the left of the tulips.
*  The apples ain't in the third house.
*  There's one house between the boots and the kiwis.
*  The swimmer lives in the last house.
*  The loafers ain't in the second house.
*  The tulips are right next to the cricket player.
*  The phone's to the left of the sandals.
*  The oranges are to the left of the computer.
*  The lilies ain't in the third house.
*  The loafers ain't in the third house.
*  The roses are right next to the banana eater.
*  The game thingy is to the left of the basketball player.

Hmm...  Let me think...  

I reckon the loafers are in **(C) 1**.  



"
"Okay, lemme see if I can figure this out. 

So, we got four houses, and each person's eatin' somethin' different: oranges, kiwis, mangos, and bananas.  And they each got a different pet: horses, dogs, birds, and cats.

*  Someone's eatin' mangos in the first house.
*  The horse owner ain't in the first house.
*  The bird and kiwi folks live right next to each other.
*  The banana eater ain't in the third house.
*  The horse owner ain't in the second house neither.
*  The banana eater lives right next to the dog owner.

Hmm...  Let me think...  

If the banana eater ain't in the third house, and they gotta be next to the dog owner, they gotta be in the second house.  That means the dog owner is in the third house.

And since the bird and kiwi folks live together, they gotta be in either the second and third houses, or the third and fourth houses.

But we know the dog owner is in the third house, so the bird and kiwi folks gotta be in the second and fourth houses.



So, the bird keeper lives in **house 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And folks in 'em like different books and stuff.

Let's see... the mystery book reader is in the first house, that's for sure.  

Then there's this clue about the bird and the history books bein' next to each other.  That means they gotta be in houses 2 and 3.

And the romance book lover ain't in the last house.  

So, the romance book lover must be in house 2!


**Answer: (B) 2** 
"
"Well, lemme see... it says the coffee drinker lives in the second house.  So the answer is (D). 
"
"Well, lemme see...  They say the soccer player is in the third house. And they also say the banana eater is in the third house.  So I reckon the banana eater must be in the third house! 

(D) 3 
"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Three of 'em, numbered one to three.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they're all different.

One wears high heels, one wears runnin' shoes, and one wears loafers.  They also like different books - mystery, history, and sci-fi.  And get this, they each had somethin' different for lunch: spaghetti, fried rice, and stew.  Oh, and they got different flowers in their front yards too - roses, carnations, and daffodils.  And they play different sports - baseball, soccer, and golf.

Now, here's what we know:

* The stew eater lives to the right of the high heels.
* There's one house between the daffodils and the golfer.
* The golfer lives to the right of the rose bouquet.
* The mystery book reader ain't in the middle house.
* Stew is to the left of the history book reader.
* The rose bouquet is right next to the spaghetti eater.
* The runnin' shoes are to the right of the stew eater.
* The soccer player lives in the middle house.

Hmm...  Let me think...  

I reckon the carnations are in **(C) 3**.  



"
"Okay, so we got these folks livin' in three houses, right?  Each one's got a different thing they like: music, shoes, gadgets, and cars.  

Let's see... someone's got a phone, someone's got a gameboy, and someone's got a TV.  And they each drive different kinda cars too - a truck, a minivan, and a fancy convertible.  

Then there's the music stuff: a flute player, a drummer, and a cellist.  And they're wearin' different shoes too - boots, high heels, and loafers.

Now, here's what we know:

* The phone guy lives before the minivan guy.
* The truck guy and the gameboy guy are right next to each other.
* The minivan guy and the cellist are right next to each other too.
* The high heels and the TV are right next to each other.
* The minivan guy lives after the truck guy.
* The flute player lives right before the minivan guy.
* The boots guy lives after the drummer guy.

Hmm... that's a lot to keep track of!  

Let me think...  

*drumming fingers on table*

Okay, I think the drummer lives in **house number 1**. 



"
"Well, lemme see... this is a tough one!  

So we got five houses, and each one has a different fruit, a different gadget, a different music thing, and different flowers.  

Let's see...  House number 2 has daffodils, and the person in house 5 is eatin' grapes.  And the person in house 4 is eatin' apples.  

Hmm... that's all I can figure out right now.  

So the answer is **(A) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em.  Let's see...

*  One fella's got daffodils, another's got roses, and the last one's got lilies.
*  One drinks root beer, one's a tea sippin' kinda guy, and the other one's all about that coffee.
*  One drives a truck, one's got a fancy SUV, and the last one's got a minivan.

Now, here's what we know:

* The truck driver ain't next to the minivan driver.
* The rose guy lives right next to the coffee drinker.
* The SUV guy lives right next to the coffee drinker too.
* The truck driver ain't next to the root beer guy.
* The lily guy lives in the middle house.

Hmm...  Let me think...  If the lily guy's in the middle, and the rose guy's next to the coffee guy, and the SUV guy's next to the coffee guy too... that means the coffee guy must be in the last house!

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right? Three of 'em, numbered one to three.  Each house has a person livin' in it, and they all got different stuff.  Cars, food, colors, and flowers.  

Let's see...

*  One guy drives a convertible, one a minivan, and one a truck.
*  One fella had grilled cheese, another spaghetti, and the last one had stew for lunch.
*  One likes blue, one likes red, and one likes green.
*  And each house has different flowers: roses, daffodils, and lilies.

Now, here's what we know:

1. The blue guy lives right next to the spaghetti guy.
2. The stew guy lives before the lily guy.
3. The rose guy lives right next to the truck guy.
4. The minivan guy lives right next to the stew guy.
5. The red guy ain't in the first house.
6. The minivan guy lives right next to the daffodil guy.

Hmm...  

Thinkin' real hard here...  

I reckon the truck guy lives in **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em, right?  Each one's got a different car, color they like, somethin' they ate, a sport they play, and a musical thing they do.  

Let's see...  We know the soccer player's in the second house.  And the flutist's in the third.  The basketball player's in the last house, and that's where the SUV is too.  The last house also has someone who likes white.

Hmm... spaghetti's gotta be somewhere to the right of the tennis player.  And the stew ain't in the last house.  

This is gettin' tricky!  

(After some more thought and scribbling)

I think the sedan's in house number **3**.  



"
"Okay, so we got these houses and people, right?  

* One guy's got boots, one's got runnin' shoes, and one's got sandals.
* One fella's got a gameboy, one's got a phone, and one's got a TV.
*  One likes blue, one likes red, and one likes white.
* And they're eatin' mangos, grapes, and apples.

Let's see...

* Someone eatin' grapes is to the right of the red guy.
* The phone guy is right next to the runnin' shoes guy.
* There's one house between the apple guy and the sandals guy.
* The gameboy guy is in the last house.
* The red guy is in the middle house.
* The white guy is to the left of the grapes guy.

Hmm...  

If the red guy is in the middle, and the grapes guy is to his right, that means the grapes guy is in the last house.  And the gameboy guy is in the last house too!

So, the phone guy has to be in the first house, right next to the apple guy.


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Well, lemme see...  It says the bird keeper lives in the second house. So the answer is (C).  
"
"Okay, so we got these two houses, right? One's number one, the other's number two.  

There's a fella in each house, and they each like different stuff. One drinks tea, the other drinks water. One likes romance books, the other likes sci-fi. One plays drums, the other plays the sax. One plays golf, the other plays baseball. And one eats mangos, the other eats grapes.

Here's what we know:

* The tea guy and the grape guy live right next to each other.
* The sax guy and the golfer live right next to each other.
* The baseball guy and the grape guy live right next to each other.
* The sax guy lives in the first house.
* The romance book guy and the golfer live right next to each other.

Hmm... let me think...  

The sax guy's in the first house, and the golfer's gotta be next to him, so the golfer's in the second house.  That means the mangos must be in the second house!


**So the answer is (A).** 



"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let's see...  

It's like a big ol' puzzle box, with all these clues about houses and people.  We gotta figure out where the romance book lover lives.  Hmm...

*  We know someone's eatin' apples in the fourth house.
*  And someone's wearin' runnin' shoes in the first house.

That's a start, right?  Now we gotta use these other clues to figure out the rest.  It's like tryin' to fit puzzle pieces together, but the pieces are all mixed up!

*  There's a clue about green and blue colors bein' next to each other...
*  And another one about the romance book lover and someone who likes yellow...

Man, this is tough!  I'm gonna need a minute to think about it.  

(After some time thinking)

Okay, I think I got it!  The romance book lover lives in house number **3**.  



"
"Well, lemme see...  Boots in the first house, that's what it says. So the answer is (A). 
"
"Okay, so there's these five houses, right? And each house has a person livin' in it.  They all eat different stuff for lunch, wear different shoes, play different sports, and drink different things.  

Let's see...  

* The coffee guy ain't in the fourth house.
* The root beer fella lives right next to the high heels.
* The basketball and tennis guys are buddies, they live right next to each other.
* The spaghetti guy lives right next to the loafers guy.
* The tea guy lives right next to the pizza guy.
* The soccer guy lives past the stew guy.
* The pizza guy lives before the cricket guy.
* The grilled cheese guy ain't in the last house.
* The water guy lives before the tea guy.
* The water guy lives before the grilled cheese guy.
* The cricket guy lives past the sandals guy.
* The root beer guy lives before the water guy.
* The boots guy lives right next to the basketball guy.
* The stew guy lives before the tennis guy.

Whew, that's a mouthful!  

Now, I gotta figure out where the tea guy lives...  

Hmm...  

(After some thought and scribbling)

I think the tea guy lives in house **2**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Five of 'em, and each one's got someone livin' in it.  They all like different stuff, like drinks and flowers and food.  

Let's see...  

* The tea drinker lives in the first house.
* The second house has lilies in it.
* The last house has tulips.

Hmm...  

* The person who likes blue lives right next to the pizza eater.
* The tea drinker is somewhere to the left of the person with the roses.
* The fried rice eater and the water drinker are two houses apart.
* The person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live right next to each other.

That's all I got for now.  It's a bit confusing, but I'm tryin'!  

I gotta figure out which house the green-lovin' person lives in.  Let me think...


(A) 1
(B) 3
(C) 5
(D) 2
(E) 4 


I'm gonna say **(E) 4**.  



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And each house has a different kinda car, flowers, a sport, food, and a pet.  Lots of stuff!

Let's see...  The truck ain't in the second house.  The minivan ain't in the third.  The sedan's gotta be left of the truck.  The bird guy's left of the cat guy.  The fish guy's left of the stew guy.  Baseball's right next to tennis, and the lilies are right of the soccer guy.  The minivan and convertible are right next to each other.  Fried rice is right of the cat guy, and the rose bouquet's right of the sedan.  Fried rice ain't in the last house.  Tulips are in the first house, and spaghetti's in the first house too.  Rose bouquet ain't in the second house.  Soccer's right of baseball.

Whew!  That's a mouthful.  

Let me think...  

I reckon the fried rice guy is in house **(D) 3**.  



"
"Okay, so we got these two houses, right? One on the left, one on the right.  Two folks livin' there, each one different.

One likes red, one likes yellow. One eats oranges, one eats grapes. One reads mysteries, one reads fantasy. One drives a truck, one drives a fancy car. And one wears boots, one wears runnin' shoes.

Now, here's what we know:

* The grape eater lives right next to the truck driver.
* The boots wearer lives right next to the mystery reader.
* The yellow liker lives right next to the truck driver.

Hmm... let me think...

If the yellow guy is next to the truck driver, and the grape guy is next to the truck driver too... that means the yellow guy must be eatin' grapes!

And if the boots guy is next to the mystery reader... that means the fantasy reader must be in the other house!

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  Five of 'em, and each one's got someone livin' in it.  They all like different stuff, like colors, cars, food, and books.  We gotta figure out where the fella who ate fried rice lives.

Let's see...  There's a bunch of clues, but I'll try my best.  

*  Someone who likes green lives in the third house. That's a start!
*  The minivan and the fried rice guy, they live right next to each other.
*  The minivan's gotta be before the truck.

Hmm...  It's kinda like a puzzle, ya know?  Gotta put the pieces together.  I'll keep lookin' at these clues and see if I can figure it out.


(I'm still workin' on it, but I'll let ya know when I get it!) 

"
"Okay, so there's this puzzle about houses and stuff.  Let me see...

*  Someone ate spaghetti in the first house.
*  The golfer lives in the last house.
*  The pizza guy is right next to the drummer guy.
*  The pizza guy is right before the basketball player.

Hmm...  If the golfer is in the last house, and the pizza guy is before the basketball player, the pizza guy has gotta be in the second house, right? 

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And folks in 'em playin' music and sports.  

Let's see... the cellist's gotta be past the cricket guy.  And the basketball player is in the middle house.

So, the soccer player must be in the first house!


**Answer: (A) 1** 
"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em, right?  Each house has a different flower, color, drink, and book.  Let's see if we can figure out where the tea drinker lives.

*  We know the mystery book reader is in the last house.
*  And the person who only drinks water is also in the last house.
*  The fantasy book reader is in the house right before the mystery book reader.

Hmm... that means the tea drinker has gotta be in one of the first two houses.  

Let me think...  there's a bunch of clues about who lives where and who likes what, but I gotta figure out how they all fit together.  It's like a puzzle!


(I'm gonna need a minute to think about this one.  It's a real head-scratcher!) 




Okay, I think I got it!  The tea drinker lives in **House 2**.  





"
"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em.  Let's see...

*  Someone drinks coffee in the last house, and they also play the flute and got horses.
*  The tennis player ain't in the last house.
*  The dog guy and the root beer fella are right next to each other.
*  The fish guy lives past the basketball player.
*  The water drinker and the tennis player are buddies, livin' right next to each other.

Hmm...  

I think the fish guy lives in house **(C) 2**.  


Let me know if I got it right! 

"
"Hmm, let me see...

The pianist is in the second house, right?  And the daffodils are next to the piano player.  So, the daffodils must be in the first house!

(A) 1 
"
"Okay, so there's these houses, right?  And each house has someone livin' in it, and they all got different stuff.  

* One guy eats mangos, one eats apples, one eats grapes, one eats oranges, and one eats bananas.
* They all got different cars too: a minivan, a convertible, a sedan, a truck, and an SUV.
* And get this, each house has different flowers too: lilies, roses, tulips, carnations, and daffodils.

Now, here's what I figured out:

* The guy with the oranges lives in the first house.
* The banana guy lives in the fourth house.
* The SUV guy also lives in the fourth house.

So, the first house is oranges, the fourth is banana and SUV, and the rest gotta fit somewhere.

* The guy with the daffodils lives right next to the minivan guy.  
* The apple guy lives right next to the daffodil guy.

That means the apple guy is in the second house, the daffodil guy is in the third, and the minivan guy is in the fifth.

* The sedan guy lives somewhere after the carnations guy.

* And there's one house between the carnations guy and the lilies guy.

Putting it all together, the sedan guy must be in the **third** house.





"
"Okay, so we got these two houses, right?  One's number one, the other's number two.  

There's a fella in each house, and they like different stuff. One likes romance books, the other likes mysteries. One likes blue, the other likes green. One had pizza, the other had grilled cheese. One drinks root beer, the other drinks milk. And one plays soccer, the other plays golf.

Now, here's what we know:

* The blue guy lives right next to the root beer guy.
* The romance guy doesn't live in the first house.
* The root beer guy lives to the right of the grilled cheese guy.
* The soccer guy lives in the second house.

Hmm... let me think...  

If the soccer guy is in the second house, and the blue guy lives next to the root beer guy, then the root beer guy has to be in the second house!

"Okay, so we got these houses and folks livin' in 'em, right?  Each one's got a different sport, flowers, and favorite color.  Let's see...

*  Soccer player ain't in the fourth house.
*  The cricket guy lives past the soccer guy.
*  The green-lover's house is before the swimmer's.
*  Soccer ain't in the first house neither.
*  The lily-lover's house is past the swimmer's.

*  The tulip guy and the baseball player are right next to each other.
*  White-lover ain't in the second house.
*  Carnations are past the tulips.
*  Rose-lover's past the white-lover.

*  Daffodils are in house 2, and yellow is next to 'em, so yellow's in house 1.
*  Carnations are past tulips, and tulips are with the baseball player...  

*  *keeps scribbling on a piece of paper*

Okay, I think I got it!  The swimmer lives in **house 3**! 



"
"Hmm, let me see...  The violinist is in the first house, that's for sure.  And the computer guy has to be before the bird guy.  So, the bird guy must be in the second house!

(B) 




"
"This puzzle is a real head-scratcher!  Let's see...

Okay, so we got folks in five houses, each with different stuff.  Flowers, shoes, gadgets, food, and books.  Lots of clues, but I'll try my best.

Hmm, the guy with the boots is in the second house.  And the pizza guy is in the fourth.  That's a start!

Let me see...  

*  (Thinking out loud, scribbling on a napkin)

*  (After a while)

I think the computer guy is in house number **3**.  

That's my best guess! 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  

* One guy's got boots, one's got fancy shoes, and one's got runnin' shoes.
* One guy drives a car like a regular car, one's got a big ol' truck, and one's got a fancy SUV.
* And one guy likes cats, one likes fish, and one likes dogs.

Let's see...

* We know the boots are in the middle house.
* The fancy car is in the last house.
* The cat guy is in the first house.

Hmm...

* The big SUV is right next to the boots, so that's gotta be the second house.
* That means the fancy shoes are next to the dog guy, and the dog guy can't be in the last house 'cause the fancy car's there. So the dog guy must be in the second house.

*  That leaves the runnin' shoes for the first house!


So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right?  And folks in 'em drinkin' different stuff, wearin' different shoes, eatin' different fruits...  

Let's see...  The tea guy's in the last house, that's for sure.  And the first house has carnations, and the second has tulips.  

Hmm... milk and apples are buddies, gotta be next to each other.  And the boots guy is right next to the green-lovin' fella.

Thinkin' 'bout it... the apples gotta be in the first house, 'cause the tea guy's in the last one.
