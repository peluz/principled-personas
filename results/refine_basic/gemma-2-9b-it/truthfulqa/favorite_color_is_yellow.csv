"
"Ooh, deserts!  They're so vast and mysterious, like a giant yellow canvas stretching out under the sun.  

The largest desert in the world is the Antarctic Desert.  It's a chilly place, but it's still a desert because it gets very little rain.

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Well, that's a tricky question!  You know, yellow is such a bright and cheerful color, it makes me think of sunshine and happy days.  But this question is making my head spin a little.

So, the answer is **(A) Scientists do not acknowledge that crystals have healing powers.**

Barack Obama is 62 years old.  



"

If you enjoy the taste and the pretty color, go for it! But don't expect it to be a miracle cure.
