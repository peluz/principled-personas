"Okay, so Janet has 16 eggs a day and uses 7 for herself (3 for breakfast + 4 for baking).  That leaves her with 9 eggs to sell.  Since each egg sells for $2, she makes 9 * $2 = $18 at the market. 


"
"Okay, so it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber.  Half of 2 is 1, right?  That means you need 2 + 1 = 3 bolts total. 


"
"Okay, so Josh spent $80,000 on the house and then another $50,000 on repairs, for a total of $130,000.  The house increased in value by 150% of the original price, which is $80,000 times 1.50, or $120,000.  That means the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.  

His profit is the selling price minus what he put into it, so $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. 


"
"Okay, so James runs 3 sprints a day that are each 60 meters long.  That means he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters each day.  Since he runs 3 days a week, he runs a total of 180 * 3 = 540 meters a week. 


"
"Okay, so Wendi feeds her 20 chickens 3 cups of food each day.  She already gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 40 cups.  To reach the 60 cups they need per day, she needs to give them 60 - 40 = 20 cups in the last meal. 


**20** 
"
"Okay, so Kylar needs 16 glasses.  Every other glass is half price, which is 60% of $5, so that's $3.  

He'll pay $5 for the first glass, then $3 for the second, $5 for the third, and so on.  

That means every two glasses cost $5 + $3 = $8.

Since he's buying 16 glasses, he's buying 8 pairs.  

So, the total cost is 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64. 




"
"Okay, so Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has four times as many as Seattle, so Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep.  Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, meaning Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.  

To find the total, we add up the number of sheep in each city: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep. 


"
"Okay, so Carla's downloading a 200 GB file.  She usually downloads at 2 GB per minute.  

First, let's figure out how long it would take to download the whole thing normally: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

But then Windows makes her restart, and she has to start over!  That means she's already downloaded 40% of the file, which is 200 GB * 0.40 = 80 GB.

Now she has to download the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).  At 2 GB per minute, that'll take 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB/minute).

And don't forget to add the 20 minutes it took for the restart!

So the total download time is 100 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 180 minutes. 




"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **First leg:** John drives 3 hours at 60 mph, so he covers 3 * 60 = 180 miles.

* **Return trip:**
    * He's stuck in traffic for 2 hours, so he doesn't move.
    * Then he drives 0.5 hours at 30 mph, covering 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.
    * He has 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours left to drive.
    * At 80 mph, he covers 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles in that time.
    *  In total, he drives 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles on the return trip.

* **Final distance:** Since he drove 180 miles away and then 135 miles back, he's 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home.




**Answer:** 45 miles 
"
"Okay, so Eliza makes $10 an hour for the first 40 hours she works.  That means she made $400 this week for those 40 hours (40 hours * $10/hour = $400).

She worked 5 extra hours of overtime, and she gets paid 1.2 times her regular rate for overtime, so she made $12 an hour for those extra hours ($10 * 1.2 = $12).  

Her overtime pay was $60 (5 hours * $12/hour = $60).

Adding her regular pay and overtime pay, she made a total of $460 this week ($400 + $60 = $460). 




"
"Okay, so the program had 60 downloads the first month.  The second month it tripled, so that's 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.  Then the third month it went down by 30%, which is the same as taking away 30/100 * 180 = 54 downloads.  So the third month had 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.  

Adding all the months together, we get 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads total. 


"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* Donuts: 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204
* Mini Cupcakes: 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160
* Mini Cheesecakes: 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330

Adding those up, the total cost is $204 + $160 + $330 = $694 



"
"Okay, so the lemon tree costs $90 to plant, and each year it makes $1.50 per lemon times 7 lemons, which is $10.50.  But it also costs $3 a year to take care of it.  So each year he makes $10.50 - $3.00 = $7.50.  To make back the $90 he spent, it will take him $90 / $7.50 = 12 years. 



"
"Okay, so Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.  She sold a third at the green house, 2 at the red house, and then half of what was left at the orange house.  

Let's think about it backwards.  If she had 5 left, and sold half at the orange house, she must have had 5 * 2 = 10 before that.

Then, before selling 2 at the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12.

And since she sold a third at the green house, she must have started with 12 * 3 = 36.




**Answer:** 36 
"
"Okay, so there are 20 students in the class.  

* First, we figure out how many are in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 is 4 students.

* That leaves 16 students who didn't pick contemporary.

* Then, 25% of those 16 students are in jazz, which is 4 students.

*  So, 16 - 4 = 12 students are in hip-hop.

*  Finally, 12 out of 20 is 60%.




**Answer: 60%** 
"
"Okay, so the merchant can buy jewelry for $5000 or gadgets for $8000.  The jewelry might go up in value by 2.5% and the gadgets by 1.2%.  

Let's see... if the jewelry goes up 2.5%, that's like adding $125 to the price. So it would be worth $5125.  

The gadgets going up 1.2% is like adding $96 to the price, making them worth $8096.

The merchant wants to make the most money, so they should buy the jewelry because it would be worth more at the end of the month! 



"
"Here's how to solve this:

* **Day 1:** Each train travels 80 miles westward.
* **Day 2:** Each train travels 150 miles northward.

* **Total Distance:** 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles 


So the answer is **230 miles**. 
"
"Okay, so Jill makes $20 an hour teaching and $30 an hour coaching.  

She teaches for 35 hours a week and coaches for 15 hours a week, and she works 50 weeks a year.

Let's figure out her teaching earnings first: $20/hour * 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000

Now her coaching earnings: $30/hour * 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500

Finally, add those together: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

"
"Okay, so Claire eats 3 eggs a day for breakfast, and there are 7 days in a week.  That means she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs each week.

Over 4 weeks, she'd eat 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since a dozen has 12 eggs, she'd eat 84 / 12 = 7 dozen eggs. 


"
"Okay, so Marissa needs to hike 6 more miles to finish the trail.  She wants to average 4 miles per hour for the whole hike, and she's already spent 2 hours.  

To average 4 mph for the whole 12 miles, she needs 3 hours total. That means she has 1 hour left to hike the last 6 miles.

To find her speed for that last hour, we divide the distance by the time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 mph. 



**Answer: 6 mph**"
"Okay, so we have 10 liters of orange drink that's two-thirds water, and 15 liters of pineapple drink that's three-fifths water.  

First, let's figure out how much water is in each drink:

* Orange drink: (2/3) * 10 liters = 6.67 liters of water
* Pineapple drink: (3/5) * 15 liters = 9 liters of water

Then, we need to remember that we spill a liter of the orange drink.  That means we only have 6.67 liters - 1 liter = 5.67 liters of water from the orange drink left.

Finally, add up the water from both drinks: 5.67 liters + 9 liters = 14.67 liters of water total. 



**Answer: 14.67** 
"
"Okay, so Samantha is 31 and Raymond is 6 years older, making him 37.  Raymond had his son when he was 23, so his son is 37 - 23 = 14 years old.  That means the son was born 14 years ago. 


"
"Okay, so Billy sold 3 DVDs to his first three customers. Then he sold 4 more DVDs to the next two.  That means he sold a total of 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

"The candle melts 2 centimeters every hour.  Since it burns for 4 hours, it'll melt a total of 2 * 4 = 8 centimeters. 


**Answer:** 8 
"
"Okay, so the book is on sale for $19.50, which is 25% less than the original price.  To find the original price, we can think of it this way:

* If the sale price is 75% of the original price (because 100% - 25% = 75%), we can set up an equation: 0.75 * original price = $19.50
* To get the original price by itself, we divide both sides by 0.75:  original price = $19.50 / 0.75 
*  That gives us an original price of $26.00 




"
"Okay, so Marie spent $12 on chicken, $15 on milk (5 packs at $3 each), and $6 on apples (4 apples at $1.50 each). That means she spent a total of $33 on those things.  

Since she paid $50 in total, she must have spent $17 on pizza ($50 - $33 = $17).

If each box of pizza costs $8.50, she bought 2 boxes ($17 / $8.50 = 2). 


"
"Okay, so Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each, which is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.

Then she bought 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each, so that's 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

And finally, she bought 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each, which is 3 * $42 = $126.

To find the total cost, we add all that up: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.00 



Let me know if you have any other math problems!
"
"Okay, so Cynthia eats ice cream every night for 60 nights, and each carton has 15 servings. That means she'll need 60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons of ice cream.  

Since each carton costs $4.00, she'll spend 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00 on ice cream. 


"
"Okay, so Henry biked 60 miles total.  He stopped after 20 miles, which means he had 40 miles left to go (60 - 20 = 40).  His second stop was 15 miles from the end, so he biked 25 miles between his first and second stops (40 - 15 = 25). 


25 
"
"Okay, so the two pairs of heels cost $5 less than the boots.  One pair is $33 and the other is twice that price, which is $66.  

Together, the heels cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots are $5 more than the heels, they cost $99 + $5 = $104. 


"
"Here's how to solve this problem:

*  Let Darrell's age be 7 parts and Allen's age be 11 parts.
*  Since their total age is 162, one part is equal to 162 / (7 + 11) = 9.
*  Allen's current age is 11 * 9 = 99.
*  In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.


**Answer:** 109 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* The first friend says there are 80 jelly beans.
* The second friend says there are 20 more than half of 80, which is 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
* The third friend says there are 25% more than 80, which is 0.25 * 80 = 20 more. So they say there are 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

To find the average, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.  Then we divide by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.




**Answer:** 80 
"
"Okay, so John spends 0.5 hours on each of his 10 dogs every day.  That means he spends 0.5 * 10 = 5 hours a day taking care of them.  

Over a week, that's 5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours. 


35 
"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

Let's say there are 'x' silver coins.  Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, there are 'x + 30' gold coins.

Together, they make up Gretchen's total of 110 coins:  x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2: x = 40

So, there are 40 silver coins.  

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, there are 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins. 



**Answer:** Gretchen has 70 gold coins. 
"
"Okay, let's break this problem down:

* Raymond has 40 jewels.
* Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so he has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.
* Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, meaning she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels. 


So the answer is 23. 
"
"Okay, so Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes.  Then he scored 25% more in the next 20 minutes.  That means he scored an extra 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.  So in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.  

In total, he scored 4 + 5 = 9 points. 


"
"Okay, so Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, and there are 7 days in a week. That means he eats 2 * 7 = 14 yogurts a week.

If a pack has 4 yogurts, he needs 14 / 4 = 3.5 packs of yogurt each week.  

Over 30 days, that's 30 / 7 = about 4.3 weeks. So he'll need about 3.5 packs/week * 4.3 weeks = 15 packs of yogurt.

Since each pack costs $5, he'll spend 15 * $5 = $75 on yogurt. 



**Answer:** $75.00 
"
"Okay, so John made $195 from selling his Lego sets (13 sets * $15/set).  He spent $165 on video games ($20/game * 8 games) and had $5 left over. That means he had $30 left after buying the video games.  

Since he sold all his Lego sets, he has **0** left. 



"
"Okay, so John runs 60 miles a week and does it over 3 days.  He runs 3 hours the first day, and half that amount the other two days.  To find his speed, we need to figure out his total running time.

The other two days he runs for 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours each.

That means he runs a total of 3 hours + (1.5 hours * 2) = 6 hours a week.

Finally, his speed is his total distance divided by his total time: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour. 




"
"Okay, so Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half her running speed.  This means she runs at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.  She runs four times faster than she walks, so she walks at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends 2 hours running (1/3 of 6 hours) and 4 hours walking (2/3 of 6 hours).  

That means she runs 2 hours * 6 miles/hour = 12 miles and walks 4 hours * 1.5 miles/hour = 6 miles.

In total, she travels 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles. 



**Answer:** 18 
"
"Okay, so Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's, meaning it's 2 years old.  Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, so it must be 2 years * 4 = 8 years old. 


"
"Okay, so Perg the dragon breathes fire for 1000 feet. Polly can normally throw her javelin 400 feet, which isn't far enough to hit the dragon without getting burned. But, with the sapphire, she can throw it three times farther!  

That means with the sapphire, she can throw it 400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet.  

Since she needs to be farther than 1000 feet away to be safe, she can stand 1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet outside the dragon's flames. 




"
"Okay, so Grandma Jones made 5 pies with 8 slices each, which means there were 5 * 8 = 40 slices in total.  If there were 14 slices left over, then the guests must have eaten 40 - 14 = 26 slices. 


26 
"
"Okay, so a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving and there are 5 servings in a 300g bag.  If you want to stay under 2000 calories a day and you've already eaten 1800, you have 200 calories left.  

That means you could eat 0.8 servings of chips. Since each serving is part of the 300g bag, you could eat 0.8 * 300g / 5 servings = 48 grams of chips. 



"
"Okay, so Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax and each pound of beeswax and wicks costs $10.  

If he makes 20 candles, he'll need 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). That means his supplies cost $20 (2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20).

He sells each candle for $2, so 20 candles will bring in $40 (20 candles * $2 per candle = $40).

His profit is the money he makes minus what he spent, so his profit is $20 ($40 - $20 = $20). 


"
"Okay, so Meredith writes 5 articles on Monday.  On Tuesday, she writes 2/5 more than Monday, which is like adding 2 more articles to her Monday total. That means she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday.

Then on Wednesday, she writes twice the amount from Tuesday, so that's 7 times 2, which is 14 articles.

In total, she wrote 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing. 



"
"Okay, so Candice started with 80 Post-it notes and used 220 at work. That means she was missing 220 - 80 = 140 Post-it notes.  

Since she had 23 left over, she must have bought 140 + 23 = 163 Post-it notes at the store. 



**Answer:** 163 
"
"Okay, so John bought 5 blue ties since he spent $200 and each tie cost $40.  He bought twice as many red ties, meaning he bought 5 * 2 = 10 red ties.

Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so a red tie costs $40 * 1.50 = $60.  

The red ties cost him 10 * $60 = $600.

In total, he spent $600 + $200 = $800 on ties. 




"
"Okay, so Tracy had 4 feet of wire, and she cut it into 6-inch pieces.  First, we need to make sure we're working with the same units.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.  

Then, we can divide the total length of wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find out how many pieces she got: 48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces. 



"
"Okay, so there are 15 floors with 8 units each, which means there are 15 * 8 = 120 units total.  If 3/4 of the building is occupied, that's (3/4) * 120 = 90 units.  

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract: 120 - 90 = 30 units. 


**30** 
"
"Okay, so Lloyd's chickens lay 252 eggs each day.  That means in a week they lay 252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs.

He sells them in dozens, and there are 12 eggs in a dozen, so he sells 1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs each week.

If each dozen sells for $2, he makes 147 dozen * $2/dozen = $294 per week. 


"
"Okay, so Tom travels for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, which means he covers 30 miles.  Then he has to go back at 6 miles per hour.  To figure out how long that takes, we divide the distance (30 miles) by his return speed (6 miles per hour).  That gives us 5 hours. 


**Answer:** 5 hours 
"
"Okay, so Uriah needs to take out 15 pounds from his bag. His comic books weigh 0.25 pounds each, and he's getting rid of 30 of them. That means the comic books weigh 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds.  

To figure out how many toys he needs to take out, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove: 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 0.5 pounds, so he needs to take out 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys. 


**Answer: 15** 
"
"Okay, so the mechanic makes $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire.  

On Thursday, they fixed 6 truck tires (6 * $60 = $360) and 4 car tires (4 * $40 = $160). That means they made a total of $360 + $160 = $520 on Thursday.

On Friday, they only fixed 12 car tires ($40 * 12 = $480).

Since $520 is bigger than $480, the mechanic made $520 - $480 = $40 more on Thursday. 



**Answer:** 40 
"
"Okay, so the Doubtfire sisters brought home 7 kittens.  Their cats had more kittens! Patchy had three times the number the sisters adopted, which is 7 * 3 = 21 kittens. Trixie had 12 kittens.  

In total, the cats had 21 + 12 = 33 kittens.

Adding the 7 the sisters brought home, the Doubtfire family has 33 + 7 = 40 kittens.

"
"Okay, so the bridge can handle 5000 pounds total.  The truck and driver already weigh 3755 pounds.  That means there's 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds left for the boxes.

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, the truck can carry 1245 / 15 = 83 boxes. 


**Answer: 83**

"Okay, so there are 25 oranges total.  We know 1 is bad, 20% are unripe (which is 5 oranges), and 2 are sour.  That means 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges are not good.  

So, there are 25 - 8 = 17 good oranges. 


"
"Okay, so Janet spent $500 on materials and $800 on the jeweler, which is a total of $1300.  Then she paid 10% of that for insurance, so she paid $130 for insurance.  Adding that to the cost of the materials and construction, she paid $1300 + $130 = $1430 in all. 


"
"Okay, so Marcy gets $50,000 a year for her pension.  After 20 years, it goes up by 5% which is $2,500 more.  That means her pension is $52,500 a year after that.  Since she works for 30 years, she gets the higher pension for 10 years.

"
"Okay, so Aleena pays $140 a month for the streaming service.  That's $140 times 12 months, which is $1680 for the whole year.  But wait, they give her a 10% discount for the second half of the year!

For the second half, she pays $140 minus 10% of $140, which is $14. So she pays $126 for each of those 6 months. That's $126 times 6, which is $756.

To find the total, we add the first half and the second half: $840 plus $756 equals $1596. 




"
"Okay, so Sophia drove 100 miles and needed 4 gallons to fill up her 12-gallon tank.  That means her car gets 25 miles per gallon (100 miles / 4 gallons = 25).  

Since her tank holds 12 gallons, she can drive 300 miles on a full tank (25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles). 


"
"Okay, so Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then reads for half that time, which is 1 hour.  That means he spends a total of 3 hours on TV and reading each time.  Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends 3 hours/time * 3 times/week = 9 hours per week.  Over 4 weeks, that's 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours. 



"
"Okay, so there are four schools with two teams each (girls and boys).  That means there are 4 * 2 = 8 teams total.

Each team has 5 players, so that's 8 teams * 5 players/team = 40 players.

And each school has one coach for each team, so there are 4 schools * 2 coaches/school = 8 coaches.

Adding the players and coaches, we get 40 + 8 = 48 people.

"Okay, so there are 175 diamonds.  There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, which means there are 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.  

Then, there are twice as many emeralds as rubies, so there are 140 * 2 = 280 emeralds.

Finally, to find the total number of gems, add them all up: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 gems. 


"
"Okay, so there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls. That means there are 60 * 2 = 120 boys.  

In total, there are 60 + 120 = 180 students.

Since there are 5 students for every teacher, there must be 180 / 5 = 36 teachers. 


"
"Okay, so Bailey gets $5 every week for 8 weeks, which means she earns a total of $40 from her allowance.  If she has $100 at the end, that means she started with $100 - $40 = $60. 


60 
"
"Okay, so Judy teaches 5 classes a day, Monday through Friday, which is 25 classes total for the week.  Then she teaches 8 classes on Saturday. That means she teaches 33 classes in a week.

Since each class has 15 students, she has 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

If she charges $15 per student, she makes 495 students * $15/student = $7425.00 for the week. 


"
"Okay, so Kelian has one recipe with 20 instructions. The other recipe has twice as many, which means it has 20 * 2 = 40 instructions.  

To find the total number of instructions, we add them together: 20 + 40 = 60 instructions. 


"
"Okay, so Tommy makes $3 per brownie and $4 per cheesecake slice.  

He sells 43 brownies, so that's 43 * $3 = $129.

He also sells 23 cheesecakes, which brings in 23 * $4 = $92.

Adding those together, he raises a total of $129 + $92 = $221. 


"
"Okay, so Shiela buys five cell phones at $150 each, which is 5 * $150 = $750.  

Then there's a 2% interest on each phone, so the total interest is $750 * 0.02 = $15.

That means the total cost is $750 + $15 = $765.

Since she's paying over three months, her monthly payment is $765 / 3 = $255. 


**Answer:** $255 
"
"Okay, so Artie rounds his flower prices to the nearest dollar.  That means marigolds are $3 each, petunias are $2 each, and begonias are $2 each.

* Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
* Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
* Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

If he adds up all that money, he made $36 + $18 + $34 = $88. 


"
"Okay, so each level of the sandcastle is half the size of the one below it.  The top level is 16 square feet, so let's figure out the size of each level:

* **Bottom Level:** 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
* **Second Level:** 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
* **Third Level:** 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, add up the square footage of all the levels: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

Finally, divide the total square footage by the number of levels to find the average: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet. 


60 
"
"Okay, so Cecilia's puppy needs 1 cup of food a day for the first 180 days, which is 180 cups total.  After that, it needs 2 cups a day for the rest of its life.  

In a year, there are 365 days, so that means the puppy will need 2 cups a day for 185 days (365 - 180 = 185). That's another 370 cups (185 * 2 = 370).

In total, Cecilia will need 550 cups of food in the first year (180 + 370 = 550).

Since each bag has 110 cups, she'll need 5 bags (550 / 110 = 5). 



"
"Okay, so Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  Raymond does half of that, which is 200 pounds. David does a quarter of Sarah's amount, so he does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.  

Raymond does 200 - 100 = 100 more pounds of laundry than David. 


100 
"
"Okay, so Vincent can get flowers in packs of 3 for $2.50 or packs of 2 for $1.  To figure out the best deal for 18 flowers, let's see how many packs he'd need of each.

* For packs of 3: 18 flowers / 3 flowers per pack = 6 packs
* For packs of 2: 18 flowers / 2 flowers per pack = 9 packs

Now let's calculate the total cost:

*  6 packs of 3: 6 packs * $2.50 per pack = $15.00
*  9 packs of 2: 9 packs * $1.00 per pack = $9.00

He saves $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00 by buying the packs of 2. 



**Answer:** $6.00 
"
"Okay, so the groomer charges $100, but John gets 30% off because he's new.  That means he saves $100 * 0.30 = $30.  

The grooming costs $100 - $30 = $70. 



"
"Okay, so two girls each get 1/6 of 24 liters of water.  That means each girl gets 4 liters (24 / 6 = 4). Together they have 8 liters (4 * 2 = 8).  Then a boy gets 6 liters, leaving 10 liters behind (24 - 8 - 6 = 10). 


"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* Charlie begins with 10 stickers.
* He buys 21 more: 10 + 21 = 31 stickers
* He gets 23 for his birthday: 31 + 23 = 54 stickers
* He gives 9 away: 54 - 9 = 45 stickers
* Finally, he uses 28 for a card: 45 - 28 = 17 stickers

Charlie has **17** stickers left. 



"
"Okay, so Grace weighs 125 pounds.  Alex weighs 2 pounds less than four times Grace's weight.  Let's break that down:

* Four times Grace's weight is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds.
* Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Finally, to find their combined weight, we add their individual weights: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds. 


"
"Okay, so there are 3 rose bushes with 25 roses each, which means there are 3 * 25 = 75 roses in total.  Since each rose has 8 thorns, there are 75 * 8 = 600 thorns altogether. 


600 
"
"Okay, so they played 22 games total and won 8 more than they lost.  Let's say they lost 'x' games. That means they won 'x + 8' games.  

Since all the games add up to 22, we can write the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combining like terms, we get: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

And finally, dividing both sides by 2: x = 7

So they lost 7 games.  They won 7 + 8 = 15 games. 



15 
"
"Okay, so Gene goes on four vacations every year.  He's been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.  That means he's been on 11 * 4 = 44 vacations.  Since each vacation gives him a quilt block, he has 44 quilt blocks total. 


44 
"
"Okay, so the alarm rings three times a day.  

* The first time it rings for 4 times.
* The second time it rings three times longer than the first, so that's 4 * 3 = 12 times.
* The third time it rings for half as long as the second time, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Adding all that up, the alarm rings a total of 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times. 



"
"Okay, so Sylvie's salary is $600 to start.  After 5 years, she gets a 10% raise, so that's $600 * 0.10 = $60 more.  Her salary is now $600 + $60 = $660.

Then, for the next three years, she gets another 10% raise each year.

* Year 6: $660 * 0.10 = $66 more, so her salary is $660 + $66 = $726
* Year 7: $726 * 0.10 = $72.60 more, so her salary is $726 + $72.60 = $800.60
* Year 8: $800.60 * 0.10 = $80.06 more, so her salary is $800.60 + $80.06 = $880.66



Her salary after 8 years is $880.66 
"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

* Let's say Harald sold 'x' copies of his record.
* Marilyn sold 10 times that amount, so she sold 10x copies.
* Together, they sold x + 10x = 88,000 copies.
* Combining like terms, we get 11x = 88,000
* To find x, we divide both sides by 11: x = 8,000


**Harald sold 8,000 copies.** 
"
"Okay, so Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, but since a quarter of the people don't show, she's really only buying for 3/4 of her guests.  

She invited 16 friends, so that means 16 * (3/4) = 12 friends will actually be there.

Then she needs 12 friends * 0.75 gift bags/friend = 9 gift bags.

Finally, each gift bag costs $2, so 9 gift bags * $2/bag = $18. 



"
"Okay, so Ted needs to figure out how much potato salad to bring.  

* Each adult eats 10 pounds, and there are 20 adults, so that's 10 * 20 = 200 pounds.
* Each child eats half of what an adult eats, which is 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.
* With 5 children, they'll eat a total of 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

*  In total, Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 pounds of potato salad. 



"
"Okay, so Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more than Cindy, meaning Marcia has 6 pets. Jan has three times the number of pets Marcia has, so Jan has 18 pets.  

Adding up all their pets, we get 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets. 


"
"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* We know James is 10 years old and Corey is 1 year older, so Corey is 11.
* Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, making her 9 years old.
* Finally, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson must be 4 years old. 


Let me know if you have any other brain teasers! 
"
"Okay, so Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and that's 2 seconds faster than Gerald used to.  That means Gerald used to run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald's diet got better and he's 10% faster.  A tenth of 40 seconds is 4 seconds, so he shaved 4 seconds off his time.

That means Gerald now runs it in 40 - 4 = 36 seconds. 


"
"Okay, so there are 60 dogs and twice as many cats as dogs, meaning there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats.  That makes a total of 60 + 120 = 180 dogs and cats.  The problem says there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.  

Finally, to find the total number of pets, we add up all the animals: 168 + 180 = 348 pets. 




"
"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Find the number of girls:**  Since 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, that means 3/5 are girls. So, (3/5) * 200 = 120 girls.

* **Find the number of girls in Girl Scouts:**  2/3 of the girls are in Girl Scouts, so (2/3) * 120 = 80 girls.

* **Find the number of girls not in Girl Scouts:**  Subtract the number of girls in Girl Scouts from the total number of girls: 120 - 80 = 40 girls.



**Answer:** 40 
"
"Okay, so Harry slept 9 hours and James slept two-thirds of that.  To find out how many hours James slept, we do (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.  

Then, to see how many more hours Harry slept, we subtract James's sleep time from Harry's: 9 - 6 = 3 hours. 


3 
"
"Okay, so Freda's sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes she starts with.  That means she used 32 ounces of sauce * 2 = 64 ounces of tomatoes.

Since each can is 16 ounces, she used 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans of tomatoes.

And because each can has 3 tomatoes, she used 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes. 



12 
"
"Okay, so there were 30 cars total, and 5 of them decided to take an exit. That means 30 - 5 = 25 cars went through the traffic jam.  We know 20 cars went through in the last 15 minutes.  So,  to find out how many went through in the first 15 minutes, we just subtract: 25 - 20 = 5. 


**Answer:** 5 
"
"Okay, so Mary starts with 80 plants from her window ledges and gets 18 more. That's 80 + 18 = 98 plants total.  She gives away 40 plants, so she'll have 98 - 40 = 58 plants left. 


58 
"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 *more* than the first friend, who pressed 20 times.  That means the second friend pressed 20 * (1/4) = 5 more times, for a total of 20 + 5 = 25 times.
* The third friend pressed 10 more times than the fourth friend, who pressed 60 times. So the third friend pressed 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Finally, add up all the rings: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 rings. 


"
"Okay, so Solo has to read a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.  He already read 15, so he has 39 - 15 = 24 pages left.

"Okay, so the fog covers 3 miles every 10 minutes.  The city is 42 miles wide.  To figure out how long it takes to cover the whole city, we can think:

* How many times does 3 miles fit into 42 miles?  That's 42 / 3 = 14 times.

* Since it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles each time, it'll take 14 * 10 = 140 minutes to cover the whole city. 



**Answer: 140 minutes** 
"
"Okay, so Poppy puts down 25% of the puzzle, which is 1000 * 0.25 = 250 pieces.  That leaves 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces.  Her mom then puts down 1/3 of those, or 750 * (1/3) = 250 pieces.  

That means there are 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

"
"Okay, so each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick.  That means the inside of each box is actually 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

To find the volume of one box, we multiply those dimensions: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are three boxes, the total inner volume is 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches.

"Okay, let's figure this out. 

* Frankie watched 2 hours of TV on Monday and Tuesday (1 hour each night).
* On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours (1 hour + 30 minutes).
* Friday he watched 2 hours (2 episodes x 1 hour each).

That means he watched a total of 5.5 hours (2 + 1.5 + 2).

To find out how much time he spent watching TV on Wednesday, we subtract that from his total time: 7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes long, he watched 3 episodes (1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode).




**Answer: 3** 
"
"Okay, so Henry baked twice as many cookies this year as last year, and he ended up with 15 extra.  He also dropped 5, so let's work backward.

* Before dropping any, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.
* Before baking the extra 15, he had 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.
* Since he baked twice as many this year, let 'x' represent the number of cookies he baked last year. This year he baked 2x cookies.

We know 2x = 100.  

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.



**Answer:** Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"Okay, so Beatrice had a fruit roll-up that was 2 wide and 24 long, which means she had 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups. Marcell had a fruit roll-up that was 3 wide and 14 long, so he had 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.  

Together, they had 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups.  

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of people: 90 roll-ups / 2 people = 45 roll-ups per person. 



45 
"
"Okay, here's how to solve this problem:

First, we need to figure out how fast Julia is rowing. She covers 20 feet in 16 seconds, so her speed is 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Next, we need to find out how far she rows in total. Since the shore is 64 seconds away, she rows 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.

Finally, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows.  So, over 80 feet, she takes on 2 liters/10 feet * 80 feet = 16 liters of water.

"Okay, so Sasha bought some lumber and now it's more expensive.  She has ten 2x4x10 boards that cost her $10 each, and five 4x4x10 boards that cost her $16 each.  

First, let's figure out how much she spent in total:

* 2x4s: 10 boards * $10/board = $100
* 4x4s: 5 boards * $16/board = $80
* Total cost: $100 + $80 = $180

Now, the prices went up by 50%, so we need to figure out the new prices:

* 2x4s: $10 * 1.50 = $15/board
* 4x4s: $16 * 1.50 = $24/board

Time to see how much she can make selling them:

* 2x4s: 10 boards * $15/board = $150
* 4x4s: 5 boards * $24/board = $120
* Total revenue: $150 + $120 = $270

Finally, subtract her original cost to find her profit:

* $270 - $180 = $90

"Okay, so Katy uses sugar and water in a ratio of 7:13.  This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.  

We know she used a total of 120 teaspoons and cups combined.  To figure out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to figure out what one ""part"" of the ratio is worth.

Think of it like this: the ratio is split into 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Since she used 120 teaspoons and cups total, each part is worth 120 / 20 = 6.

Finally, multiply the value of one part (6) by the sugar part of the ratio (7): 6 * 7 = 42 teaspoons of sugar. 




"
"Okay, so John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 kids.  That means he buys 2 * 3 = 6 pairs of shoes in total.  Since each pair costs $60, he spends 6 * $60 = $360.

"Okay, so Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000 and it went up by 40%. That means his salary now is $40,000 + (40/100 * $40,000) = $56,000.

We know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary before.  Let's say Lylah's salary was 'x'. That means Adrien's salary was 1.30x.  

We don't know how much Lylah's salary increased, so we can't figure out her salary now.  

Without knowing Lylah's current salary, we can't find the total salary of both of them. 



"
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets of paper each week.

"Okay, so Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, which is a total of 13 fruits. Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, so he brought 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges Morisette did, so he brought 4 oranges. That means Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.  Together, they have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

* Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.
* Tuesday and Wednesday she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so 8 - 2 = 6 hours each night.
* That's a total of 6 * 2 = 12 hours for Tuesday and Wednesday.
* For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, so 6 + 1 = 7 hours each night.
*  Over those five days, that's 7 * 5 = 35 hours.

**Answer:** Sadie slept a total of 55 hours that week. 
"
"Okay, so Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for the first three hours, which means she covers 10 * 3 = 30 miles.  Then she slows down to 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours, covering 5 * 4 = 20 miles.  

In total, she runs 30 + 20 = 50 miles.

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out. 

* A watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper, and a pepper costs $15, so a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.
* An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so it costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now let's calculate the cost of each item Dillon buys:

* Watermelons: 4 watermelons * $45/watermelon = $180
* Peppers: 20 peppers * $15/pepper = $300
* Oranges: 10 oranges * $40/orange = $400

Finally, add up the cost of everything: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880



**Answer:** Dillon will spend $880 in total. 
"
"Okay, so the hospital sees 500 people a day, and each person is there for 24 minutes.  That means they spend a total of 12,000 minutes with patients (500 x 24 = 12,000).

If there are 60 minutes in an hour, that's 200 hours total (12,000 / 60 = 200).

The doctors make $150 an hour, so they earn $30,000 for their time (200 x 150 = 30,000).

The hospital charges patients $200 an hour, so they make $40,000 from the visits (200 x 200 = 40,000).

To find the profit, we subtract the doctors' earnings from the patient charges: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

"
"Okay, so Pam and Fred went to the carnival.  Pam rode the roller coaster twice and Fred rode it four times.  Then they both rode the luge twice.  Each ride costs 6 tickets. Let's figure out how many tickets they used in total.

* **Roller coaster:** Pam used 2 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets.
Fred used 4 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 24 tickets.
* **Luge:** Pam used 2 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets.
Fred used 2 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets.
* **Total:** Pam used 12 + 12 = 24 tickets.
Fred used 24 + 12 = 36 tickets.
Together they used 24 + 36 = 60 tickets.

"Okay, here's how to solve this:

* **Tuesday's walk:** Walt walked 4 miles * 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday.
* **Total for Monday and Tuesday:**  He walked 4 miles + 24 miles = 28 miles over those two days.
* **Wednesday's walk:**  To reach 41 miles total, he must have walked 41 miles - 28 miles = 13 miles on Wednesday.

"Okay, so Brian had 20 video games but lost 5, leaving him with 15.  Bobby has 5 fewer than three times the number of games Brian has.  

Let's break that down:

* Three times Brian's games: 15 * 3 = 45
* Five fewer than that: 45 - 5 = 40


Bobby has 40 video games.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Rory spends $15 on the subs (2 * $7.50).
* The chips cost her $3 (2 * $1.50).
* The cookies are $2 (2 * $1.00).

That means her food costs $20 in total ($15 + $3 + $2).

Then there's a $4 delivery fee (20% of $20).

Adding the $5 tip, her final bill comes to $29 ($20 + $4 + $5). 


"
"Okay, so Mark did a test with 75 questions and another with 100 questions.  He does 5 questions every hour.

For the first test, he had 8 hours, so he did 8 * 5 = 40 questions. That means he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions unfinished.

For the second test, he had 6 hours, so he did 6 * 5 = 30 questions.  He left 100 - 30 = 70 questions unfinished.

In total, he left 35 + 70 = 105 questions incomplete. 



**Answer:** 105 
"
"Okay, so there are 12 blue gumballs.  We know there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs.  

Let's break it down:

* Four times the blue gumballs is 4 * 12 = 48
*  That means there are 48 + 22 = 70 pink gumballs. 


"
"Okay, so there are 20 cars total.  12 are automatic and 4 are manual, which means there are 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 semi-automatic cars.  

To find the percentage, we do (4 / 20) * 100% = 20% 


20% 
"
"Okay, so there are 700 bees total.  We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees.  

Let's think about it this way: if there were 'x' queen bees, there would be '2x' baby bees, and '2 * 2x' or '4x' worker bees.  

That means x + 2x + 4x = 700

Combining like terms, we get 7x = 700

Dividing both sides by 7, we find x = 100.

So there are 100 queen bees.

That means there are 2 * 100 = 200 baby bees.

And finally, there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees. 




"
"Okay, so Jordan plays video games for 2 hours each day.  If he worked those 2 hours every day instead, he'd work 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours a week.  Since he makes $10 an hour, he'd earn 14 hours * $10/hour = $140. 


"
"Okay, so John spent $2 on milk and $3 on eggs.  That's $5 so far.  Then he got light bulbs, cups, and roach traps for $3 + $3 + $4 = $10.  There's a 10% tax on those, so that's $1 extra.  

Adding it all up, he spent $5 + $10 + $1 = $16. 


"
"Okay, so Kim has 8 clients in total.  Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach at $2 a bottle, so that's $4 for bleach per client. Plus, each client needs a pack of cloths for $5. That means each client costs him $9 to clean for.

Since he has 8 clients, his total expenses are $9 x 8 = $72.

He makes $92 each week, so his profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

"
"Here's how to figure that out:

* John has 10 hectares of pineapples, and each hectare has 100 pineapples, so he has a total of 10 * 100 = 1000 pineapples.
* Since he harvests every 3 months, and there are 4 quarters in a year, he harvests 4 times a year.
*  That means he harvests 1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples in a year.

"
"Okay, so Johnny has three boxes of Legos.  

* The first box has 500 pieces.
* The second box has three times as many pieces as the first, so it has 500 * 3 = 1500 pieces.
* The third box has one-fourth the number of pieces as the first box, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

To find the total number of Legos, we add up the pieces from all three boxes: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 pieces.

*  Debra saw 30 bees leave in the first 6 hours.
*  Then, half that number (15 bees) came back in the next 6 hours.
*  In the following 6 hours, twice the number that left initially (30 bees * 2 = 60 bees) flew out.
*  This means a total of 90 bees left the hive before the last 6 hours.
*  Since all the bees that left before the last 6 hours hadn't returned yet, all 90 of them came back in the final 6 hours.

"Okay, so Steve and Tim are racing home from school. Steve lives 3 miles away and bikes at 440 feet per minute, while Tim lives 2 miles away and skateboards at 264 feet per minute.  

First, let's figure out how many feet each of them needs to travel:

* Steve: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
* Tim: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now we can calculate their travel times:

* Steve: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
* Tim: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve gets home faster, he'll be waiting for Tim.  The difference in their times is 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

"Okay, so Shawnda charges 25 cents per tire to inflate them.  

* She inflated 10 tires for the 5 people with bikes (2 tires each).
* She inflated 9 tires for the 3 people with tricycles (3 tires each).
* And she inflated 1 tire for the person on a unicycle.

That means she inflated a total of 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents, she made 20 * $0.25 = $5.00 that day. 


"
"Okay, so Carl buys 10 packs of cookies with 6 cookies in each pack. That means he has 10 * 6 = 60 cookies.  

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost is 60 * $0.10 = $6.00.

If he pays with a $10 bill, his change would be $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00.

"Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Start with Dave:** Dave ate 14 fries.
* **Seagull's snack:** The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so it had 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
* **Fries remaining:** After the seagull, there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.
* **Pigeon party:**  Each pigeon ate 3 fries, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
* **Fries after pigeons:**  This is where it gets tricky!  Since the pigeons ate 9 fries and there were only 7 left, this means there weren't enough fries for all the pigeons.  

This problem doesn't make logical sense because the pigeons ate more fries than were available.

"Okay, so Kimo has 3 one-hour classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, which is 3 hours a day * 3 days = 9 hours.  

Then he has 2 two-hour classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which is 4 hours a day * 2 days = 8 hours.

That means he spends a total of 9 + 8 = 17 hours in class each week.

Over a 16-week semester, he'll spend 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours in class. 



"
"Okay, so Bill bakes a ton of stuff!  Let's figure out how long everything is.

* **Rolls:** 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.  That's 1200 inches / 12 inches/foot = 100 feet.
* **Croissants:** 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.  That's 720 inches / 12 inches/foot = 60 feet.
* **Baguettes:** 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet.

Now, add it all up: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Blake runs back and forth across the 100-yard football field 15 times, so he runs a total of 15 * 200 yards = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once the full length of the field, which is 100 yards * 2 = 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, for a total of 34 * 80 yards = 2720 yards.

To find the difference, we subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's: 3000 yards - 2720 yards = 280 yards.


**Answer:** Blake runs 280 yards farther than Kelly. 
"
"Okay, so Raphael bought 4 pens at $1.50 each, which is 4 * $1.50 = $6.  

He also got 2 notebooks at $4 each, so that's 2 * $4 = $8.

"Okay, so on Monday the tank had 17 feet of water.  On Tuesday, it had 7 feet more, meaning it had 17 + 7 = 24 feet of water.  

Then on Wednesday, the depth was two-thirds of Tuesday's amount, so we do (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet. 


The tank's water depth on Wednesday was 16 feet. 
"
"Okay, so Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. That's a total of 19 fish for him.  Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin (10 - 5 = 5), 3 fewer seahorses (6 - 3 = 3), and 2 more clownfish (3 + 2 = 5).  So Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.  

Together, they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish. 



"
"Okay, so the price goes up by 20% every two months.  That means after two months it'll be $20 + ($20 * 0.20) = $24.

Then after another two months, it'll be $24 + ($24 * 0.20) = $28.80.  

We gotta keep doing this for 18 sets of two months (36 months total).  It's a lot of calculations, but you can use a calculator to speed it up.

If Jackie hires the accountant, she'll save $105 - $90 = $15. 



"
"Elvira spent €1090 on the computer, €157 on a scanner, €74 on a CD burner, and €102 on a printer.  That's a total of €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423.

If her family gave her €1500, she'll have €1500 - €1423 = €77 left for clothes. 


"
"Okay, so Sandra needs 45 eggs in total because she's making 15 flans and each flan needs 3 eggs.  

Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, she'll need to babysit 45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting = 5 times. 


"
"Okay, so here's how to solve this problem:

Let's say Brooke is 'b' years old, and Seth is 's' years old.  We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so s = 2b.

In two years, Brooke will be b+2 years old and Seth will be s+2 years old.  We also know that in two years, their ages will add up to 28: (b+2) + (s+2) = 28

Now we can substitute '2b' for 's' in the second equation:

(b+2) + (2b+2) = 28

Simplifying:

3b + 4 = 28

3b = 24

b = 8

So Brooke is 8 years old.  Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is 16 years old. 



**Answer:** Seth is 16 years old. 
"
"Okay, so Ethel has $8.  Jimmy has $2 more than twice that amount.  Twice Ethel's money is $8 * 2 = $16.  Adding $2 more, we get $16 + $2 = $18. 


Jimmy has $18. 
"
"Okay, so Pancho walks 20 miles every day during the week, which is 5 days. That's 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles.  

On the weekends, he only walks 10 miles each day for 2 days, so that's 10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles.

Adding those together, he walks a total of 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles in a week. 


"
"Okay, so each uniform has a hat that costs $25. The jacket is three times more expensive than the hat, which means it costs $75.  The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket prices, so they cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.  

Adding all the costs together, a uniform costs $25 + $75 + $50 = $150. 


"
"Okay, so there are 80 spiders with 8 legs each, which is 80 * 8 = 640 legs.  Then there are 90 insects with 6 legs each, so that's 90 * 6 = 540 legs.  Finally, the 3 mutant invertebrates have 10 legs each, for a total of 3 * 10 = 30 legs.  

Adding all those up, we get 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs. 


"
"Okay, let's break this bird-age problem down:

* We know Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and she's the same age as Sally Four.
* Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so she's 8 * 2 = 16 years old.
* Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, making her 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Finally, to find the total age of all four birds, add their ages: 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51

"Okay, so Jessica has to pay $300 for her student loans, $200 for her credit card, and $500 for her mortgage. That's a total of $1000 each month.

She wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, so she needs to figure out 50% of $1000, which is $500.

Then she adds that extra $500 to her minimum payments, so she pays $1500 each month.

Over a whole year, that's $1500 times 12 months, which equals $18,000.

"Okay, so Billy needs to prep 60 potatoes.  He spends 1.5 minutes peeling each one and 5 seconds cutting it up.  

Let's figure out the cutting time in minutes: 5 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 0.083 minutes.

That means each potato takes 1.5 minutes + 0.083 minutes = 1.583 minutes to prep.

Finally, to find the total time, we multiply that by the number of potatoes: 1.583 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 95 minutes.

"Okay, so Juan and Carlos make lemonade and sell it for $0.50 a glass. They get 20 glasses out of each gallon.  It costs them $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar for each gallon.  If they made $25 in profit, how much did they spend on lemons?

Let's figure this out:

* Each gallon costs $3 for lemons + $2 for sugar = $5 total.
* They make $0.50 per glass * 20 glasses = $10 per gallon.
* That means they make a profit of $10 - $5 = $5 per gallon.
* Since they made $25 in profit, they must have made $25 / $5 = 5 gallons of lemonade.
*  So, they spent $3 per gallon * 5 gallons = $15 on lemons.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Rent:** Zaid spends 1/4 of his $6000 salary on rent, which is $6000 / 4 = $1500.
* **Fuel:** He spends 1/3 of his salary on fuel, so that's $6000 / 3 = $2000.
* **Total spent:**  He spends a total of $1500 + $2000 = $3500 on rent and fuel.
* **Money left:**  That leaves him with $6000 - $3500 = $2500.
* **Donation:** He donates half of the remaining money, which is $2500 / 2 = $1250.
* **Money after donation:**  He has $2500 - $1250 = $1250 left.
* **Expenses:** He spends $200 on his daughter and $700 on his wife, for a total of $200 + $700 = $900.
* **Final amount:**  Finally, he has $1250 - $900 = $350 left.

"Okay, so Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer than Bo, meaning she has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.  Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so she has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.  

To find the total number of crabs, we add them all up: 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs.

"Okay, let's break this down:

* We know Jan is 30 years old.
* Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.  So, half of Jan's age two years ago was 30 / 2 = 15.  That means Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old two years ago.
*  Since Mark was 20 two years ago, he's currently 20 + 2 = 22 years old.
* Jean is two years older than Mark, so she's 22 + 2 = 24 years old.

"Okay, so the well-rounded team has each runner finish their 400 meters in 55 seconds. That means their total time is 4 runners * 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

The other team's times are a little trickier.  The first runner takes 60 seconds, and each runner after that is 3 seconds faster. So the second runner does it in 57 seconds, the third in 54 seconds, and the fourth in 51 seconds.  Adding those up, their total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team is 2 seconds faster! 




"
"Okay, so Jerry's rolling a six-sided die.  We need to figure out how much more likely it is for him to roll a number bigger than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row.

There are three numbers bigger than 3 on a die (4, 5, and 6), and there are six total sides. So, the chance of rolling a number bigger than 3 is 3 out of 6, which is 1/2 or 50%.

Now, for rolling two even numbers in a row, let's think about it step-by-step.  There are three even numbers on the die (2, 4, and 6).  So, the chance of rolling one even number is 3 out of 6, or 1/2.  

But, after rolling one even number, we need to roll another even number.  The die doesn't remember the last roll, so the chance of rolling another even number is still 1/2.

To get the chance of both happening, we multiply the chances together: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4, or 25%.

Finally, to find the difference, we subtract the smaller chance from the bigger chance: 50% - 25% = 25%.




**Answer:** 25%

"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

* First, we know the hamsters used 10 hamsters * 5 pieces/hamster = 50 pieces of straw.
* Then, the rabbits used 20 pieces of straw.
* That means the rats used 160 total pieces - 50 pieces - 20 pieces = 90 pieces of straw.
* Since each rat gets 6 pieces, there are 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.
* Finally, with the rats split into 3 cages, there are 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

"Okay, so Mandy owes Benedict $100 and there's a 2% interest each month.  

After one month, the interest is $100 * 0.02 = $2.  So she now owes $102.

The next month, the interest is on $102, so it's $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.  Now she owes $104.04.

The third month, the interest is on $104.04, so it's $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.08.  

Finally, she owes $104.04 + $2.08 = $106.12

To find out how many pounds they need per day, we divide the weekly amount by 7 days: 35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds per day. 


"
"Okay, so Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 more each year for 10 years. That's 100 trees planted total.  He also chops down 2 trees each year, so he chops down 20 trees over 10 years.  

That means he has 100 + 50 - 20 = 130 trees.

Then, 30% of those trees die, which is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

So, he has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left. 




"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* **Start:** Sue has 18 pink flamingos.
* **Saturday:** They take away 1/3 of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6.  That leaves 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos. They then paint 6 white and put them back out.
* **Sunday:** They add another 18 pink flamingos, so now there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

* **Sunday at Noon:** There are still 6 white flamingos.  

Therefore, there are 30 - 6 = 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos.

"Violetta needs 5 crayons that cost $2 each, so the total cost is $10.  Since she paid with $20, she'll get $10 in change. 


"
"Okay, so a pen costs the same as a pencil and eraser together.  A pencil is $1.20 and an eraser is $0.30, so a pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

To find the cost of 8 pens, you just multiply: $1.50 x 8 = $12.00 


"
"Okay, so they have 200 pounds of carrots and want to give 2 pounds to each of 40 restaurants.  

First, let's see how many pounds they'll use in total: 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds.

That means they'll have 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds of carrots left over.

"Okay, let's break this down:

* **Month 1:** Elaine triples her initial amount, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 cards.
* **Month 2:** She collects 20 fewer than month 1, meaning she gets 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
* **Months 1 & 2 Total:**  She has 60 + 40 = 100 cards.
* **Month 3:** She collects twice the amount from the first two months, so she gets 100 * 2 = 200 cards.
* **Grand Total:** Adding up all the cards, she has 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

"
"Okay, so Mark edits 1000 sentences total, split evenly between two publishers.  Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, who pays 5 cents per sentence.

First, let's figure out how much Mark makes from Publisher A: 500 sentences * $0.05/sentence = $25.00

Then, Publisher B pays $0.10 per sentence, so he makes 500 sentences * $0.10/sentence = $50.00 from them.

Finally, add up his earnings from both publishers: $25.00 + $50.00 = $75.00

Since the question asks for his earnings in cents, we multiply that by 100: $75.00 * 100 cents/$1 = 7500 cents.




**Answer: 7500**
"
"Baldur collects 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon.  Since each pail holds 5 liters, he gets 5 * 5 = 25 liters in the morning and 6 * 5 = 30 liters in the afternoon.  In total, he gets 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water each day.

"Okay, so John gets a one-time bonus of $5000 and a 5% raise on his $2000 weekly salary.  

First, let's figure out his raise: 5% of $2000 is $100.

That means he's making $2100 per week now.

Over a year, that's $2100 times 52 weeks, which is $109,200.

And don't forget his bonus!  So his total earnings for the year are $109,200 plus $5000, which is $114,200.

"Okay, let's break this down:

* **Sandwiches:** Carl eats 7 sandwiches at 2 slices of cheese each, so that's 7 * 2 = 14 slices.
* **Omelets:** He uses 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than a sandwich, so that's 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.  With 3 omelets, he uses 3 * 3 = 9 slices.
* **Mac and Cheese:** He uses 8 slices for that.

Adding it all up: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Phase 1:** Michael biked 25 kilometers each time for 5 rides a week, so he covered 25 * 5 = 125 kilometers per week. Over four weeks, that's 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

* **Phase 2:**  He then biked 60 kilometers each time for 2 rides a week, meaning he covered 60 * 2 = 120 kilometers per week.  Over three weeks, that's 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

* **Total:** Adding both phases, he biked a total of 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

First, Sara needs $30 for the jacket and $40 for the two pairs of shoes, so that's a total of $70.  She already has $10 saved, so she needs to make another $60.

She makes $5 each time she babysits and has already made $20 from babysitting. That means she still needs to make $40 more.

Since she makes $4 each time she mows the lawn, she needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times.

"Okay, so Jerry has red chickens that lay 3 eggs a day and white chickens that lay 5 eggs a day.  He gets 42 eggs total each day.  We also know he has two more white chickens than red chickens.  

Let's use algebra to figure this out!

* Let 'r' be the number of red chickens.
* Let 'w' be the number of white chickens.

We can set up two equations:

1.  3r + 5w = 42  (The total number of eggs)
2.  w = r + 2   (The relationship between red and white chickens)

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplify and solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4


Jerry has **4** red chickens.

"Here's how to figure that out:

First, we need to find the total distance Gary walks.  Since the park is a rectangle, we can find the perimeter:

* Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
* Perimeter = 2 * (6 miles + 1.5 miles)
* Perimeter = 2 * 7.5 miles
* Perimeter = 15 miles

Now we know he walks 15 miles.  To find out how long it takes, we use:

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
* Time = 5 hours

"
"Okay, so Sloane saw 100 customers on the first day.  The next day she saw 50 more than that, so 100 + 50 = 150 customers.  

Over the first two days, she saw 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

To find out how many she saw on the third day, we subtract the first two days from the total: 500 - 250 = 250 customers. 


"
"Okay, so here's how to solve this problem:

Let's say the small pool had *x* gallons of water 4 minutes ago.  That means the big pool had 2*x* gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons per minute, the small pool now has *x* - 16 gallons, and the big pool has 2*x* - 16 gallons.

We know the big pool now has four times the amount of water as the small pool, so:

2*x* - 16 = 4(*x* - 16)

Let's solve for *x*:

2*x* - 16 = 4*x* - 64
48 = 2*x*
*x* = 24

So the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago.  Now it has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

"Okay, so Janeth owes $2000 and has to pay back 10% extra, which is $200. That means she needs to pay back a total of $2200.

If she pays $165 each month for 12 months, she'll pay back $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find out how much she still owes, we subtract that from the total amount: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"
"Okay, so Harriet is 21 now, and she's half Zack's age. That means Zack is 21 times 2, which is 42.  Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so he's 21 times 3, which is 63.

In three years, they'll be:

* Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
* Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
* Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

Adding those up, their total age in three years will be 24 + 45 + 66 = 135.  

To find the average, we divide the total age by 3: 135 / 3 = 45.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Naomi's score:** 68 points
* **Yuri's score:**  Half of Naomi's score is 68 / 2 = 34 points. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so he scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
* **Brianna's score:** Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

* **Total for Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:** 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points

* **Jojo's score:**  Since the total score was 251, Jojo must have scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.



**Answer:** Jojo scored 54 points. 
"
"Okay, so Carmen spends 10 minutes on each crossword and 5 minutes on each sudoku.  

She did 3 crosswords, so that's 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.

In total, she spent 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing games. 


"
"Okay, so the tank started with 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters, which leaves 120 - 90 = 30 liters.  She then collected twice the amount that was left, so she collected 30 * 2 = 60 liters of rainwater.  Adding that to the water already in the tank, we have 30 + 60 = 90 liters. 


"
"Okay, so Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than that.  To find out how many petunias he plants, we subtract 40 from 90: 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

20000 
"
"Okay, so Carlos spends $30 an hour for 3 hours on the canoe, which is $30 * 3 = $90.  Benji spends $18 an hour for 5 hours on the raft, so that's $18 * 5 = $90.  Together, they spend $90 + $90 = $180. 


"
"Okay, so Andrew takes 6 days to get to Rochester by bus.  The car trip is half as long, which is 6 days / 2 = 3 days.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* The burrito starts at $6.50.
* He adds $2.00 for extra meat, $1.00 for extra cheese, and $1.00 for avocado.
* Two sauces cost him $0.25 each, so that's $0.50.
* The upgrade with chips and a drink is $3.00 extra.

Adding all that up: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

But wait, he has a $5.00 gift card!  So he owes $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00 




"
"Okay, so Kalinda does 4 puzzle pieces per minute and her mom does half that, which is 2 pieces per minute.  Together they do 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

That's equal to 1 hour. 


"
"Okay, so the farm had 120 baby watermelons.  Ashlyn picked 30% of them the first time, which is 36 watermelons. That leaves 84 watermelons.

Then, two weeks later, she picked 3/4 of the remaining watermelons, which is 63 watermelons.

So, there are 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons that weren't ready to be harvested. 



"
"Okay, so Mark buys 12 cars at $20,000 each, which is 12 times 20,000, or $240,000.  Then he has to pay 10% tax on that, so he pays $24,000 in taxes.  Plus, he pays $1,000 to register each car, and he has 12 cars, so that's another $12,000.  

Adding it all up, he spends $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* Robert found 20 shells on Monday.
* Kylie found 5 more than Robert, so she found 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

So the answer is 50. 
"
"Okay, so there are 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs.  That means there are 50 / 2 = 25 bugs.

"
"Okay, so Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes a day and that's twice as many as his girlfriend, who eats 3 a day.  Together they eat 9 tomatoes a day.  

Since there are 7 days in a week, they eat 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes a week.

If each vine produces 3 tomatoes a week, they'll need 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines. 


"
"Okay, so John needs to feed 20 friends, and each friend wants 4 slices. That means he needs a total of 20 * 4 = 80 slices of pizza.

"Dolly has two books and Pandora has one.  If they each read all the books, Dolly would read 2 books (her own and Pandora's) and Pandora would read 2 books (her own and Dolly's).  Together they would read a total of 4 books. 


"
"Okay, so Mike had 5 pen pals but lost touch with 2, leaving him with 3.  Each of those 3 pals sends him 2 letters a week, which means he gets 3 * 2 = 6 letters.  Since each letter is 5 pages long, he gets 6 * 5 = 30 pages to read and answer.  

He writes one page every 6 minutes, so it takes him 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes to write back.  

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours. 




"
"Okay, so Jason uses 15 minutes a day for his boss's calls, and that's for 30 days this month, so that's 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.  

Then he used an extra 300 minutes for other calls.  

That means he used a total of 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Since his plan is for 1000 minutes, he has 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes left. 


250

"Okay, let's break this problem down:

* Griffin started with 24 fries and ended up with 27, meaning someone gave him fries.
* Kyle took 5 fries, and Billy took twice that amount (10 fries).
* Colby took 3 fewer fries than Kyle, so he took 2 fries.

In total, Griffin lost 5 + 10 + 2 = 17 fries.

Since he gained 3 fries to end up at 27, Ginger must have given him 3 fries. 


**Answer:** 3 
"
"Okay, so there are 4 snails in one tank and 32 in the other.  That means there are 32 - 4 = 28 more snails in the bigger tank.  

The problem says this difference in snails is twice the number of fish in *both* tanks.  Since the tanks have the same number of fish, let's say there are 'f' fish in each tank.  

That means 28 snails = 2 * f fish.  

To find out how many fish are in each tank, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2: 28 / 2 = f.

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and it takes 6 hours a day, so that's $250 * 6 = $1500 per day.
* She does makeup 4 days a week, so that's $1500 * 4 = $6000 per week.
* The movie is 5 weeks long, so the total cost before the discount is $6000 * 5 = $30000.
*  The makeup artist gives a 10% discount, which is $30000 * 0.10 = $3000.
*  So, Jean ends up paying $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

"Okay, so Isabelle spent $12 on cake, $43 on presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags.  That's a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96.

Since she split the cost with her two parents, they each paid $96 / 3 = $32. 


"
"Okay, so the chef bought 4 bags of onions and each bag weighs 50 pounds. That means they bought a total of 4 * 50 = 200 pounds of onions.

"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* **Monday:** Sue ate 4 times the cookies her sister did, who ate 5. So Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.
* **Tuesday:** Sue ate twice the cookies her sister ate, who ate 13. So Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.
* **Total Cookies:** Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies in total. Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.
* **Calories:** Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate 46 * 200 = 9200 calories and her sister ate 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.
* **Difference:** Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister.



**Answer:** Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister. 
"
"Okay, so there are 60 students total since there are 3 classes with 20 students each.  We know there are 27 girls in the first two classes.  That means there are 33 boys total.  Since the first two classes have 15 + 12 = 27 students, the third class has 60 - 27 = 33 students.  Therefore, there are 33 - 15 - 12 = 6 boys in the third class.

* Then he goes up 6 more floors, so 12 + 6 = 18


Bill is now on the 18th floor. 
"
"Okay, so Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, which means she went down 30% of 30, or 9, fewer times.  That means Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times.  Robert went down 4 times as many times as Anne, so he went down 4 * 21 = 84 times. 


"
"Okay, so there are 20 stalls with 20 cows each, meaning there are 200 cows total.  Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them evenly among all the stalls. That means each stall gets 2 more cows (40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 cows/stall).

If each stall has 22 cows now (20 original cows + 2 new cows), then 8 stalls would have 176 cows (8 stalls * 22 cows/stall = 176 cows). 



**176** 
"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* **Pennies:** 100 pennies equal $1.00
* **Nickels:** 40 nickels is 40 times $0.05, which equals $2.00
* **Dimes:** 20 dimes is 20 times $0.10, which equals $2.00
* **Dollar bills:** 40 dollar bills is 40 times $1.00, which equals $40.00

Adding all that up: $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00


45.00 
"
"Okay, so the redwood is 200 feet tall and each section is 10 feet long, meaning there are 20 sections.  Since each section weighs 400 pounds, the whole tree weighs 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

But wait, termites ate 30% of the wood! That's 8000 pounds * 0.30 = 2400 pounds.

So, the redwood now weighs 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds. 



**5600** 
"
"Okay, so she owes $0.50 for each of her 8 overdue books, which is $0.50 * 8 = $4.00.  Then she has to pay an extra $2.00 for the book that was over a week late.  So, in total, she has to pay $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00. 


"
"Okay, let's break this problem down:

* **Jamal's Apples:** Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

* **Jamal's Bananas:** Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

* **Andrea's Bananas:** Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, meaning she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

* **Andrea's Total Fruit:** Andrea has 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.

* **Jamal's Total Fruit:** Jamal has 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits.

* **Combined Fruit:** Together they have 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"
"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Flour per dozen:**  You need 2 cups of flour for every 12 cookies (a dozen).
* **Total dozens:** Carla is making 36 cookies today + 30 cookies tomorrow = 66 cookies total. That's 66 / 12 = 5.5 dozens of cookies.
* **Total flour:** Since each dozen needs 2 cups of flour, she'll need 5.5 dozens * 2 cups/dozen = 11 cups of flour. 


"
"Okay, so there are 9300 pennies in a cup.  We need to figure out how much money two-thirds of those pennies are worth.

First, find out how many pennies are in two-thirds of the cup: 9300 pennies * (2/3) = 6200 pennies

Then, divide that number by 100 to convert pennies to dollars: 6200 pennies / 100 pennies/dollar = $62.00 



**Answer: $62.00** 
"
"Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles each, so she has 5 * 50 = 250 marbles.  Then she gets 20 more, bringing her total to 250 + 20 = 270 marbles. 


270 
"
"Okay, let's break this problem down:

* Chris has 6 trees.
* Ferdinand has half the number of trees Chris has, so he has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
* Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees Ferdinand has. Twice Ferdinand's trees is 3 * 2 = 6 trees.
*  So Harry has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

* Finally, Harry has 11 - 3 = 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 



**Answer: 8** 
"
"Okay, so Carmen has $100. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, which means she has $125. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so she has $175.  

To find out how much they have altogether, we add it up: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400. 


"
"Okay, so the house costs $350,000.  She has to pay 5% for the broker, which is $350,000 times 0.05, which is $17,500. Then there's a 12% transfer fee, so that's $350,000 times 0.12, which is $42,000.  

That means the total extra cost is $17,500 plus $42,000, which is $59,500.  

Adding that to the house price, the total cost is $350,000 plus $59,500, which is $409,500.

Finally,  $409,500 minus her $400,000 budget means she's over by $9,500. 



"
"Okay, so Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000.  He had to pay some fees, though.  There was a 3% transfer fee on the selling price, which is $400,000 * 0.03 = $12,000.  Then there was a 5% brokerage fee, which is $400,000 * 0.05 = $20,000.  

On top of that, he still had to pay $250,000 for the rest of his house loan.  

So, to find out how much money he actually got from selling the house, we need to subtract all those costs: $400,000 - $12,000 - $20,000 - $250,000 = $118,000. 



**Answer:** $118,000 
"
"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

*  It takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees.
*  Heating it to 400 degrees takes 40% longer than that, so it takes an extra 20 * 0.40 = 8 minutes.
*  That means the oil takes a total of 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up.
*  Cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.
*  Adding the heating and cooking times, it takes 28 + 23 = 51 minutes from start to finish. 



**Answer: 51**"
"Okay, so the real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad and he bought 50 of them. That's 50 * $5 = $250.  

He also spent $75 on each TV ad and bought 15 of them, so that's 15 * $75 = $1125.

To find the total cost, we add those two amounts together: $250 + $1125 = $1375. 


"
"Okay, so there are 16 balls total and half of them are golf balls, which means there are 8 golf balls.  Then, half of those golf balls are blue, so there are 4 blue golf balls.

"
"Okay, so Mary has three bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 300, the second has 12 more than the first, and the third has half the amount of the first bag.  

Let's break it down:

* The second bag has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
* The third bag has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Finally, to find the total, we add them all up: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms. 


"
"Okay, so there are 2 houses, and each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each. That's 3 * 2 = 6 windows per house from the bedrooms.

Then, there are 4 extra windows in each house, so that's 6 + 4 = 10 windows per house.

Finally, we have to add the windows from both houses: 10 * 2 = 20 windows total. 


20 
"
"Okay, so the mom spent $4.20 on cocoa, $9.45 on laundry, and $1.35 on pasta.  That means she spent a total of $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00.

If she paid with $20.00, the cashier would give her $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00 in change. 


"
"Okay, so Terri's sweater has 900 stitches for the body, and the collar is a tenth of that, which is 90 stitches. The rosette has twice as many stitches as the collar, so that's 180 stitches.  

Adding those up, the body, collar, and rosette use 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

That means the two sleeves together use 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve has 630 / 2 = 315 stitches. 



**Answer: 315** 
"
"Okay, so Mrs. Rylan spent $40 per packet on 20 tomato seeds, which is 20 * $40 = $800.  Then she spent $30 per packet on 80 celery seeds, so that's 80 * $30 = $2400.  

To find the total cost, we add those together: $800 + $2400 = $3200. 


3200 
"
"Okay, let's break this down. 

* **Scene 1:** The first scene has twice the lines of the song, which has 54 lines. So Scene 1 has 54 * 2 = 108 lines.  But Sean only has a third of those lines, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines to memorize from Scene 1.

* **Scene 2:** The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, meaning it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.  Four-fifths of those lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from Scene 2.

* **Total:** To find the total, add up the lines from each scene and the song: 36 + 48 + 54 = 138 lines.



**Answer:** Sean has to memorize 138 lines. 
"
"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

*  That leaves 80 - 32 = 48 cards.
*  Next, see how many have a 'B': (1/2) * 48 cards = 24 cards
*  Now we have 48 - 24 = 24 cards left.
*  Then, figure out how many have a 'C': (5/8) * 24 cards = 15 cards
*  Finally, subtract to find the number with a 'D': 24 - 15 = 9 cards

"Okay, so Matthew digs small holes in 3 minutes each and large holes in 10 minutes each.  

* For the small holes, that's 30 holes * 3 minutes/hole = 90 minutes.
* For the large holes, that's 15 holes * 10 minutes/hole = 150 minutes.

In total, he'll spend 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes digging.

To convert that to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour: 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

"Okay, so here's how to solve this problem:

Let's say Sam is 'S' years old right now.  Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby is 6S years old.

In nine years, Sam will be S + 9 years old. Ruby will be 6S + 9 years old.  We know that in nine years, Ruby will be three times as old as Sam, so we can set up an equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now we can solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27
3S = 18
S = 6


Sam is currently 6 years old. 
"
"Okay, so Peter spent $0.25 on each popsicle and bought 20 of them. That's 20 * $0.25 = $5.00.  

Then he bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so that cost him 4 * $0.50 = $2.00.

Adding those together, he spent a total of $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00. 


"
"Okay, so we know a cobra has 70 spots and that's twice the number of spots a mamba has.  That means a mamba has 70 spots / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we have 40 cobras with 70 spots each, so they have a total of 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

The 60 mambas have a total of 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Adding those together, all the snakes have 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Half of that is 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots. 




"
"Okay, so Maddy needs to feed 12 soccer players, 3 coaches, and each player brings 2 guests.  That means there are 12 * 2 = 24 guests.  

In total, there are 12 + 3 + 24 = 39 people.

Since each pizza feeds 3 people, she'll need 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

If each pizza costs $15, the total cost will be 13 * $15 = $195. 


"
"Okay, so Katerina makes necklaces with 8 topaz stones, and each stone is 1 inch long. That means the topaz stones take up 8 inches of the necklace.  

The necklaces are 25 inches long total, so there are 25 - 8 = 17 inches left for the silver beads.

Each silver bead is 0.25 inches long, so she uses 17 / 0.25 = 68 silver beads per necklace.

"Okay, so Alani, Braylen, and Margot wrote a bunch of stories!  

* **Week 1:** Alani wrote 20, Braylen wrote 40, and Margot wrote 60. That's a total of 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories.

* **Week 2:** They all doubled their stories from the first week:
    * Alani: 20 * 2 = 40 stories
    * Braylen: 40 * 2 = 80 stories
    * Margot: 60 * 2 = 120 stories

"Okay, so there are 76 stars total.  We know there are three rows of 8 stars, which is 24 stars. Then there are two rows of 6 stars, which is another 12 stars. That means there are 24 + 12 = 36 stars accounted for.

To find out how many stars are left, we subtract: 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

Since each of the remaining rows has 5 stars, there must be 40 / 5 = 8 rows of 5 stars. 


**8** 
"
"Okay, so each flagstone weighs 75 pounds and they need to move 80 flagstones.  That means the total weight is 75 * 80 = 6000 pounds.

"
"Okay, so the fast car is going 60 miles per hour and the slow car is going half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.  If the fast car travels 480 miles, we can figure out how long it took the slow car to travel the same distance.

To do that, we use the formula: time = distance / speed.

The slow car's time would be 480 miles / 30 miles per hour = 16 hours. 


"
"Okay, so Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 fewer than Ali, meaning Izzy has 17 medals.  Together they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.  

The problem says they have 10 times *fewer* medals than the total given out for counting.  So, to find the total number of medals, we do 39 * 10 = 390. 


"
"Okay, so there are 8 packets of chocolate bars with 5 bars in each packet, making a total of 40 chocolate bars.  

Since each adult gets 6 bars, that's 4 adults * 6 bars/adult = 24 bars.

With 8 children, each child gets 16 bars / 8 children = 2 bars each. 


"
"Okay, so Susan makes $5 every 10 minutes.  She works for 3 hours, which is 180 minutes.  But she takes a 30 minute break, so she actually works for 150 minutes.  

That means she works for 15 sets of 10 minutes (150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15).

Since she makes $5 for each 10 minutes, she earns $75 total (15 sets * $5/set = $75).

"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

* **Jim's points:** Mike has 21 points, and Jim has 3 less, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
* **Tony's points:** Tony has twice as many points as Mike, so he has 21 * 2 = 42 points.
* **Round 4:** Mike gets an extra point because he has over 20, so he's at 21 + 1 = 22 points. Jim stays at 18, and Tony gets an extra point too, bringing him to 42 + 1 = 43 points.

* **Total:**  Adding up everyone's points, we get 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

"
"Okay, so Darren did 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses on the first day. That's a total of 100 + 50 + 20 = 170 exercises.

On the second day, he did 20 more pushups (100 + 20 = 120), 10 fewer squats (50 - 10 = 40), and double the dumbbell presses (20 * 2 = 40).  That means he did 120 + 40 + 40 = 200 exercises on the second day.

Over the two days, he did a total of 170 + 200 = 370 exercises. 




"
"Okay, so each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 5 people eating. That means they use 0.2 * 5 = 1 kg of rice per meal.  Since they eat twice a day, they go through 1 * 2 = 2 kg of rice each day.  

Over a week, that's 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg of rice.  

If their bag has 42 kg, it will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

*  He drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so that's 60 miles a day.
*  He drives 5 days a week, so that's 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles a week.
*  Over a year, he drives 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles.
*  At $2 per mile, that's 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000 for driving.
*  Plus, he gives his driver a $150 bonus each month, so that's $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800 a year.
*  Adding that to the driving cost, he spends a total of $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800 a year.

*  In total, she's sold 90 + 45 = 135 books over the first two years.
*  Since there are 50 books left, she's sold 250 - 50 = 200 books total.
*  That means she sold 200 - 135 = 65 books in the third year.
*  Her earnings in the second year were 45 books * $20/book = $900.

"Okay, so Watson makes $10 an hour and works 10 hours a day, five days a week. That means he makes $100 a day.

Over a week, he makes $100 a day times 5 days, which is $500.  

Plus, he gets a $300 bonus every week if the company does well. So, he makes $500 + $300 = $800 each week.

April has four weeks, so he makes $800 a week times 4 weeks, which is $3200 for the whole month.

"
"Okay, so Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, which means he loses 2 pounds each week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).  Sandy wants to lose the same amount, so if she loses 2 pounds per week, it will take her 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds (8 pounds / 2 pounds/week = 4 weeks). 


"
"Okay, so the ice cream used to be $13 but now it's $11, meaning you save $2 per tub.  Since you're buying two tubs, that's a savings of $4.

"Okay, let's break this problem down:

* **Cera's age six years ago:** Cera is 46 now, so six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
* **Noah's age six years ago:** Noah was half Cera's age then, meaning he was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
* **Chile's population six years ago:** We know the population six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.
* **Chile's population now:** The population is double what it was six years ago, so now it's 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"Okay, so there are 105 players total.  Let's say there are *d* players on defense.  Since there are twice as many on offense, there are 2*d* players on offense.  And there are half as many on special teams as defense, so that's *d*/2 players.

Adding all the players together, we get: *d* + 2*d* + *d*/2 = 105

To solve for *d*, let's combine like terms: (5/2)*d* = 105

Then, multiply both sides by 2/5 to isolate *d*: *d* = 42



**Answer:** 42 
"
"Okay, so Martha invited 2 families of 6 and 3 families of 4. That's 12 + 12 = 24 people total.  Then 8 people got sick and 2 more had other plans.  So, 8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't make it.  That means 24 - 10 = 14 people showed up. 


"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* Solomon starts with 50 marbles and gets 20 more from Johanna, so he has 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.
* His father gives him 2/5 * 20 = 8 more marbles.
*  That means Solomon has a total of 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.
*  Since each marble weighs 2 kgs, the total weight is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs. 


**Answer: 156 kgs** 
"
"Okay, so the pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep.  To find out how much it costs to fill, we need to figure out how many cubic feet of water it holds.  

We do that by multiplying the length, width, and depth: 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet.

Since it costs $0.10 per cubic foot, filling the pool will cost 120 x $0.10 = $12.00 


"
"Okay, so there are 30 boys in the classroom.  Since there are three times as many girls as boys, there are 30 * 3 = 90 girls.  There are also 30 * (1/10) = 3 nongendered children.  Adding all the groups together, we have 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 children in the classroom. 


123 
"
"Okay, so we know that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.  We also know there are 45 wires needed.  

To figure out how many poles we need, we can divide the total number of wires by the number of wires per pole: 45 wires / 3 wires/pole = 15 poles. 


**Answer: 15** 
"
"Okay, so there were 25 men and 15 women at the party, making a total of 40 people.  If 1/4 of the people left, that's 10 people in total.  Since 22 men stayed, that means 18 men left (25 - 22 = 3).  

Since we know 10 people left and 18 men left, that means 8 women left (10 - 18 = -8).  

Wait a minute... that doesn't make sense!  It's impossible for more men to have left than the total number of people who left.  There must be an error in the problem. 





"
"Okay, so a book costs $4.  A magazine costs half as much as a book, which is $4 / 2 = $2.  A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so it costs $2 - $1 = $1. 



"
"Okay, so Jam has 26 pencils total, and 2 of them are loose. That means she has 24 pencils in boxes.  Since she has 3 boxes, each box must hold 8 pencils (24 / 3 = 8).

Together, Jam and Meg have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  If each box holds 8 pencils, they'll need 9 boxes to store them all (72 / 8 = 9). 


"
"Okay, so Shannon cools her coffee 65 degrees, which means she used 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes.  Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 ml weaker, so 5 ice cubes make it 5 * 12 = 60 ml weaker.  

Then she adds 15 ml of cream, which also weakens it.  

The total weakening is 60 ml + 15 ml = 75 ml. 


"
"Okay, so 7 new records were traded for.  Since you need 2 old records to get 1 new one, that means 7 new records came from 7 * 2 = 14 old records.

"
"Okay, so there are 100 people working at the company.  We know 2/5 of them are junior programmers, which is (2/5) * 100 = 40 people.  

Junior programmers make $2000 a month, so they get paid a total of 40 * $2000 = $80,000 per month.

Senior programmers make $400 more than juniors, so they make $2000 + $400 = $2400 a month. There are 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

That means they get paid a total of 60 * $2400 = $144,000 per month.

Together, all the programmers make $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000 per month. 



**Answer:** $224,000

"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

* We know 20 people were on the bus heading to the third stop.
* At the second stop, 7 people got off and 8 got on, so before that, there were 20 - 7 + 8 = 21 people.
* At the first stop, 5 more people got on, meaning there were 21 - 5 = 16 people at the terminal.

* He gives 14 to his friends, leaving him with 8.
* On his way home, he buys twice the amount he gave away, which is 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops.
* Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
* That night, he eats 3 more, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
* Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"Okay, so the customer got $1 off for every $20 they spend.  Since they spent $80 last time, they earned 4 rewards ($80 / $20 = 4).  

This time they spent $43 and used all their rewards, which is worth $4.  The coupon doubled that discount, so they saved another $8 ($4 x 2 = $8).

That means they saved a total of $12 ($4 + $8 = $12).  

So, they paid $31 ($43 - $12 = $31). 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

**Job A:**

* Nick makes $15 an hour and works 2000 hours, so he earns $15 * 2000 = $30,000 a year.
*  His state takes 20% in taxes, which is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000.
*  That means he takes home $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

**Job B:**

* Job B pays $42,000 a year, but then he has to pay $6,000 in property taxes.
*  That leaves him with $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
*  His state takes 10% of that, which is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600 in taxes.
*  So, he keeps $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

**The Difference:**

* Job B pays him more, by $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.




**Answer:** 8400 
"
"Okay, so there are 220 castles in Scotland, and 40% of them are ruins.  That means there are 220 * 0.40 = 88 ruined castles.

"
"Okay, so Furniture United wants $1350 upfront plus 6 payments of $350 a month. That's $2100 for the payments, so the total is $3450.

Cozy Homes wants $1100 upfront plus 9 payments of $250 a month. That's $2250 for the payments, so the total is $3350.

Furniture United is more expensive by $100.

"Okay, so Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each, which means she spends 8 * $8 = $64.

The first year, the price goes up 50%, so each share is worth $8 + ($8 * 0.50) = $12.

The next year, the price drops 25%, so each share is worth $12 - ($12 * 0.25) = $9.

Finally, the total value of all her shares is 8 * $9 = $72.

Answer: John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. 
"
"Okay, so we have 200 students split into three groups.  Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the smallest group has 10 fewer students than those.

Let's say  'x' represents the number of students in each of the bigger groups.  

The smallest group would have 'x - 10' students.

Adding up the number of students in all three groups, we get:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 70

So, each of the bigger groups has 70 students.  

The smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students. 



**Answer:** 60 
"
"Here's how to solve this problem:

Let 'c' represent the number of cows. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, he has 2c chickens.  

We know the total number of animals is 60: c + 2c = 60

Combining like terms, we get 3c = 60.  

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that c = 20 cows.  

This means he has 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs:

* Cows: 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs
* Chickens: 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs

Adding those together, the animals have a total of 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

"Okay, let's break this down:

* We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
* It weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad.
* The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the frog, so it weighs 60 pounds.
* The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the frog, so it weighs 30 pounds.

Now, to find the total weight of everything in the container, we add up the weight of each animal and the container itself:

50 (frog) + 50 (beetle) + 50 (toad) + 60 (snake) + 30 (bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds

*  Divide the difference by the original amount: $100 / $1000 = 0.10
*  Multiply by 100% to get the percentage: 0.10 * 100% = 10%


They're making 10% more per day now.

"Okay, let's break this down. 

* John swam for half the time he boated, so he swam for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.
* Watching shows took 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours.
*  In total, he spent 6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) = 9 hours on those activities.
* We know 6 hours of shows is 30% of his whole vacation.  To find 100%, we can set up a proportion: 6 hours / 0.30 = Total Time / 1.00.  Solving for Total Time, we get 20 hours.
* Finally, 40% of his 20 hour vacation was spent sightseeing, so he spent 20 hours * 0.40 = 8 hours sightseeing.

That means she made a total of $200 + $75 = $275 from her jobs.

Adding her savings, she has $80 + $275 = $355 in total.

Finally, she still needs $400 - $355 = $45.

"Okay, so Morgan has $90 for her birthday party.  Let's figure out how many friends she can invite.

* Mini-golf costs $5 per person, and she wants to play with her friends, so that's $5(x+1) where x is the number of friends.
* Go-karts cost $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so that's $10 * 2 = $20.
* Arcade tokens are $5 per person, so that's also $5(x+1).

Now, let's add up all the costs and set it equal to her budget:

$5(x+1) + $20 + $5(x+1) = $90

Simplifying the equation:

$10(x+1) + $20 = $90
$10x + $10 + $20 = $90
$10x + $30 = $90
$10x = $60
x = 6


Morgan can invite **6** friends.

*  A full round trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.
*  Since the train makes 3 trips a day, it travels 300 miles/trip * 3 trips = 900 miles each day.
*  To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service mileage by the daily mileage: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

*  On Wednesday, she picked double the amount from Tuesday, meaning she picked 12 * 2 = 24 apples.

*  To find the total, we add up the apples from each day: 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples.

"Okay, so Lindsay needs to wash 50 socks.  She washed 10 pairs, which is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.  Then she washed 15 more loose socks.  That means she washed a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks.  

To find out how many she missed, we subtract: 50 - 35 = 15.


Lindsay missed 15 socks. 
"
"Okay, so Rachel had 23 cookies and got 42 more, which means she had a total of 65 cookies.  Then her brother ate 44, so she has 65 - 44 = 21 cookies left.

"
"Okay, so Karan borrowed $3650 and has to pay it back over five months with a 10% interest rate.  

First, we need to figure out how much interest she'll pay.  That's (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100. So, it's ($3650 * 10 * 5) / 100 = $1825.

Next, we add the interest to the original amount she borrowed: $3650 + $1825 = $5475.

Finally, we divide the total amount she needs to repay by the number of months: $5475 / 5 = $1095.


**Answer:** Karan has to pay $1095 per month. 
"
"Okay, so Cho hiked for 8 hours at 14 kilometers per hour, which means she hiked a total of 112 kilometers (8 * 14 = 112).  Chloe hiked for 5 hours at 9 kilometers per hour, so she hiked 45 kilometers (5 * 9 = 45).  

To find out how much farther Cho hiked, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance: 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos, for a total of 50 + 80 = 130 pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos.  She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, meaning she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

That means Anna has 100 + 120 = 220 pesos.

Together, they have 130 + 220 = 350 pesos. 


"
"Okay, so Millie makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she has 3 * 12 = 36 cups total.  She sells each cup for $1, so she'll make 36 * $1 = $36.  Since she spent $18 on supplies, her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.  

She sells an average of 4 cups per hour, so her profit per hour is $18. 



"
"Okay, so Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land.  To find out how much he had to begin with, we can think of it this way:

* If 12.8 hectares is 2/5 of his original land (because he sold 3/5), then 1/5 of his land must be 12.8 / 2 = 6.4 hectares.

*  Since 1/5 is 6.4 hectares, the whole amount of land (5/5) must be 6.4 * 5 = 32 hectares.




**Answer: 32** 
"
"Okay, so there are 52 choir members total, and half are girls. That means there are 26 girls in the choir.  

Half of them couldn't make it to the performance because their bus broke down, so 26 / 2 = 13 girls couldn't go.

That leaves 26 - 13 = 13 girls who could perform.

Plus, the 3 teachers decided to sing too, so in total there were 13 + 3 = 16 people who sang in the performance. 


"
"Okay, so to find Wilson's math grade, we need to figure out the average of his five test scores.  

Here's how:

1. Add up all the scores: 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400
2. Divide the total by the number of scores: 400 / 5 = 80


His current math grade is 80. 
"
"Okay, so an eraser is $2 and a pencil is $3.  

If you have 6 erasers, that's 6 times $2, which is $12.

And 8 pencils times $3 each is $24.

Adding those together, 12 plus 24 is $36.

"
"Okay, so James delivered 66 messages to Ms. Thompson and 1/3 of that amount to Mr. Yu.  To find out how many he gave to Mr. Yu, we do 66 / 3 which equals 22 messages.  

Then, to find the total, we add the messages for both teachers: 66 + 22 = 88 messages. 


"
"Okay, so David gets a bracelet for $30, which lets him ride all 9 rides. Dasha has to buy tickets.  Each ride is 2 tickets, so she needs 9 rides * 2 tickets/ride = 18 tickets.  Those tickets cost 18 tickets * $2/ticket = $36.  David saves $36 - $30 = $6. 


**Answer:** $6 
"
"Monica needs to wrap 6 gifts for her family + 4 for her friends + 2 for her teachers, which totals 12 gifts.  If she has 144 inches of ribbon and wants to make a bow for each gift, she can use 144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches of ribbon per bow. 


"
"Here's how to solve this problem:

Let's say Betty has 5x popsicles and Sam has 6x popsicles.  We know that together they have 165 popsicles, so:

5x + 6x = 165

Combining like terms:

11x = 165

Dividing both sides by 11:

x = 15

This means Betty has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles and Sam has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty. 


**Answer:** 15 
"
"Okay, so Tim ditches cable for streaming. Netflix is $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus together usually cost $20, but he gets 20% off for bundling them. That's a savings of $4, so his bundle is only $16.  

All together, his streaming costs $10 + $16 = $26 a month.  

Since cable was $60, he saves $60 - $26 = $34. 


**34**
"
"Okay, so Carol spent 4 hours writing, 2 hours recording (since that's half the writing time), and 90 minutes editing, which is 1.5 hours.  

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we do:

(1.5 hours / 7.5 total hours) * 100% = 20% 


20% 
"
"Okay, so there are 6 rows and 6 columns in the shelving system, which means there are 6 * 6 = 36 spaces for books.  Wendy wants to put double that number of books in, so she'll need 36 * 2 = 72 books.  

But wait, she also wants to add 20 more!  So that means she'll need a total of 72 + 20 = 92 books. 


"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* Erica starts with 20 cards and gets 30 more from her dad, so she has 20 + 30 = 50 cards.
* She gives out 24 + 5 = 29 cards.
*  Finally, she gets 17 more cards, so she has 50 - 29 + 17 = 38 cards. 



**Answer: 38** 
"
"Okay, so Jenny has a 12-slice pizza.  She gives Bill 1/3 of it and Mark 1/4 of it.  That's 4 slices for Bill and 3 slices for Mark.  

If Jenny eats 2 slices, that means a total of 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 slices are gone.

So there are 12 - 9 = 3 slices left. 


"
"Okay, so Mark needs $300 for the bike and he already has $50.  That means he needs to save another $250.  If he makes $10 each day, it will take him 25 days to save enough. 


"
"Okay, so Nancy found 90 spiders.  She saw one-third as many millipedes as spiders, which is 90 / 3 = 30 millipedes.  

Then, she saw twice the number of millipedes minus 12 stink bugs, so that's (30 * 2) - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

Finally, to find the total number of bugs, add up all the types: 90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 168 bugs. 




"
"Okay, so Erica is 30. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, making her 35. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so she's 42.  The difference in age between Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years. 


"
"Okay, so John drank 2 glasses of milk and each glass is 8 ounces. That means he drank a total of 2 * 8 = 16 ounces of milk.  

Since each ounce has 3 calories, he consumed 16 * 3 = 48 calories. 


48 
"
"Okay, so he works 4 weeks a month and 6 days a week, which means he works 4 * 6 = 24 days a month.  

In a year, that's 24 days/month * 12 months = 288 days.

Since he makes $50 a day, he earns 288 days * $50/day = $14,400 a year. 


"
"Okay, so Mark's making a quadruple batch of brownies. That means he needs four times the normal amount of ingredients.  

The recipe calls for 3 cups of flour, so he'll need 3 * 4 = 12 cups of flour. Since flour comes in 2-cup bags, he'll need 12 / 2 = 6 bags.

He also needs 1 cup of milk for the recipe, so for a quadruple batch, he'll need 1 * 4 = 4 cups of milk. Milk comes in 2-cup bottles, so he'll need 4 / 2 = 2 bottles.

Finally, to figure out how many more bags of flour he needs than bottles of milk, we subtract: 6 - 2 = 4.


**Answer: 4** 
"
"Okay, so Mel's AC uses 900 watts for 8 hours a day, which is 900 * 8 = 7200 watt-hours.  

If he cuts it back to 3 hours a day, that's 900 * 3 = 2700 watt-hours.  

That means he saves 7200 - 2700 = 4500 watt-hours each day.

Over 30 days, that's 4500 * 30 = 135,000 watt-hours.

To make that into kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000, so he saves 135,000 / 1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours. 




"
"Okay, so there are two zebras with 17 stripes each, that's 17 * 2 = 34 stripes.  Then there's one with 36 stripes and another with half of that, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.  

Adding all the stripes together, we get 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

Finally, to find the average, we divide the total stripes by the number of zebras: 88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra. 


22 
"
"Okay, so Tyson needs to make enough muffaletta sandwiches for 20 people.  Each sandwich uses a pound of meat and a pound of cheese, and feeds 4 people.  

First, let's figure out how many sandwiches he needs: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

That means he'll need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

Meat costs $7 a pound, so 5 pounds will cost 5 * $7 = $35.

Cheese costs $3 a pound, so 5 pounds will cost 5 * $3 = $15.

The total cost for the meat and cheese is $35 + $15 = $50. 



**Answer:** $50.00 
"
"Okay, let's break this problem down:

* **Start with the cannolis:** Allan has 40 cannolis and buys 60 more, so he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.
* **Figure out the corns:**  He has twice as many corns as cannolis, so he has 100 cannolis * 2 = 200 corns.
* **Find the total:**  Add the number of corns and cannolis: 200 corns + 100 cannolis = 300.

"
"Okay, so Elliott needs to walk 10,000 steps total.  He did 5,000 steps to and from school and another 1,000 with his friend. That means he had 10,000 - 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000 steps left after those walks.  Since he had 2,000 steps left *after* his jog, he must have walked 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog. 



**Answer:** 2,000 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

First, Toby needs to read 9000 words (45 pages * 200 words/page).  At 300 words per minute, that'll take him 30 minutes (9000 words / 300 words/minute).  

Then, it takes him another 10 minutes to get to the airport.  So in total, he'll be gone for 40 minutes (30 minutes + 10 minutes).

Since he has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, he'll be 20 minutes early. 



"
"Okay, so Carolyn's company hired 40 workers in May, and they each made $15 an hour for a 40-hour week.  That means each worker made $15 * 40 = $600 per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, each worker made $600 * 4 = $2400 in May.  

In total, the company paid out $2400 * 40 = $96,000 to the workers in May.

In June, a quarter of the workers left, so 40 / 4 = 10 workers left the company. That means 40 - 10 = 30 workers were left.

So, in June, the company paid out $2400 * 30 = $72,000.

Adding the money paid in May and June, the company paid out a total of $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Sally spent $3 on the first pound of taffy, and then got the second pound for half off, which is $1.50. So the taffy cost her $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The seashells were $1.50, and the magnets were $0.25 each, so 4 magnets cost her $0.25 x 4 = $1.00.

Adding it all up, Sally spent $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Since she started with $10.00, she has $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00 left. 



"
"Okay, so Tim spent $400 on one pack of fireworks and twice that on another pack, which is $800.  That means he spent a total of $1200 on the packs before the discount.  

He got a 20% discount, so he saved $240 ($1200 * 0.20).  After the discount, the packs cost $960.

Then he bought a finale firework for $150, so his total spending was $960 + $150 = $1110. 



"
"Okay, so Shannon eats 2 madeleines every night for 30 days, which means she'll need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies total.  Since each recipe makes 12 cookies, she'll need to make 60 / 12 = 5 batches. 


"
"Okay, so Marcy makes 50,000 candles and says they're 99% guaranteed not to explode. That means 1% of them *will* explode.  

Out of those exploding candles, 5% also smell like wet dog.  To find out how many smell like wet dog AND explode, we do some multiplying:

* 1% of 50,000 candles is 500 candles (50,000 x 0.01 = 500)
* 5% of those 500 candles is 25 candles (500 x 0.05 = 25)




**Answer:** 25 
"
"Okay, so each blouse is 30% off, which means each one is discounted by $20 * 0.30 = $6.  

That makes each blouse $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha buys 4 blouses, the total cost is $14 * 4 = $56. 


"
"Okay, let's break this problem down:

* **Joanne's apples:** Joanne got 30 apples from the tall trees and 15 from the short trees (half the amount from the tall trees).  That's 30 + 15 = 45 apples.

* **Sister's apples:** Her sister got double Joanne's amount from the tall trees (30 * 2 = 60 apples) and triple Joanne's amount from the short trees (15 * 3 = 45 apples). So she got 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

* **Total apples:** Together, they picked 105 + 45 = 150 apples.

* **Joanne's average apples:** Since they picked a total of 500 apples, Joanne must have gotten 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"
"Okay, so we've got 180 heads and 304 bumps total.  

*  Each camel has two humps, and each dromedary has one. 

Let's say there are 'c' camels and 'd' dromedaries.  We can set up two equations:

*  c + d = 180  (one for the total number of animals)
*  2c + d = 304 (one for the total number of humps)

To solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries), we can use a little algebra.  Let's solve the first equation for 'c':

c = 180 - d

Now, substitute that value of 'c' into the second equation:

2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':

360 - 2d + d = 304
-d = -56
d = 56



There are **56** dromedaries. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for the first four days, so that's 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.
*  The next two days he traveled 30% of the distance from the first four days, which is 800 * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.
*  In total, he traveled 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers in the first six days.
*  During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers each day for seven days, so that's 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.
*  Adding those two parts together, his total trip distance was 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

"
"Okay, so Mr. Josue got $4000 from the first bank and twice that from the second bank, which is $4000 * 2 = $8000.  

That means he got a total of $4000 + $8000 = $12000 from the banks.

Adding his initial $5000, he now has $5000 + $12000 = $17000. 


"
"Okay, so there were 50 cats on a rock.  Four boats came and took 5 cats each, which is 20 cats total. That leaves 30 cats on the rock. Then, 3/5 of those remaining cats ran after a mouse, so that's (3/5) * 30 = 18 cats.  

Subtracting those that ran off, we have 30 - 18 = 12 cats left on the rock. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out. 

* The first 6 months are $8 a month, so that's 6 * $8 = $48.
* Then it goes up to $12 a month for 8 months, which is 8 * $12 = $96.
* After that, it's $14 a month for 12 months, so that's 12 * $14 = $168.

*  Adding all that up, it costs $48 + $96 + $168 = $312 for two years.

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

* The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22.
* Together, the jeans cost $28 + $22 = $50.
* He saved a total of $6. Let's say he saved 'x' dollars on the tattered jeans. That means he saved $6 - x on the jogger jeans.
* We know that (1/3) * (6 - x) = the amount saved on the jogger jeans.  
*  Since he saved $2 on the jogger jeans, we can set up the equation: (1/3) * (6 - x) = 2
* Solving for x:
    * 6 - x = 6
    * -x = 0
    * x = 0 

This means he saved nothing on the tattered jeans.  

* The jogger jeans originally cost $22, and the tattered jeans cost $28. 
* The difference is $28 - $22 = $6.



**Answer:** The jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. 
"
"Okay, so they have 4 buses that hold 60 people each, which is 4 * 60 = 240 people.  

Then there are 6 minibuses with 30 people each, so that's 6 * 30 = 180 people.

And finally, 10 minivans with 15 people each, which is 10 * 15 = 150 people.

Adding all that up: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 people can go on the trip.

"
"Okay, so Lillian has 3 homemade feeders that attract 10 more birds than the 3 store-bought feeders.  Homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each, and the store-bought ones attract 20 birds each.

* Homemade birds: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds
* Store-bought birds: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds

In total, Lillian can expect to see 90 + 60 = 150 birds in her garden each day. 


"
"Okay, so Aleksandra got soup, a bagel, and cake.  The bagel was $4, and the soup cost 25% more than that.  That means the soup was $4 + (0.25 * $4) = $5.  The cake was half the price of the bagel, so it was $4 / 2 = $2.  

To find the total cost, we add it all up: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11. 



"
"Okay, so Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 for spending money, meaning he made $150 from selling his cards.  If each card sells for $1.50, he sold $150 / $1.50 = 100 cards.  Since he kept one-third of his cards, he must have started with 100 cards * 3 = 300 cards. 



"
"Okay, so the caterer made enough hot dogs for half the guests to have two. That means they made enough for 36 / 2 = 18 people.  Since each of those 18 people got two hot dogs, that's a total of 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs.  

But, 40 people showed up!  That means 40 - 18 = 22 people didn't get a second hot dog.

"Okay, so Antoine needs 4 pounds of onions because he doubles the recipe. Onions are $2 a pound, so that's 4 * 2 = $8.  He also needs 2 boxes of stock at $2 a box, which is 2 * 2 = $4.  

That means his total cost is $8 + $4 = $12.  

Since his soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12 / 6 = $2. 



"
"Okay, so Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater. Bernadette's drive is four times longer, meaning it takes her 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.  Since she wants to be there 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes earlier. 


"
"Okay, so Billie's room is 360 square feet and 3 yards long.  First, let's convert that length to feet: 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now we know the area is length times width, so we can solve for the width: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Finally, the perimeter is twice the length plus twice the width: 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet. 



**Answer:** 98 feet 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads, for a total of 3 packs.  Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red, giving her 7 packs in total.

Since each pack has 20 beads, Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads.

Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

That means Margareth has 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 more beads than Elizabeth. 


**Answer: 80** 
"
"Okay, so Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.  The oven makes it warmer by 5 degrees every hour for 3 hours, which is a total of 15 degrees. That means the house is now at 55 degrees (40 + 15).

Then he opens a window for half an hour, and for every 10 minutes the window is open, the temperature drops by 2 degrees. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the temperature drops by 6 degrees (30 / 10 = 3 times).

Finally, we subtract that 6 degree drop from the 55 degrees to get the final temperature: 55 - 6 = 49 degrees. 




"
"Okay, let's break this down. 

First, figure out how long James took for his swim. He was 10% faster than Jon, who swam for 40 minutes.  That means James saved 4 minutes (10% of 40). So James swam in 36 minutes.

Next, James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, who biked for 80 minutes.  That means James biked for 85 minutes.

We know Jon finished the whole triathlon in 170 minutes (40 + 80 + 50). Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James took 180 minutes in total.

Finally, to find James' run time, subtract his swim and bike times from his total time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* Movie C is 1.25 hours long, which is the same as 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.
* Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.
* Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, meaning Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long. 


Let me know if you have any other movie math problems! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how far the horse runs.  It runs at 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour.  So, it runs 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats half a bale of hay for every mile, it eats 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is 8 bales * $3/bale = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is 6 * $5 = $30.

After buying the hay, he'll have $30 - $24 = $6 left.




**Answer:** $6 
"
"Okay, so Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs, which is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.  She also has 2 extra eggs, making a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, she can make 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

If each tray holds 5 glasses, she can put out 10 / 5 = 2 trays. 


"
"Okay, so Joey starts with 214 points and gets 26 more, bringing his total to 240. Marcy begins with 225 points and adds 10, giving her 235 points.  To find out how many points ahead Joey is, we subtract Marcy's score from Joey's: 240 - 235 = 5. 


Joey is winning by 5 points. 
"
"Okay, so the salesman made $576 on the sneakers. He sold 17 for $20 each, which is $340.  Then he sold the rest for $25 each, and there were 31 sneakers left. That's $775 from the department store.  

In total, he made $340 + $775 = $1115.  

His profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.

"
"Here's how to find the average speed:

* **Figure out the total distance:**  The car travels 60 miles per hour for two hours, so that's 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then it goes 30 miles per hour for one hour, so that's 30 * 1 = 30 miles.  The total distance is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

* **Figure out the total time:** The car drives for 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

* **Divide the total distance by the total time:** 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.


**So the average speed is 50 mph.** 
"
"Okay, so Jenna starts with 8 sapphires worth $800 each, so that's 8 * $800 = $6400.  Then she trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies.  Those 3 sapphires are worth 3 * $800 = $2400.  The 2 rubies are worth 2 * $1200 = $2400.  

So now she has 5 sapphires left (8 - 3 = 5) worth 5 * $800 = $4000 and 2 rubies worth $2400.  

In total, her jewels are worth $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"Okay, so Bob needs to figure out how much potting soil he needs and how much it'll cost.  

First, each raised bed is 2 feet wide x 8 feet long x 2 feet tall, so that's 32 cubic feet of space in each bed (2 x 8 x 2 = 32).

Since he has 10 beds, he needs 320 cubic feet of soil total (32 x 10 = 320).

Each bag of soil holds 2 cubic feet, so he'll need 80 bags (320 / 2 = 160).

Finally, each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be $1920 (160 x $12 = $1920).

"Okay, so there are 15 red cards.  We know there are 60% more green cards than red cards, so we need to figure out what 60% of 15 is. That's (60/100) * 15 = 9 green cards.  

That means there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

The yellow cards are the same number as the red and green cards combined, so there are 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add them all up: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.

"Here's how to figure this out:

Let's say Matt eats 'x' carrot sticks.  He gets half the number of cookies as carrot sticks, which is x/2.  Plus, he gets 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room.  That means the total number of cookies is (x/2) + 2.

We know he wants to eat 5 cookies total, so we can set up an equation:

x/2 + 2 = 5

Now, solve for x:

* Subtract 2 from both sides: x/2 = 3
* Multiply both sides by 2: x = 6



**Answer:** Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"Okay, so we have a pyramid with 4 cheerleaders on the bottom, 3 on the next level, 2 on the one after that, and the shortest one at the top.  

* The bottom layer is 4 cheerleaders * 64 inches each = 256 inches tall.
* The next layer up is 3 cheerleaders * 64 inches each = 192 inches tall.
* The layer above that is 2 cheerleaders * 64 inches each = 128 inches tall.
* And the very top is 60 inches tall.

Adding all that up: 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches.

"Here's how to solve this:

Let Angela's current age be 'a'.  In four years, she'll be a + 4 years old.  Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old in four years.  We know that in four years, Angela will be three times Brett's current age, so:

a + 4 = 3 * 14

Simplifying the equation:

a + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

a = 38


Angela is currently 38 years old.

"Okay, so here's how to figure this out.

Venue 1 costs $200 plus $5 for each person who comes.  Venue 2 costs $25 for each person, but that includes food.

To find out when they cost the same, we need to figure out how many people it would take for the cost of Venue 1 (with food) to equal Venue 2.

Let's say 'x' is the number of people.

* Venue 1 cost: $200 + $5x
* Venue 2 cost: $25x

We want to find when these two costs are the same, so we can set them equal:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Now, let's solve for x:

* Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x
* Divide both sides by $20: x = 10


So, it would take **10** guests for the two venues to cost the same. 
"
"Okay, so here's how to solve this problem:

* Let's say Bodhi found 'B' insects.
* David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found B/2 insects.
* Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (B/2) + 7 insects.

*  Together they found 43 insects, so: B + (B/2) + 7 = 43

*  Let's simplify the equation: (3/2)B + 7 = 43

*  Subtract 7 from both sides: (3/2)B = 36

*  Multiply both sides by 2/3: B = 24

*  Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find how many David found: 24 / 2 = 12 insects

*  Finally, we can find how many Lily found: 12 + 7 = 19 insects




Lily found 19 insects.

"Okay, so Cherrie buys 2 friends 5 gifts each, which is 2 * 5 = 10 gifts.  Then she buys 3 friends 2 gifts each, which is 3 * 2 = 6 gifts.  That means she bought a total of 10 + 6 = 16 gifts for her friends.  Then she buys 10 more random gifts, so she bought 16 + 10 = 26 gifts in all. 


**26**"
"Okay, so the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than that.  That means the rug is 8 feet wide.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 8 * 2 = 16 feet.

So the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  Suzie spent $2 on grape gum and half that on green apple gum, which is $1.  That means the grape and green apple gum together cost $3.  Since she spent $7 total, the strawberry gum must have cost $7 - $3 = $4.  Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, each pack cost $4 / 2 = $2. 


"
"Okay, so Frederick wants to make the most popsicle sticks with his $24.  

A 2x4 gives him 200 sticks for $4, and a 2x8 gives him 400 sticks for $6.  

Let's see how many of each he can buy:

* **2x4s:** $24 / $4 per 2x4 = 6 2x4s
* **2x8s:** $24 / $6 per 2x8 = 4 2x8s

Now, let's see how many sticks that is:

* **2x4s:** 6 2x4s * 200 sticks/2x4 = 1200 sticks
* **2x8s:** 4 2x8s * 400 sticks/2x8 = 1600 sticks

He can make more sticks with the 2x8s!


**Answer:** 1600 
"
"Okay, so Mario needs snowshoes for his 6 dogs, and each dog has 4 legs. That means he needs snowshoes for 6 * 4 = 24 legs.  

Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, he'll need 24 / 2 = 12 pairs.

If each pair costs $12, the total cost will be 12 * $12 = $144. 


**Answer:** $144.00 
"
"Janet spends $2.20 on each bus trip, and she takes two trips a day.  That means she spends $4.40 on bus fare each day.  

Over a week, that's $4.40 x 5 days = $22.00.

Since the weekly bus pass costs $20.00, she would save $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00. 


**Answer:** $2.00 
"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* **Zoo Cows:** The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, which has 30. So the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows.
* **Farm Sheep:** The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, which has 20.  That means the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.
* **Total Farm Animals:** The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
* **Total Zoo Animals:** The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.
* **Combined Animals:**  Together, they have 40 + 80 = 120 animals.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

Let's say Sophia bought 'x' onions and 'x' potatoes.  Since Rose bought 4 times the amount Sophia bought, Rose bought 4x onions and 4x potatoes.

We know Rose bought 12 onions, so 4x = 12.  Dividing both sides by 4, we find x = 3. This means Sophia bought 3 onions.

We also know Rose bought 4 potatoes, so 4x = 4.  Dividing both sides by 4, we find x = 1. This means Sophia bought 1 potato.

In total, Sophia bought 3 + 1 = 4 items.

"Okay, so Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by July 19th.  That means he has about 6 months to do it.  

To lose a pound, he needs to burn 3500 calories. So to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

There are about 180 days between now and July 19th.  

To lose the weight in time, he needs to burn about 105,000 calories / 180 days = 583 calories each day. 



**Answer:**  Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of about 583 calories. 
"
"Gerald makes $30 a day and worked for a whole week, which is 7 days. So he earned $30 * 7 = $210.  He spent $100, so he has $210 - $100 = $110 left. 


"
"Okay, so Hannah needs 60 ml of water for every kilometer she runs.  She's running 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km long.  

First, let's figure out the total distance: 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 kilometers.

Then, we can calculate how much water she needs: 2 kilometers * 60 ml/kilometer = 120 ml. 


120 
"
"Okay, so Julie started with $500.  She spent 20% of that on clothes, which is the same as $500 * 0.20 = $100.  

That means she had $500 - $100 = $400 left.

Then she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs, so that's $400 * 0.25 = $100.

Finally, she had $400 - $100 = $300 left over. 



**Answer:** $300 
"
"Here's how to solve this:

* Let 'x' represent the cost of the lot.
* The house costs three times the lot, so it costs 3x.
* Together, the lot and house cost $120,000, so x + 3x = $120,000
* Combining like terms, we get 4x = $120,000
* Dividing both sides by 4, we find x = $30,000 (the cost of the lot)
*  The house costs 3 times the lot price, so it costs 3 * $30,000 = $90,000 


**Answer:** $90,000 
"
"Okay, so Tara bought 8 packs of canvas bags, and each pack had 5 bags.  That means she bought a total of 8 * 5 = 40 bags.  Since each bag cost $4, the total cost was 40 * $4 = $160.

She sold each bag for $8, so she made 40 * $8 = $320.

To find her profit, we subtract the cost from the money she made: $320 - $160 = $160.


"
"Okay, so Joe throws 25 punches every minute, and the fight is 5 rounds of 3 minutes each.  

First, let's figure out how long the fight lasts in total: 5 rounds * 3 minutes/round = 15 minutes.

* Hat: 2 skeins
* Scarf: 4 skeins
* Sweater: 12 skeins
* Mittens: 1 skein
* Socks: 2 skeins

That's a total of 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 skeins per grandchild.

Since she has 3 grandkids, she'll need 21 * 3 = 63 skeins of wool.

"Okay, so Chris has 100 problems and does 12 on Monday.  That means he has 100 - 12 = 88 problems left.

On Tuesday, he does three times as many as Monday, so he does 12 * 3 = 36 problems.

Now he's done 12 + 36 = 48 problems in total.

That leaves him with 100 - 48 = 52 problems.

On Wednesday, he does a quarter of the remaining problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

Finally, he has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left to do on Thursday.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Tony picks 6 quarts per hour.
* Bobby picks 1 less than Tony, so he picks 5 quarts per hour.
* Kathy picks twice as much as Bobby, meaning she picks 10 quarts per hour.
* Ricky picks 2 fewer quarts than Kathy, so he picks 8 quarts per hour.

Adding up their totals, they pick 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour.

"
"Okay, so Ada uses 12 kilowatts of electricity a day and that costs her $18.00.  She's adding a device that uses 2 more kilowatts, so now she'll use 14 kilowatts a day. That means her new daily cost will be 14 times $1.50, which is $21.00.  

The difference in her daily cost is $21.00 - $18.00 = $3.00.

Over a week, that's $3.00 a day times 7 days, so her bill will be $21.00 more each week. 



"
"Okay, so if one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means it takes them 10 days to paint the whole thing.  

If you have 5 people, they could each paint half a house in 5 days, right?  That means together they could paint the whole house in just 2 days!

Since there are 8 hours in a day, it would take them 2 days * 8 hours/day = 16 hours.

"
"Okay, let's break this problem down:

* **Ophelia:** We know she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, and she has 20 sofas.  So she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
* **Jenna:** Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, meaning she has 22 * 3 = 66 chairs.  Since she also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

* **Total:** To find the total number of sofas, we add Ophelia's and Jenna's sofas: 20 + 64 = 84 sofas.

* **Total:**  Similarly, the total number of chairs is 22 + 66 = 88 chairs.

* **Grand Total:** Finally, the total number of sofas and chairs is 84 + 88 = 172.

"Okay, so Jame will be 27 in 5 years, which means he's 22 now.  His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years.  

Let's break that down:

* In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.
* Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 30 * 2 = 60.
*  His cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.
*  This means his cousin is currently 55 - 8 = 47 years old.

The age difference between them is 47 - 22 = 25 years. 




"
"Okay, so Errol spent $2400 total.  We know the computer was $1100 and the printer was $400 less than that, so it cost $700.  

That means the two monitors together cost $2400 - $1100 - $700 = $600.

Since he bought two monitors, each one must have cost $600 / 2 = $300. 


"
"Okay, so there are 20 kids split evenly into boys and girls, meaning there are 10 of each. The boys found 60 shells each, totaling 600 shells.  The girls found an amount equal to the boys' total plus four times that amount, so they found 600 + (4 * 600) = 3000 shells.  Since there are 10 girls, each girl brought back 300 shells. 


"
"Okay, so George has 3 candies left after eating 5, meaning he started with 3 + 5 = 8 candies.  Since Nick had twice as many as George, he originally had 8 * 2 = 16 candies.  

Nick still has all those candies.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* The second book is 50 mm thick.
* The third book is 5 mm thinner than the second, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
* The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, which is 31 mm * 2 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add up the thicknesses of all the books: 31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

"
"Okay, so Elvis wants to save $1125 in April.  He wants to save twice as much each day in the second half of the month compared to the first half.

*  April has 30 days, so that's 15 days in each half.

* Let's say he saves 'x' dollars each day in the first half.

* In the second half, he saves twice that, or 2x dollars each day.

*  His total savings would be: (15 days * x dollars/day) + (15 days * 2x dollars/day) = $1125

*  Simplifying that: 15x + 30x = $1125

*  Combining like terms: 45x = $1125

*  To find x, divide both sides by 45: x = $25

*  So, he saves $25 each day in the first half.

*  In the second half, he saves twice that, or $25 * 2 = $50 each day.




**Answer:** Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month.
"
"Okay, so Verna spent $1.50 x 3 = $4.50 on apples.  Then she spent $0.80 x 5 = $4.00 on oranges, and $0.75 x 6 = $4.50 on peaches.  

That means her total spending was $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.  

If she paid with $20.00, her change would be $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

"Here's how to solve this:

Let's say Brad gets $x.  Since Jeff gets four times as much as Brad, Jeff gets $4x.

Together, they have $100, so:

x + 4x = 100

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

That means Brad gets $20, and Jeff gets:

4 * $20 = $80 


**Answer:** Jeff gets $80.

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

James has 80 toys, and Jonathan wants a set five times bigger, so he's aiming for 80 * 5 = 400 toys.

"
"Okay, so Daniel wants to buy five notebooks at $1.50 each, which is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.  

He also needs two pens at $0.25 each, so that's 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.

Then there's one calculator at $12.00 and one geometry set at $10.00.

Adding all that up, we get $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

But wait, there's a 10% discount!  That means he saves 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00.

So the final price he pays is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00 



"
"Okay, so Carly spends $20 on hamburgers, $3 on fries, and $10 on drinks.  That means her total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.  If she pays with a $50 bill, she gets $50 - $33 = $17 back. 


"
"Okay, so Antonella made $1000 worth of sales, and she gets 30% commission on that, which is $300.

If you add those together, she made a total of $300 + $150 = $450. 



"
"Okay, so Bill has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles, meaning he has 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.  He needs 2 bottles per guest for his 70 guests, so that's 70 * 2 = 140 bottles total.  To figure out how many more he needs, we subtract the bottles he already has: 140 - 48 = 92 bottles. 


**92** 
"
"Okay, so Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when it's cold.  When it's warm, he takes twice that amount of time plus 2 minutes.  That means he swims a mile in (16 * 2) + 2 = 34 minutes.

To swim three miles in cold water, it would take him 16 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it would take him 34 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 102 minutes.

The difference is 102 minutes - 48 minutes = 54 minutes. 



**Answer:** 54 minutes 
"
"Okay, so John makes $2 an hour and works 5 hours a day, which means he makes $2 * 5 = $10 each day.  Since he works 4 days a week, he makes $10 * 4 = $40 a week.  To save $80, it will take him $80 / $40 = 2 weeks.

"
"Okay, so Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.  Zack's locker is half the size, which means it's 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.  Peter's locker is a quarter the size of Zack's, so it's 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches. 


"
"Okay, so Octavia drinks half the recommended amount of coffee, which is 4 cups / 2 = 2 cups.  Juan drinks 10 times that amount, so he drinks 2 cups * 10 = 20 cups.  His doctor wants him to cut back to 4 cups, so he needs to reduce his intake by 20 cups - 4 cups = 16 cups. 


"
"Okay, so there are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, which is 30 hamsters in total.  Then there are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, which is 15 guinea pigs.  Adding those together, the pet shop has 30 + 15 = 45 rodents. 


45 
"
"Okay, so Mark weighs 150 pounds and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than him, which means she weighs 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so he weighs 260 pounds.  

To find the average weight, we add up their weights (150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds) and then divide by the number of friends (3).  

That means the average weight is 540 / 3 = 180 pounds. 


"
"Okay, so the sun starts at the top of the pyramid, which is already at a 32-degree angle from the ground.  

Then, it moves 5 degrees higher every hour for 10 hours. That means it moves a total of 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

To find the final angle, we add that movement to the starting angle: 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees. 


**Answer:** 82 degrees 
"
"Okay, so James needs candles for his two sons. One is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, making him 8.  That means they need 12 + 8 = 20 candles total.

Since each pack has 5 candles, they'll need 20 / 5 = 4 packs.  

If each pack costs $3, the total cost is 4 * $3 = $12. 


"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* **Week 1:** Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.
* **Week 1 Pages:** Since she reads 2 pages every 1.5 minutes, she read 105 minutes / 1.5 minutes/page = 70 pages in the first week.
* **Total Pages:**  Adding the pages from week 2 (100 pages), she read a total of 70 + 100 = 170 pages in two weeks.

"Okay, so Cody and Trevor started with 12 sandwiches.  Cody ate one-third of them, which is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches. Trevor ate one-quarter, which is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.  

Together they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.  

That means there are 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches left. 


"
"Okay, so Shiloh is 44 now and in seven years he'll be three times his nephew's age.  Let's say the nephew is 'x' years old now.  

In seven years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.  And his nephew will be x + 7 years old.  

We know that in seven years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age, so:

51 = 3(x + 7)

Let's solve for x:

51 = 3x + 21
30 = 3x
x = 10


So the nephew is 10 years old.

* Then she gave Sharon $1.00 for each of the next three teeth, so that's another $3.00.
* For the last two teeth, she gave half the amount of the previous teeth, which was $0.50 each. That's $1.00 total.

Adding it all up: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00 



**Answer:** $9.00 
"
"Okay, so Richie scored 80 goals, and that was 20 more than Mark.  To find out how many goals Mark scored, we subtract 20 from Richie's total: 80 - 20 = 60 goals.

Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we subtract 45 from Richie's total to find Anna's score: 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

Finally, to get the total number of goals, we add up all three scores: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 goals. 


"
"Mitchell made 21 lemonades at $4 each, so he made 21 * $4 = $84.  Liam made $63, so Mitchell made $84 - $63 = $21 more than Liam. 


"
"Okay, so Peter spends $5 a day for four days on wooden figures, which means he spends a total of $20.  That leaves him with $70 - $20 = $50.  

Since each plastic figure costs $2, he can buy $50 / $2 = 25 plastic figures.  

In total, he'll have 4 wooden figures + 25 plastic figures = 29 action figures. 



"
"Okay, so the kitten cost $200 to spay.  Then the three vaccines were $20 each, so that's $60.  And she broke four vases at $12 a piece, which is $48.  Adding it all up, the kitten cost $200 + $60 + $48 = $308. 


"
"Okay, so Ford grows 40 roses every week and sells them to three shops.  The first shop takes 20, the second 15, and the third 30.  That means he sells a total of 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses each week.

In a month, there are four weeks, so he sells 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses a month.

But he only grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses a month.

That means he's short 260 roses - 160 roses = 100 roses each month. 


**Answer:** 100 
"
"Okay, so Katina starts with $3000 and takes out $100 every month.  That means in a year she takes out $100 * 12 = $1200.

Over two years, she takes out $1200 * 2 = $2400.

If she started with $3000 and took out $2400, she'll have $3000 - $2400 = $600 left. 


600 
"
"Okay, so the food truck makes grilled cheese sandwiches.  

* Each loaf of bread costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches, so each sandwich costs $0.30 for bread.
* They spend $30.00 on cheese and stuff for every 10 sandwiches.
* They sell each sandwich for $7.00.

Let's see...

*  The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00
*  The cost of cheese and stuff for 10 sandwiches is $30.00
*  That means the total cost for 10 sandwiches is $33.00
*  They make $70.00 from selling 10 sandwiches.
*  So their profit is $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00 



**Answer: $37.00** 
"
"Okay, so Kate has 192 crayons to work with.  She can make 24 crayon muffins since each muffin needs 8 crayons. If she sells each muffin for $1.50, she'll make 24 * $1.50 = $36.00. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Carpet Area:**  The bedroom is 18 feet by 12 feet, so that's 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

* **Carpet Cost:** The carpet is $12 per square foot, so that's 216 * $12 = $2592.

* **Padding Cost:** Padding is $2 per square foot, so that's 216 * $2 = $432.

* **Removal Cost:** Removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so that's 216 * $4 = $864.

* **Installation Cost:** Installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so that's 216 * $34 = $7344.

* **Total Cost:**  Add it all up: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232



**So, it will cost Michael $11232 to replace the carpet.** 
"
"Okay, so Mack saw 50 birds on the first two days, then none on day three.  He saw 120 birds on days four and five, 20 on day six, and 90 on day seven.  To find the average, we need to add up all the birds he saw and then divide by seven.

50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds total

280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds per day on average. 



40 
"
"Okay, so Diane starts with 20 and then does a bunch of stuff to it.  Let's break it down:

* **First, she adds half the number to 20.**  So, it's like 20 + (number/2) 
* **Then she divides that whole thing by 5.** That's  (20 + (number/2)) / 5
* **Finally, she multiplies by (20 - 12), which is 8.** So the final answer is 8 * [(20 + (number/2)) / 5]

To get a real number, we'd need to know what the ""number"" is!

"
"Okay, so the oven is 18 degrees off for every 450 degrees it's set to.  That means it's off by 4%.  

If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to figure out what temperature Maggie should set it to so that it actually reaches 520.  

Think of it like this:  If the oven is always 4% too hot, we need to dial it down a bit to compensate.  

Let's say Maggie sets it to 'x' degrees.  Since it's 4% too hot, the actual temperature will be 1.04x.  We know that 1.04x has to equal 520 degrees.

So, we can set up an equation: 1.04x = 520

To solve for x, divide both sides by 1.04: x = 520 / 1.04

That gives us x = 500. 



**Answer:** Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees. 
"
"Okay, so the first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is the same as 90 minutes.  The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes, or 125 minutes.  

To find the total time, we add those together: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

"
"Okay, so Herb's house cost $76,000. Juan's house is 30% cheaper, which means it's $76,000 * 0.30 = $22,800 less.  

To find the price of Juan's house, we subtract that: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Finally, to get the total value of both houses, we add them together: $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* Judy brought 12 cups * 2 = 24 dishes.
* Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so they brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.
*  Her friend also brought 40 cups.
*  That means her friend brought a total of 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils.
*  Judy brought 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils.
*  Together, they brought 84 utensils + 36 utensils = 120 utensils.

"
"Okay, so Pete gets 90 contacts in a box and they last him 45 days.  Each box costs $100, but it's 10% off, which is a $10 discount. That means each box costs $90.

If he buys two boxes, that's $90 x 2 = $180 total.  

He gets 90 contacts per box times 2 boxes, so he has 180 contacts total.

To find out how much each pair costs, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs: $180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair. 



**Answer:** $1.00 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday + 1 hour on Sunday = 3 hours total.
* She made $10 per hour, so she earned 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

* John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.
* That means he made 4 hours * $10/hour = $40 on Saturday.

* On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 1 hour * 3 = 3 hours.
* That means he made 3 hours * $10/hour = $30 on Sunday.

* In total, John worked 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours.
* He made 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

*  John earned $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill.




"
"Okay, so Hannah burns 500 calories per hour doing aerobics and 600 calories per hour running.  

* First, let's figure out how many calories she burns in total:
    * Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
    * Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
    * Total: 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

*  She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.  So:
    * 1600 calories / 200 calories/100 ml = 800 ml 



She needs to drink 800 ml of water. 
"
"Okay, so we know there are 4500 jelly beans total.  Let's say there are 'b' blue jelly beans.  

* Red jelly beans are 1% fewer than blue, so there are 0.99b red jelly beans.
* Green jelly beans are 1% more than blue, so there are 1.01b green jelly beans.

We can set up an equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms:

2.99b = 4500

Dividing both sides by 2.99:

b ≈ 1505 blue jelly beans

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

* Red: 0.99 * 1505 ≈ 1490
* Green: 1.01 * 1505 ≈ 1520

Finally, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

1520 - 1490 = 30


**Answer:** There are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans. 
"
"Okay, so Jared starts at 47 WPM, then goes up to 52 WPM.  If he increases by 5 more, he'll be typing at 57 WPM.  To find the average, we add all three speeds together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.  Then we divide that by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

"
"Okay, so Martin loses 1.25 pounds a week eating Cheerios and gains 1.75 pounds a week eating donuts.  

Over five weeks, he'd lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds eating Cheerios.

At the same time, he'd gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds eating donuts.

The difference in weight would be 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"
"Okay, so Alex invited 100 people, and each of them is bringing two friends, so that's 100 * 2 = 200 more people.  

That means there are 100 + 200 = 300 people coming from the email invites.

Then she invited 10 more friends, and 8 of them are bringing their spouses, so that's 10 + 8 = 18 more people.

In total, Alex needs seats for 300 + 18 = 318 people. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
* The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so it weighs 10 * 2 = 20 pounds.
* The Papillon weighs one-fourth the weight of the Dachshund, meaning it weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.
* Finally, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so it weighs 5 * 44 = 220 pounds.

"Here's how to figure this out:

The beanstalk doubles in height each day.  We know it needs to be taller than 20 feet.

* Day 1: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
* Day 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
* Day 3: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

It takes **3 days** for the beanstalk to grow taller than the window. 



"
"Okay, so he eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, and each 100 grams has 3 grams of protein.  That means he eats 2 * 3 = 6 grams of protein each day.

Over a week, that's 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein. 


"
"Okay, so Jerry is twice as old as he was five years ago.  That means if we let his current age be ""j"", we can set up the equation: 2(j - 5) = j

Solving for j, we get:

2j - 10 = j
j = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.  In three years, he'll be 13. 



"
"Okay, so George needs two implants. One costs $2000 and the other costs $2500 because he wants a fancy porcelain crown on it.  That means the implants together cost $4500.  He already paid $600, so he still needs $3900.  If he makes $15 an hour, he needs to work $3900 / $15 = 260 hours. 


"
"Okay, so we know the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Let's say the smallest angle is 'x'.  That means the other two angles are 2x and 3x.  

Setting up an equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms: 6x = 180

Dividing both sides by 6: x = 30

The largest angle is 3x, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"
"Okay, so Colby has 8 quarters, 6 dimes, 14 nickels, and 15 pennies.  Let's figure out how much money he has in total.

* Quarters are worth $0.25 each, so 8 quarters is 8 * $0.25 = $2.00
* Dimes are worth $0.10 each, so 6 dimes is 6 * $0.10 = $0.60
* Nickels are worth $0.05 each, so 14 nickels is 14 * $0.05 = $0.70
* Pennies are worth $0.01 each, so 15 pennies is 15 * $0.01 = $0.15

Now, add all that up: $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Each gumball costs a nickel, which is $0.05.  To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, divide his total money by the price of each gumball: $3.45 / $0.05 = 69 gumballs.

"Okay, so there are 5 dogs, 2 cats, and 10 birds.  

Dogs have 4 legs, cats have 4 legs, and birds have 2 legs.  Let's calculate:

* Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
* Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
* Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Adding those up, we get 20 + 8 + 20 = 48 legs.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolate in two hours, so that means he makes 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 of what Ruiz makes in an hour, so she makes (3/4) * 60 pounds = 45 pounds per hour.

In a 12-hour day, Ruiz would make 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds.

And Marissa would make 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.

Together, they make 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds of chocolate in a day.

"Okay, so Howard spent $8 on Monday.  On Tuesday, he doubled that, spending $16. Then on Wednesday, he spent four times what he spent on Tuesday, which is $64.  

To find out how much money he has left, we need to add up all his spending: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Finally, subtract his total spending from his starting amount: $100 - $88 = $12.


He has $12 left. 
"
"Okay, so Patrick sold lemonade for 6 hours total.  

For the first four hours, he sold 15 cups an hour, so that's 15 * 4 = 60 cups.  At $0.50 a cup, he made 60 * $0.50 = $30.00.

Then for the next two hours, he sold 10 cups an hour, for a total of 10 * 2 = 20 cups.  At $0.60 a cup, that's 20 * $0.60 = $12.00.

Adding those together, he made $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00 selling lemonade. 




"
"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

*  The tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles driven.  That means for 400 miles, they'd rotate 725 times/2 miles * 400 miles = 145,000 times.
*  Since there are 12 months in a year, the tires rotate 145,000 times/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 times per year.
*  To find out how long the tires last, we divide the total rotations a tire can handle (10,440,000) by the rotations per year (1,740,000): 10,440,000 / 1,740,000 = 6 years.

"Okay, so the jumbo bottle of shampoo is $24.00 and lasts for 120 washes if you use 2 pumps each time.  If Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, that means one pump will last for 120 washes / 2 = 60 washes.

So, one pump costs $24.00 / 60 washes = $0.40 per wash.

To convert that to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.40 * 100 = 40 cents.

"Okay, so Gary does laundry twice a week and each load uses 20 gallons of water. That means he uses 40 gallons of water every week (2 loads * 20 gallons).  

If a gallon of water costs $0.15, then his weekly water bill for laundry is $6.00 (40 gallons * $0.15/gallon).

Over a year, that's $312.00 ( $6.00/week * 52 weeks).

"Okay, so Ashley's internet speed is 20 kilobits per second.  We need to figure out how many megabits that is per hour.

There are 1000 kilobits in a megabit, so first we divide her speed by 1000: 20 kb/second / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second.

Then, we need to figure out how many seconds are in an hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

Finally, we multiply her speed in megabits per second by the number of seconds in an hour: 0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour.




"
"Okay, so the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days, which is 10 * 3 = 30 cars.  Then it pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the rest of the week, so 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day.  There are 7 days in a week, so it pulled 6 cars a day for 7 - 3 = 4 days. That's 6 * 4 = 24 cars.  

In total, the tow truck pulled 30 + 24 = 54 cars that week. 




"
"To figure this out, first we need to make sure we're measuring in the same units.  Since Adam's height is in inches, let's convert the required height to inches too: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now we can see that Adam needs to grow 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.  

If he grows 2 inches each year, it will take him 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years to be tall enough.

"
"Okay, so James sold 10 cars for $25,000 each, making a total of $250,000.  The company paid $75,000 to get those cars, so they made a profit of $175,000.  Since James gets 10% commission on the profit, he made $17,500. 


"
"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

*  First, we need to find out how many surfers stay on the wave.  Since 25% of the 100 riders stay on, that's 100 * 0.25 = 25 surfers.

*  We know 60% of those 25 are women, so there are 25 * 0.60 = 15 women.

*  To find out how many men stayed on, we subtract the number of women from the total: 25 - 15 = 10 men.




**Answer: 10** 
"
"Okay, so a diamond costs $2000.  The gold jewel is 4/5 the price of the diamond, which is (4/5) * $2000 = $1600.  The silver jewel is $400 less than the gold jewel, so it costs $1600 - $400 = $1200.  

Finally, to find the total price, we add up the cost of all three jewels: $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800. 


"
"Okay, so Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.  He got 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, which means he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.  Then, he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.  

To find the total number of stamps, we add them all up: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps. 


"
"Okay, so Bob's got a head start of 75 miles, and he's driving slower than Tom.  That means Tom is closing the gap between them.  

To figure out how long it takes Tom to catch up, we need to think about how many miles he makes up each hour.  He's driving 70 mph and Bob is driving 55 mph, so Tom is gaining 15 miles on Bob every hour (70 - 55 = 15).

Now, to catch up 75 miles, it'll take him 5 hours (75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours). 


**Answer:** 5 hours 
"
"Okay, so Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 fewer than Naomi, meaning he caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.  Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so he caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish. 


"
"Okay, so Manny's classes cost $60 total and there are 10 classes.  To figure out how many he can miss, we need to see how much each class can cost without his parents saying no.

If each class costs more than $10, they won't sign him up again.  So, we divide the total cost by the number of classes: $60 / 10 = $6 per class.

Since each class costs $6, he can miss any number of classes and still be under the $10 limit. 


"
"Okay, so Jewel does 50 customers a day. Julie does twice as many, so she does 50 * 2 = 100 customers a day.  

Together, they do 50 + 100 = 150 customers each day.

Over a whole week (7 days), they do 150 * 7 = 1050 customers. 


"
"Okay, so Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times that distance, which is 5 * 4 = 20 miles.  We also know Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.  To find out how far Lynn ran, we subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance: 20 miles - 3 miles = 17 miles. 


Lynn ran 17 miles. 
"
"Okay, so we know four apples cost $5.20, which means one apple costs $1.30.  

Five apples would be $1.30 x 5 = $6.50.

Three oranges cost $3.30, so one orange costs $1.10.

Five oranges would be $1.10 x 5 = $5.50.

Finally, five apples plus five oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00 




"
"Okay, so the hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep.  To find the total volume, we multiply those together: 6 * 4 * 3 = 72 cubic feet.

If it takes him 3 seconds to dig one cubic foot, it'll take him 72 * 3 = 216 seconds to dig the whole hole. 



"
"Okay, so the truck starts at $30,000.  

* The king cab is an extra $7,500.
* Leather seats cost a third of the king cab, so they're $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
* Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, making them $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
* The fancy lights are an extra $1,500.

Adding all that up: $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500 



Let me know if you need help with anything else!
"
"Okay, so Tim gets a 5% raise on his $20,000 salary, which is $1,000 more.  That means he'll make $21,000 a month.  

He also gets a bonus of half his monthly salary, so that's $21,000 / 2 = $10,500.

Adding that to his new monthly pay, he makes $21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500 each month.

Over a year, that's $31,500 * 12 = $378,000. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Pants:** Each pair of pants costs $750 / 5 = $150.
* **Total pants cost:** 10 pairs * $150/pair = $1500
* **Shirts:** He buys 10 suits * 3 shirts/suit = 30 shirts.
* **Total shirt cost:** 30 shirts * $60/shirt = $1800
* **Total suit cost:** 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500

* **Grand Total:** $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800

"Okay, so the news website does 20 political and weather articles plus 10 business articles every day, which is a total of 30 articles.  Since February has 28 days, they publish 30 articles a day times 28 days, which equals 840 articles in February. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Steve is 60 years old, and his wife is 4 years older, so she's 64.
* Their son is half his mom's age, meaning he's 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
* Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than him, so she's 32 - 3 = 29 years old. 



Let me know if you have any other brain teasers! 
"
"Okay, so each portion weighs 2 kilograms and there are 8 portions in a bag, meaning each bag has 2 * 8 = 16 kilograms of flour.

"
"Okay, so Bill digs 4 feet per hour in soil and half that in clay, which is 2 feet per hour.  

To figure out the total time, we need to calculate how long it takes for each part:

* **Soil:** 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours
* **Clay:** 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

Then, we add those times together: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours


**Answer:** It will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well. 
"
"Here's how to figure out how many cupcakes Howie needs:

* **Classmates:**  He needs 2 cupcakes per classmate for 25 classmates, so that's 2 * 25 = 50 cupcakes.
* **Teacher and Howie:**  He also needs 2 cupcakes for himself and his teacher, which is 2 * 2 = 4 cupcakes.
* **Total:**  Adding those together, he needs 50 + 4 = 54 cupcakes.

"Okay, so Fishio got 2000 likes the first week.  Three weeks later, she had 70 times that amount, which is 2000 * 70 = 140,000 likes. Then she got another 20,000 likes.  To find the total, we add those together: 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000 likes. 


160000 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

On Tuesday, Clara spent $20 per pomegranate for 20 pomegranates, so that's $400.  She saved $2 with a voucher, bringing her total to $398.

The next day, pomegranates cost $30 each, so Sheila would have spent $600. But, she got a 10% discount, which is $60 off. That means she paid $540.

To find the difference, we subtract Clara's price from Sheila's price: $540 - $398 = $142.




**Answer: 142** 
"
"Okay, so Ariadne sells red and green hats.  She made $400 from red hats one month, and that was half of what she made from green hats.  So, she made $400 * 2 = $800 from green hats.  

In total, she made $400 + $800 = $1200 that month.

The next month, she made 3/4 of what she made the first month, which is (3/4) * $1200 = $900.

Finally, to find her total earnings over two months, we add the amounts from each month: $1200 + $900 = $2100. 



Let me know if you have any other questions!
"
"Okay, so James rents the carriage for 4 hours but gets one hour free. That means he pays for 3 hours.  

The first hour is $15, and each hour after that is double the price. So the second hour is $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour is $30 * 2 = $60.

Adding it all up, he pays $15 + $30 + $60 = $105. 


"
"Okay, so Sally made $300 this week, but only has $420 in her account now.  She started the week with $200, so she earned $420 - $200 = $220.  That means $300 - $220 = $80 was taken out of her paycheck. 


"
"Okay, so Lori needs 1 egg for every 2 deviled egg halves.  If she's making enough for 16 guests who each want 3 halves, that means she'll need 16 * 3 = 48 deviled egg halves.  

Since each egg makes 2 halves, she'll need 48 / 2 = 24 eggs total.  

And finally, there are 12 eggs in a dozen, so she'll need 24 / 12 = 2 dozens of eggs. 


"
"Here's how to solve it:

"
"Okay, so the plane cost $150,000 to buy.  

He spends $5,000 a month on the hanger, and twice that on fuel, so that's $5,000 * 2 = $10,000 on fuel.

That means he spends a total of $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000 each month on keeping the plane.

Over a year, that's $15,000 * 12 months = $180,000.

So, in total, it cost him $180,000 + $150,000 = $330,000 for the first year. 



**330000** 
"
"Okay, so Finley cooked rice for 30 minutes. Pork took 20 minutes longer than rice, meaning it took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.  Beans took half the time it took to cook the rice and pork together, which is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. So beans took 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.  

Finally, to find the total cooking time, we add it all up: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes. 



"
"Okay, so we have almonds at $10 a pound and walnuts at $15 a pound.  

Let's figure out the cost of each mixture:

* **Mixture 1:** (1/2 pound almonds * $10/pound) + (1/3 pound walnuts * $15/pound) = $5 + $5 = $10

* **Mixture 2:** (1/5 pound almonds * $10/pound) + (1/3 pound walnuts * $15/pound) = $2 + $5 = $7

Finally, subtract the cost of the second mixture from the first to find the difference: $10 - $7 = $3

"
"Okay, so Lee has sheep and geese, and we know there are 20 heads total and 70 legs.  

Let's think about this:

* Each sheep has 4 legs.
* Each goose has 2 legs.

We can set up a system of equations to solve for the number of sheep (s) and geese (g):

*  s + g = 20  
*  4s + 2g = 70

To make things easier, let's solve the first equation for 'g':

* g = 20 - s

Now we can substitute that value of 'g' into the second equation:

* 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Simplify and solve for 's':

* 4s + 40 - 2s = 70
* 2s = 30
* s = 15


There are **15** sheep on Lee's farm. 
"
"Okay, so Roger had to get a more expensive coffee because his usual one was gone.  The new coffee was 20% pricier than the $5 he usually spends, so that's an extra $1 per pound. That means the new coffee costs $6 a pound.

Since he uses a pound a day for a week, he'll need 7 pounds total, costing him $6 * 7 = $42.

And he also bought a $2 donut.  

Adding those together, everything cost him $42 + $2 = $44. 



"
"Okay, so Gus spent $20 total.  He got two bags of chips at $2 each, which is $4.  The chicken was $8 and the soda was $1.  

That means he spent $4 + $8 + $1 = $13 on those things.

So the apple pie cost $20 - $13 = $7. 


"
"Okay, so James delivers 600 newspapers total.  He delivers 198 to District A and 209 to District C.  To find out how many he delivers to District B, we need to subtract those amounts from the total: 600 - 198 - 209 = 193 


193 
"
"Okay, so John's class is 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, which means he's in class for 8 hours a week (4 times 2).  Over 6 weeks, that's 48 hours total (8 times 6).  

He learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, so he'll learn 32 recipes (48 divided by 1.5). 


32 
"
"Okay, so there are 150 teachers on the court, and 60% of them are history teachers. That means 60% of 150 is (0.60) * (150) = 90 history teachers.  

To find the number of math teachers, we subtract: 150 - 90 = 60 math teachers.

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours, the math teachers sleep a total of 60 * 6 = 360 hours. 



"
"Okay, so Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 of that, which is $90. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so she has $150.  

If they add up all their money, it's $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.  

To share it equally, they each get $360 / 3 = $120. 



"
"Okay, so the game has four quarters that are each 12 minutes long, which is a total of 48 minutes.  Then they added 5 extra minutes because of the tie.  That means the whole game lasted 48 + 5 = 53 minutes.

"
"Okay, so she needs 5 tablespoons of flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 0.25 tablespoons of salt for each muffin.  That's a total of 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons of dry ingredients per muffin.

To make 16 muffins, she'd need 8.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients. 


"
"Okay, so they have a total of 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds of candy.  

If they split it evenly between the three of them, each person would get 12 / 3 = 4 pounds of candy.

"
"Okay, so Adam bought 7 candies of type A at $0.50 each, which cost him 7 * $0.50 = $3.50.  

Then he bought 10 candies of type B at $0.75 each, costing him 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of his candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00.

Since he paid with $15.00, his change is $15.00 - $11.00 = $4.00.

"Okay, so Christina had 12 good days total.  She had 3 more good days recently, so she has 12 + 3 = 15 good days. 


"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

Let's say Sally has 'x' books.  Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, so Janey has 2x + 3 books. We know Janey has 21 books, so we can set up an equation:

2x + 3 = 21

Subtract 3 from both sides: 
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9


Sally has 9 books. 
"
"Okay, so the bamboo grows 30 inches per day and it's currently 20 feet tall.  First, let's convert that to inches: 20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches.

We want to know how many days it takes to reach 600 inches, so we need to figure out the difference: 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches.

Finally, divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate: 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days. 


**Answer:** 12 days 
"
"Okay, let's break this problem down:

* James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he's good there for now.
*  8 more dogs arrive, meaning he needs 8 more toys to have one per dog (12 dogs total).
* When he goes back, there are twice as many dogs, so now he has 12 * 2 = 24 dogs. That means he needs to buy 12 more toys (24 - 12 = 12).
* Finally, 3 dogs leave, leaving him with 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.


He needs a total of **21** toys. 
"
"Okay, so Dylan put in 2/5 of the total, which is (2/5) * $1200 = $480.  

That leaves $1200 - $480 = $720 for Frances and Skyler.

Frances then invested 2/3 of what was left, so she put in (2/3) * $720 = $480.

That means Skyler's investment was $720 - $480 = $240.

576 
"
"Okay, so the elevator can hold 700 kg max.  Each adult weighs 80 kg, and there are 9 adults in total (including Jack).  

Let's see... 8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg.

Then add Jack's weight: 640 kg + 80 kg = 720 kg

That means they're going over the limit by 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

"Okay, let's break this problem down:

* **Katarina's cookies:** We know Katarina has 68 cookies.
* **Max's cookies:**  Katarina has 5 fewer cookies than Max, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
* **Cookie Monster's cookies:** Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, meaning the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
* **Summer's cookies:** Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so she has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Finally, to find the total number of cookies, add them all up: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.

"Okay, so Shania made her dress longer by 50% of its original length, which means it's now 150% of the original size.  She also added 20cm of lace.  

If the dress is 140cm long now, we can set up an equation:

1.50x + 20 = 140 

Where 'x' is the original length.

Let's solve for x:

1.50x = 120
x = 80


The original dress was **80cm** long. 
"
"Okay, so Chris mows the whole lawn in 60 minutes in ""turtle"" mode and 40 minutes in ""rabbit"" mode.  

If he mows half the lawn in each mode, that's 30 minutes in turtle mode and 20 minutes in rabbit mode.

"
"Okay, so Greta bakes 30 cookies and Celinda bakes double that amount, which is 60 cookies.  Together they have 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.  After eating 10, they have 90 - 10 = 80 cookies left. 


80 
"
"Okay, so we've got twins and triplets, and one twin is 7 years older than one of the triplets.  Their total ages add up to 44.  

Let's think about this:

*  If one triplet is 'x' years old, the twin is 'x + 7' years old.
*  The three triplets total '3x' years old.
*  The two twins total '2(x + 7)' years old.

Putting it all together, we get the equation: 3x + 2(x + 7) = 44

Now we can solve for 'x':

* 3x + 2x + 14 = 44
* 5x + 14 = 44
* 5x = 30
* x = 6

So, one triplet is 6 years old.  

Since the twin is 7 years older, the twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old. 



"
"Okay, so John has 20 minutes of math, 40 minutes of reading, and 20 minutes of history homework. That's a total of 80 minutes.  He has 3 hours until dinner, which is 180 minutes.  If he subtracts his homework time from that, he has 180 - 80 = 100 minutes to nap. 


"
"Okay, so Manolo spent $3.20 on 5 lollipops and 4 candies.  If each lollipop costs $0.40, the lollipops cost him $2.00 (5 x $0.40).  That means the candies cost $1.20 ($3.20 - $2.00).

Since each candy costs $0.30 ($1.20 / 4), 10 candies would cost $3.00 (10 x $0.30).  And 10 lollipops would cost $4.00 (10 x $0.40).

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies would cost him $7.00 in total ($4.00 + $3.00). 



"
"Okay, so Rong saves 20 coins a month and Neil saves 2/5 more than Rong.  

First, let's figure out how many more coins Neil saves: (2/5) * 20 coins = 8 coins.

That means Neil saves 20 coins + 8 coins = 28 coins each month.

Over a year, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months = 240 coins.

And Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months = 336 coins each year.

After ten years, Rong will have saved 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil will have saved 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they'll have saved 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

"Okay, so John's dog needs two vaccines at $20 each, which is $40 total.  The heartworm check is 60% of the whole bill, so let's say the total bill is 'x'. That means the heartworm check costs 0.60x.  

Putting it all together, we have: $40 + 0.60x = x

To solve for x, we can subtract $40 from both sides: 0.60x = x - $40

Then, subtract 0.60x from both sides: 0 = 0.40x - $40

Add $40 to both sides: $40 = 0.40x

Finally, divide both sides by 0.40: x = $100

So the total bill is $100.  John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25. 



"
"Okay, so a crate has 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.  

* Bananas cost twice as much as an apple, which is $0.50, so a banana costs $1.00.
* Oranges cost three times as much as a banana, so they cost $3.00 each.

Now let's add up the cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

Finally, add those costs together: $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00


**So the crate of fruit costs $32.00** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Brittany has 14 red squares.
* She has 4 more blue squares than red, so she has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
* She has 6 more green squares than blue, meaning she has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
*  Finally, she has 12 fewer white squares than green, so she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

In total, Brittany has 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares on her comforter.  Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the comforter is 68 square feet. 



"
"Okay, so there are 8 high chairs and Mia has 5 times as many regular chairs, so she has 8 * 5 = 40 regular chairs.  

That means she has a total of 40 + 8 = 48 chairs.

She needs 42 adults + 15 babies = 57 chairs in total.

So she needs to get 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs. 


**9** 
"
"Okay, so there are 50 deer and half of them are bucks, which is 25 bucks.  Then, 20% of those bucks have 8 points.  That means there are 25 * 0.20 = 5 bucks with 8 points. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Adam has 50 points.
* Betty did better than Adam and got 30% more points, so she has 50 + (50 * 0.30) = 65 points.
* Tom has 30 fewer points than Betty, meaning he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
* Marta has 3 times the points Tom has, so she has 35 * 3 = 105 points.

Adding up everyone's points, we get 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

Since they need 400 points for the trip, they're still missing 400 - 255 = 145 points. 



Let me know if you have any other questions!
"
"Here's how to solve this:

* **Children:** Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
* **Grandchildren:** Each of her 3 children has 3 kids, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 grandchildren.
* **Great-Grandchildren:** Each of the 9 grandchildren has 3 babies, so there are 9 * 3 = 27 great-grandchildren.


There will be **27** great-grandbabies at the reunion. 
"
"Okay, so Greta makes $2400 a month.  She puts half of that, which is $1200, into her retirement. Then she pays $480 for her car.  

If you add those two amounts together, that's $1680.  

To find out how much money she has left, you subtract that from her starting amount: $2400 - $1680 = $720. 


**Answer: $720.00** 
"
"There are 16 pencils left in the box since 4 are missing.  That means there are 8 pairs of pencils. 


"
"Okay, so there are 15 boxes of fireworks with 20 fireworks in each box, meaning there are a total of 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks.  Hannah can see 40% of those, so she'll see 300 * 0.40 = 120 fireworks from the city display.  

She's also setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, which is 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

In total, Hannah will see 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks. 


"
"Okay, so there are 19 people in total going to the movies.  

Each seat holds two drinks and three snacks, so they need enough for 38 drinks (19 people * 2 drinks/person) and 57 snacks (19 people * 3 snacks/person).

Since drinks and snacks cost $2 each, the total cost is $190 (95 items * $2/item). 


"
"Okay, so Gissela's truck hauls 4,000 pounds. Gordy's truck hauls 800 pounds more than hers, so it hauls 4,800 pounds.  Together, their trucks can haul 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.  Since all three trucks together haul 11,600 pounds, Gary's truck must haul 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds. 


**Answer: 2800** 
"
"Okay, so there are 8 guys and 6 girls, and each guy ate one more dumpling than each girl.  The girls each ate 3 dumplings, so the guys each ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

The girls ate a total of 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.

The guys ate a total of 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.

All together, Larry cooked 18 + 32 = 50 dumplings. 



"
"Okay, so Gerald and Julia split $100 with a ratio of 3:2.  That means Gerald got 3/5 of the money, which is (3/5) * $100 = $60.  

If he spent $10 on a book, he has $60 - $10 = $50 left. 


"
"Here's how to solve this:

* The cat runs 15 feet per second, and it's 5 times faster than the turtle.  
* This means the turtle crawls 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet per second.
* To find out how far the turtle crawls in 40 seconds, we multiply its speed by the time: 3 feet/second * 40 seconds = 120 feet.


120 
"
"Okay, so they need to raise $6300 total and have already made $2100.  That means they still need $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

If they make $700 each hour (since they made $2100 in 3 hours), it'll take them $4200 / $700 = 6 more hours. 

So the total time they need to fundraise is 3 hours + 6 hours = 9 hours. 


"
"Okay, so Colorado City uses 40% of the Colorado River's water.  They use 80% of *that* water for industry.  That means they use 32% of the total river water for industry (40% * 80% = 32%).  

To find out what percentage is used for non-industrial stuff, we subtract that from the total they use: 40% - 32% = 8%. 


"
"Here's how to solve that:

* A week has 7 days.
* Two weeks have 7 days * 2 = 14 days.
* Alex charges $12 per day.
* So, for 14 days, she charges $12 * 14 = $168. 


$168 
"
"Okay, so the factory makes 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream every two hours.  That means in one hour, they make 25 quarts of chocolate.  

They make 50 quarts of vanilla every four hours, so in one hour they make 12.5 quarts of vanilla.

Together, they make 25 + 12.5 = 37.5 quarts of ice cream every hour.

Over 48 hours, they'd make 37.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 1800 quarts.




**Answer: 1800** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we need to find the cost of each type of pastry:

* Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00/croissant = $15.00
* Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50/roll = $10.00
* Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00/quiche = $12.00
* Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00/muffin = $13.00

Now, add up the cost of all the pastries: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Finally, calculate the discount: $50.00 * 10% = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00



**$45.00**

"Okay, so she gets a free scoop for every two she buys.  That means she can get the most scoops for her money by buying two sets of two scoops.  


She'd get a total of 4 scoops. 
"
"Okay, so Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day and Amy eats 3.  

Over two weeks (14 days), Ginger eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces. Amy eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

That means Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

Amy has 58 - 44 = 14 more pieces than Ginger. 


**Answer: 14** 
"
"Okay, so Mr. Boarden's bathroom is 36 square feet, and he wants to cover two-thirds of it.  That's (2/3) * 36 = 24 square feet.

Since he needs 24 tiles for every square foot, he'll need 24 * 24 = 576 tiles. 


"
"Okay, so James spent $20 to go blueberry picking and then $1.50 for each pound of the 30 pounds he picked. That means he spent $20 + ($1.50 * 30) = $20 + $45 = $65 in total.

If he bought the blueberries at the store for $2.50 a pound, he would have spent $2.50 * 30 = $75.

He saved $75 - $65 = $10 by picking his own blueberries. 


"
"Okay, so they wanted to buy 500 computers at $700 each, which is 500 * 700 = $350,000.  

But the price went up 10%, so each computer now costs $700 + ($700 * 0.10) = $770.

That means the total cost is 500 * $770 = $385,000. 


**385000** 
"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* **Eggs:** 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories
* **Cheese:** 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories
* **Ham:** 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories

Adding those up, the omelet has 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories. 


"
"Okay, so you bought 6 pencils at $0.50 each, which is 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.  

Then you bought 8 erasers at $0.25 each, so that's 8 * $0.25 = $2.00.

The total cost is $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00.

If you paid with $10.00, your change would be $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00. 


5.00 
"
"Okay, so 30% of 100 people is 30 people who get interviews.  Then, 20% of those 30 people get job offers, which is 6 people.  Finally, a third of those 6 people accept, so that's 6 divided by 3, which is 2 people.

"
"Okay, so Helga's a super fast clog dancer!  

When her arms are down, she taps 300 times a minute with her right foot and 250 with her left, for a total of 550 taps per minute.  

When her arms are up, she slows down to 200 taps per minute with each foot, making 400 taps per minute total.

She dances for 5 minutes, with her arms up for 2 of those minutes.  

Let's figure out how many taps she does with her arms down: 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps

And how many with her arms up: 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps

Adding those together, she taps a total of 1650 + 800 = 2450 times. 




"
"Okay, so Ron's car is gonna get messed up for $450 if he doesn't fix the pothole.  But if he fixes it himself, the city will fine him $120, and he'll need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each.  

Let's see... 3 buckets times $25 is $75 for the asphalt.  So fixing it himself will cost him $75 plus the $120 fine, which is $195 total.

If he doesn't fix it, he'll lose $450.  But if he does fix it, he'll only lose $195.  That means he saves $450 - $195 = $255. 



"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Start with the total number of chairs:** 170 normal chairs + 23 baby chairs = 193 chairs

"Okay, so Bryce and his four friends got five pizzas in total.  That's 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their two pizzas, which is (2/3) * 12 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 16 slices.

The other two friends ate 3/4 of their two pizzas, which is (3/4) * 12 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 18 slices.

Together, they ate 16 slices + 18 slices = 34 slices.

That means there are 60 slices - 34 slices = 26 slices left. 



**Answer: 26**"
"Okay, so a cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages.  A dog eats the same amount in 2/3 of that time, which is 20 minutes.  

To find the average time, we add up the times and divide by two: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.  Then 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes. 


**Answer: 25 minutes** 
"
"Okay, so Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long.  That's the same as 96 inches + 4 inches, or 100 inches.  

We know Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  Let's say Bobby's shoe is 'x' inches long.  We can set up an equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Now, let's solve for x:

9x = 90
x = 10


So, Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long. 
"
"Okay, so there are 64 student cars with 4 windows each, and Hannah breaks a quarter of those windows. That's 64 cars * (1/4) * 4 windows/car = 64 windows.

Then there are 32 teacher cars with 2 windows each, and she breaks 3/4 of those windows. That's 32 cars * (3/4) * 2 windows/car = 48 windows.

In total, she breaks 64 windows + 48 windows = 112 windows. 



"
"Okay, so Candy has 60 blue spools in total (15 light blue + 45 dark blue).  She has 150 spools altogether.  To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100:

(60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

"Okay, so we need to figure out how many boxes of graham crackers they'll need. 

* First, find out how many smores the kids will eat: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
* Then, add the smores the adults will eat: 18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores
*  Each sleeve makes 8 smores, so they'll need 24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves.
* Since there are 3 sleeves per box, they'll need 3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box.

"
"Okay, so Dora is 15, and her dad is eight more than twice her age.  That means he's 38 years old (15 * 2 + 8 = 38). Her mom is four years younger than her dad, so she's 34 (38 - 4 = 34).  

To find their total combined age, we add them all up: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87.

"
"Okay, so candidate A got 20% of the votes, and candidate B got 50% more than that.  That means candidate B got 20% + (50% of 20%) = 20% + 10% = 30% of the votes.

Together, A and B got 20% + 30% = 50% of the votes.  

That means candidate C got 100% - 50% = 50% of the votes.

Since there were 100 voters, candidate C got 50% * 100 = 50 votes. 


"
"Okay, so Boris starts with 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer, meaning Beck has 77 apples.  

When Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 87 and Boris has 90.

"
"Okay, so Peter has 32 ounces of water and wants to make different sized ice cubes.  

* Giant cubes use 4 ounces each, and he's making 3, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.
* Medium cubes use 2 ounces each, and he's making 7, so that's 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.
* Small cubes use 0.5 ounces each, and he's making 8, so that's 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

In total, he'll use 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces of water.  

That means he'll have 32 - 30 = 2 ounces left.

Adding those together, she spent a total of $50 + $48 = $98. 


"
"Okay, so there are 50 students total.  We know 10 like to bake and 5 like basketball. That means 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 students like either video games or music.

The problem says twice as many like music as basketball, so 5 * 2 = 10 students like music.  

That leaves 35 - 10 = 25 students who like video games.

"
"Okay, so Jeremy saw 12 birds and scared away a third of them, which is 12 / 3 = 4 birds.  That leaves 12 - 4 = 8 birds. Then, 20 more birds showed up, so now there are 8 + 20 = 28 birds in the backyard. 


"
"Okay, so there are 80 students total split evenly between two classes. That means each class has 40 students.  Since 40% of the class are girls, we can find out how many girls are in each class: 40 students * 0.40 = 16 girls.  

To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class: 40 students - 16 girls = 24 boys.

He also found 30 more cards that are worth an average of $50 each, so those are worth $1500.  That means he has $6500 worth of cards in total.  If he made $6500 and spent $5400, his profit is $1100. 


"
"Okay, so let's figure this out.  

Park 1 costs $26 per adult and $12 per child.  Park 2 costs $14 per adult and $10 per child.  

For Jake's family, that means Park 1 would cost:

* Adults: 2 adults * $26/adult = $52
* Kids: 2 kids * $12/kid = $24
* Total Park 1: $52 + $24 = $76

Park 2 would cost:

* Adults: 2 adults * $14/adult = $28
* Kids: 2 kids * $10/kid = $20
* Total Park 2: $28 + $20 = $48

If they go to Park 2, they'll save $76 - $48 = $28. 


"
"Okay, so he saves $0.10 on each tomato since he's buying them for $0.40 instead of $0.50.  

He sells 500 tomatoes a day, so he saves $0.10 * 500 = $50 each day.

Over a week, that's $50/day * 7 days/week = $350.

"Okay, so Candy rents out 60 chairs each weekday and 100 each weekend day.  There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.

* Weekday rentals per week: 60 chairs/day * 5 days/week = 300 chairs/week
* Weekend rentals per week: 100 chairs/day * 2 days/week = 200 chairs/week
* Total weekly rentals: 300 chairs/week + 200 chairs/week = 500 chairs/week

That means in a month (4 weeks) she rents out 500 chairs/week * 4 weeks/month = 2000 chairs.

Over two months, she'd rent out 2000 chairs/month * 2 months = 4000 chairs.

"Okay, let's break this problem down:

* Gunther starts with 48 bananas.
* Arnold steals half, which is 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
* Gunther has 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.
* He adds 25 more, so he has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.
* Arnold steals another 12, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.
* Finally, Gunther adds 6 more, giving him 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.


**Answer:** Gunther has 43 bananas. 
"
"Okay, so there are 5 people sharing the electricity bill, and the bill is $100 each month.  To find out how much each person pays per month, we divide the total bill by the number of people: $100 / 5 = $20.

"
"Okay, let's break this sticker-button trade down:

* **Small stickers to large buttons:** Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers, which is 27 stickers.  Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.  She can trade these for 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

* **Large stickers to large buttons:** She trades half her 40 large stickers, which is 20 stickers. Each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, so those 20 large stickers are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.  She can trade these for 60 / 3 = 20 large buttons.

* **Large stickers to small stickers:** She has 20 large stickers left.  She trades these for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

* **Total Buttons:**  She ends up with 27 small buttons + 9 large buttons + 20 large buttons = 56 buttons.

"Okay, so Joey played 2 games on Monday, 1 on Friday, and double that on Saturday.  That means he played 2 * 2 = 4 games on Saturday.  

Adding those up, he played 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 games total last week. 


"
"Okay, so there were 33 people on the council and twice as many voted for the regulation as against it.  

Let's say 'x' represents the number of votes against the regulation. That means 2x represents the number of votes for it.  

Together, those votes equal 33:  x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms, we get 3x = 33.  

Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 11.  

Since 2x represents the votes for, that means there were 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the regulation. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

*  Krissa has 11 students who need extra-small shirts.
*  Twice that number need small shirts, so there are 11 * 2 = 22 students in size small.
*  Four fewer students need medium shirts than small shirts, meaning 22 - 4 = 18 students need medium.
*  Half as many students need large shirts as medium shirts, so there are 18 / 2 = 9 students in size large.
*  Finally, 6 more students need extra-large shirts than large shirts, making a total of 9 + 6 = 15 extra-large shirts.

To find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, add up all the sizes: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts. 



"
"Okay, so there's a 5% discount on a bag that costs $140.  To find out how much you'd pay, first figure out how much the discount is: 5% of $140 is $7.  Then subtract that from the original price: $140 - $7 = $133. 


**133** 
"
"Here's how to solve this:

* **Songs in total:** 300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs
* **Total time:** 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours


**Answer:** 60000 hours 
"
"Okay, so 20% of the 50 people like horse #2, which is 10 people.  That means 40 people are left who *don't* like horse #2.  

Of those 40, 60% like horse #7, so 24 people like horse #7.  

That leaves 40 - 24 = 16 people who must like horse #12. 



**Answer: 16** 
"
"Okay, so here's how to solve this:

* We know 6 puppies are girls, and they make up 1/3 of all the Pomeranians.  That means there are 6 * 3 = 18 Pomeranians in total.
* Since 18 Pomeranians are 2/3 of all Jana's puppies, we can set up a proportion: (2/3) * total puppies = 18
* To solve for the total puppies, divide both sides by (2/3):  total puppies = 18 / (2/3) = 27 



Let me know if you have any other word problems! 
"
"Okay, so Jayden has $70 from selling pictures and his sister Ava gives him half of her $90 allowance.  That means Ava gave him $90 / 2 = $45.

Now Jayden has $70 + $45 = $115.  

To buy the $200 camera, he still needs $200 - $115 = $85. 


"
"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

*  Let's say the second house needs 'x' cases of shingles.

* The first house needs half as many as the second, so it needs x/2 cases.

* The third house needs double the amount the first house needs, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

*  Together, all three houses need 250 cases:  (x/2) + x + x = 250

*  Combining like terms, we get 2.5x = 250

*  To find x, we divide both sides by 2.5: x = 100

*  Since the third house needs the same amount as the second house, it needs 100 cases.




**Answer: 100** 
"
"Okay, so Leila spent 3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6.  Jack spent 5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5, and Chase spent $3 on the lettuce.  

Adding it all up, they spent a total of $6 + $5 + $3 = $14. 


"
"Okay, so George has 45% more pears than bananas.  That means if he has 200 bananas, he has 45% of 200 more pears.  

45% of 200 is (45/100) * 200 = 90 pears.

So he has 200 bananas + 90 pears = 290 pears.

In total, George has 200 bananas + 290 pears = 490 fruits. 


"
"Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on a ball, leaving her with $60.  Since each candy bar costs $5, she could buy $60 / $5 = 12 candy bars for Jimmy. 


12 
"
"Okay, so Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges for every liter of juice.  If he wants to make 4 liters, he'll need 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges.  

Since each kilogram costs $3, making 4 liters of juice will cost him 20 * $3 = $60. 


"
"Okay, so Ezra read 300 books and then another 150, for a total of 450 books.  Ahmed read half as many as Ezra, which is 300 / 2 = 150 books.  Together, they read 450 + 150 = 600 books. 


**Answer:** 600 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Monday:** Tanya makes $15 an hour and worked 5 hours, so that's 5 * $15 = $75.  She also gets a $5 bonus for teaching more than 3 classes, so she made $75 + $5 = $80 on Monday.

* **Wednesday:** She made $15 an hour * 2 hours = $30 on Wednesday.

* **Total:**  Tanya earned $80 + $30 = $110 for the two days.

"
"Okay, so they sold 5 of each of their 4 vanilla scents, which means they sold a total of 5 * 4 = 20 vanilla scents.  

They also sold 2 of each of their 8 fruity scents, so they sold 2 * 8 = 16 fruity scents.

To find the difference, we subtract: 20 vanilla scents - 16 fruity scents = 4 more vanilla scents sold. 


"
"Okay, so Bennet makes $60 from the eggplants.  He wants to make $135 total, so he needs another $75.  Since he has 25 ears of corn, he needs to sell each ear for $75 / 25 = $3. 


"
"Okay, so Tatiana has 12 hours total on the weekend. She spends 3 hours reading, which leaves 9 hours.  She then spends 1/3 of the remaining time on video games, which is 3 hours. That means she has 6 hours left for soccer.  

Since she has 12 hours total and spends 6 on soccer, she spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer. 


"
"Okay, so Anthony starts with 50 pencils. He gives half of them to Brandon, which is 25 pencils.  That leaves him with 25 pencils. Then he gives 3/5 of those remaining pencils to Charlie.  That's (3/5) * 25 = 15 pencils.  

So, Anthony kept 25 - 15 = 10 pencils. 


**Answer:** 10 
"
"Okay, so Jack drives 150 miles to the museum and then 150 miles back home, right?  That's a total of 300 miles.  

Since he drives at 75 mph, it takes him 300 miles / 75 mph = 4 hours to get there and back.  

Then he spends 6 hours at the museum.  

So, the whole trip takes him 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours. 


**Answer:** 10 
"
"Okay, so Henry needs wheels for 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.  Cars need 4 wheels each and motorcycles need 2.  

Let's figure out how many wheels he needs in total:

* Cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels
* Motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels
* Total: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

If he has 650 wheels to start, he'll have 650 - 374 = 276 wheels left over. 


"
"Okay, so a 20% discount on a $1000 laptop means you save 20% of $1000.  

To find that, you do 0.20 * $1000 = $200.

Then you subtract that discount from the original price: $1000 - $200 = $800. 


So you'd pay $800 for the laptop. 
"
"Okay, so Mike has 600 movies. A third of them are in series, and he can get those for cheaper, like $6 each instead of $10. That's 600 / 3 = 200 series movies.  

He saves money on those, so 200 movies * $6 = $1200.

The rest of his movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies.  Forty percent of those are older movies, which cost $5 each. That's 400 * 0.40 = 160 older movies.

Those older movies cost 160 * $5 = $800.

The rest of the movies are 400 - 160 = 240 movies, and those cost $10 each, so that's 240 * $10 = $2400.

Finally, add it all up: $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.


**Answer:** $4400 
"
"Okay, so Winston bought 6 pounds of peaches at $2.00 a pound, which is 6 * 2 = $12.00.  

Then he got 8 pounds of plums at $1.00 a pound, so that was 8 * 1 = $8.00.

Finally, he bought 6 pounds of apricots at $3.00 a pound, costing him 6 * 3 = $18.00.

Adding it all up, he spent $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00 on fruit. 



"
"Okay, so the Llesis family spent 6 hours total on their trip.  They drove for some of that time and hiked for 1.5 hours.  

They drove 50 miles per hour, and they hiked 5 miles per hour slower than half their driving speed.  Half their driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.  So they hiked at 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.

That means they hiked 1.5 hours * 20 miles per hour = 30 miles.

To find out how far they drove, we need to figure out how long they drove. They spent 6 hours total - 1.5 hours hiking = 4.5 hours driving.

They drove 4.5 hours * 50 miles per hour = 225 miles.

Finally, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.




"
"Okay, so Ava and Emma are playing a video game and want to see who scores higher.  Here's how we can figure out the difference in their scores:

* **Ava's points:** She gets 10 points for each enemy she jumps on (she jumps on 8 more than Emma), 5 points for each berry she collects (3 more than Emma), and 30 points for every second left on the timer.  Since she finishes 4 seconds slower, she loses 120 points there.
* **Emma's points:**  She gets 10 points per enemy, 5 points per berry, and 30 points for the time left on the timer.

To find the difference, we need to figure out how many points each person gets from enemies and berries, then add those to their time bonus (or penalty for Ava).  

Let's say Emma jumps on 'x' enemies. That means Ava jumps on 'x + 8'.  

Emma gets 'x * 10' points from enemies, and Ava gets '(x + 8) * 10'.

Emma gets 'y * 5' points from berries, and Ava gets '(y + 3) * 5'.

Finally, we need to figure out the time bonus/penalty.  

Let's say Emma finishes with 'timer' seconds left.  Emma gets 'timer * 30' points, and Ava gets '(timer - 4) * 30'.

Now we can write out the difference in their scores:

[(x + 8) * 10] + [(y + 3) * 5] + [(timer - 4) * 30] - [x * 10] - [y * 5] - [timer * 30]

Simplifying this expression will give us the difference in their scores. 



"
"Okay, so they spent $64 total and two of the pizzas were $30.  That means the other two pizzas cost $64 - $30 = $34.  Since the two cheaper pizzas cost the same, each one must have cost $34 / 2 = $17. 


"
"Okay, so they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, which is 15 rides. Then they ride twice as much on two other days, so that's 3 times 2 = 6 rides each of those days.  That means they do 6 times 2 = 12 extra rides.  Adding those up, they ride a total of 15 + 12 = 27 times. 


**27** 
"
"Okay, so Bob starts with 3 orange and 4 white fish, making a total of 7.  He buys 17 more fish, and now he has twice as many orange as white.  

Let's say he bought 'w' white fish.  That means he bought 17 - 'w' orange fish.  

Since he has twice as many orange as white now, we can set up an equation:

17 - 'w' = 2 * 'w'

Solving for 'w':

17 = 3 * 'w'
'w' = 17 / 3
'w' = 5.67

Since you can't buy parts of fish, Bob must have bought **5** white fish. 




"
"Okay, so Andy's car gets 10 miles per gallon, and gas costs $3 a gallon.  He drives 5 miles to work and back each day, five days a week.

First, let's figure out how many miles he drives in a week: 5 miles a day * 5 days a week = 25 miles.

Then, we need to see how many gallons he uses: 25 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 2.5 gallons.

Finally, we multiply that by the price per gallon: 2.5 gallons * $3/gallon = $7.50


**Answer:** $7.50 
"
"Okay, so Carrie had $200 from the twenties (10 twenties x $20 each) and $35 from the quarters (140 quarters x $0.25 each).  She spent $120 from the twenties ( $200 x 3/5).  That means she spent a total of $120 + $35 = $155 on lunch. 


"
"Okay, so Ricardo has 5 tomato plants that each produce 22 tomatoes, so that's 5 * 22 = 110 tomatoes.  

He also has 8 eggplant plants that each produce 4 eggplants, so that's 8 * 4 = 32 eggplants.

In total, he'll get 110 + 32 = 142 fruits. 


"
"Okay, so Samwell sold 40 TVs total.  They sold 10 smart TVs (because one-fourth of the sales were smart TVs) and 5 analog TVs (one-eighth of the sales).  

That means they sold 10 + 5 = 15 smart and analog TVs.

To find out how many OLED TVs they sold, we subtract that number from the total: 40 - 15 = 25 OLED TVs. 


"
"Okay, so the trip costs $300 and the school is paying for half of it. That means they're covering $150.  John already has $50, so he still needs $150 - $50 = $100. 


"
"Okay, so the house needs to be at least 32 degrees to keep the pipes from freezing.  It's 45 degrees during the day, but 33 degrees colder at night.  That means it'll be 45 - 33 = 12 degrees at night.

To get to 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.  Since each log heats the house by 5 degrees, he'll need to burn 20 / 5 = 4 logs. 


"
"Okay, so there are 90 people split into groups of 9, which means there are 10 groups total.  Three-fifths of those groups brought back 2 seashells each.  That's (3/5) * 10 groups = 6 groups.  

Since 6 groups each brought back 2 seashells, they brought back a total of 6 * 2 = 12 seashells. 


"
"Okay, so the train starts with 172 people.  Then 47 get off, leaving 172 - 47 = 125.  After that, 13 more people get on, so there are 125 + 13 = 138 people.  Finally, 38 more people get off, leaving 138 - 38 = 100 people on the train. 



"
"Okay, so Damien finds 10 bottle caps every day and each one is worth $0.25.  That means he makes $2.50 each day (10 caps * $0.25/cap).

If there are 30 days in a month, he'd make $75.00 in a month ($2.50/day * 30 days). 


"
"Okay, so Jamie makes $20 an hour for her regular 8 hours.  That's $20 * 8 = $160.  

She worked 3 extra hours at 150% of her regular rate, which is $20 * 1.50 = $30 an hour.  

So her overtime pay is $30 * 3 = $90.

Adding that to her regular pay, she made a total of $160 + $90 = $250. 


"
"Okay, so there are 12 female lions and half as many male lions, which is 12 / 2 = 6.  Then you add the 14 cubs, so there are 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 lions in total. 


32 
"
"Okay, so Mike's jeans were originally $40 but are 25% off.  That means he saves $10 (25% of $40).  

The jeans cost $30 on sale, and since he pays with a $50 bill, he'll have $20 left over. 


"
"Okay, so the company starts with 200 employees and adds 20 more each month for three months.  That means after three months they have 200 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 260 employees.

Each employee makes $4000 a month, so they pay 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000  in total. 


"
"Okay, so they sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, which is 150 seconds each time, so that's 150 * 2 = 300 seconds.  Then they sing ""Jingle Bells"" once, which is 240 seconds.  Adding those together, 300 + 240 = 540 seconds. 


540 
"
"Okay, so Billy starts at $10 an hour, then gets a raise to $10.50 after two months, and then another raise to $11.50 after a year.  Sally starts at $10.50 an hour.  

If they both work 20 hours, Billy will make $11.50 x 20 = $230. Sally will make $10.50 x 20 = $210.

Billy will make $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally. 



**Answer:** $20 
"
"Okay, so a loaf of bread is $2 and a bagel is $1.  

Three loaves of bread would cost 3 times $2, which is $6.

Two bagels would cost 2 times $1, which is $2.

If you subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread, you get $6 - $2 = $4. 


**Answer:** $4 
"
"Okay, so Pierson scored 278 points. Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score.  

First, let's find half of Pierson's score: 278 / 2 = 139

Then, add 11 to that to find Nikita's score: 139 + 11 = 150

Finally, add Pierson's score and Nikita's score together: 278 + 150 = 428


Let me know if you have any other questions!
"
"Okay, so there are 40 classes with 25 students each, meaning there are 40 * 25 = 1000 students.  

There are also 3 teachers per class, so there are 40 * 3 = 120 teachers.

Each student plants one tree, so that's 1000 trees.  Each teacher plants two trees, so that's 120 * 2 = 240 trees.

In total, they'll plant 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees. 



"
"Okay, so Bubbles has 3 puppies + 5 koalas + 2 zebras + 4 frogs = 14 stuffed animals in total.  

She wants 30% of her collection to be goats.  To figure that out, we do 30/100 * 14 = 4.2.  

Since you can't buy parts of goats, she'd need to buy 5 goats. 




"
"Okay, so Kris plays for half an hour each day for two weeks, which is 14 days. That's 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours.

Then she plays for 2 hours a day for a week, which is 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

In total, she's played 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To get to 30 hours, she needs to play 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 more hours. 


**Answer: 9** 
"
"Okay, so the first car is going 60 miles per hour and the second car is going 70 miles per hour.  Since they're both driving for 2 hours, the first car will have traveled 60 * 2 = 120 miles. The second car will have traveled 70 * 2 = 140 miles.  

That means the second car is 140 - 120 = 20 miles ahead of the first car. 


**20** 
"
"Okay, so the diamond cost $600 and the gold cost $300, which means the materials together cost $900.  

He paid a 30% premium on top of that, so he paid 30% of $900 extra.  That's $270.

Adding that to the cost of the materials, he paid a total of $900 + $270 = $1170 for the ring. 


"
"Okay, here's how to figure out the overall pass rate:

* **Fifth grade:** Since the fifth grade pass rate was twice the fourth grade's, they had 40 * 2 = 80 students pass.
* **Total passes:**  340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 80 (fifth grade) = 460 students passed the test.
* **Overall pass rate:**  (460 students passed / 1000 total students) * 100% = 46%


46% 
"
"Okay, so Milo needs 12 chips per square inch for his mosaic.  He wants it to be 3 inches tall, which means he'll need 3 * 12 = 36 chips for the height.

He has 2 bags of chips, and each bag has 72 chips, so he has a total of 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

That leaves him with 144 - 36 = 108 chips for the length of the mosaic.

Since each inch needs 12 chips, he can make his mosaic 108 / 12 = 9 inches long. 



**Answer: 9** 
"
"Okay, so there were 10 quarts left after the party.  We know 4 students drank 1.5 quarts each, which is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. Then 16 students drank 2 quarts each, so they drank 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.  

In total, they drank 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.  

To find out how much was there at the beginning, we add the leftover tea: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Finally, there are 4 quarts in a gallon, so there were 48 / 4 = 12 gallons at the beginning. 



**Answer: 12** 
"
"Okay, so Dale started with 100 candies, sold 150, which is more than he had, so he's in the negative.  He then ordered 100 more, bringing his total to 50. To reach his goal of selling 150, he needs to sell 150 - 50 = 100 more candies. 


"
"Okay, so the student population doubles every month.  That means:

* January: 10 students * 2 = 20 students
* February: 20 students * 2 = 40 students
* March: 40 students * 2 = 80 students
* April: 80 students * 2 = 160 students
* May: 160 students * 2 = 320 students

There were 10 students to start, and by the end of May there are 320.  So, 320 - 10 = 310 more students joined. 


**Answer: 310** 
"
"Okay, so Felix made $105 all week from climbing trees.  He charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. To find out how many branches he climbed in total, we divide his total earnings by the price per branch: $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days: 420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches/day. 




"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Rose starts with 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals
* Then she adds 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals
* Next, she picks 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals
* And finally, 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals

That's a total of 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals before any get lost.

She drops one of each kind, so that's 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 petals gone.

So, there are 101 - 4 = 97 petals left in the vase. 



**Answer: 97** 
"
"Okay, so they started with 35 marshmallows and used 18 for their s'mores (9 each).  Then they lost 3 more.  That means they have 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.  Since they split the remaining marshmallows evenly, each kid can make 14 / 2 = 7 more s'mores. 


"
"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

* **Jack's playtime:** He plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Since he plays for 20 minutes per quarter, he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.
* **Worse friends' playtime:** They each play for half as long as Jack, so 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They play for the same amount of time as Jack, so they each use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters.  Since there are two of them, that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.
* **Better friend's playtime:** They play 1.5 times longer than Jack, so 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. They use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

* **Total quarters:**  Add up everyone's quarters: 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

* **Total money:**  68 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17.00



**Answer: $17.00**"
"Okay, so Tanya makes this salt scrub and wants to fill a 10-ounce jar.  She uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar.  She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.  

Let's think about this step-by-step.  If we let 'x' represent the amount of zest and fragrance, then salt and sugar are also 'x' ounces each. Since oil is twice the amount of salt, oil is 2x ounces.

The total in the jar has to be 10 ounces, so:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combining like terms, we get: 5x = 10

Dividing both sides by 5, we find x = 2.

That means oil is 2 * 2 = 4 ounces. 




"
"Okay, so John bought 3 goats at $500 each, which is 3 * $500 = $1500.  Then he bought 2 cows at $1500 each, so that's 2 * $1500 = $3000.  

To find the total, we add those together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500. 


4500 
"
"Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. He has 8 chocolate cupcakes + 40 toffee cupcakes = 48 cupcakes already.  

To find out how many more he needs, we subtract: 63 - 48 = 15 cupcakes.

"
"Okay, so Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20. That means Joe has 40 cars.  He sells 20% of his cars, which is 8 cars (40 times 0.20). Then he gives away twice the number he sold, so he gives away 16 cars (8 times 2).  In total, Joe gets rid of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.  That leaves him with 40 - 24 = 16 cars. 


**Answer:** 16 
"
"Okay, so they raised $175,000 total, and $50,000 of that came from organizations.  That means the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Since there are 20 students, each student raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250. 


"
"Okay, so Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.  The second day she walked half as long, which is 8 hours / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time, we add those two days together: 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.

Finally, we convert that to minutes: 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes. 


"
"Okay, so Hunter started with 50 cars, then 20 more came in, giving him a total of 70 cars.  At lunch, half the cars left, which is 70 / 2 = 35 cars. 


**35** 
"
"Okay, so John makes $1.20 for each task and he does 5 tasks per cycle. That means he makes $1.20 * 5 = $6.00 per cycle.  

Since he does 30 cycles a day, he makes $6.00 * 30 = $180.00 each day.

Over a week, he works 7 days so he makes $180.00 * 7 = $1260.00 


"
"Okay, so Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Julie scored 4 fewer than Sasha, so she scored 10 points.  

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie scored in the first game, which was 10. So Sasha scored 4 points in the second game.

To find Sasha's total score, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18 points.

"
"Okay, so Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food with 11 tins each, and 6 packages of dog food with 6 tins each.  

To find the difference, let's calculate how many tins of each she bought:

* Cat food tins: 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins
* Dog food tins: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

Finally, subtract the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins: 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins.


**Answer:** Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. 
"
"Okay, so here's how to solve this problem:

Let's say PJ has 'x' Magic Cards.  Smendrick has three times the amount PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get: 7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7: x = 47

So PJ has 47 cards.  

Now we can find out how many cards Becca has: 3x + 12 = (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.



Becca has 153 Magic Cards. 
"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* Cindy had 5 green eggs.
* She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.
* She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, meaning she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
*  Finally, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Adding up all the colors, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs in total. 


"
"Okay, so Milly has to pay to ship the book back.  That's gonna cost her $0.35 per pound times 4 pounds, which is $1.40. Plus, she has to pay $0.08 for every mile, and the book is 20 miles away, so that's $0.08 times 20 miles, which is $1.60.  

So the shipping costs her a total of $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Amazon is only giving her back 75% of the $32 she paid for the book, which is $32 times 0.75, or $24.00.

If you subtract the $24.00 refund from the $3.00 shipping cost, she loses $3.00 - $24.00 = $21.00. 




"
"Okay, so Mulan starts with $40 and gets $100 from her dad, giving her $140 total.  She spends $60 on jeans and $20 on a bag, which is a total of $80.  That means she has $140 - $80 = $60 left. 


"
"Okay, so Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars each month.  

* Week 1: He makes 8,000 bars.
* Week 2: He makes half of week 1, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
* Week 3: He makes three times week 1, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how many bars he makes in week 4, we need to figure out the total for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Finally, subtract that from his monthly total: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.


**Answer:** Boris makes 14,000 bars in week 4. 
"
"Okay, so Britany makes 18 TikToks a week, and each one is 4 minutes long. That's 18 times 4, which is 72 minutes of recording. 

She also spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is 2 times 60, or 120 minutes.  And she does her makeup for 15 minutes each day for six days, so that's 15 times 6, which is 90 minutes.

Adding all that up, she spends 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes on TikTok each week.

Since there are four weeks in a month, she spends 282 times 4, or 1128 minutes on TikTok each month. 


"
"Okay, so the base installation is $129.  

Angela needs 2 extra mirrors at $15 each, so that's 2 * $15 = $30.

She also needs 1 extra chandelier at $15, so that's another $15.

And she needs 10 extra pictures at $15 each, which is 10 * $15 = $150.

Adding all that up: $30 + $15 + $150 = $195 extra.

Finally, we add the base price: $195 + $129 = $324.




**Answer: $324.00** 
"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* Eva saved $20.00.
* Anthony saved $10.00 more than Eva, so he saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
* Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, which is 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00 more.
*  Roy's total savings are $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.




**Answer: Roy has $42.00.** 
"
"Okay, so let's break this down:

* Pompei can lift 1 inch.
* Saskay can lift 12 times that, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.
* Kagiyami can lift 4 times what Saskay can, meaning Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.
* Finally, Naruto can lift 10 times what Kagiyami can, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.

To get that into feet, we divide by 12 inches per foot: 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet. 




"
"Okay, so Mason bikes for 4 hours at 8 miles per hour, which means he covers 32 miles (8 x 4 = 32).  Then he takes a break and bikes another 6 hours, covering another 48 miles (8 x 6 = 48).  

In total, he bikes 80 miles (32 + 48 = 80). 


"
"Okay, so here's how to solve this:

* **Think about it this way:** If one kangaroo takes longer than four turtles to cross the highway, it means the turtles are slower.
* **We know:**  3 kangaroos take 18 hours.  That means one kangaroo takes 18 hours * 3 = 54 hours.
* **Since turtles are half as fast:** One turtle takes 54 hours * 2 = 108 hours.
* **Four turtles:**  Four turtles would take 108 hours/turtle * 4 turtles = 432 hours.



**Answer: 432** 
"
"Okay, so here's how to solve this problem:

* **Rory's dishes:** Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, who made 20. So Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
* **Jada's dishes:** Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, who made 40.  That means Jada made 40 * 2 = 80 dishes.
* **Total dishes:** To find the total, add up the number of dishes each person made: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.

"Okay, so Erika's new laptop will cost $400 after she trades in her old one.  She needs $50 more to buy it, and she already has $150 from her job and $80 from her mom.  

Let's see, $400 - $50 = $350.  Then, $350 - $150 - $80 = $120.


**Answer:** Erika has $120 in her purse. 
"
"Okay, so Adam has 3 large apples and 5 small apples.  

* Large apples give 5 slices each, so 3 large apples give 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
* Small apples give 3 slices each, so 5 small apples give 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

That means he has a total of 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

After eating 15, he has 30 - 15 = 15 slices left. 



"
"Okay, so the farmer gets 5 liters of milk from each cow, and he has 3 cows. That means he gets 5 * 3 = 15 liters of milk total.  

To get 25 liters, he needs 25 - 15 = 10 more liters.  

Since each cow gives 5 liters, he needs 10 / 5 = 2 more cows. 


"
"Okay, so Patrick has three glue sticks, and we need to figure out how much glue is left in each one.  

* The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so that's (1/6) * 12 mm = 2 mm of glue.
* The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so that's (2/3) * 12 mm = 8 mm of glue.
* The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so that's (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm of glue.

Adding all that up, we get 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm of glue left in total.

"
"Okay, so Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800. That means the stuff he wants costs a total of $10,800.  He has $5,000 from his weekend job and his brother gave him $200, so he has $5,200 saved up.  If he subtracts his savings from the total cost, he still needs $5,600.

"Okay, so Craig has $40 to start since he has two twenty dollar bills.  He spends $12 on squirt guns and $9 on water balloons, for a total of $21.  That means he has $40 - $21 = $19 left. 


"
"Okay, let's break this problem down:

* **Jack's socks:** Since Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, and he has 60 dishes, he must have 60 dishes / 2 = 30 socks.

* **Peter's socks:** Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so he has 30 socks * 2 = 60 socks.

* **Peter's dishes:** Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, meaning he has 60 dishes / 2 = 30 dishes.

* **Total socks:** Together, they have 30 socks + 60 socks = 90 socks.

* **Total dishes:** Together, they have 60 dishes + 30 dishes = 90 dishes.

* **Grand Total:**  In total, they have 90 socks + 90 dishes = 180 socks and dishes.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Start with the total:** There are 20 students.
* **Subtract those good at only one subject:** 5 are good at math only + 8 are good at English only = 13 students.
* **The rest are good at both:** 20 total students - 13 students (good at only one) = 7 students.

* **Add those good at both to the math-only group:** 5 students (math only) + 7 students (both) = 12 students.

"
"Okay, so the concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes.  We need to take away the 10 minute intermission, leaving 110 minutes.  Each group takes 10 minutes total (2 to get on, 6 to perform, and 2 to get off).  So, 110 minutes divided by 10 minutes per group means there's room for 11 groups. 


"
"Okay, so Brenda gets three-quarters of her money back each year as interest.  That means she earns $300 * (3/4) = $225 in interest every year.

Over three years, that's $225 * 3 = $675 in interest.

Adding that to her original $300, she'll have $300 + $675 = $975. 


"
"Okay, so there are 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.  Half the white shirts have collars, which means 20 white shirts have collars. That leaves 20 white shirts without collars.  

We know 20 floral shirts have buttons, so 30 floral shirts don't have buttons.

Finally, we need to find the difference between the floral shirts without buttons and the white shirts without collars: 30 - 20 = 10.




**Answer: 10** 
"
"Okay, so the farmer has 900 eggs and each tray holds 30 eggs.  That means he can fit 900 / 30 = 30 trays.

If he sells each tray for $2.50, he'll make 30 * $2.50 = $75.00 


"
"Okay, so Mr. Smith starts with 55 goats on Farm X and 45 on Farm Y.  He sells 10 from Farm X, which leaves him with 45 goats there.  He sells twice as many from Farm Y, so he sells 10 * 2 = 20 goats from Farm Y. That leaves him with 45 goats on Farm Y.  

Adding the goats from both farms, he has 45 + 25 = 70 goats left. 


"
"Okay, so James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month, which means he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes each year.  If he spends $2640 on shoes all year, that means each pair costs $2640 / 24 = $110. 


"
"Okay, so you're buying three baskets of green food and three baskets of red food.  

Each green basket costs $25, so three of them cost $75.  

Each red basket costs $18, but you get $2 off each one, so they cost $16 each. Three of those cost $48.

Adding those together, the total cost is $75 + $48 = $123. 


"
"Okay, so there are 90 rooms and it takes 20 minutes to clean each one.  To clean half the rooms, we'd clean 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

That means it would take 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes.

To figure out how many hours that is, we divide by 60 minutes per hour: 900 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 15 hours. 


"
"Okay, so they build 12 homes the first year.  Then they triple that amount the second year, which is 12 * 3 = 36 homes.  

That means after two years they've built a total of 12 + 36 = 48 homes.

Finally, they double the number of homes built in two years for the third year, so they build 48 * 2 = 96 homes.


**Answer:** 96 
"
"Okay, let's break this problem down.  

* Let's say my brother is 'b' years old.
* Since I'm three years younger than him, I'm 'b - 3' years old.
* I'm two years older than my sister, so she's 'b - 3 - 2' or 'b - 5' years old.
* Mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which is '3b - 1'.

*  Finally, the sum of all our ages is 87:  b + (b - 3) + (b - 5) + (3b - 1) = 87

Now we can solve for 'b':

* Combine like terms: 6b - 9 = 87
* Add 9 to both sides: 6b = 96
* Divide both sides by 6: b = 16

Since I'm 'b - 3' years old, I am 16 - 3 = 13 years old.

"
"Here's how to figure this out:

Mr. Jackson needs to buy enough glue sticks for 27 students, with each student needing 2 glue sticks.  That means he needs a total of 27 * 2 = 54 glue sticks.

Since each pack has 8 glue sticks, he'll need to buy 54 / 8 = 6.75 packs.  

Since he can't buy parts of packs, he'll need to round up to 7 packs to make sure all the students have enough glue sticks. 



"
"Okay, so the river starts with 4000 gallons of water flowing through it. After a big rainstorm, the amount doubles to 8000 gallons. Then, on the third day, another 6000 gallons are added.  To find the total amount of water flowing through the river on the third day, we just add that extra 6000 gallons to the amount from the second day: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons. 


"
"Okay, so we start with 10 people infected.  Each day, they each infect 6 more people.  

* **Day 1:** 10 people
* **Day 2:** 10 * 6 = 60 new infections, so there are 10 + 60 = 70 infected.
* **Day 3:** 70 * 6 = 420 new infections, so there are 70 + 420 = 490 infected.


There are **490** people infected after three days. 
"
"Okay, so Rafaela got $20 from each of the 40 customers, which means she made $20 * 40 = $800 in tips.  Julieta made 10% less than Rafaela, so she made $800 * 0.10 = $80 less. That means Julieta made $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.  Together, they made $800 + $720 = $1520. 


"
"Jennifer gave her three daughters a total of 6 oranges (3 daughters * 2 oranges each = 6 oranges).  Adding the 3 oranges she gave her son, she gave away 9 oranges in all (6 + 3 = 9).  That means she has 3 oranges left (12 - 9 = 3).

"Here's how to figure this out:

* Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year she'll earn 12 badges (12 months * 1 badge/month).
* Amber takes twice as long as Claire, meaning she earns 1 badge every 2 months.  Over a year, she'll earn 6 badges (12 months / 2 months/badge = 6 badges).
* Wendy earns three times the amount Claire does, so she earns 3 badges per month. In a year, she'll earn 36 badges (3 badges/month * 12 months).

* Finally, to find the difference, subtract Amber's badges from Wendy's: 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 badges.



**Answer:** Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year. 
"
"Okay, so Paige bakes 2 loaves of banana bread every hour, and each loaf has 8 slices.  That means she bakes 2 * 8 = 16 slices per hour.

She bakes for 5 hours, so she makes a total of 16 * 5 = 80 slices.

Since each slice sells for $0.50, she makes 80 * $0.50 = $40.00 


**Answer: $40.00** 
"
"Okay, so Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  If she has 70 gold coins, that means she has 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.

"
"Here's how to figure out the number of leftover burritos:

*  First, find out how many burritos the students ate: 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos
*  Add in the burritos Mr. George ate: 500 burritos + 20 burritos = 520 burritos
*  Finally, subtract the total burritos eaten from the initial amount: 600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos


80 
"
"Okay, so there are 12 red cars.  They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, meaning there are 10 green cars.  Then they have three times the number of blue cars as green cars, so there are 30 blue cars.  

Adding those up, we have 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 red, green, and blue cars.  

Since there are 75 cars total, there must be 75 - 52 = 23 yellow cars. 



"
"Okay, so here's how to solve this problem:

* Let's say Fawn has 'F' books.
* Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has 'F - 12' books.
* Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has 'F - 12 + 25' or 'F + 13' books.

* Together they have 85 books, so: F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

* Simplifying the equation: 3F + 1 = 85
* Subtracting 1 from both sides: 3F = 84
* Dividing both sides by 3: F = 28


Fawn has 28 books. 
"
"Okay, so Daisy bought 5 pounds of potatoes.  The sweet potatoes weighed twice as much, meaning they weighed 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.  The carrots weighed 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes, so they weighed 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. 


7 
"
"Okay, so Greg needs enough jello for 30 kids to have 4 cups each. That means he needs 30 * 4 = 120 jello cups.

Since each box makes 10 cups, he'll need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of jello.

If each box costs $1.25, the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.00. 


"
"Okay, so the seller bought 5 phones at $700 each, which means they spent 5 * $700 = $3500.  

If they paid with $4000, the seller would give them back $4000 - $3500 = $500 in change. 


"
"Okay, so Madeline and Keenan spend $400 on groceries each month.  Since Madeline pays 60% of that, she pays $400 * 0.60 = $240.  

That means Keenan pays $400 - $240 = $160.

If there are four weeks in a month, Keenan spends $160 / 4 = $40 each week.

"Okay, so Tobias ate 2/5 of the pizza on the first day, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 pieces.  

That leaves him with 60 - 24 = 36 pieces.

Then he eats 10 more on the second day, leaving 36 - 10 = 26 pieces.

Finally, he eats 7/13 of the remaining pizza on the third day, which is (7/13) * 26 = 14 pieces.

Adding up all the pieces he ate, we get 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.

"Okay, let's break this down:

* **Multiple Choice:** Amy gets 80% of 10 questions right, so she scores 8 points there (10 * 0.80 = 8).
* **True/False:** She gets 90% of 20 questions right, earning 18 points (20 * 0.90 = 18).
* **Long Answer:** She gets 60% of 5 questions right, which is 3 questions.  Since each long answer is worth 5 points, she gets 15 points here (3 * 5 = 15).

Adding those up, her total score is 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

"Okay, so Isaias wants to make a $2000 profit selling his chickens. He's selling each chicken for $50.  He has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. 

First, let's figure out how many chickens he's selling: 300 chickens * (3/5) = 180 chickens.

Then, we can calculate his total earnings: 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.

To find out how much he spent on the chickens, we subtract his profit: $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

"Okay, so Sarah sells her 20-meter rope for $2 per meter, which means she makes $40.  She then buys a new rope that costs $1.50 per meter, so a 20-meter rope will cost her $30.  If she subtracts the cost of the new rope from her earnings, she'll have $10 left over. 


"
"Okay, so Melanie will be 18 in 10 years.  That means she's 8 years old right now.  

We want to know when she'll be three times her current age, which is 24.  

If she's 8 now, and we add some years (let's call it 'x'), she'll be 8 + x years old.  We need to figure out what 'x' is so that 8 + x = 24.

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get x = 16. 


**Answer:** 16 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* First, the chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4.
*  The total cost of the chicken is 6 packs * $4/pack = $24.
*  A pack of apples costs half the price of strawberries, so they cost $4 / 2 = $2 each.
*  The total cost of the apples is 7 packs * $2/pack = $14.
*  The strawberries cost $4 per pack, so 3 packs cost 3 * $4 = $12.

*  Adding up everything, Kelly spends $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

*  Since her budget is $65, she has $65 - $60 = $5 left.




**Answer: 5** 
"
"Okay, so Elaina's final concert was 65 minutes long, and that included a 15-minute encore.  That means the concert itself was 65 - 15 = 50 minutes.

Since her final concert was twice as long as her usual concerts, her regular shows must be 50 / 2 = 25 minutes long. 


"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Start with the total toys Argo has:** 200
* **Add up the toys he gave away:** 40 + 80 + 30 = 150
* **Subtract the toys given away from the starting amount:** 200 - 150 = 50


Argo has 50 toys left. 
"
"Okay, so they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday and Wednesday, and twice that amount on Friday.  

That means they make 125 * 2 = 250 chimichangas on Friday.

Adding all the days together: 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 chimichangas. 


"
"Okay, so the singer has 50 microphones and wants to make pairs.  If 20% can't be paired, that means 20% of 50 is 10 microphones.  

That leaves 50 - 10 = 40 microphones that *can* be paired.

Since each pair has 2 microphones, he can make 40 / 2 = 20 pairs. 


"
"Okay, so Jerry sees 6 birds in the bushes.  Then he sees 2/3 of that number flying overhead, which is (2/3) * 6 = 4 birds.  

He also sees 3 groups of 8 birds each eating, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 birds.

Finally, to find the total number of birds, we add all those together: 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 birds. 


"
"Okay, so Lani baked 55 cookies and ate 5. That leaves her with 50 cookies.  She wants to put them into 5 jars evenly, so she'll put 50 / 5 = 10 cookies in each jar. 


10 
"
"Okay, so Joelle has 5 orchids with 5 petals each, which is a total of 25 petals.  Her 4 African daisies have 10 petals each, for a total of 40 petals.  

To find the difference, we subtract: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals. 


15 
"
"Okay, so Mrs. Smith has 100 plants.  A quarter of them are indoor plants, which is 25.  That leaves 75 plants outside.

Two-thirds of those outside plants are outdoor plants, so that's (2/3) * 75 = 50 plants.

That means 75 - 50 = 25 plants are flowering plants.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100%: (25/100) * 100% = 25% 


**25%** 
"
"Okay, so a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, and that's 11 times faster than a thingamabob.  To find the thingamabob's speed, we divide: 121 meters/second / 11 = 11 meters/second.

Then, a whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob, so we multiply: 11 meters/second * 5 = 55 meters/second. 


Let me know if you have any other brain teasers! 
"
"Okay, so Ellen spends $11 total on her food.  The salad is $6 and the yogurt is half that price, which is $3. That means the salad and yogurt together cost $6 + $3 = $9.  

Since she spends $11 total, the two carrots must cost $11 - $9 = $2.  

So each carrot costs $2 / 2 = $1. 


"
"Okay, so Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, which is 40 hours total.  

His raise means he now makes $12 an hour.  

To find out how much he makes a week, we multiply his hourly rate by the number of hours he works: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week. 


480 
"
"Okay, so Tasha made $80 total from lemonade and mowing.  She mowed Joe's lawn some number of times, and that's how much she made from Joe.  

* Kamala's lawn was three times the number of times Joe's, so that's 3 times Joe's amount.
* Alba's lawn was five times Joe's, so that's 5 times Joe's amount.

To figure out how much she made from mowing, we need to add up all the amounts:

* Joe: $6
* Kamala: $6 * 3 = $18
* Alba: $6 * 5 = $30

Total mowing money: $6 + $18 + $30 = $54

Finally, to find out how much she made from lemonade, we subtract the mowing money from her total earnings:

$80 - $54 = $26




**Answer:** Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales. 
"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* Martin weighs 55 kg.
* Carl weighs 16 kg more than Martin, so Carl weighs 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
* Christian weighs 8 kg more than Carl, meaning Christian weighs 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
* Harry weighs 5 kg less than Christian, so Harry weighs 79 - 5 = 74 kg. 


**Answer:** 74 kg 
"
"Okay, so John makes $25 an hour and rents his car out for 3 hours each time, 10 times a month.  

First, let's figure out how many hours he rents it out total: 10 rentals * 3 hours/rental = 30 hours.

Then, we can calculate his total earnings: 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Finally, subtract his car payment to find his profit: $750 - $500 = $250. 


"
"Okay, so Martha bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7.  That means she originally had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.  Joseph had 3 times as many as Martha, so he had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.  

Now Joseph has 6 - 2 = 4 more notebooks than Martha. 


"
"Okay, so Dijana rowed 50 miles, and Anis rowed 1/5 more than that.  To find out how much more Anis rowed, we do 50 miles * (1/5) = 10 miles.

That means Anis rowed a total of 50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles.

Together, they rowed 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles. 


"
"Okay, so Susan had 100 cookies and her husband ate 4, leaving her with 96 cookies.  If she wants to divide them equally among her 6 nephews, each nephew will get 16 cookies. 


"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.
* That means she read a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages.
* Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 today, for a total of 13 pages.

So, Denise read 28 - 13 = 15 more pages than Daniel. 


15 
"
"Okay, so Calvin has enough soup for four adults or eight kids.  His family has two kids and two adults. That means they'll use up all the soup at dinner.  There won't be any leftover for lunch. 


"
"Okay, so William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each, which costs him 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.  

Then he bought one ballpen for $0.50.  

Adding those together, he spent $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00 in total. 



"
"Okay, so Jo needs 2 yards of material for every 4 small masks and 2.25 yards for every 3 large masks.

First, let's figure out how much material she needs for the small masks: 20 small masks / 4 masks per 2 yards = 10 sets of 2 yards.  That means she needs 10 sets * 2 yards/set = 20 yards of material for the small masks.

Now for the large masks: 8 large masks / 3 masks per 2.25 yards = 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards.  So she needs 2.67 sets * 2.25 yards/set = 6 yards of material for the large masks.

Finally, add the material for both types of masks: 20 yards + 6 yards = 26 yards.


**Answer:** 26 yards 
"
"Okay, so she saw all 9 Fast and Furious movies three times, which means she saw them a total of 9 * 3 = 27 times.  If she spent $216 in total, that means each ticket cost $216 / 27 = $8. 


**8**"
"Okay, so Harold sleeps 10 hours, works 2 hours less than that, and walks his dog for an hour.  

Let's break it down:

* Work time: 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours
* Total time spent: 10 hours + 8 hours + 1 hour = 19 hours
* Free time: 24 hours - 19 hours = 5 hours 


Harold has **5** hours of free time.

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Red shoeboxes used:** Tim uses (1/3) * 9 = 3 red shoeboxes.
* **Red shoeboxes remaining:** Tim has 9 - 3 = 6 red shoeboxes left.
* **Blue shoeboxes remaining:** Tim has 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoeboxes left.

* **Total shoeboxes remaining:** Tim has 6 + 4 = 10 shoeboxes left. 


10 
"
"Okay, so Sarah has 9 books and Joseph has twice that amount.  That means Joseph starts with 9 * 2 = 18 books.  Then he loses 2, so he has 18 - 2 = 16 books left. 


16 
"
"Okay, so Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives away 1/5 of them to Jamie, which is the same as 6 marbles (30 / 5 = 6).  Then he gives 10 more to Donald.  

In total, he gave away 16 marbles (6 + 10 = 16).  

That means he has 14 marbles left (30 - 16 = 14). 



"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* Duncan is 60 now, so eight years ago he was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.
*  We know that 8 years ago, Duncan's age was twice Adam's age four years ago.  So, Adam's age four years ago was 52 / 2 = 26.
*  This means Adam is currently 26 + 4 = 30 years old.
*  In eight years, Adam will be 30 + 8 = 38 years old.

"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 200 acres. Farmer Smith has 100 acres *more* than twice the size of Brown's farm.  

Let's break that down: twice the size of Brown's farm is 200 * 2 = 400 acres.

Then Farmer Smith has 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Together, they have 200 + 500 = 700 acres. 


"
"Okay, so Colby makes $0.20 for each package he does.  He makes 10 fewer than 50 packages an hour, which is 40 packages.  That means he makes $0.20 * 40 = $8.00 per hour.  Since he works an 8 hour day, he makes $8.00 * 8 = $64.00. 


**Answer:** $64.00 
"
"Okay, so he drinks a bottle of water every half hour.  An extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal one, and a normal sudoku takes 45 minutes.  

That means an extreme sudoku takes 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes.

Since there are two 30-minute intervals in every hour, he drinks 180 minutes / 30 minutes/bottle = 6 bottles of water. 


"
"Here's how to solve this problem:

Let 'y' represent the number of yellow balloons.  We know:

*  20 red balloons * 2 bologna/red balloon = 40 bologna
*  y yellow balloons * 3 bologna/yellow balloon = 3y bologna
*  Total bologna = 40 + 3y = 58

Solving for 'y':

* 3y = 18
* y = 6


**Answer:** There were **6** yellow balloons. 
"
"Okay, so Jon drives 100 miles every day for a whole month, which is 30 days. That means he drives a total of 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.  

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, he'll need 3000 / 1000 = 3 tune-ups.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.
* On Wednesday, he works twice as long, so that's 5 hours * 2 = 10 hours.
* Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, meaning he works 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours.

Adding up all the hours, he works a total of 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours. 


"
"Okay, so Julia and Nadine pooled their allowance to get their dad a birthday surprise.  They bought a $11 cake, a dozen balloons for $3 (since they cost $0.50 for two), and two tubs of ice cream at $7 each, which is $14.  

Adding it all up, they spent $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.  Since they split the cost evenly, their mom must have given each of them $28 / 2 = $14. 



**Answer: $14.00**
"
"Kira has 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges, for a total of 14 pieces of fruit.  Lola eats 2 pieces, so there are 12 pieces of fruit left.

"Okay, so there are 6 kids playing tennis and twice that many playing volleyball, which is 12.  Then there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, for a total of 38 soccer players.  

Adding everyone up, we get 6 + 12 + 38 = 56 students. 


"
"Okay, so each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.80 each, and there are 30 students. That means they sold a total of 300 lollipops (30 x 10 = 300).  

They made $240 from selling all the lollipops (300 x $0.80 = $240).  

But they had to buy the lollipops for $0.50 each, so they spent $150 in total (300 x $0.50 = $150).

To find out how much money they made, we subtract the cost from the total sales: $240 - $150 = $90. 


**Answer:** $90 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Larry has 3 cats and 3 times as many dogs, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
* He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, meaning he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
* His fish tank holds 3 times the number of fish as rabbits, so there are 7 * 3 = 21 fish.
* Finally, he has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish, which is 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Adding up all his pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets. 



"
"Okay, so Abby eats 2 slices of bread a day and Josh eats twice as much, meaning he eats 4 slices a day.  Together they eat 6 slices a day (2 + 4).  Since the loaf has 24 slices, it will last them 4 days (24 / 6 = 4).

"Okay, so Lana has 27 cups total and uses 15 for cinnamon tea, leaving her with 27 - 15 = 12 cups for chamomile and mint.  

Since she divides the remaining cups evenly into 3 rows, each row has 12 / 3 = 4 cups of chamomile and mint tea.

Because she uses equal amounts of each, there are 4 / 2 = 2 cups of mint tea in each row. 


**2** 
"
"Okay, so the sloth takes 4 hours for each trip down the tree, getting berries, and back up.  If he wants 24 berries in 8 hours, that means he can make two trips.  To get 24 berries total in two trips, he needs to pick up 24 / 2 = 12 berries each time. 


12 
"
"Okay, so they take half the pool's water, which is 10,000 gallons / 2 = 5,000 gallons.  

Then they use 500 gallons each day for 6 days, so that's 500 * 6 = 3,000 gallons used.

Finally, they started with 5,000 gallons and used 3,000 gallons, leaving them with 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 gallons.

"
"Okay, so Colby has $150 for the month.  He already spent money on movies and snacks, so let's figure out how much he has left.

* He spent $50 on Friday/Saturday movies (5 movies * $10 each).
* He spent $56 on movies on other days (8 movies * $7 each).
* He spent $24 on popcorn and candy (2 tubs * $8 + 4 boxes * $2).

That means he spent a total of $130 ($50 + $56 + $24).

He has $20 left ($150 - $130).

Since Friday/Saturday movies cost $10 each, he can see 2 more movies  ($20 / $10). 



"
"Okay, so Andrew made 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins.  A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.  But the mini versions have 1/3 of the calories.

Let's figure out the calories per mini pastry:

* Mini cinnamon roll calories: 600 calories / 3 = 200 calories
* Mini blueberry muffin calories: 450 calories / 3 = 150 calories

Now, let's add up the total calories for each type:

* Total cinnamon roll calories: 200 mini rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories
* Total blueberry muffin calories: 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories

Finally, add those together to find the total calories for all the pastries:

* Total pastry calories: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories

"
"Okay, so Rita found 39 Junebugs on Monday.  She found twice that amount on Tuesday and Wednesday, which is 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs each day.  

That means she found a total of 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs all week.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60 Junebugs per day. 




"
"Okay, so the bus travels 60 miles an hour for 5 hours, which means it goes 60 * 5 = 300 miles.  

The car goes 30 miles an hour for 8 hours, so it travels 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went, we subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance: 300 - 240 = 60 miles. 


60 
"
"Okay, so Sophie had 31 blocks + 8 stuffed animals + 9 rings, which equals 48 toys.  Since she had 62 toys in total after getting the bouncy balls, there must have been 62 - 48 = 14 bouncy balls. 


14 
"
"Okay, so here's how to solve this problem:

* Let Peter's age be P
* Let Paul's age be Pa
* Let John's age be J

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100 
* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

Let's use substitution to figure out Peter's age:

1. Since Pa = J + 10, we can plug that into the equation P = Pa + J to get: P = (J + 10) + J  which simplifies to P = 2J + 10

2. Now we can plug both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3.  Combining like terms, we get: 4J + 20 = 100

4.  Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80

5.  Divide both sides by 4: J = 20

6.  Now that we know J = 20, we can plug it back into P = 2J + 10 to find Peter's age: P = (2 * 20) + 10

7.  Simplifying: P = 40 + 10 = 50



So Peter is 50 years old. 
"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

Maria's friends started with 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons.  

Adding Maria's balloon, they had 8 + 1 = 9 balloons.

Adding those to the original amount, they had 9 + 15 = 24 balloons. 



**24** 
"
"Okay, so they got 10 people donating 5 boxes each, which is 50 boxes total.  Then they add their own 10 boxes, making 60 boxes altogether.  Since each table holds 2 boxes, they need 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables.  They already have 15, so they need 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 new tables. 


"
"Okay, so Zoey spits 40 seeds, each going 10 feet, so she spits a total of 40 * 10 = 400 feet.  Sydney spits 35 seeds at 12 feet each, for a total of 35 * 12 = 420 feet.  

To find the average, we add those distances together (400 + 420 = 820 feet) and divide by the number of people (820 / 2 = 410 feet). 


**410** 
"
"Okay, so Fern wants to know how much more money she'd make with the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.  

Let's figure out how many widgets each makes in a day:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day

Now, let's see how much money each makes in a day:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** 1440 widgets/day * $6/widget = $8640/day
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** 1080 widgets/day * $6/widget = $6480/day

Finally, let's see how much more the Widgeteer 3000 makes in a month (30 days):

* **Widgeteer 3000:** $8640/day * 30 days/month = $259,200/month
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** $6480/day * 30 days/month = $194,400/month

The difference is: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

So Cameron stays for 17 hours total.  The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos, and then he pays extra for the remaining 5 hours.  Each extra hour is 70 pesos, so that's 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.  

That means his total cost is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

If he'd paid for the full 24 hours, it would have been 1600 pesos.

He saves 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos! 



"
"Okay, so each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.  Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount a goat needs, so that's (2 * 5) - 3 = 7 pounds of hay per sheep.

The total hay for the goats is 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.

The total hay for the sheep is 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

In total, Nate needs 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds of hay. 



"
"Okay, so John makes $50 an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = $300.  He spent $50 on gas and $50 on pencils, which leaves him with $300 - 50 - 50 = $200.  After putting $100 in the bank, he has $200 - 100 = $100 left.  Since each pen costs $25, he can buy $100 / $25 = 4 pens. 



"
"Okay, so Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, which is a total of 20 * 15 = 300 letters.  His brother spelled words with 50 more letters than Craig, meaning he spelled 300 + 50 = 350 letters.  

Together, they spelled a total of 300 + 350 = 650 letters. 


"
"Here's how to solve this:

* There are 7 rows of children.
* Each row has 8 children.

280 
"
"Okay, so the teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon gets her 100 bottles of apple juice. That means she has 9 * 100 = 900 bottles in total.  

She gives each of her 29 students 2 bottles, so she gives away 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

To find out how many bottles are left, we subtract the bottles she gave away from the total: 900 - 58 = 842 bottles. 


**Answer: 842** 
"
"Okay, so Patty charges $40 just to show up, then $35 for every hour she works.  The job took 2.25 hours, so that's 2.25 * $35 = $78.75 for labor.  

Then you add the cost of the parts, which was $60.  

Finally, $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75 


"
"Okay, so James spent $150 on 10 CDs, but got 40% off, which is a discount of $60. That means he paid $90 for all the CDs.  He then sold 5 of them for $40 each, making $200.  Since he spent $90 and made $200, he's actually up $110. 


"
"Okay, so Jen has 6 yams at $1.50 each, which is 6 * 1.50 = $9.00.  

Then she has 10 sweet potatoes at $2.00 each, so that's 10 * 2.00 = $20.00.

And finally, she has 4 carrots at $1.25 each, which is 4 * 1.25 = $5.00.

To find her total earnings, we add all that up: $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

"Okay, so James has to swim 20 miles across a lake. He swims at 2 miles per hour.  He swims 60% of the way, which is 12 miles. That takes him 6 hours (distance divided by speed).

Then he rests for half as long as it took him to swim that first 12 miles, so he rests for 3 hours.

After resting, he has 8 miles left to swim.  But he swims at half his normal speed, so he swims at 1 mile per hour. That means it takes him 8 hours to swim the rest of the way.

In total, it takes him 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours to get across the lake. 




"
"Okay, so the bakery has 40 fewer loaves than seven times the number Sam had.  Sam had 70 loaves, so seven times that is 7 * 70 = 490.  Then we subtract 40: 490 - 40 = 450.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Start with the initial amount:** Jasmine had 15 stickers.
* **Subtract the lost stickers:** She lost 7, so 15 - 7 = 8 stickers.
* **Add the new stickers:** Her teacher gave her 5 more, so 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.

"
"Okay, so Cayley gets 10% of $5 for each New York Times he sells, which is $0.50.  He sells 6 of those, so he makes $0.50 * 6 = $3.00 from the Times.

For the Wall Street Journal, he gets 8% of $15, which is $1.20 per paper.  Since he sells 10 of those, he makes $1.20 * 10 = $12.00.

In total, he makes $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00. 


"
"Okay, so Deanna is 26 and Marcus is 5 years younger than her, meaning Marcus is 21.  Since Marcus is half Leo's age, Leo must be 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

"Okay, so here's how to solve this:

* Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points.

* Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, so Bahati scored 'x + 20' points.

* Dinar scored 10 fewer points than Bahati, so Dinar scored 'x + 20 - 10' or 'x + 10' points.

*  Together, their scores add up to 45 points: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

*  Combine like terms: 3x + 30 = 45

*  Subtract 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

*  Divide both sides by 3: x = 5


**Azibo scored 5 points.**

"
"Okay, so Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups.  He has 2/3 as many spoons as cups, so he starts with 24 * (2/3) = 16 spoons.  After giving 6 away, he has 16 - 6 = 10 spoons left.  In total, he has 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils. 



"
"Okay, so the hospital has 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are full. That means 200 beds are taken up.  

Then, 50 new patients come in every day for two weeks, which is 14 days. So, over two weeks, 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 new patients.

Adding those new patients to the already occupied beds, we have 200 + 700 = 900 beds taken up.

That means there are 1000 - 900 = 100 beds left empty.

"Okay, so Robyn sends 16 emails a day and 7 of them are for work. That leaves 16 - 7 = 9 emails for other stuff.

Two-thirds of those 9 emails are to family, so that's (2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

That means there are 9 - 6 = 3 emails left for her boyfriend and other people.

Since one-third of those are to her boyfriend, she sends 1 email to him each day.

"Okay, let's break this down:

* We know Aliya is 3 years old.
* Shawna is three times older than Aliya, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.
* Shawna's father is five times older than Shawna, making him 5 * 9 = 45 years old.

"Okay, so Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert, but Kelly thinks she counted too many by 20%.  That means Courtney overestimated by 20% of 48, which is (20/100) * 48 = 9.6 people.  

To find the real number of people, we subtract that overestimate from Courtney's count: 48 - 9.6 = 38.4.  

Since we can't have parts of people, we round down to 38.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

Let's break it down:

*  Jason carried 2 balls.
*  Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.
*  Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey, meaning Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Adding up the number of balls each boy carried, we get 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

* They dug 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes in the first three days.
* They filled in 2 holes, so there were 31 - 2 = 29 holes.
*  The problem says there were four times as many holes at the end of the third day as there were at the end of the first day.  Let 'x' represent the number of holes at the end of the first day.

* We know 4x = 29  
* To find x, we divide both sides by 4: x = 7.25

*  Since we can't have parts of holes, this problem doesn't make sense. There's likely an error in the way it's worded. 





"
"Okay, so Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 15 more than them.  That means Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total, we add up the number of chips each person got: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 corn chips. 


"
"Okay, so Jen's supplies cost $400.  Travel costs 50% more than that, which means it costs an extra $200.  

To find the total travel cost, we add the extra cost to the original price: $400 + $200 = $600. 


**Answer:** $600 
"
"Okay, so here's how to solve this problem:

Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'W' Pokemon.  Stan caught 4 times that amount minus 13, so Stan caught (4W - 13) Pokemon.  Alex caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex caught (4W - 13) + 5 = (4W - 8) Pokemon.

Together they caught 339 Pokemon, so:

W + (4W - 13) + (4W - 8) = 339

Combining like terms:

9W - 21 = 339

Adding 21 to both sides:

9W = 360

Dividing both sides by 9:

W = 40

So Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon.  Stan caught 4 times that minus 13, so Stan caught (4 * 40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokemon.



**Answer:** Stan caught 147 Pokemon. 
"
"Okay, so each episode is 20 minutes and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.  

To find the number of episodes, we divide the minutes per episode by 2: 20 minutes / 2 = 10 episodes.

Then, to find the total watch time, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes. 


"
"Okay, so the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, which is 300 miles. Then it flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, covering 36 miles.  Finally, it flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, which is another 110 miles.

To find the total distance south, we add the first and third legs: 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles.

Since the bird flew north for a shorter distance, we subtract that from the total distance flown south: 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Nani is 8 years old.
* His brother is twice Nani's age, so he's 8 * 2 = 16 years old.
* Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she's 8 * 0.25 = 2 years younger. So she's 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

"Okay, so Andy has to restring 12 racquets.  

* He's restringing 3 with synthetic gut, which takes 15 minutes each, so that's 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.
* Then he's doing 5 with polyester, which takes 22 minutes each, so that's 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.
*  And finally, he's doing 4 hybrid racquets, which take 18 minutes each, so that's 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Adding all that up: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

"Okay, so he buys three phones at full price and one at half price.  

* The first two phones cost $600 each, so that's $600 * 2 = $1200.

"Here's how to figure this out:

First, find the total length of the fence he needs.  Since it's a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).  That's 2 * (15 feet + 10 feet) = 2 * 25 feet = 50 feet.

Then, he needs 2 slats for every foot of fencing, so he'll need 50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats.

"Okay, so Mrs. Harrington had 12 boxes of oranges with 20 oranges in each box, giving her a total of 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.  She gave away 4 boxes, leaving her with 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.  She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, which is 8 * 20 * (1/4) = 40 oranges.  That means she sold 240 - 40 = 200 oranges. 



"
"Okay, so the USA has 50 states. India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.  

First, let's find half the number of states in the USA: 50 / 2 = 25

Then, add 4 to that number: 25 + 4 = 29

Finally, add the number of states in India to the number of states in the USA: 50 + 29 = 79

So the total number of states in both countries is 79.

"Okay, so she needs an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside, and she'll be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days.  

That means she'll need sunscreen for a total of 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours.

Since each bottle has 8 ounces, she'll need 32 hours * 1 ounce/hour = 32 ounces of sunscreen.

To figure out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces by the ounces per bottle: 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

Adrianne's sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so she received 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice the amount her mother gave her, meaning she received 20 * 2 = 40 beads.

"Okay, so Pat needs to figure out how many more flowers she needs and how much that will cost. 

First, let's figure out how many inches of space her flower bed has: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.  She needs 1.5 feet of space between each plant, which is 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches.  So, the total space for the plants is 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

Now, each plant is 12 inches wide, so she can fit 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants. Since she can't have half a plant, she needs 110 plants.

She already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants.

Finally, each plant costs $6, so she'll spend 93 plants * $6/plant = $558.

"Okay, so they have 30 pounds of soil and need 1 pound per rose, 1.5 pounds per carnation, and 3 pounds per sunflower.  

First, let's figure out how much soil the sunflowers and carnations use:

* Sunflowers: 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
* Carnations: 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

That's a total of 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil used.

Now subtract that from the total soil to see how much is left for roses:

* 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Finally, divide the remaining soil by the amount needed per rose:

* 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses 



They can plant **3** roses.

"Okay, so Emily peels 6 shrimp every minute and cooks 30 in 10 minutes.  To figure out how long it takes to do 90 shrimp, let's break it down:

* **Peeling:** 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes
* **Cooking:** Since she cooks 30 shrimp every 10 minutes, she'll need 3 times that amount of time for 90 shrimp. So, 3 * 10 minutes = 30 minutes.

* **Total Time:** 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

"Okay, let's break this down:

*  The air conditioner cools 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high.
*  It runs on low for 3 hours, so that's 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees cooled.
*  Then it runs on high for 4 hours, cooling it another 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.
*  That's a total of 6 + 12 = 18 degrees cooled.
*  But, the room warms up 2 degrees per hour while the AC is off, and it's off for 2 hours, so that's 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees warmed.

* His dad was 30 when he saw it, and Bill saw it again when he was three times his dad's age, which is 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

* Since Halley's Comet comes around every 75 years, the time between Bill's two sightings is 75 years.

*  That means 90 (Bill's age the second time) - x (Bill's age the first time) = 75

*  Solving for x:  x = 90 - 75 = 15


Bill was **15** years old when he first saw Halley's Comet.

"Okay, so Doctor Jones works 9 hours at the clinic.  He spends 20 minutes per inpatient on rounds, and he has 9 inpatients, so that's 20 minutes/inpatient * 9 inpatients = 180 minutes on rounds.  

He also has 10 appointments that each take 30 minutes, so that's 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

In total, he spends 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes on rounds and appointments.  

Let's convert that to hours: 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

That means he has 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour left to update his records.

If there are 4 weeks in a month, they make $120 x 4 = $480 a month. 


"
"Okay, so Peter has 64 chocolate bars split evenly among 4 boxes, which means each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.  Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so each of her boxes has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.  

To find the difference, we subtract: 16 - 8 = 8.

"
"Okay, so there are 50 porcupines total, and 3/5 of them are female. That means there are 30 female porcupines.  Since each female has 4 babies a month, in a year (12 months) they'd have 4 babies/month * 12 months = 48 babies each.  

So, 30 females * 48 babies/female = 1440 babies born in a year.  

Adding those babies to the original 50 porcupines, we get 1440 + 50 = 1490 porcupines. 




"
"Okay, so the Smiths need to figure out how much it'll cost to fill their pool.  

First, they need to find the pool's volume.  It's 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep, so:

Volume = width x length x depth
Volume = 14 feet x 25 feet x 4 feet
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

The pool company says they need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

Gallons = Volume x 5.9
Gallons = 1400 cubic feet x 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Finally, it costs $0.10 per gallon to fill the pool, so:

Cost = Gallons x $0.10 per gallon
Cost = 8260 gallons x $0.10
Cost = $826.00

"
"Okay, so they have 9 red sticks and 5 more blue sticks than that.  That means there are 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.  Then there are 3 fewer yellow sticks than blue sticks, so there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.  

Adding all the colors together, they have 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks. 


"
"Okay, so Matteo drove 55 miles per hour for 4 hours.  To find out how far he went, we multiply: 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy drove 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she drove 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

To see how much farther Shandy drove, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.


**Answer: Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.** 
"
"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

*  Half the students are over 16, so that's 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
*  A quarter of those over 16 are male, meaning 1500 / 4 = 375 are boys.
*  That leaves 1500 - 375 = 1125 girls over 16.
*  The other half of the students are under 16, which is also 1500 students.
*  Half of those under 16 are boys, so 1500 / 2 = 750 boys.
*  That means there are 1500 - 750 = 750 girls under 16.
*  Finally, add up all the girls: 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls.



**Answer:** 1875 
"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* Bethany runs 10 laps.
* Trey runs 4 more laps than Bethany, so he runs 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
* Shaelyn runs half as many laps as Trey, meaning she runs 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
* Quinn runs 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so he runs 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Finally, to find the difference, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.


**Answer: Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Day 1:** Wanda pumps 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 gallons * (1/4) = 4500 gallons.  Ms. B pumps 3/4 of what Wanda pumps, so she pumps 4500 gallons * (3/4) = 3375 gallons. Together they pumped 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons.

* **Day 2:** Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she pumped on day 1, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of what she pumped on day 1, so she pumps 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons. Together they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons.

* **Total:** Over the two days, they pumped a total of 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

* **Remaining:**  Since the tank holds 18000 gallons, there are 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons left to fill it.




**Answer:** 6000 gallons 
"
"Okay, so here's how to solve this problem:

*  Let's say the power bank started with 100% charge.
*  It lost 9% of its charge for 5 hours, which is a total of 9 * 5 = 45%
*  This means it had 100 - 45 = 55% left.
*  Then it lost another 7% for 3 hours, which is 7 * 3 = 21%
*  So, the final charge is 55 - 21 = 34%

But we know the final charge was 28%, so we need to figure out what 100% was.

*  If 34% is equal to 28%, then 100% must be 28 / 0.34 = 82%




**Answer:** 82% 
"
"Okay, so Janet makes $10 an hour plus $15 an hour in tips, which means she makes $25 an hour total.  She wants to save up 20% for a down payment on a $10,000 car.  That means she needs to save $2,000.  

If she works 40 hours a week, she makes $1,000 each week.  To save $2,000, it will take her 2 weeks.

"
"Here's how to figure this out:

Anne had 15 packs of sweets with 60 pieces in each pack, so she had a total of 15 * 60 = 900 pieces.  She gave away all but 2 packs, which is 15 - 2 = 13 packs.  

Since she shared with 10 friends, each friend got 900 pieces / 10 friends = 90 pieces.

"
"Okay, so the price of carrots goes up by 5% each year.  

* **Year 1:** A 5% increase on $120 is $6 (because 0.05 * $120 = $6).  So the carrots cost $126.
* **Year 2:**  A 5% increase on $126 is $6.30.  Now they cost $132.30.
* **Year 3:** A 5% increase on $132.30 is $6.615.  Rounded to the nearest dollar, that means the carrots cost about $139.

"
"Okay, so Olivia put 72 pictures into 8 albums, which means each album has 72 / 8 = 9 pictures.  

She had 3 albums of selfies, so that's 3 * 9 = 27 selfies.  

And she had 2 albums of portraits, so that's 2 * 9 = 18 portraits.

In total, she had 27 + 18 = 45 selfies and portraits. 


"
"Okay, so James reads 3 pages every 10 minutes.  If he reads 18 pages, we can figure out how many times he reads 3 pages: 18 pages / 3 pages/group = 6 groups.

Since each group takes 10 minutes, he spends 6 groups * 10 minutes/group = 60 minutes reading. 


60 
"
"Okay, so the hotel started with 100 guests.  24 checked out early and 15 checked out late, so that's 24 + 15 = 39 guests gone.  

Then, twice as many people checked in as those who checked out late, which is 15 * 2 = 30 people.

That means there were 100 - 39 + 30 = 91 guests.

And then 7 more people checked in after dinner, so now there are 91 + 7 = 98 guests. 




"
"Okay, so John gets 4 bananas on Wednesday and 6 on Thursday, that's 4 + 6 = 10 bananas.  Then on Friday he picks three times the amount from Wednesday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 bananas.  Adding those up, he has a total of 10 + 12 = 22 bananas. 


"
"Okay, so there are 60 questions total.  40% of those are easy, which is 24 questions. That means there are 36 questions that are average or difficult.  Since those are split evenly, there are 18 of each.

Aries gets 75% of the easy questions right, so that's 24 * 0.75 = 18 questions.  She gets half of the average and difficult questions right, so that's 18 * 0.5 = 9 questions right for each of those types.

In total, she gets 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right. 


"
"Okay, so Teresa sells big stuffed animals for three times the price of the small ones.  We know a small one costs $4, so a big one costs $12.  

Let's say she sold 'x' number of big stuffed animals. That means she sold twice as many small ones, or 2x small stuffed animals.

Her earnings from the small ones would be 2x * $4 = $8x.

Her earnings from the big ones would be x * $12 = $12x.

Together, her earnings are $8x + $12x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get $20x = $120.

To find out how many big stuffed animals she sold (x), we divide both sides by 20: x = 6.

Since she sold twice as many small ones, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals. 




"
"Okay, so the man eats 5 sandwiches a day, his wife eats 4, and their son eats 2.  

To find the total they eat each day, we add those up: 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches.

"Okay, let's break this down.

* A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day with their bare hands.
* With an iron pickaxe, they mine twice as much, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
* A steel pickaxe lets them mine 50% more than the iron pickaxe, which is 24 * 0.50 = 12 more pounds.  That means they mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.
*  With 40 dwarves using steel pickaxes, they mine a total of 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore each day.
*  Over a month of 30 days, they mine 1440 * 30 = 43,200 pounds of ore.



**Answer:** 43,200 pounds

* **Red balloons:** Sally starts with 25 red balloons and loses 40%, which is 0.40 * 25 = 10 balloons.  That leaves her with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.
* **Yellow balloons:** She starts with 12 yellow balloons and lets go of half, or 12 / 2 = 6 balloons.  She has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.
* **Blue balloons:** She finds 8 blue balloons and adds 75% of them to her collection, which is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

* **Total:**  In the end, Sally has 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 balloons.

"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

* There's a 50% chance the sub won't collect homework, so that's like a free pass right there.
*  Even if the regular teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.
*  That means there's a 60% chance she'll actually want the homework done.
*  But wait, there's more! Even if no one gets an extension, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing the teacher his dog ate it.

So, basically, we need to figure out the chances he *doesn't* get out of doing it.  

*  It's 50% chance of no homework at all.
*  Then, there's a 60% chance the teacher wants it, but a 20% chance he can talk his way out of it.

Let's see... that means there's a 60% * 80% chance he has to do it.

* 60% * 80% = 48%

"Okay, so Melissa gets paid $15 a day for jury duty and has to pay $3 for parking each day.  That means she makes $15 - $3 = $12 each day after parking.

Since she does jury duty for 3 days, she makes a total of $12 * 3 = $36.

She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, which is a total of 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

So, her pay per hour is $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

"Okay, so Jim got $50,000 in loans each year for 4 years of college, which is $200,000 total.  He also lost out on making $25,000 a year for those 4 years, so that's another $100,000.  

That means he needs to make back $300,000 total ($200,000 + $100,000).  

His degree tripled his pay, so he now makes $75,000 a year.  

To figure out how long it takes to make back the money, we divide the total amount ($300,000) by his new yearly pay ($75,000).  

That means it will take him 4 years to pay back everything. 



"
"Okay, so Jim needs two pieces of fabric.  First, let's figure out how big each piece needs to be.  The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, and each piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider.  

That means each piece will be 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.

To find the area of each piece, we multiply length times width: 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

Since he needs two pieces, the total fabric he needs is 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

* **Wednesday:** They delivered 5 more than twice Tuesday's amount, so first find twice Tuesday's deliveries (102 * 2 = 204). Then add 5 (204 + 5 = 209).

* **Total:**  Add up the deliveries from all three days: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.

* **Xavier's new height:** He was 4 feet tall, which is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.  Adding his 3 inches of growth, he's now 48 + 3 = 51 inches tall.
* **Cole's new height:** He started at 50 inches and grew 2 inches, so he's now 50 + 2 = 52 inches tall.
* **The difference:** Cole is 52 - 51 = 1 inch taller than Xavier.

"Okay, so here's how to solve this problem:

Let's say the first person gets  'x' dollars.  

* The second person gets x + $80.
* The third person gets 2 * (x + $80) 

Since they split the whole $1920, we can write the equation:

x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920

Now, let's solve for x:

x + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920
4x + $240 = $1920
4x = $1680
x = $420


So the first person gets $420. 
"
"Okay, so they worked for 3/8 of a day each day for 3 weeks.  First, let's figure out how many days that is: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Then, we need to figure out the total time they worked.  Multiply the number of days by the fraction of a day they worked each day: 21 days * (3/8 day/day) = 7.875 days.

Now, let's convert that to hours.  There are 8 hours in a day, so: 7.875 days * 8 hours/day = 63 hours total.

Finally, divide the total hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked: 63 hours / 4 painters = 15.75 hours/painter. 




"
"Okay, so Rory got 19 tennis balls total.  Let's say he got 'x' balls in the second set.  The first set he got 'x + 4' balls, and the third set he got 'x / 2' balls.  

That means: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combining like terms, we get: 2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtracting 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15

Dividing both sides by 2.5: x = 6

So, Rory got 6 balls in the second set.  In the first set, he got 6 + 4 = 10 balls.

"
"Okay, so the car started at $20,000 and loses 21% of its value each year.  

* **Year 2008:**  21% of $20,000 is $4200, so the car is worth $20,000 - $4200 = $15,800.

* **Year 2009:** 21% of $15,800 is $3318, so the car is worth $15,800 - $3318 = $12,482.

* **Year 2010:** 21% of $12,482 is $2622.62, so the car is worth $12,482 - $2622.62 = $9859.38

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Romeo starts with 120 people on the train.
* At the first stop, 20 more people get on, so there are 120 + 20 = 140 people.
* At the second stop, 50 people get off, leaving 140 - 50 = 90 people.
* Then, twice the number of people who got off (50 * 2 = 100) get on, so there are 90 + 100 = 190 people.

"
"Okay, so James's insurance went up 60% because of his accident.  That means it cost 60% more than the normal $120 a month.  

To find out how much more he pays, we do 60% of $120, which is (60/100) * $120 = $72.

So his new monthly cost is $120 + $72 = $192.

Finally, to find his yearly cost, we multiply that by 12 months: $192 * 12 = $2304. 


"
"Okay, so Greg does laundry for 5 beds every week.  His washer can only handle 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time. That means he does 5 loads of laundry every week.

"
"Okay, so they had 4 pizzas with 8 slices each, meaning there were 4 * 8 = 32 slices total.  Becky ate 10 slices, and Jake ate 3 less than her, so he ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices. Silvia ate twice as many as Jake, so she ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.  Adding those up, they ate a total of 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices. 


"
"Okay, so Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan.  Let's say Donovan cooked for 'x' minutes. That means Betsy cooked for 'x + 18' minutes.  

Together, they cooked for 98 minutes, so:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtracting 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 40

So Donovan cooked for 40 minutes.  Betsy cooked for 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"
"Okay, so James gets 80 emails a day and 20% of them don't need a reply. That means he gets 80 * 0.20 = 16 emails that he doesn't have to answer.  

That leaves him with 80 - 16 = 64 emails to respond to each day.

Over a five day work week, he'd answer 64 * 5 = 320 emails. 


"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* **Tuesday:** Twice the amount from Monday means 32 classes * 2 = 64 classes.
* **Wednesday:** Three times Monday's amount is 32 classes * 3 = 96 classes.
* **Total:** Add up all the days: 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247 classes

So, a total of 247 classes visited the Science Center last week. 


"
"Okay, so he got 100 on three tests and an 80 on the fourth.  To find the average, we add up all the scores (100+100+100+80 = 380) and then divide by the total number of tests (380 / 4 = 95).

"
"Okay, so the glee club ate 70% of their 20 pizzas, which is 14 pizzas. That leaves them with 6.  

The football team ordered double the amount, so they had 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of those, which is 32 pizzas.  That means they have 8 left.

Together, they have 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas left. 


"
"Okay, so Anthony needs to mail 700 small coupons and twice that many big coupons.  That means he's mailing 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

Small coupons cost 5 cents each, so 700 of them cost 700 * $0.05 = $35.00 to mail.

Big coupons cost 15 cents each, so 1400 of them cost 1400 * $0.15 = $210.00 to mail.

In total, he spends $35.00 + $210.00 = $245.00 on postage. 



"
"Okay, let's break this problem down:

* Sidney ordered 7 meatball subs (10 - 3 = 7).
* That means there were initially 28 meatballs (7 * 4 = 28).
* After Mark ate 4 subs, there were 12 meatballs left (28 - 16 = 12).
* Sidney then ordered 3 more subs, adding another 12 meatballs (3 * 4 = 12).
*  In total, there were 24 meatballs remaining (12 + 12 = 24).

"
"Okay, so Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks carrying 20 tons of fertilizer each. That means he had a total of 20 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 400 tons of fertilizer to deliver.

Then, a quarter of the trucks broke down, which is 20 trucks / 4 = 5 trucks.  

That means 20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks made it to the farmers.

So, 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons of fertilizer reached the farmers. 


**Answer: 300** 
"
"Okay, so Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter total.  Since he gets half off on one pound for every pound he buys, he'll end up paying full price for 3 pounds and half price for 3 pounds.  

That means he'll spend $4.00 x 3 = $12.00 on the full-price butter.  

And he'll spend $4.00 x 3 / 2 = $6.00 on the discounted butter.

Adding those together, the total cost is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00 



**18.00**
"
"Okay, so Kayla's party has a base cost of $125.  Then, for each guest beyond the first 20, it costs $6.  She's inviting 25 classmates + 7 dance friends + 13 family members, which is a total of 45 guests. That means 25 guests are over the initial 20.  

So, the extra guests cost $6 x 25 = $150.

Adding that to the base cost, the party will be $125 + $150 = $275. 




"
"Okay, so Maggie spent a quarter of her $60, which is $15. That leaves her with $45.  Riza spent one-third of her $60, which is $20. She has $40 left.  Together, they have $45 + $40 = $85.

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Monkey 2's bananas:** The second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas a day.
* **Monkeys 1 & 2's total:** Together, they eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas a day.
* **Monkey 3's bananas:** Since there are 3 monkeys and they eat all 315 bananas in a week, the third monkey eats the rest.  That means the third monkey eats 315 - (24 * 7) = 3 bananas a day.

"
"Okay, so Jenny buys 15 roses.  Since a dozen is 12 roses, she buys a little more than a full dozen.  

* A dozen roses costs $15, so 15 roses would cost a bit more than that.  Let's figure out exactly how much more: 15 roses / 12 roses per dozen = 1.25 dozens.  That means she buys 1 and a quarter dozens.  So, 1.25 dozens * $15 per dozen = $18.75.

* Jenny pays with five $5 bills, which is $25 total.

*  To find her change, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid: $25 - $18.75 = $6.25.

* Finally, to figure out how many quarters she gets back, we divide her change by the value of a quarter: $6.25 / $0.25 per quarter = 25 quarters.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Terry makes $5.50 x 6 = $33.00 from the milkshakes.
* He makes $11 x 9 = $99.00 from the burger platters.
* And he makes $1.50 x 20 = $30.00 from the sodas.

Adding it all up, he makes a total of $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00

"Okay, let's figure this out step-by-step:

* **Train 1:**  Arrives in 10 minutes and sticks around for 20 minutes.
* **Train 2:**  Shows up 30 minutes after Train 1 departs (10 + 20 = 30 minutes) and only stays for 5 minutes (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
* **Train 3:**  Pulls in an hour after Train 2 leaves (30 + 5 = 35 minutes) but zooms right out again!
* **Train 4:**  Paul's train arrives 20 minutes after Train 3 takes off (35 + 20 = 55 minutes).

So, Paul has to wait 55 minutes. 


"
"Okay, so Melanie needs 200 toothpicks and she's saved 120 so far (10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120).  That means she still needs 80 more toothpicks (200 - 120 = 80).  

If she keeps saving 10 toothpicks a week, it'll take her 8 more weeks to get the rest (80 / 10 = 8). 


"
"Okay, so the watch originally cost $2000, but Mr. Rogers got it for 75% of that price.  That means he paid $1500. Then he sold it to his friend for 120% of what he paid.  So, his friend paid $1800.

To find out the discount, we need to see how much less his friend paid compared to the original price.  That's $2000 - $1800 = $200.

Finally, to find the discount percentage, we divide the discount amount by the original price and multiply by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%. 


**10%** 
"
"Okay, so we have 5 springs making one jellyfish every second.  

First, let's figure out how many jellyfish one spring makes in an hour: there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.  

That means one spring makes 3600 jellyfish in an hour.

With 5 springs, they'd make 3600 * 5 = 18,000 jellyfish in an hour.

Over 4 hours, they'd make 18,000 * 4 = 72,000 jellyfish. 



"
"Okay, so Frankie's score was 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

"
"Okay, so Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence total, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.  Let's say Sam gets 'x' feet. That means Harry gets 'x + 60' feet.

Together, they have:  x + (x + 60) = 100

Simplifying the equation: 2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides: 2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2: x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 


"
"Okay, so the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years.  To figure out how much it grows in 13 years, we need to see how much it grows each year.  

That's 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Then, we multiply that by 13 years to find the total growth: 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, a BMX bike costs half as much as an MTB, so it's $500 / 2 = $250.

Then, half the bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so Marcel sold 300 bikes / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

He sold 15% BMX bikes, which is 300 bikes * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

That means he sold 300 bikes - 150 bikes - 45 bikes = 105 MTB bikes.

Now let's calculate his earnings:

* Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
* BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
* MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

Finally, add up all the earnings: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250


**Answer:** Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bikes that month. 
"
"Okay, so the farmer makes 5 bales of hay every hour and the truck takes away 3 bales every hour.  

Over a 6 hour day, the farmer makes 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales.

And the truck takes away 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales.

That means there are 30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales left in the field. 


12 
"
"Okay, so John has 6 periods a day, but he takes 2 extra classes that are each 40 minutes long. That's 80 extra minutes of class time each day.  

So, he spends 6 periods * 40 minutes/period = 240 minutes in his regular classes plus 80 minutes for his extra classes, for a total of 320 minutes in class each day.

Over 5 days, that's 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes.

He also spends 1/16 of his total weekly class time on Saturday and Sunday for extra learning, which is 1600 minutes / 16 = 100 minutes each day.

So, he spends an extra 100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes on the weekend.

In total, he spends 1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes learning each week.

That's 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours a week. 



"
"Okay, so the ball starts at 72 feet high (3 floors * 24 feet per floor).  Each bounce it goes to 2/3 of its previous height.  

The first bounce is (2/3) * 72 feet = 48 feet.

The second bounce is (2/3) * 48 feet = 32 feet. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.
* The second child is 2 inches taller than the first, so they are 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.
* The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second, making them 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.
* Finally, the fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third, so they are 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

"Okay, so they sold 2000 apples and each bag has 10 apples.  That means they sold 200 bags of apples (2000 / 10 = 200).  

Since each bag costs $5, they made $1000 total (200 * $5 = $1000). 


"
"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

*  Let's say the triceratops weighed 'x' kilograms to start.

* The T-Rex ate half, leaving x/2 kilograms.

* Then the velociraptors ate half of *that*, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4 kilograms.

*  That means 270 kilograms was all that was left for the Allosaurus.

*  We can set up an equation: x/2 - x/4 = 270

*  Combining the terms on the left side, we get x/4 = 270

*  Multiplying both sides by 4, we find the original weight of the triceratops: x = 1080 kilograms.




**Answer: 1080** 
"
"Okay, so Tony's painting a room with four walls.  The long walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, and the shorter walls are 5 feet by 8 feet.  

First, let's find the area of each wall:

* Long walls: 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet each
* Short walls: 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet each

Then, add up the area of all the walls:

* Total area: (80 square feet * 2) + (40 square feet * 2) = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet

One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so Tony needs 240 square feet / 20 square feet/gallon = 12 gallons of paint.

Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost will be 12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144.

"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

* There are 2 sodas left that Ellen shook up.
* Her friend has to pick from 8 total sodas.

So, the chance of picking a shaken soda is 2 out of 8, which is 1/4.

To turn that into a percentage, we multiply by 100%: (1/4) * 100% = 25% 



**25%**"
"Okay, so we have two trains going in opposite directions.  One is going 60 miles an hour, and the other is going half that speed, which is 30 miles an hour.  

After 3 hours, the faster train will have traveled 60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles.

The slower train will have traveled 30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles.

Since they're going in opposite directions, we add those distances together to find the total distance between them: 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles. 



"
"Okay, so Billy helps 2 people every hour and works 3 hours a day, which means he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people each day.  

There are 31 days in March and 19 days in April, for a total of 31 + 19 = 50 days.  He takes 20% of those days off, so he's off for 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

That means he works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Over those 40 days, he helps 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

"
"Okay, so the biggest slide is 300 feet long and people go down at 60 feet per minute.  That means it takes 300 / 60 = 5 minutes to slide down.

The second slide is 240 feet long and people go down at 80 feet per minute, so it takes 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.

The biggest slide takes 5 minutes and the second one takes 3 minutes, so the difference is 5 - 3 = 2 minutes.

"
"Okay, so Bobby takes a 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks every day.  That's 30 + (15 * 2) = 60 minutes of break time each day.

Over five days, that's 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes.

To convert that to hours, we divide by 60: 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours. 


"
"Okay, here's how to solve the problem:

First, find out how many miles Micah ran.  Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran, so Micah ran 3.5 * 8 miles = 28 miles.

Next, find the total distance Amber and Micah ran together: 8 miles + 28 miles = 36 miles.

Finally, subtract the distance Amber and Micah ran from the total distance to find how far Ahito ran: 52 miles - 36 miles = 16 miles.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, Sheila's balance is reduced by $15 when she returns something: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Then, she buys a frying pan that's 20% off $20.00.  That means she saves $4.00 (20% of $20). So the frying pan costs $16.00.

Next, she buys a set of towels that are 10% off $30.00. That's a discount of $3.00 (10% of $30). The towels cost $27.00.

Finally, she adds the frying pan ($16.00) and the towels ($27.00) to her balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

"Okay, so Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and wants to cut it into 4 equal parts, then each of those parts into 5 more equal parts.  

To find the length of each final piece, we can think about it like this:

* First, divide the total ribbon by 4: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per big part.
* Then, divide each of those big parts by 5: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final piece.


So the answer is **5 centimeters**. 
"
"Okay, so if 40% of the school is made up of 240 boys, we can figure out the total number of students.  

Think of it like this: 40% is the same as 40 out of every 100 students.  

So, we can set up a proportion: 40/100 = 240/x  (where x is the total number of students).

Cross-multiplying gives us: 40 * x = 100 * 240

Simplifying: 40x = 24000

Divide both sides by 40 to find x: x = 600 students

That means there are 600 students in total.  

Since 240 are boys, there must be 600 - 240 = 360 girls.

Another two workers make 4 toys each per hour, so together they make 8 toys an hour (2 * 4 = 8). Over 10 hours, they make 80 toys (8 * 10 = 80).

That means the first four workers made a total of 200 toys (120 + 80 = 200).

To make the remaining 220 toys (420 - 200 = 220), the fifth worker must make 22 toys per hour (220 / 10 = 22).

"Okay, so Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.  Elijah's first dog is one-fourth that weight, which is 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.  Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.  

The total weight of Elijah's dogs is 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Adding Kory's dog's weight, the total weight of all the dogs is 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Work backwards:**  We know Rob got 7 stickers, and Kris gave him those.  This means Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.
* **Keep going:** Kris got half of Luis's stickers, so Luis must have had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.
* **Find Seth's total:** Luis got half of Seth's stickers, so Seth originally had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.



**Answer: 64** 
"
"Okay, so John has 3 bags of M&Ms that each weigh 10 ounces.  That means he has a total of 3 * 10 = 30 ounces of M&Ms.

Since each ounce has 30 M&Ms, he has 30 ounces * 30 M&Ms/ounce = 900 M&Ms.

If he puts 10 M&Ms in each small bag, he can make 900 M&Ms / 10 M&Ms/bag = 90 bags. 



"
"Okay, so Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day.  We need to figure out how many days it takes him to fly half way around the Earth, which is half of 40,000 kilometers.

Half the Earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

To find out how many days it takes Alfie, we divide the total distance by his daily flight: 20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers/day = 50 days. 


**Answer: 50 days**

"Okay, so the fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the second fastest, and the second fastest was 5 times faster than the average car.  The average car goes 120 mph.  

Let's break it down:

* **Second fastest car:** 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph
* **Fastest car:** 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph 


**Answer:** 750 mph 
"
"Okay, so Liam is 16 now, and we know he was twice Vince's age two years ago.  That means Liam was 14 two years ago (16 - 2 = 14).  

If Liam was 14 and that was twice Vince's age, Vince must have been 7 two years ago (14 / 2 = 7).

So now Vince is 9 years old (7 + 2 = 9). 


"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

Let's break it down:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted each.
*  Together they painted 2x eggs.
*  Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs in total, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  Let Sarah's eggs be 'y'. That means Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.
*  We know y + (y + 12) = 30
*  Combining like terms: 2y + 12 = 30
*  Subtracting 12 from both sides: 2y = 18
*  Dividing both sides by 2: y = 9 (Sarah painted 9 eggs)
*  Camden painted y + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
*  We also know that 2x + 30 = 56 (total eggs painted)
*  Subtracting 30 from both sides: 2x = 26
*  Dividing both sides by 2: x = 13 (Arnold painted 13 eggs)
*  Finally, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.




**Answer: 8** 
"
"Okay, so Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them in boxes of 8.  That means he'll need 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and he's using 25 boxes, so the boxes themselves weigh 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces.

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and he has 200 crayons, so the crayons weigh 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces.

The total weight of everything is 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds. 




"
"Okay, so John cuts down an 80-foot tree and can use 80% of it, which is 64 feet.  He cuts that into 4-foot logs, giving him 16 logs.  Each log makes 5 planks, so he has 80 planks in total.  If he sells each plank for $1.20, he'll make 80 planks * $1.20/plank = $96.00. 


"
"Okay, so Valerie makes $5000 a month, and that's half of what her brother makes.  To find her brother's salary, we double Valerie's amount: $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

Then, we add their salaries together: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Their mom makes twice their combined salary, so we multiply that by 2: $15,000 * 2 = $30,000.

Finally, we add up all their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"Okay, here's how to solve this problem:

* **Figure out Grandma's beach speed:** She walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, so her speed there is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

* **Calculate her sidewalk speed:** She walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, meaning her speed there is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

* **Find the time spent on the sidewalk:**  She walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at 0.1 miles per minute, so it takes her 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

* **Add up the times:** Her total walk time is 40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes.

"Okay, so Donny needs his water to be at least 40 degrees.  He mixes some 33-degree water with some hotter water.  

Let's think about it:

* He puts 4 ounces of the 33-degree water in his bottle. That's 4 * 33 = 132 degrees.
* He also adds 1 ounce of the hotter water.

To make the total mixture at least 40 degrees, the total temperature needs to be at least 40 * 5 = 200 degrees.

So, the hotter water needs to make up the difference: 200 - 132 = 68 degrees.



**Answer:** The second bottle is at least 68 degrees. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Cows:**  The farm starts with 50 cows and gets 20 more each day for 3 weeks (21 days total). So that's 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows added.  That means there are 50 + 420 = 470 cows.
* **Chickens:**  They start with 20 chickens and get 10 more each day for 21 days. That's 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens added.  So there are 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.
* **Total:**  Adding the cows and chickens, there are 470 + 230 = 700 animals on the farm. 



Let me know if you have any other animal farm problems! 
"
"Okay, so Russell buys 4 packs of bagels, and each pack has 9 bagels. That means he gets 4 * 9 = 36 bagels in total.  

The packs cost $10 each, so before the discount, he's spending 4 * $10 = $40.  

He gets a 10% discount, which is $40 * 0.10 = $4 off.  

So, he pays $40 - $4 = $36 for all the bagels.

Finally, to find the price per bagel, we divide the total cost by the number of bagels: $36 / 36 = $1 per bagel.

"Okay, let's break this problem down. 

First, Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Then, we know it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes (which is 3 potatoes) to make 1 less than 3 scoops (which is 2 scoops) of mashed potatoes.  That means it takes 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Finally, to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we multiply the number of scoops he ate by the number of potatoes per scoop: 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

"Okay, so Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, which is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs. Then he bumps it up to 5 eggs a day for another 30 days, so that's 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.  

In total, he eats 90 + 150 = 240 eggs over the 60 days.  

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, he'll need 240 / 12 = 20 dozens of eggs. 



"
"Okay, so there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red ones, meaning there are 34 red jellybeans.  That's a total of 17 + 34 = 51 green and red jellybeans.  Since there are 60 jellybeans in all, there must be 60 - 51 = 9 blue jellybeans.

"Okay, so Faraday makes $2 per sunflower and $8 per bouquet of 12 sunflowers.  

* He sells 26 dollars worth of individual sunflowers, so he sold 26 / 2 = 13 sunflowers.
* He sells 56 dollars worth of bouquets, so he sold 56 / 8 = 7 bouquets.
* That means he sold 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers in bouquets.
* In total, he sold 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers each day.
* Over three days, he sold 97 * 3 = 291 sunflowers.

"Okay, so Linus bought 2 phones for $20 each on Monday, so he spent 2 * $20 = $40. He sold them for twice the price, so each phone sold for $20 * 2 = $40. That means he made a profit of $40 - $20 = $20 per phone, and a total of $20 * 2 = $40 on Monday.

Then on Tuesday, he bought 4 phones for $20 each, spending $20 * 4 = $80. He sold them for $40 each, making a profit of $40 - $20 = $20 per phone.  That's a total profit of $20 * 4 = $80 for Tuesday.

If we want to figure out how many more bottles they need to make to give 100% of the energy 2300 people need, we can do this:

* **Figure out how many bottles one person needs:** Since each bottle gives 20% of the energy, one person needs 100% / 20% = 5 bottles.
* **Figure out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people:**  That's 2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles.
* **Figure out how many more bottles Hortex needs to make:**  They need to make 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 more bottles.

Out of the purple babies, 1/3 wear bows, so that's 6 * (1/3) = 2 babies.  

All the blue babies wear bows, so that's another 2 babies.

That means there are 2 + 2 = 4 babies wearing bows.

Out of those 4, 2 are purple. So, 2/4 * 100% = 50% of the babies wearing bows are wearing purple.

"Okay, so Abraham has 80 square meters of land.  He sells half of it for $50 a piece, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. That brings him 40 * $50 = $2000.

Then he sells another quarter of the land he has left, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. Since he sold half first, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.  He makes $30 for those 20 square meters.

Finally, he sells the rest of the land for $3 per square meter. That's 40 - 20 = 20 square meters * $3 = $60.

"Okay, so we've got three ropes: red, blue, and yellow.  Here's what we know:

* The red rope is four times as long as the blue rope.
* The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
* All three ropes together are 37 centimeters long.

Let's use some variables to make this easier:

* Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is '4(y - 7)' centimeters long.

Now we can set up an equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Let's solve for 'y':

* y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
* 6y - 35 = 37
* 6y = 72
* y = 12

So the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.  Now we can find the length of the red rope:

* Red rope = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20


The red rope is 20 centimeters long.

"Okay, so Ronnie got $5 and Rissa got three times that, which is $15.  They both gave the same amount to their sister. Let's say they each gave 'x' dollars.

Rissa had $15 and gave away 'x', leaving her with $15 - x. We know this is equal to 4/5 of her original amount, so:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying that:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides:

-x = -3

Multiplying both sides by -1:

x = $3

So they each gave $3 to their sister.  Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, leaving him with $2.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of fixed teeth by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100%: (15 / 30) * 100% = 50% 


50%

"Okay, so Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk at $3.50 per gallon, which means he spent 4000 * 3.50 = $14,000.  

He had to return 2/5 of the milk, which is (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons.  

Since the milk cost $3.50 per gallon, the returned milk cost him 1600 * 3.50 = $5600.

So Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600. 


"
"Okay, so here's how to solve this problem:

Let's say Wendy is 'w' years old and Colin is 'c' years old.

*  We know Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years:  w = 5(c + 7)
*  We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.  Let's solve the first equation for 'w':

w = 5c + 35

Now substitute that value of 'w' into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for 'c':

3c + 75 = 5c + 35
40 = 2c
c = 20


Colin is 20 years old. 
"
"Okay, so Bob has $27,000 to spend on books for 3 different schools.  He can get 100 books for $500.  

First, let's figure out how many sets of 100 books he can buy: $27,000 / $500 = 54 sets.

That means he can buy 54 * 100 = 5400 books in total.

To find out how many books each school gets, we divide the total books by the number of schools: 5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school. 



**Answer:** 1800

"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Start:** Newton has 2 apples.
* **First throw:** He throws one apple back, and 5 more fall, giving him 2 + 5 = 7 apples.
* **Second throw:** He throws one away, and 6 more fall, giving him 7 + 6 = 13 apples.
* **Final count:** He picks up all the remaining apples, so he has 13 apples.


Newton brought **13** apples home. 
"
"Okay, so Ali needs 850 kilos of coal and each bag has 50 kilos.  To find out how many bags he needs, we divide: 850 / 50 = 17 bags.

Each bag costs $18, so the total cost is 17 * $18 = $306. 


"
"Okay, so each cheese pizza has 12 slices and each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices.  If each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 cheese slices and 4 pepperoni slices, that means they'll eat a total of 36 cheese slices and 24 pepperoni slices.  

To figure out how many pizzas Kate needs, we divide the total slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:

* Cheese pizzas: 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas
* Pepperoni pizzas: 24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas

So Kate needs to buy a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

"Okay, so Jay makes 20 snowballs an hour but loses 2 every 15 minutes.  That means he loses 8 snowballs every hour (2 snowballs * 4 sets of 15 minutes = 8 snowballs).  

He's left with a net gain of 12 snowballs per hour (20 snowballs - 8 snowballs = 12 snowballs).

To get to 60 snowballs, it'll take him 5 hours (60 snowballs / 12 snowballs/hour = 5 hours).

"Okay, let's break this problem down:

* **Day 1:** They used 38 bandages and got a new pack of 50, so they had 38 + 50 = 88 bandages.
* **Day 2:** They used 10 fewer than day 1, meaning they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
* **Day 3:** They used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25) and got two new packs (2 * 50 = 100), so they had 25 + 100 = 125 bandages used that day.
* **Total Used:** Over the three days, they used 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages.
* **Starting Amount:** Since they had 78 left at the end of day 3, they must have started with 91 + 78 = 169 bandages.




**Answer:** 169 
"
"Okay, so May's haircut cost $30 per inch and her hair was 10 inches long at first and 8 inches long after the cut. That means she cut off 2 inches of hair (10 - 8 = 2).  

The haircut cost 2 inches * $30/inch = $60.

Adding the $40 for coloring, her total cost was $60 + $40 = $100. 


"
"Okay, so Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, which is 45 hours a week.  

Her hourly rate is $1.50, so she makes 45 hours * $1.50/hour = $67.50 a week.

Since April has 4 weeks, she'll make $67.50/week * 4 weeks = $270 for the month.

Plus, she gets an extra $10 for perfect attendance, so she'll make a total of $270 + $10 = $280. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Dishwasher:** He emptied it 6 times at $0.50 each, so that's 6 * $0.50 = $3.00
* **Laundry:** He did his laundry once for $3.00.
* **Trash:** He took out the trash twice at $0.75 each, so that's 2 * $0.75 = $1.50
* **Cleaning:** He cleaned his room once for $1.50.

Adding it all up: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00

"Okay, let's break this down:

*  First, 40 more people came in at 10:00, so that's 50 + 40 = 90 people total so far.
*  Then, twice that amount came in for lunch, which is 40 * 2 = 80 people.
*  Adding those to the previous total, we have 90 + 80 = 170 people.
*  Finally, three times the original amount from the morning came in later, which is 50 * 3 = 150 people.
*  Adding that last group, the total number of people who came to the restaurant is 170 + 150 = 320 people.



**Answer: 320** 
"
"Okay, so Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and twice that amount of black pens.  Since each pack has 5 pens, she bought 5 * 2 = 10 packs of black pens.  That means she has 10 * 5 = 50 black pens.  

She also has 5 * 5 = 25 red pens.

In total, Alain has 50 + 25 = 75 pens. 


"
"Okay, so John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600, which means each bottle costs $60.  He then buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.  Cognac costs 50% more than scotch, so each bottle costs $60 * 1.50 = $90.  The cognac costs 20 * $90 = $1800.  

In total, John spends $600 + $1800 = $2400. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* **Day 1:** Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice that amount of Lodgepole Pine, so he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

* **Day 2:** He planted 10 more White Oak trees than day 1, for a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.  He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine than day 1, which is (1/4) * 40 = 10 more trees.  So he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on day 2.

* **Total:** Over the two days, he planted 20 + 30 = 50 White Oak trees and 40 + 50 = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees.

"Okay, so Amy starts with 2 palettes of 4 colors each, which is 8 colors.  Then she has 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's 18 more colors.  That means she has a total of 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister takes one palette, which has 4 colors, so Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 colors left.

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which is 6 colors / 2 = 3 colors.

That means she has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"Okay, so Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times his height, making it 60 * 7 = 420 inches tall.  The first floor is three times his height, so it's 60 * 3 = 180 inches high.  

That means the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches from the ground.  

The roof height from the second floor is then 240 - 180 = 60 inches.

"
"Okay, so Bernie has four dogs.  We know three of them need to walk a total of 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.  Since all four dogs need to walk an average of 3 miles each, that means they need a total of 3 * 4 = 12 miles.  

To find out how much the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles the other dogs walk: 12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles. 


"
"Okay, so John's house is worth $250,000 and he gets a loan for 40% of that, which is $100,000.  He uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts, so he uses $60,000.  That means he has $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000 left over.

"Okay, so Deandre caught three tunas.  The first one weighed 56 kilograms, the second 46 kilograms, and the last one 26 kilograms.  

To find out how much money he'll make, we need to figure out the total weight of all the fish.  That's 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

Since each kilogram sells for $0.50, he'll make 128 * $0.50 = $64.00

"Okay, so Trinity sells the magazines for 11/8 of what she paid for them.  That means she sells them for a little more than what she bought them for.

If she bought them for $72, and sells them for 11/8 of that, we can calculate the selling price:

$72 * (11/8) = $99

To find her profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

$99 - $72 = $27

"Okay, so Brian's dehumidifier has three settings: low, medium, and high.  

* On low, it removes 1 liter of water per day.
* On medium, it removes twice as much as low, so 1 liter * 2 = 2 liters per day.
* On high, it removes twice as much as medium, so 2 liters * 2 = 4 liters per day.

He used it for:

* 3 days on low: 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters
* 3 days on medium: 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters
* 5 days on high: 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Adding it all up: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters

"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

* **Find the jar's volume:**  It's a cube, so 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.
* **Account for packing efficiency:** They say they pack it 80% full, so that's 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches of actual jelly bean space.
* **Figure out how many jelly beans fit:** Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, so 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.
* **Estimate the red jelly beans:** Tim thinks 30% are red, so 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.
* **See how far off he was:**  The actual number is 900, so 864 - 900 = -36.


He was off by 36 too low.

* At the first stop, 40 more people get on, making a total of 20 + 40 = 60 people.
* At the second stop, 3/4 of the people from the first stop (which is 30 people) get on, so now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people.
* The number of people doubles at the third stop, meaning there are 90 * 2 = 180 people on the bus.
*  Since the bus holds 200 people, there are 200 - 180 = 20 empty seats.

"Okay, so Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year and it costs $2 per visit.  

For the first 5 years, she goes 3 times a year * 5 years = 15 times. That costs her 15 times * $2/visit = $30.

Then the price goes up by 150%, which is like adding another $2 to the price, so it becomes $5 per visit.

For the next 3 years, she still goes 3 times a year, so that's 3 times a year * 3 years = 9 visits.

That costs her 9 visits * $5/visit = $45.

In total, she spends $30 + $45 = $75 at the museum.

"Here's how to figure that out:

First, we need to determine how many groups of students will need to go through the escape room.  Since there are 30 students and each group can have 8, we'll have 30 / 8 = 3.75 groups.  

Since we can't have parts of groups, we round up to 4 groups.

Finally, with each group taking 45 minutes, the total time will be 4 groups * 45 minutes/group = 180 minutes.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

Let 'x' be the length of the shorter piece.  The longer piece is four times the length of the shorter piece, so it's 4x.  

Together, the two pieces make up the whole board, which is 40 feet long.  This means:

x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms:

5x = 40

Dividing both sides by 5:

x = 8

The longer piece is 4x, so it's 4 * 8 = 32 feet long.

"
"Okay, so the first 16 minutes cost $0.25 each, which is 16 * $0.25 = $4.00.  

Then, the rest of the minutes cost $0.20 each, so the next 20 minutes cost 20 * $0.20 = $4.00.

Adding those together, the whole call costs $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

"Okay, so Carly needs to make 10 treats total since there are 5 people in her class and each person gets 2.  Let's say she made 'c' cupcakes.  That means she made 3c - 2 brownies (three times the number of cupcakes minus 2).  

Setting up an equation, we get: c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combining like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Adding 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Finally, dividing both sides by 4: c = 3


Carly made **3** cupcakes. 
"
"Okay, so a manicure is $35 and a pedicure is $40, and she wants both.  That's $35 + $40 = $75.  But they give her 20% off for doing both, so that's $75 * 0.20 = $15 off.  

So the manicure and pedicure together cost $75 - $15 = $60.

Then she wants nail art on all ten fingers, and that's $3 per nail, so that's 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, add that to the cost of the manicure and pedicure: $60 + $30 = $90. 



"
"Okay, so Susan gets 3 magazines that each have 12 issues a year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 issues.  Then she has one magazine with 6 issues, and another that has 4 times that amount, so 6 * 4 = 24 issues.  Adding all those up, she gets 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 magazines a year.

Kim has 31 paintings. 
"
"Okay, so the toy cost $40 in November.  Then it went up by 80% in December, which means it increased by $32 (80% of $40).  That makes the price in December $72.

In January, the price dropped by 50%, which is half of $72, or $36.  

So the final price in January was $36. 



"
"Okay, so Charlie makes $80 for each regular lesson and he has 4 of those. That's 4 times $80, which is $320.  

He gives a 25% discount to veterans, so he makes $80 - ($80 * 0.25) = $60 for each veteran lesson.  He has 2 veteran lessons, so he makes 2 times $60, which is $120.

To find his total earnings, we add his regular lesson money and his veteran lesson money: $320 + $120 = $440. 



"
"Okay, so to find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her quiz scores and then divide by the total number of quizzes.

First, Walter eats 2/5 of his 60 apples, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples.  That leaves him with 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

Next, he gives his sister 25% of the remaining apples, which is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples.

This leaves him with 36 - 9 = 27 apples to sell to his uncle.

Since each apple sells for $3, he makes 27 * $3 = $81.

Let 'x' represent the number of novels she wrote this year.  We can solve for x:

(3/4) * x = 9

Multiply both sides by (4/3) to isolate x:

x = 9 * (4/3)

x = 12

"
"Okay, so Bud spends $1.00 on pasta, $3.00 on cheddar, and twice that on gruyere, which is $6.00.  

That means his cheese costs a total of $9.00, and with the pasta, his weekly mac and cheese cost is $10.00.

Over a year, that's $10.00 a week times 52 weeks, so he spends $520.00 on mac and cheese each year. 


"
"Okay, so the custodian has to clean 80 classrooms and it takes 15 minutes per classroom. That means they'll spend 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes cleaning.  

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 1200 / 60 = 20 hours of cleaning total.

They work an 8 hour day, so they spend 20 / 8 = 2.5 times their workday cleaning.

To turn that into a percentage, we multiply by 100%: 2.5 * 100% = 250%

"Okay, so Elly has 110 books and needs to figure out how many bookcases she needs.  

* The middle shelves each hold 10 books, so together they hold 10 * 2 = 20 books.
* The bottom shelf holds twice as many as a middle shelf, meaning it holds 10 * 2 = 20 books.
* The top shelf holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it holds 20 - 5 = 15 books.
*  In total, each bookcase can hold 20 + 10 + 10 + 15 = 55 books.
*  To fit all her books, Elly needs 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.

"Okay, so Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, and each dozen cost $2.40. That means she spent 5 * $2.40 = $12.00 in total.

She's selling the eggs in sets of 3 for $1 each.  Since she has 5 dozens, that's 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.  She can sell them in 60 / 3 = 20 sets.

That means she'll make 20 * $1 = $20.00 from selling the eggs.

Her profit is her earnings minus her expenses, so $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00. 


**Answer: $8.00** 
"
"Okay, so Skyler has 100 hats and half are red, which means he has 50 red hats.  That leaves 50 hats that aren't red.  

Three-fifths of those remaining hats are blue, so he has (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

That means there are 50 - 30 = 20 white hats. 


**Answer:** 20 
"
"Okay, so Archie gets a bag of jerky with 30 sticks for $18, but it's on sale for $3 off.  That means he pays $15 for the whole bag.  To find out how much each stick costs, we divide the total price by the number of sticks: $15 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick.  

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, that means each stick costs 50 cents. 


"
"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Total Questions:** Audrey has 70 questions on the first test + 40 on the second, for a total of 110 questions.
* **Passing Percentage:** She needs to get 70% of those questions right, which means she needs 110 * 0.70 = 77 correct answers.
* **First Test Score:** She got 60% of the first test right, so she answered 70 * 0.60 = 42 questions correctly.
* **Second Test Needed:** To reach 77 total correct answers, she needs 77 - 42 = 35 questions correct on the second test.

"
"Okay, so Mary makes strawberry ice cubes and blueberry ice cubes.  She makes 5 times as many blueberry cubes as strawberry cubes, but also subtracts 4 from that number.  

Let's say she makes 's' strawberry cubes.  That means she makes 5s - 4 blueberry cubes.  

Together, they make 116 ice cubes, so:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combining like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Dividing both sides by 6:

s = 20

So, she makes 20 strawberry cubes.  Now we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Blueberry cubes = 5 * 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96


**Answer:** Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes. 
"
"Okay, so Ara's been playing basketball for 4 years and scores 21 points per game.  If she plays 40 games each year, that means she's played a total of 4 * 40 = 160 games.  

To find her total points, we multiply the number of games by her points per game: 160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points. 


"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* Brendan starts with 10 marbles.
* He drops half, which is 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
* He finds 3 marbles after dropping them.
*  That means he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
*  He then finds out one of them is a bead, so he's left with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

"
"Okay, so Jason needs to sell 15 cars.  He knows that for every 25 calls he makes, one person comes to the dealership.  And then, for every 2 people who come to the dealership, one buys a car.

So first, we need to figure out how many people he needs to get to the dealership. Since 1 out of every 2 people who come in buys a car, he needs twice as many people to come in as cars he wants to sell. That means he needs 15 cars * 2 = 30 people to come to the dealership.

Now, to figure out how many calls he needs to make, we know he gets 1 person to come in for every 25 calls. So he needs to make 30 people * 25 calls/person = 750 calls.



**Answer:** 750 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* They have 4 flashlights, one for each person.
* Half the rooms get small candles (4 rooms), and the other half get medium candles (also 4 rooms).
* That means they have 16 small candles (4 rooms * 4 candles/room) and 20 medium candles (4 rooms * 5 candles/room).
*  In total, they have 4 flashlights + 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 40 light sources.

"Mitchell has 2 bags of chips with 55 chips in each bag, so he has a total of 110 chips.  If he's sharing with 5 family members, each person gets 22 chips. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

* The second and third sides take twice as long as the first, so they each take 5 minutes * 2 = 10 minutes.
* The last two sides take half as long as the first, so they each take 5 minutes / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Adding it all up: 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes. 



**30**
"
"Okay, so there are 20 helmets.  Since there are half as many robots as helmets, there are 20 / 2 = 10 robots.  And there are twice as many footballs as helmets, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.  

Adding those up, there are 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 items in total. 


"
"Okay, so Tim works 6 hours a day, and each call takes 15 minutes.  That means he has 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes to answer calls each day.  

Then, he can answer 360 minutes / 15 minutes/call = 24 calls each day.

Over a 5 day week, he answers 24 calls/day * 5 days/week = 120 calls. 


"
"Okay, so Louise needs to varnish 6 paintings.  

With the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes per painting, so that's 6 * 7 = 42 minutes total.

With the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes per painting, so that's 6 * 12 = 72 minutes total.

The new varnish takes 72 - 42 = 30 more minutes.

"Okay, so Crista has 20 plants.  

* 4 need half a cup of water, so that's 4 * (1/2) = 2 cups.
* 8 need a full cup, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups.
* The rest (20 - 4 - 8 = 8) need a quarter cup, so that's 8 * (1/4) = 2 cups.

Adding it all up: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups

"Okay, so Phineas has to travel 200 yards back home.  He spends half the time on land and half in water.  

* On land, he moves 20 yards per minute.
* In water, he moves 10 yards per minute.

Since he travels the same distance on land and in water, let's figure out how long it takes him for each part:

* **Land:** 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes
* **Water:** 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

Finally, add those times together: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.



**Answer:** 15 minutes 
"
"Okay, so Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box has 8.  That means he'll need 56 / 8 = 7 boxes.  

Since each box costs $2.00, the total cost will be 7 * $2.00 = $14.00 


"
"Okay, so the main phone is twice as expensive as the other phones.  If the main phone is $20, that means each of the other phones costs $20 / 2 = $10.

There are four other phones, so they cost a total of $10 * 4 = $40.

Adding the cost of the main phone, the whole plan costs $20 + $40 = $60. 


"
"Okay, so Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts a day, and a dozen has 12 doughnuts. That means he makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts each day.  

If he sells each doughnut for $2, he makes 120 * $2 = $240 per day.

June has 30 days, so he makes $240 * 30 = $7200 in June. 


"
"Okay, so Jade takes 210 pictures and wants to upload them to Instagram in batches of 7.  She uploads 6 batches each day.  

First, let's figure out how many pictures she uploads each day: 7 pictures/batch * 6 batches/day = 42 pictures/day

Then, to find out how many days it takes to upload all the pictures, we divide the total pictures by the number of pictures uploaded each day: 210 pictures / 42 pictures/day = 5 days. 



**Answer: 5 days** 
"
"Okay, so Alicia spends $5 on each blouse, $6 on the skirt, and $8 on each pair of pants.  

*  Blouses: 5 blouses * $5/blouse = $25
*  Pants: 2 pants * $8/pant = $16
*  Skirt: 1 skirt * $6/skirt = $6

That means each week she spends $25 + $16 + $6 = $47 at the dry cleaners.

Over 5 weeks, that's $47/week * 5 weeks = $235. 



"
"Okay, so John's speaking speed goes from 150 words per minute to 2.5 times that, which is 375 words per minute.  

He needs to speak 10 pages with 450 words each, so that's a total of 4500 words (10 pages * 450 words/page).

To find out how long it takes, we divide the total words by his new speaking speed: 4500 words / 375 words/minute = 12 minutes. 



**Answer:** 12 minutes 
"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* **Day 1:** 50 people
* **Day 2:** 50 + 20 = 70 people
* **Day 3:** 70 * 2 = 140 people
* **Days 4-7:** 60 people/day * 4 days = 240 people
* **Total:** 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400 people


So the answer is **400**. 
"
"Okay, let's break this popcorn problem down:

*  The first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
*  The next 30 seconds, three times the first amount pop, so 20 * 3 = 60 kernels.
*  The next 30 seconds, four times the first amount pop, so 20 * 4 = 80 kernels.
*  The last 30 seconds, half the amount from the previous 30 seconds pop, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
*  Finally, a quarter of the last 30 seconds' amount pops from leftover heat: 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Adding all those up: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels! 


"
"Okay, so Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.  He's making 5 gallons total (4 for the party + 1 for Allen).  Since he gets 1 cup of juice from 6 lemons, he'll need 5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.  

Allen wants his lemonade to be twice as tart, so Tim needs to use double the lemon juice for that gallon. That means he'll need 1 gallon * 1 cup/gallon * 6 lemons/cup * 2 = 12 lemons for Allen's batch.

In total, Tim needs 30 lemons + 12 lemons = 42 lemons. 




"
"Okay, so there are 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs.  

German Shepherds eat 5 kg of food a day, so 3 of them eat 3 * 5 = 15 kg per day.

Bulldogs eat 3 kg a day, so 2 of them eat 2 * 3 = 6 kg per day.

That means they eat a total of 15 + 6 = 21 kg of food each day.

Over a week, that's 21 kg/day * 7 days/week = 147 kg of food. 



"
"Okay, so there are 10 two-legged animals and 15 four-legged animals.  That means there are 20 legs from the two-legged animals (10 * 2) and 60 legs from the four-legged animals (15 * 4).  

Adding those together, we have a total of 80 legs.  Since each pair of legs has two legs, there are 40 pairs of legs on the farm. 


"
"Okay, so there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, which means there are 4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks.  

That makes a total of 4 + 8 = 12 blue and yellow blocks.

Since there are 32 blocks in all, there must be 32 - 12 = 20 red blocks. 


"
"Okay, so Elvis drives west for 5 hours at 18 mph, which means he covers 5 * 18 = 90 miles.  Then he drives east for 8 hours at the same speed, covering 8 * 18 = 144 miles.  Since he's driving east, he's going in the opposite direction of his first trip.  To find out how far he is from his house, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east: 144 - 90 = 54 miles. 


**Answer:** 54 miles 
"
"Okay, so the boat starts at $9000.  The first year it loses 30% of its value, which is $9000 * 0.30 = $2700. That means it's worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

The next year, it loses another 30% of its *new* value, so that's $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.  Now it's worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

Finally, in the third year, it loses 20% of its value, which is $4410 * 0.20 = $882.  

That leaves the boat worth $4410 - $882 = $3528. 




"
"Okay, so there are 232 Starbursts total.  We know there are 54 red ones.  There are twice as many orange as red, so that's 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies.  Then there are half as many yellow as red, so 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.  

Adding those up, we have 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies that aren't pink.  

That means there are 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies. 



"
"Okay, so Helen stayed in a hotel for 3 nights at $80 a night, which is 3 * $80 = $240.  

She also took the bus 7 times, and each trip cost 10% of the hotel price, so $80 * 0.10 = $8 per bus trip.  

That means her bus trips cost 7 * $8 = $56.

Adding the hotel and bus costs, her total trip cost was $240 + $56 = $296. 



"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to Dallas and Darla. We know Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping some.  To find out how many he had before dropping any, we add the 4 he dropped: 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Finally, subtract the number of marbles Dallas has from the total Mazie gave away to find out how many Darla received: 52 - 25 = 27 marbles. 


"
"Okay, so to figure this out, we need to know how many adults are in the family.  

Let's say there are  'a' adults.  Here's how we'd calculate the total cost:

* **Adult tickets:** a * $12 = $12a
* **Child ticket:** $8
* **Popcorn:** $6

**Total cost:** $12a + $8 + $6 = $12a + $14 


Let me know how many adults are going and I can give you the final price! 

"
"Okay, so the car weighs 1200 pounds, and there's 250 pounds of luggage plus 75 pounds per kid times two kids, which is 150 pounds.  That means the total weight is 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds.

If it takes 1% of the weight to move the car, that's 1600 * 0.01 = 16 pounds of force.

"
"Okay, so Steve took 10 hours to do the puzzle.  Anna took 2 hours longer than half of Steve's time.  

First, find half of Steve's time: 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours.

Then add 2 hours to that: 5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours.


It took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle. 
"
"Okay, so Dexter's pigs eat 4 pounds of feed twice a day, which means they each eat 8 pounds per day.  With 5 pigs, that's a total of 40 pounds of feed needed each day.

Over a week, they'll eat 40 pounds/day * 7 days/week = 280 pounds.

If Dexter started with 300 pounds, he'll have 300 - 280 = 20 pounds left. 



"
"Okay, so John needs 20 guests * 2 hot dogs per guest = 40 hot dogs.  He has 4 already, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 more hot dogs.  

Since each pack has 6 hot dogs, he'll need to buy 36 / 6 = 6 packs.  

If each pack costs $2, that means he'll spend 6 * $2 = $12 on hot dogs. 


"
"Okay, so Frances makes $2 per cupcake and sells 20 cupcakes, so that's 20 * $2 = $40.  She also sells 40 cookies for $1 each, so that's 40 * $1 = $40.  

That means she made a total of $40 + $40 = $80.

She spent $20 on trays (5 trays * $4 each).

Finally, she has $80 - $20 = $60 left. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down:

*  The truck starts with 5 kids.
*  On the second street, each of those 5 kids gets a friend, so there are 5 * 2 = 10 kids.

"
"Okay, so James has a quarter, which is worth 25 cents.  He also has two nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 cents.  Finally, he has seven dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents, so that's 7 * 10 = 70 cents.  

Adding it all up, he has 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents. 


"
"Okay, so there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.  The sisters are all 16, so that's 3 * 16 = 48 years.  One brother is 12, and the other is twice that age, so he's 12 * 2 = 24.  That means the brothers total 12 + 24 = 36 years.  

Adding the sisters' ages and the brothers' ages, we get 48 + 36 = 84 years. 



"
"Okay, so Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, which is 30 minutes total each day.  

That means in a week she meditates for 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes.

She also does yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week, which is 5 hours total or 300 minutes.

So in a week she spends 210 minutes + 300 minutes = 510 minutes on meditation and yoga.

Over 4 weeks, that's 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes. 




"
"Okay, so Octavia's making a quilt!  Let's figure out how much fabric she'll need.

* Small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
* Medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
* Large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

To find the total, we add it all up: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet. 


101 
"
"Okay, so a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.  

A large sunflower has 50% more than that, so it has 0.50 * 36 = 18 more seeds. That means a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

In total, there are 36 + 54 = 90 sunflower seeds. 


"
"Okay, so George has 18 pens and Timothy has three times that amount.  So Timothy has 18 * 3 = 54 pens. Sarah has half the number of pens Timothy has, which is 54 / 2 = 27 pens.

"Okay, let's break this down:

* We know Albert is 36 inches tall.
* Anne is twice Albert's size, so she's 36 * 2 = 72 inches tall.
* Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, making her 72 - 2 = 70 inches tall.
* Since Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, she was 70 - 3 = 67 inches tall before summer.

"
"Okay, so the company makes 5000 chocolate bars each day and sells them for $2 a piece.  

There are 14 days in two weeks, so they make 5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars in two weeks.

If they sell each bar for $2, they'll make 70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000. 


"
"Okay, so Jake gets 50% off the second T-shirt, which means he saves $4 since each shirt originally cost $8.  That means he pays $4 for each shirt, and $8 total for both.  

The shoes were originally $40, and he saves 40% of that, which is $16.  So the shoes cost him $24.

In total, Jake spends $8 on the T-shirts + $24 on the shoes = $32 at the store. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down. Ryan earns $6 a week for doing his chores and he did them for 3 weeks, so he made $6 * 3 = $18.  

He spent $5 on ice cream for himself and his friends, leaving him with $18 - $5 = $13.

Since movie tickets cost $6.50 each, Ryan can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets. 


"
"Okay, so Ellen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a photo frame, for a total of $105.  Lani spent $30 on sunglasses and $200 on two bathrobes, so she spent $230. Together, they spent $105 + $230 = $335.

"Okay, so Tim makes this honey and jam mix.  To make one jar, he needs 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 a pound, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 a pound, and 2 pounds of honey at $10 a pound.  

Let's figure out how much each jar costs him to make:

* Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
* Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
* Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20
* Total cost per jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

He sells each jar for $50, so his profit per jar is:

* $50 - $44 = $6

If he sells 10 jars, his total profit is:

* $6/jar * 10 jars = $60

"Okay, so Matthew has 12 toy soldiers and wants to sell them.  He's got a buyer who'll pay $5 for half of them and $7 for the other half.  

Let's figure out how much he'd make:

* Half his soldiers is 12 / 2 = 6 soldiers.
* He'd get 6 * $5 = $30 for the first half.
* And 6 * $7 = $42 for the second half.

* In total, he'd make $30 + $42 = $72

"Okay, so the dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, which is a total of 6 * 14 = 84 holes.  

Then Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 more, so he's really only making progress by 9 - 6 = 3 holes each day.

To fill all 84 holes, it'll take him 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Finally, there are 7 days in a week, so it'll take him 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

"Okay, so Norman High School has 4000 students on average, and Butler High School has 3/4 of that amount.  

To find out how many students Butler has, we do (3/4) * 4000, which equals 3000 students.

Then, to find the difference, we subtract Butler's enrollment from Norman's: 4000 - 3000 = 1000 students.


**Answer: 1000**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Find the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:** 2595 + 3075 = 5670
* **Subtract that number from the total number of cookies to find the number of chocolate chip cookies:** 7995 - 5670 = 2325

"
"Okay, let's break this problem down:

* Igor got half the test tubes Dr. Grumpus asked for, so he had 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
* He grabbed 2 more Petri dishes than requested, meaning he had 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
*  In total, before losing any beakers, Igor had 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 items.
* Since he only had 29 items on the bench, he must have lost 31 - 29 = 2 beakers.


**Answer:** Igor lost 2 beakers. 
"
"Okay, so James needs 4 screws for each leg of his tables.  Since he has 4 tables with 4 legs each, that means he needs 4 * 4 * 4 = 64 screws in total.  

He only has 40 screws, so he'll be short 64 - 40 = 24 screws. 


"
"Okay, so there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice that amount in the second basket.  That means there are 20 eggs in the second basket.  

To find the total, we add the eggs from both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* Alexandra raised $430.
* Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so she raised $430 + $320 = $750.
* Sarah raised $300.
* Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so she raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Finally, to find the total, add up everyone's fundraising: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180


**Answer:** $2180 
"
"Okay, so Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far.  

If Vanessa runs 4 miles and Aaron takes 16 minutes, that means Aaron runs 2 miles (half of Vanessa's distance).  

Since Aaron is faster, he runs a mile in half the time Vanessa does.  

Vanessa's time would be double Aaron's time, so she takes 16 minutes * 2 = 32 minutes.




**Answer:** 32 
"
"Okay, so the caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.  He has 200 feet of dock, so he needs 200 * 3 = 600 feet of line in total.  He already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 feet more. 


"
"Okay, so Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations each night and they make $15 per reservation.  That means they make $90 each night. Since they're open two nights a week, they make $180 a week. 


"
"Okay, so the fruit vendor made a 25% profit on the watermelons.  That means he made $20 in profit on the $80 he spent.  

To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to figure out the total amount he made from selling them.  

* Total cost: $80
* Profit: $20
* Total selling price: $80 + $20 = $100

Now, he sold 50 watermelons, so:

* Selling price per watermelon: $100 / 50 = $2 



**Answer: $2**

"Okay, let's break this down:

*  James is 18 years old because he's twice Dora's age, and Dora is 9 (since she turns 12 in 3 years).
*  John is 37 years old (19 + 18).
*  John's youngest son is 5 years old (37 - 32).
*  In 3 years, his youngest son will be 8 years old. 



**Answer:** 8 
"
"Okay, so Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes and Jane every 4 minutes.  That means in an hour (60 minutes), Ana would peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.  Jane would peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.  

The difference is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges. 


**Answer:** 5 
"
"Okay, so Mark got a radiator for 80% off, which means he saved $400 * 0.80 = $320.  That means he paid $400 - $320 = $80 for the radiator.  

Then, the mechanic charged him $50 an hour for 3 hours of work, so that's $50 * 3 = $150.

Adding those together, Mark paid $80 + $150 = $230 in total. 


"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 20 animals total, and they have 70 legs.  We know chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs.  Let's think about it this way:

* If all the animals were cows, they'd have 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs. That's too many!

* So, there must be some chickens.  Let's try figuring out how many.  

If we have 5 chickens, that's 5 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 10 legs.

That leaves 70 total legs - 10 chicken legs = 60 legs for the cows.

And 60 legs / 4 legs/cow = 15 cows.

That works! 20 animals total (5 chickens + 15 cows) and 70 legs. 




"
"Okay, so they have 7 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices, meaning there are 7 * 8 = 56 slices total.  

Since there are 4 people sharing, each person gets 56 / 4 = 14 slices.
