"Alright, let's break this down.  

Josh spent $80,000 on the house and then put another $50,000 into repairs, for a total investment of $130,000. The repairs increased the house's value by 150% of the original price, which is $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.  

This means the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.  

His profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

Wendi feeds her 20 chickens 3 cups of feed each day, split into three meals. She's already given them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon.  

To find out how much feed she needs for the final meal, we can subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed:

* Total daily feed: 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups
* Feed needed in the final meal: 60 cups - 15 cups - 25 cups = 20 cups

"Let's break this down step-by-step:

First, figure out how long it would take to download the whole file at Carla's normal speed: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

Now,  40% of the way through the download is 100 minutes * 40% = 40 minutes.

Since the restart happens at the 40-minute mark, Carla has downloaded 40 minutes * 2 GB/minute = 80 GB.

After the restart, she needs to download the remaining 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB.

This will take another 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Adding up the time for the first download, the restart, and the second download, we get 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down.  

* Melanie started with some number of vacuum cleaners, let's call that number 'x'.

* At the green house, she sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

* Then she sold 2 more at the red house.

*  After the green and red houses, she had x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

* At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold (1/2)(x - x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners.

*  We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners left in the end. This means: x - x/3 - 2 - (1/2)(x - x/3 - 2) = 5

Now we can solve for x:

1. Simplify the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x/2 - x/6 - 1) = 5
2. Continue simplifying: x - x/3 - 2 - x/2 + x/6 + 1 = 5
3. Combine like terms: (6x/6) - (2x/6) - (3x/6) - 1 = 5
4. Simplify further: x/6 - 1 = 5
5. Add 1 to both sides: x/6 = 6
6. Multiply both sides by 6: x = 36



**Answer:** Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

First, we find out how many students chose contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students is 4 students.  

That leaves 16 students who didn't pick contemporary.  Of those, 25% chose jazz, which is 4 students.

So, 12 students must have chosen hip-hop.  

To find the percentage of the whole class who chose hip-hop, we divide the number of hip-hop dancers (12) by the total number of students (20) and multiply by 100%: (12/20) * 100% = 60%.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  The merchant has two options:

* **Option 1:** Jewelry worth $5,000 that's predicted to increase by 2.5%
* **Option 2:** Electronic gadgets worth $8,000 that are predicted to increase by 1.2%

To figure out the most profitable choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

**Option 1 (Jewelry):**

* Increase in value: $5000 * 0.025 = $125
* Total value at the end of the month: $5000 + $125 = $5125
* Profit: $5125 - $5000 = $125

**Option 2 (Electronic Gadgets):**

* Increase in value: $8000 * 0.012 = $96
* Total value at the end of the month: $8000 + $96 = $8096
* Profit: $8096 - $8000 = $96

Now, she spends one-third of her time running, which is (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours.  During those 2 hours, she covers 2 hours * 6 miles/hour = 12 miles.

She spends two-thirds of her time walking, which is (2/3) * 6 hours = 4 hours.  Over those 4 hours, she covers 4 hours * 1.5 miles/hour = 6 miles.

* Julia started with an unknown number of spoons.
* She bought a package, then had 12 spoons total.
* Her husband gave her 5 more spoons.
* She used 3 spoons while cooking.

To find out how many were in the package she bought, we can work backward:

1. Before her husband gave her spoons, she had 12 - 5 = 7 spoons.
2. Before using any spoons, she had 7 + 3 = 10 spoons.


So, Julia's package contained 10 spoons.

"Alright, let's figure this out!  We've got 700 bees in total, and twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens.  

Let's think about it step-by-step:

* If we start with the queens, let's say there are 'q' queens.
* That means there are '2q' baby bees.
* And since there are twice as many worker bees as babies, there are '2 * (2q)' or '4q' worker bees.

Now we know the total number of bees is the sum of all these: q + 2q + 4q = 700

Combining like terms, we get 7q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7, we find q = 100 queens.

With 100 queens, there are 2 * 100 = 200 baby bees.

And finally, there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.

*  Since there weren't any fries left, the raccoon didn't eat any.
*  The ants took the last fry, leaving 5.

Working backwards, we can figure out the original amount:

* Before the ants took a fry, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.
* Before the pigeons ate any, there were 6 + 9 = 15 fries.
* Before the seagull took any, there were 15 + 7 = 22 fries.

"Let's break this down.  The price of the marbles goes up by 20% every two months.  That means we're dealing with exponential growth.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Jerry's got a six-sided die.  We need to figure out how much more likely it is for him to roll a number bigger than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row.

* **Greater than 3:** There are three numbers on the die that fit the bill (4, 5, and 6). That's three out of six, or a probability of 1/2.

* **Two evens in a row:**  There are three even numbers (2, 4, and 6).  So, the chance of rolling one even number is 1/2.  Then, he'd have to roll another even number, which also has a 1/2 chance.  To get the probability of both happening, we multiply: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.

* **The Difference:**  We subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

* **Percentage:**  Finally, convert that fraction to a percentage: (1/4) * 100% = 25%

First, we need to figure out how many 10-foot sections are in the whole redwood tree.  Since the tree is 200 feet tall, there are 200 feet / 10 feet/section = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the whole tree weighed 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

The termites ate 30% of the wood, which is 8000 pounds * 0.30 = 2400 pounds.

* **Cera's age six years ago:** Cera is 46 now, so six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
* **Noah's age six years ago:**  Noah was half Cera's age then, meaning he was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
* **Chile's population six years ago:** The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.
* **Chile's population now:** The population is now double what it was six years ago, making it 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

**Job B:**

* Job B pays a flat $42,000 per year.
*  After paying $6,000 in property taxes, his net income is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.

Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, and there are 60 animals in total.  To find the total number of legs, we need to figure out how many chickens and cows there are.

Now, let's calculate the legs:

* Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
* Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

"Let's break this down.  Erin scored 14 points, and now she has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8.  

First, figure out how many points Erin has in total now: 14 + 8 = 22 points.

Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, that means Sara's score (8) multiplied by 3 equals Erin's original score before she got those extra 14 points.

So, 8 * 3 = 24.  That means Erin had 24 points before.

"Greetings!  Let's unravel this riddle of the camels and dromedaries. 

We know there are 180 heads in total and 304 bumps.  Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one, we can set up a system of equations.

Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.

*  c + d = 180  (The total number of heads)
*  2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps)

To find the number of dromedaries, we can solve for 'd'.  Let's rearrange the first equation to get 'c' by itself:

c = 180 - d

Now, substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:

2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':

360 - 2d + d = 304
-d = -56
d = 56


Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries in the herd.

*  Since each card sold for $1.50, he sold $150 / $1.50 = 100 cards.
*  If he kept 1/3 of his cards, the 100 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection.
*  Therefore, he started with 100 cards * (3/2) = 150 cards.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to make sure we're using the same units. Since the area is in square feet, let's convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so a 3-yard length is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now we know the length is 9 feet and the area is 360 square feet.  We can find the width by dividing the area by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Finally, the perimeter of a rectangle is found with the formula: 2 * (length + width).  Plugging in our values, we get 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

* **Second layer:**  3 cheerleaders at 64 inches each is 3 * 64 = 192 inches.
* **Third layer:** 2 cheerleaders at 64 inches each is 2 * 64 = 128 inches.
* **Top layer:** Our shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

Now, add it all up: 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches.

Finally, convert inches to feet: 636 inches / 12 inches/foot = 53 feet.

Venue 1 costs a flat $200 plus $5 per guest for food. Venue 2 costs $25 per guest, and that includes food.  

To find out when they cost the same, we need to figure out how many guests would make the total cost equal.  Let's say 'x' is the number of guests.

* Venue 1 cost: $200 + $5x
* Venue 2 cost: $25x

We want to find when these two costs are the same:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x

Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

*  Let's say Bodhi found 'B' insects.
*  David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found B/2 insects.
*  Lily found 7 more insects than David, meaning she found B/2 + 7 insects.

We know that together they found 43 insects, so:

B + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combining like terms:

(3/2)B + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

(3/2)B = 36

Multiplying both sides by 2/3:

B = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find how many Lily found:

Lily's insects = B/2 + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19


Lily found 19 insects.

* **Summer's cookies:** Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

"Let's break this problem down.  

*  Let 'x' represent the original length of the dress.
*  Extending the dress by 50% adds 0.50x to its length.
*  The total length after the extension is x + 0.50x = 1.50x
*  Adding the lace trim makes the dress 1.50x + 20cm long.
*  We know this final length is 140cm: 1.50x + 20 = 140
*  Subtracting 20cm from both sides, we get 1.50x = 120cm.
*  Finally, dividing both sides by 1.50 gives us x = 80cm.


The original length of the dress was 80cm.

"Alright, let's break this down.  We've got twins and triplets, and one twin is 7 years older than a triplet.  Their total age is 44.  

To figure out the age of one twin, let's think:

*  If we knew the age of one triplet, we could easily find the twin's age.
*  We need to find a way to express the ages of all five kids in terms of one variable.

Let's say 't' is the age of one triplet.  The other two triplets are also 't' years old.  The twin older than the triplet is 't + 7'.  The other twin is also 't + 7'.

Now we can write an equation: t + t + t + (t + 7) + (t + 7) = 44

Simplifying: 5t + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides: 5t = 30

Dividing both sides by 5: t = 6

So, one triplet is 6 years old.  

Since one twin is 7 years older than that triplet, the twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

First, we know each lollipop costs $0.40, so five lollipops cost 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.  

That means the four candies cost $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

So, one candy costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, ten lollipops would cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00, and ten candies would cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

Together, that's $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many coins Neil saves each month. He saves 2/5 times more than Rong, who saves 20 coins.  That means Neil saves (2/5) * 20 = 8 more coins than Rong.

So, Neil saves a total of 20 + 8 = 28 coins each month.

Now, let's see how many coins each of them saves in a year:

* Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins per year.
* Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year = 336 coins per year.

Finally, we need to calculate their total savings after ten years:

* Rong saves 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.
* Neil saves 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

John's dog needs two vaccines at $20 each, so that's $40 right there.  The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which means we need to figure out the total bill first.  Let's call the total bill 'x'.  We know:

* Vaccines: $40
* Heartworm check: 0.60x 
* Total bill: x

So,  $40 + 0.60x = x

Solving for x:

* Subtract $40 from both sides: 0.60x = x - $40
* Subtract 0.60x from both sides: 0 = 0.40x - $40
* Add $40 to both sides: $40 = 0.40x
* Divide both sides by 0.40: x = $100

John's total bill is $100.  Since he brought $125, he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

* **Apples:** Apples cost $0.50 each, and there are 12 in the crate, for a total of $0.50 * 12 = $6.00.

* **Oranges:** Oranges are the priciest at three times the cost of a banana, making them $3.00 each. With 7 oranges, they cost $3.00 * 7 = $21.00.

"Alright, let's break this down. Mike has 600 movies, and a third of them are in series, which he can get for a discounted price.  That's 600 / 3 = 200 series movies.  

Since series movies cost 6 dollars less than a regular movie, they cost 10 - 6 = $4 each. So, those 200 series movies cost 200 * $4 = $800.

That leaves him with 600 - 200 = 400 movies that aren't in series.  Forty percent of those are older movies, which cost $5 each. That's 400 * 0.40 = 160 older movies costing 160 * $5 = $800.

Finally, the remaining movies are regular price, so the 400 - 160 = 240 movies cost 240 * $10 = $2400.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, figure out the Llesis family's hiking speed.  They hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, which is 50 mph. Half their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 mph.  So, their hiking speed was 25 - 5 = 20 mph.

Next, calculate the distance they covered while hiking. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 mph, meaning they hiked 1.5 * 20 = 30 miles.

Now, determine how long they spent driving. Their total trip was 6 hours, and they hiked for 1.5 hours, so they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Finally, calculate the distance they covered while driving. They drove at 50 mph for 4.5 hours, covering a distance of 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

To find the total distance to their vacation spot, add the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

"Let's break this problem down.  Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish, for a total of 7.  He then bought 17 more fish, and now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  

Let's use some variables:

*  Let 'w' represent the number of white fish Bob bought.
*  Let 'o' represent the number of orange fish Bob bought.

We know:

*  w + o = 17 (The total number of fish he bought)
*  o = 2w (He has twice as many orange as white)

We can use substitution to solve for 'w'. Since we know o = 2w, we can substitute that into the first equation:

w + 2w = 17

Combining like terms:

3w = 17

Dividing both sides by 3:

w = 5.67

Since Bob can't buy parts of fish, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Jack's playtime:** Jack plays for 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes. Since he plays for 20 minutes per quarter, he uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

* **Weaker friends' playtime:** Each of the weaker friends plays for half as long as Jack, meaning they play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They play for a total of 2 friends * (240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter) = 48 quarters.

* **Better friend's playtime:** The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. They use 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

* **Total quarters:**  Adding up the quarters used by everyone, we get 12 quarters + 48 quarters + 8 quarters = 68 quarters.

* **Total cost:**  Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total cost is 68 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17.00

"Let's break this problem down.  Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar.  She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

*  Let's say 'x' represents the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance).
*  Since salt and sugar are equal, they also use 'x' ounces.
*  Oil is twice the amount of salt, so oil is 2x ounces.

Now we know the total amount in the jar is 10 ounces: x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combining like terms, we get 5x = 10.  

Dividing both sides by 5, we find x = 2.

Since oil is 2x, Tanya uses 2 * 2 = 4 ounces of oil.

*  Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Now, let's solve for x:

* Let F be the number of books Fawn has.
* Let A be the number of books Anne has.
* Let S be the number of books Sofie has.

We know:

* S + A + F = 85 (Total books)
* S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more than Anne)
* A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer than Fawn)

Let's substitute to solve for F:

1. Since S = A + 25, we can write: (A + 25) + A + F = 85

2.  Simplifying: 2A + F + 25 = 85

3.  Substitute A = F - 12: 2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85

4.  Expand: 2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85

5.  Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85

"Let's figure this out! Colby has $150 for the month.  He's already spent money on movies and snacks.  

* Friday and Saturday tickets cost $10 each, and he's seen 5 on those days, so that's 5 * $10 = $50.
* Movies on other days cost $7 each, and he's seen 8, so that's 8 * $7 = $56.
* He's also spent $16 on popcorn and $8 on candy.

That means he's spent a total of $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

He has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since Friday and Saturday tickets cost $10 each, he can see 2 more movies.

"Alright, let's figure this out!

We know Peter, Paul, and Jean's combined age is 100.  We also know Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages.

Let's use some variables:

* Peter's age = P
* Paul's age = Pa
* John's age = J

Now we can set up some equations:

* P + Pa + J = 100 
* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

We can use substitution to solve for Peter's age (P).  Let's substitute the second equation (Pa = J + 10) into the third equation:

* P = (J + 10) + J
* P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute both the second equation and the modified third equation into the first equation:

* (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Simplify and solve for J:

* 4J + 20 = 100
* 4J = 80
* J = 20

Now that we know John is 20, we can find Peter's age using P = 2J + 10:

* P = (2 * 20) + 10
* P = 40 + 10
* P = 50

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles.  

At a speed of 2 miles per hour, this takes him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

He then rests for half the time he spent swimming, so he rests for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

He swims the rest of the way at half his usual speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.  

This takes him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

Finally, the total time is 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming) = 17 hours.

Then we need to account for the space between the plants: 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches.

So, the total space needed is 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

That means Pat needs 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants. Since Pat can't buy half a plant, she needs to buy 110 plants.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants.

Each plant costs $6, so Pat will spend 93 plants * $6/plant = $558 at the store.

First, find out how much soil the sunflowers and carnations use:

* Sunflowers: 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
* Carnations: 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, add that up: 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Subtract that from the total soil to see how much is left for roses: 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Finally, divide the remaining soil by how much each rose needs: 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses. 


They can plant **3** roses.

"Let's break this problem down:

*  The air conditioner cools 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high.
*  The room warms up 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.

First, the air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.

Then, it switches to high for 4 hours, cooling it an additional 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.

That's a total of 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees of cooling.

However, while the air conditioner is off for 2 hours, the room warms up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 18 degrees cooler - 4 degrees warmer = 14 degrees cooler than the starting temperature.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

*  Let 'x' represent the power bank's initial charge when Maria left for the park.

*  The power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours, totaling a loss of 9 * 5 = 45%.

*  Over the next 3 hours, it lost another 7% per hour, for a total loss of 7 * 3 = 21%.

*  The final charge was 28%, so we can set up the equation: 55% - 21% = 28%

Marcus has a 50% chance of having a substitute teacher who won't collect homework.

Since Jim needs two pieces, the total fabric needed is 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

"Alright, let's break this tennis ball problem down. 

*  Let's say Rory got 'x' tennis balls in the second set.

*  The first set had 'x + 4' balls since he got four more than the second.

*  The third set had 'x / 2' balls because he got half the amount from the second set.

*  Adding all the sets together, we get: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Now, let's solve for 'x':

*  Combine like terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19
*  Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15
*  Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6

So, Rory got 6 balls in the second set.  

Finally, the first set had x + 4 balls, which is 6 + 4 = 10 balls. 



Rory retrieved **10** tennis balls in the first set.

"Let's figure out Sheila's new credit card balance. 

First, her balance goes down by $15.00 after the return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Then, she buys a frying pan that's 20% off $20.00.  That means she saves $4.00: $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. The frying pan costs $16.00: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, she buys a set of towels that are 10% off $30.00. That's a discount of $3.00: $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. The towels cost $27.00: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If 40% of the school is made up of 240 boys, we can find the total number of students first.  

Think of it like this: 40% represents a portion of the whole school.  We know that portion is 240 boys.  To find the whole, we can set up a proportion:

40/100 = 240/total students

Cross-multiplying gives us:

40 * total students = 100 * 240

Simplifying:

40 * total students = 24000

Divide both sides by 40 to find the total number of students:

total students = 600

Now, to find the number of girls, subtract the number of boys from the total:

600 - 240 = 360


There are **360** girls in the school.

*  Dividing both sides by 2: y = 9 (Sarah painted 9 eggs)

*  Camden painted y + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

*  Since Arnold and Madeline painted 2x eggs, and the total is 56, we have 2x + 30 = 56

*  Subtracting 30 from both sides: 2x = 26

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at a certain speed and 1 mile on the sidewalk at twice that speed.  We're given that she spends 40 minutes on the beach.

To find her speed on the beach, we can use the formula:

*Speed = Distance / Time*

So, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed there is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now we can find the time she spends on the sidewalk:

*Time = Distance / Speed*

Time on the sidewalk is 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

Finally, to get the total time for her 3-mile walk, we add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:

40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

*  We know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
*  Together, all three ropes measure 37 centimeters.

Let's use 'y' to represent the length of the yellow rope.  This means the blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long, and the red rope is 4 * (y - 7) centimeters long.

Now we can set up an equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

So, the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.  

Now we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20


The red rope is 20 centimeters long.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  Ian has a 40-foot board and wants to cut it into two pieces where one piece is four times longer than the other.  

If the shorter piece is 'x' feet long, the longer piece is '4x' feet long.  

Together, their lengths add up to 40 feet:  x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms, we get 5x = 40.  

Dividing both sides by 5, we find x = 8.

So, the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, which means it's 4 * 8 = 32 feet long.

"Let's figure this out!

Each pig eats 8 pounds of feed per day (4 pounds per meal * 2 meals).  

With 5 pigs, that's a total of 40 pounds of feed eaten each day (8 pounds/pig * 5 pigs).

Over a week, they'll eat 280 pounds (40 pounds/day * 7 days).

That means Dexter will have 20 pounds of feed left (300 pounds - 280 pounds).
