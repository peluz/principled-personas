"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Josh spent $80,000 on the house and another $50,000 on repairs, for a total investment of $130,000.  The repairs increased the house's value by 150% of the original price, which is $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.  

So the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

His profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Wendi feeds her 20 chickens 3 cups of feed each per day, split into three meals. She's already given them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon.  To find out how much feed she needs for the final meal, we can subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed:

* Total daily feed: 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups
* Feed needed in the final meal: 60 cups - 15 cups - 25 cups = 20 cups

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Carla downloads 2 GB every minute, so a 200 GB file would normally take 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

But, she gets interrupted!  She's downloaded 40% of the file, which is 200 GB * 0.40 = 80 GB.  

That means she has to redownload the remaining 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB.

"Let's break this problem down.  

*  Melanie started with some number of vacuum cleaners, let's call that number 'x'.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3.

*  At the red house, she sold 2 more.

*  That means she had x - x/3 - 2 left.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold (x - x/3 - 2) / 2.

*  We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2) / 2 = 5

Now we can solve for x:

1. Simplify the equation.
2. Isolate x. 

You'll find that Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. 

The merchant has two options:

* **Jewelry:** Worth $5,000 now, expected to increase by 2.5%

* **Electronic Gadgets:** Worth $8,000 now, expected to increase by 1.2%

To find the most profitable option, we need to calculate the profit for each:

**Jewelry:**

* Increase in value: $5000 * 0.025 = $125
* Total value at the end of the month: $5000 + $125 = $5125
* Profit: $5125 - $5000 = $125

**Electronic Gadgets:**

* Increase in value: $8000 * 0.012 = $96
* Total value at the end of the month: $8000 + $96 = $8096
* Profit: $8096 - $8000 = $96

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If Kyle got a 25% discount on a book that cost $19.50, we can think of that $19.50 as 75% of the original price (because 100% - 25% = 75%).

To find the original price, we can set up a little equation:

0.75 * original price = $19.50

Divide both sides by 0.75 to isolate the original price:

original price = $19.50 / 0.75 = $26.00

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

Gretchen has 110 coins total, and 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  If we let 's' represent the number of silver coins, we know there are 's + 30' gold coins.  

Since all the coins add up to 110, we can write the equation: s + (s + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get 2s + 30 = 110.  Subtracting 30 from both sides, we have 2s = 80.  

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that s = 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the number of gold coins, we add 30 to the number of silver coins: 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.



Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

* **Patient Charges:** The hospital charges $200 per hour and sees patients for 200 hours, bringing in $40,000 (200 hours * $200/hour).

* **Profit:**  The hospital's profit is the difference between patient charges and doctor's earnings, which is $10,000 ($40,000 - $30,000).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

* We know there are 700 bees total.
* There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens.

Let's think about it step-by-step:

1. **Queens:**  Let's say there are 'q' queen bees.
2. **Babies:** Since there are twice as many babies as queens, there are 2q baby bees.
3. **Workers:**  There are twice as many worker bees as babies, so there are 2 * (2q) = 4q worker bees.

Now we can set up an equation:

q + 2q + 4q = 700

Combine like terms: 7q = 700

Divide both sides by 7: q = 100

So, there are 100 queen bees.

Now we can find the number of worker bees:

4q = 4 * 100 = 400


There are **400** worker bees.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Start with Dave:** Dave ate 14 fries.
* **Seagull's snack:** The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
* **Fries remaining:** After the seagull, there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.
* **Pigeon party:**  Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, for a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
* **Fries after pigeons:**  This is where things get tricky!  There were only 7 fries, and the pigeons ate 9. This means there weren't enough fries for all the pigeons. 

Since the problem states that a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries *and* ants took a final fry, we know there must have been more fries initially.  Let's work backward to figure out how many.

* **Before the ants:** There were 5 fries + 1 fry (taken by the ants) = 6 fries.
* **Before the pigeons:** There were 6 fries + 9 fries (eaten by the pigeons) = 15 fries.
* **Before the seagull:** There were 15 fries + 7 fries (eaten by the seagull) = 22 fries.



**Therefore, there were 22 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.**

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Let's say Brooke is 'b' years old, and Seth is 's' years old.  We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so s = 2b.

In two years, they'll both be a couple of years older.  The sum of their ages then will be 28: (s + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Now we can use our first piece of information (s = 2b) to substitute into the second equation:

(2b + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Simplifying that, we get:

3b + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3b = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

b = 8

So Brooke is 8 years old.  Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is 16.

There are 3 even numbers on a die, so the probability of rolling one even number is 3/6, or 1/2.  Since the rolls are independent, we multiply those probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

If each duck eats 3.5 pounds of insects a week, ten ducks would eat 3.5 * 10 = 35 pounds of insects a week.

To find out how many pounds they need per day, we divide the weekly amount by 7 days: 35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds/day.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Yearly tree growth:** Tom plants 10 trees and removes 2, so he gains 8 trees each year.
* **Growth over 10 years:** Over 10 years, this adds up to 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.
* **Total trees after growth:**  He starts with 50 trees and gains 80 more, giving him 50 + 80 = 130 trees.
* **Tree loss:**  30% of the 130 trees die, which is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.
* **Final count:**  After the losses, Tom has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

Let's say the small pool had *x* gallons of water 4 minutes ago.  Since the big pool had twice as much then, it had 2*x* gallons.

Because both pools leak at 4 gallons per minute, the small pool now has *x* - 16 gallons, and the big pool has 2*x* - 16 gallons.

We know the big pool now has four times the amount of water as the small pool, so:

2*x* - 16 = 4(*x* - 16)

Let's solve for *x*:

2*x* - 16 = 4*x* - 64
48 = 2*x*
*x* = 24

* There are 200 cows in the stalls to begin with (10 stalls * 20 cows/stall).
* Mr. Sylas adds 40 more cows, so there are 240 cows total (200 + 40).
*  He divides the new cows equally among the 20 stalls, meaning each stall gets 2 more cows (40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 cows/stall).
*  Now, each stall has 22 cows (20 cows + 2 cows).
*  So, 8 stalls would have 176 cows (8 stalls * 22 cows/stall).

"Let's figure out which job gives Nick more take-home pay.

**Job A:**

* Nick earns $15 per hour and works 2000 hours a year, so his gross pay is $15 * 2000 = $30,000.
*  With a 20% tax rate, he pays $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000 in taxes.
* His net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

**Job B:**

* Job B offers a yearly salary of $42,000.
*  First, we need to subtract the $6,000 property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
*  Then, he pays 10% tax on the remaining income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600.
*  His net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

**Comparison:**

* Job B pays Nick $32,400, while Job A pays $24,000.


Nick makes $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400 more at Job B.

"Hey there! Let's solve this problem.

Farmer Brown has 60 animals, which are either chickens or cows.  Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, we can set up an equation:

* Chickens: 2 * 20 = 40 chickens

Finally, let's calculate the total number of legs:

Finally, the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2 * (length + width).  So, the perimeter of Billie's room is 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

"Let's figure this out!

Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads, for a total of 3 packs.  Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads, for a total of 7 packs.

Since each pack has 20 beads, Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads.

Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

Margareth has 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"Let's break this problem down:

*  Marcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees.
*  Baking for 3 hours raises the temperature by 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.
*  So the temperature after baking is 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.
*  The open window cools the house 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, that's 3 times the cooling effect.
*  The total cooling is 3 times * 2 degrees/cooling = 6 degrees.
*  Finally, the house temperature after cooling is 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

"Hey there! Let's break down this food truck's profit.

First, the bread costs $3.00 per loaf and makes 10 sandwiches, so each sandwich costs $0.30 to make.

Then, they spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for every 10 sandwiches.

So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese & condiments) = $33.00

They sell those 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, bringing in $70.00.

Finally, their profit is $70.00 (revenue) - $33.00 (cost) = $37.00

"Here's how to figure this out:

The oven is 18 degrees hotter than it should be at 450 degrees.  That means for every 100 degrees, it's off by 4%.

So, to get 520 degrees, Maggie needs to set the oven to a lower temperature.  Let's figure out what that is:

*  If 100 degrees is off by 4%, then 520 degrees would be off by 4% as well.
*  To find the correct setting, we need to figure out what number is 4% *less* than 520.

*  4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8 degrees.
*  Subtract that from 520: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2

*  Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.

*  Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, there are 0.99b red jelly beans.

*  And because there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, there are 1.01b green jelly beans.

*  The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so:  0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500

*  Combining like terms, we get 2.99b = 4500

*  Solving for 'b', we find b = 4500 / 2.99 ≈ 1505 blue jelly beans.

"Let's figure this out!

* Adam has 50 points.
* Betty did better than Adam and got 30% more points, so she has 50 + (50 * 0.30) = 65 points.

"Let's break this problem down:

*  Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, let's call that amount 'z'.

Since z = s (same amount of zest and salt), we can substitute: 2s + 4s = 10

Combining like terms: 6s = 10

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

* Let's say PJ has 'x' Magic Cards.
* Smendrick has 3 times the amount PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341, so:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Let's simplify:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now we know PJ has 47 cards.  Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Angela's installation cost.

She needs 6 mirrors installed (6 - 4 = 2 extra), 2 chandeliers (2 - 1 = 1 extra), and 20 pictures (20 - 10 = 10 extra).

* Extra mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $30.00
* Extra chandeliers: 1 chandelier * $15.00/chandelier = $15.00
* Extra pictures: 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00

Adding those up: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

"Hey there! Let me break this problem down for you. 

*  Let's say your brother is 'b' years old.

Now, add up everyone's ages:  b + (b - 3) + (b - 5) + (3b - 1) = 87

Simplify that equation: 6b - 9 = 87

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

So, Peter, Paul, and Jean add up to 100 years old. We know Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is the total of Paul and John's ages.

Let's use some variables:

* Peter's age = P
* Paul's age = Pa
* John's age = J

We can write this as equations:

* P + Pa + J = 100 
* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

Now, let's use some clever substitution! Since we know Pa = J + 10, we can plug that into the third equation:

* P = (J + 10) + J
* P = 2J + 10

And now we can plug both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:

* (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Let's simplify:

* 4J + 20 = 100
* 4J = 80
* J = 20

Now that we know John is 20, we can find Peter's age:

* P = 2J + 10

* **Step 3: Rest Time**
   He rests for half the time he swam, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

* **Step 4: Remaining Distance**
   He has 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles left to swim.

* **Step 5: Speed for Second Swim**
   He swims the remaining distance at half his usual speed, so he swims at 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

* **Step 6: Time for Second Swim**
   It takes him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours to swim the rest of the way.

* **Step 7: Total Time**
   Adding up all the times, it takes him 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours to cross the lake.

"Let's break this problem down:

*  Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points.

*  Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, so Bahati scored 'x + 20' points.

*  Dinar scored 10 fewer points than Bahati, so Dinar scored 'x + 20 - 10' or 'x + 10' points.

*  The total points for the team is 45, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

*  Simplifying the equation: 3x + 30 = 45

*  Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

*  Dividing both sides by 3: x = 5


Azibo scored **5** points.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

* Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'W' Pokemon.
* Stan caught 4 times that amount minus 13, so Stan caught (4W - 13) Pokemon.
* Alex caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan, so Alex caught (4W - 13) + 5 = (4W - 8) Pokemon.

Together they caught 339 Pokemon, so:

W + (4W - 13) + (4W - 8) = 339

Combining like terms:

9W - 21 = 339

Adding 21 to both sides:

9W = 360

Dividing both sides by 9:

W = 40

Now we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon.  

Stan caught 4 times that amount minus 13:

(4 * 40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokemon.

"Let's figure this out!

First, we need to figure out how many plants Pat needs.  Her flower bed is 111 feet long, and each plant needs 12 inches of space plus 1.5 feet (18 inches) of space between them.  That means she needs 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches of space for the plants themselves.  

Then we subtract the space between the plants: 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.  

Now we can see how many plants she needs: 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants. Since Pat can't buy half a plant, she needs to buy 110 plants.

She already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants.

Marcus has a 50% chance of having a substitute teacher who won't collect homework.  If his regular teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. Even if no one gets an extension, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing her his dog ate it.

So, to figure out the chance he *has* to do the homework, we need to think about the opposite: when he *doesn't* get out of it.

*  He'll definitely have to do it if there's no substitute AND no extension.
*  That means calculating the chance of the regular teacher being there AND not giving an extension: 50% * 60% = 30%

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find the area of each wall:

* The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so each is 80 square feet (10 * 8 = 80).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them in boxes of 8. That means he'll need 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so 25 boxes weigh 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces.

The crayons themselves weigh 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces.

In total, the crayons and boxes weigh 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.

Now, substitute that value of 'w' into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for 'c':

3c + 75 = 5c + 35
40 = 2c
c = 20

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Bob has $27,000 to spend on books for 3 schools.  Since he can buy 100 books for $500, he can buy 27,000 / 500 = 54 sets of 100 books.

That means he can buy a total of 54 * 100 = 5400 books.

To find out how many books each school gets, we divide the total books by the number of schools: 5400 / 3 = 1800 books per school.

* **Revenue:** She sells 3 eggs for $1, and she has 60 eggs (5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen).  That means she can sell 60 / 3 = 20 sets of 3 eggs.  Her total revenue is then 20 * $1 = $20.00.
* **Profit:**  Profit is calculated as revenue minus cost: $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.



**Answer:** Rose's profit will be $8.00.

Butler High School enrolls 3/4 the number of students as Norman High School, which means they enroll (3/4) * 4000 = 3000 students.

The difference in enrollment between the two schools is 4000 - 3000 = 1000 students.

"Let's figure this out! 

They made 7995 cookies total.  

* Rainbow cookies: 2595
* Oatmeal cookies: 3075

To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total:

7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2325

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Test tubes:** Igor got half the requested amount, so he had 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
* **Petri dishes:** He gathered 2 more than requested, meaning he had 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
* **Total before losing beakers:**  Igor started with 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 items.
* **Beakers lost:** Since he ended up with 29 items, he lost 31 - 29 = 2 beakers.


Igor lost **2** beakers.

"Let's figure this out!

James needs 4 tables * 4 legs/table = 16 legs.

Since each leg needs 2 screws, he'll need 16 legs * 2 screws/leg = 32 screws.

That means he'll have 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws left over.

"Hey there!  If there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many in the second, that means there are 20 eggs in the second basket.  

Adding those together, we have 10 + 20 = 30 eggs in total.

"Let's break this down:

* Alexandra raises $430.
* Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so she raises $430 + $320 = $750.
* Sarah raises $300.
* Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so she raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Finally, to find the total, we add up everyone's fundraising: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.


**Answer:** $2180

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Aaron's speed:** Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa, and he covered 2 miles in 16 minutes.  
* **Vanessa's speed:** Vanessa ran twice the distance Aaron did, meaning she ran 4 miles. Since Aaron's speed was twice Vanessa's, we can figure out Vanessa's time.

Let Vanessa's time be represented by 'x'.  We know:

* Aaron's speed = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute
* Vanessa's speed = 0.125 miles per minute / 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute

Now we can use the formula: time = distance / speed

* Vanessa's time (x) = 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute = 64 minutes



**Answer:** Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

He needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and he has 200 feet of dock. So that means he needs 200 * 3 = 600 feet of line in total.

But wait, he already has 6 feet!  

So, he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 feet of new line.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. 

The vendor made a 25% profit on the 50 watermelons, which means he sold them for 125% of the original price.  

First, we need to find out the selling price of all the watermelons.  Since he made a profit of 25% on the $80 he spent, his profit is $20.  So, he sold all the watermelons for $80 + $20 = $100.

Finally, to find the price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons: $100 / 50 = $2 per watermelon.

"Let's break this down:

* **Ana's speed:** Ana peels one orange every 3 minutes.
* **Jane's speed:** Jane peels one orange every 4 minutes.
* **Time:** They peel for a whole hour, which is 60 minutes.

To find out how many more oranges Ana peels, we need to see how many each person peels in an hour:

* **Ana:** 60 minutes / 3 minutes/orange = 20 oranges
* **Jane:** 60 minutes / 4 minutes/orange = 15 oranges

The difference is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.


**Answer:** Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Let's figure this out!

* The radiator costs $400 but he gets it for 80% off, so he saves $400 * 0.80 = $320.
* That means he pays $400 - $320 = $80 for the radiator.
* The mechanic charges $50 per hour for 3 hours of work, totaling $50 * 3 = $150.
*  Adding the radiator cost and labor, Mark pays $80 + $150 = $230 in total.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. 

If we have 20 animals and they have a total of 70 legs, we can use a little bit of algebra.  

* Let 'c' be the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' be the number of cows.

We know:

* c + w = 20  (The total number of animals)
* 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

We can solve for 'c' (the number of chickens).  Let me do some rearranging:

* From the first equation, we get: w = 20 - c

* Substitute that into the second equation: 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

* Simplify: 2c + 80 - 4c = 70
* Combine like terms: -2c = -10
* Divide both sides by -2: c = 5

"Let's figure this out!

They have 7 pizzas with 8 slices each, so that's 7 * 8 = 56 slices in total.

With Henry and his 3 friends, there are 4 people sharing.

56 slices divided by 4 people means each person gets 56 / 4 = 14 slices.
