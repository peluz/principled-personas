"Okay, let's break this down!

Josh spent $80,000 on the house and $50,000 on repairs, for a total investment of $130,000.  The repairs increased the house value by 150% of the original price, which is $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.  

So the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

His profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Kylar buys glasses in pairs, with every other one being discounted.  That means he'll pay $5 for the first glass and $3 for the second, then repeat that pattern.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Carla downloads 2 GB every minute, so a 200 GB file would normally take 100 minutes (200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes).

But, she has to restart halfway through! That means she downloads 80 GB (40% of 200 GB) before the restart.  

After the 20-minute restart, she has to download the whole 200 GB again.  That takes another 100 minutes.

So, the total download time is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (rest of the download) = 160 minutes.

*  After the green and red houses, she had (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1 vacuum cleaners.

*  Finally, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left.  This means: (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

If Kyle got a 25% discount on a book that cost $19.50, we can think of that $19.50 as 75% of the original price (because 100% - 25% = 75%).

Gretchen has 110 coins total, and 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  If we let 's' represent the number of silver coins, we know there are 's + 30' gold coins.  

Since all the coins together equal 110, we can write the equation: s + (s + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get 2s + 30 = 110.  Subtracting 30 from both sides, we have 2s = 80.  

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that s = 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the number of gold coins, we add 30 to the number of silver coins: 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

First, we know Dana skips at 3 miles per hour.  Since skipping is half as fast as running, she runs at 3 miles/hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

She runs four times faster than she walks, so her walking speed is 6 miles/hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, she spends one-third of her time running (6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours) and two-thirds of her time walking (6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours).

This means she covers 2 hours * 6 miles/hour = 12 miles running and 4 hours * 1.5 miles/hour = 6 miles walking.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Let's say Brooke is 'b' years old, and Seth is 's' years old.  We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so s = 2b.

In two years, they'll both be a little older: Brooke will be b+2, and Seth will be s+2.  We also know that in two years, their ages will add up to 28: (b+2) + (s+2) = 28

Now we can use a little substitution! Since we know s = 2b, let's put that into the second equation:

(b+2) + (2b+2) = 28

Simplify that: 3b + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3b = 24

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

There are three numbers on a die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6).  That means there's a 3 out of 6 chance, or 50%, of rolling a number bigger than 3.

Now, for rolling two even numbers in a row, think about it this way:

*  You have to roll an even number first (2, 4, or 6 - that's a 50% chance).
*  Then, you have to roll another even number (again, 50% chance).

To get the chance of both happening, we multiply those probabilities together: 50% * 50% = 25%.

So, it's 25% more likely to roll a number bigger than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. 

We know there are 180 heads total and 304 bumps.  Camels have two humps, and dromedaries have one.  

Let's use some algebra!

* Let 'c' be the number of camels
* Let 'd' be the number of dromedaries

We can set up two equations:

*  2c + d = 304 (two humps per camel)

To solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries), we can use substitution.  Let's solve the first equation for 'c':

* c = 180 - d

Now, substitute that value of 'c' into the second equation:

* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. 

First, remember that there are 3 feet in every yard. So Billie's room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet long.

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet.  To find the width, we can use the formula:

Area = length * width

360 square feet = 9 feet * width

width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet

Now we can find the perimeter:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)

Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet

Perimeter = 98 feet

"Let's figure this out!

Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads, for a total of 3 packs.  Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads, for a total of 7 packs.

Since each pack has 20 beads, Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads.

Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

Margareth has 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

* A 2x4 gives him 200 sticks for $4, so he could buy 6 of those.
* A 2x8 gives him 400 sticks for $6, so he could buy 4 of those.

That means he could get 1200 sticks from the 2x4s (6 x 200) or 1600 sticks from the 2x8s (4 x 400). 

He'll get the most sticks by buying the 2x8s!

* **Total Revenue:** James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, so he made 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

* **Cost of Cars:** The company paid 30% of the car price, meaning the cost was $250,000 * 0.30 = $75,000.

* **Profit:**  The profit is the revenue minus the cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

* **James' Commission:**  He gets 10% of the profit, so his commission is $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500.




**Answer:** James made $17,500.

* **Time difference:** Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Now let's calculate their scores:

"Let's figure this out! 

Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish, for a total of 7.  He bought 17 new fish, and now he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  

Let's use some variables:

*  Let 'w' represent the number of white fish Bob bought.
*  Let 'o' represent the number of orange fish Bob bought.

We know:

*  w + o = 17 (He bought 17 fish total)
*  o = 2w (He has twice as many orange as white)

We can use substitution to solve for 'w'. Since we know o = 2w, we can substitute that into the first equation:

w + 2w = 17

Combining like terms:

3w = 17

"Let's break this problem down!

*  Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, let's call that amount 'z'.
*  She uses the same amount of salt and sugar, so let's call that amount 's'.
*  Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so oil is 2s ounces.
*  We know oil, salt, sugar, zest, and fragrance all go into the 10-ounce jar.

So, our equation is: z + z + s + s + 2s = 10

Combining like terms: 2z + 4s = 10

Since zest and salt are represented by 'z' and 's' respectively, we need to figure out their values.  We know that salt is equal to zest, so we can rewrite the equation as:

2z + 4z = 10

Combining like terms: 6z = 10

Dividing both sides by 6: z = 1.67 ounces (approximately)

Now that we know zest is 1.67 ounces, we know salt is also 1.67 ounces.

Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 8 cars.

Then he gives away twice the number he sold, so he gives away 8 * 2 = 16 cars.

In total, Joe gets rid of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

That leaves him with 40 - 24 = 16 cars.

"Let's break this problem down!

*  Let's say PJ has 'x' Magic Cards.
*  Smendrick has 3 times the amount PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
*  Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Now, let's solve for x:

* Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341
* Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329
* Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

Finally, to find out how many cards Becca has, plug the value of x back into her expression:

3 * 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153


Becca has 153 Magic Cards.

* The third week, he makes three times the amount from the first week: 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how many bars he makes in the fourth week, we need to see how many he makes in total over the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Finally, subtract that number from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

* 2 chandeliers (2 - 1 = 1 extra chandelier)
* 20 pictures (20 - 10 = 10 extra pictures)

Here's the breakdown:

* Extra mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $30.00
* Extra chandelier: 1 chandelier * $15.00/chandelier = $15.00
* Extra pictures: 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00

Total extra cost: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

* S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more than Anne)
* A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer than Fawn)

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Tasha made $80 total from lemonade and mowing lawns.  We know she made $6 for each lawn she mowed, and she mowed Joe's lawn some number of times.  

To find out how much she made from lemonade, we need to figure out how much she made from mowing.  We know:

* She mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's.
* She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's.

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times.  That means:

* Kamala's lawn: 3x times
* Alba's lawn: 5x times

So, her total mowing earnings would be:

6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x) = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x

To find out how much she made from lemonade, we subtract her mowing earnings from her total earnings:

$80 - $54x = Lemonade earnings

The remaining distance is 8 miles.  Since he swims at half speed for the rest of the trip, it takes him 8 hours to cover those 8 miles.

In total, it takes James 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours to cross the lake.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

* Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'W' Pokemon.
* Stan caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe caught, so Stan caught 4W - 13 Pokemon.
* Alex caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan, so Alex caught 4W - 8 Pokemon.

Together they caught 339 Pokemon, so:

W + (4W - 13) + (4W - 8) = 339

Then we need to account for the space between the plants: 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches.

So, the total space needed is 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

That means Pat needs 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants. Since she can't have half a plant, she needs 110 plants.

**Day 1:**

* Wanda pumped 1/4 of the tank, which is (1/4) * 18000 gallons = 4500 gallons.
* Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda pumped, so she pumped (3/4) * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.
* Together, they pumped 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons on day 1.

**Day 2:**

* Wanda pumped 2/3 of what she pumped on day 1: (2/3) * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons.
* Ms. B pumped 1/3 of what she pumped on day 1: (1/3) * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

*  Let 'x' represent the power bank's initial charge when Maria left for the park.

*  The power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours, totaling a loss of 9 * 5 = 45%.

*  After those 5 hours, the remaining charge was x - 0.45x = 0.55x

*  Then, it lost another 7% per hour for 3 hours, for a total loss of 7 * 3 = 21%.

*  This means the final charge, 28%, can be represented as 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x

*  Setting up the equation: 0.34x = 0.28

*  Solving for x: x = 0.28 / 0.34 
*  x ≈ 0.82 or 82%




The power bank's charge when Maria went to the park was approximately **82%**.

*  She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals, meaning she sold 2x small stuffed animals.
*  Her earnings from the small stuffed animals would be 2x * $4 = $8x.

Marcus has a few ways to avoid doing his homework:

* **Substitute Teacher:** There's a 50% chance he'll have a sub who won't collect it.
* **Extension:** Even with the regular teacher, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.
* **Dog Ate It:** If no one gets an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate it.

To figure out the chance he *has* to do his homework, we need to find the opposite: the chance he *doesn't* avoid it.

Let's think about the scenarios where he *does* have to do his homework:

* **Regular Teacher, No Extension, No Dog Excuse:** This is the most likely scenario where he has to do it.

Let's calculate the probability of this happening:

*  Probability of regular teacher: 50%
*  Probability of no extension: 60% (100% - 40%)
*  Probability of no dog excuse: 80% (100% - 20%)

So, the probability of all three happening is: 50% * 60% * 80% = 24%

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Find the number of boxes:** Nik has 200 crayons and puts 8 crayons in each box, so he'll need 200 crayons / 8 crayons/box = 25 boxes.

* **Calculate the weight of the crayons:**  200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces.

* **Calculate the weight of the boxes:** Each box weighs 8 ounces, and he has 25 boxes, so the boxes weigh 8 ounces/box * 25 boxes = 200 ounces.

* **Find the total weight:** The crayons and boxes together weigh 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.

* **Convert ounces to pounds:** There are 16 ounces in a pound, so 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

"Let's break this problem down step by step!

First, we know Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at a certain speed and 1 mile on the sidewalk at twice that speed.  We're given that she spends 40 minutes on the beach.

To find her speed on the beach, we can use the formula:

*Speed = Distance / Time*

So, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed there is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now we can find the time she spends on the sidewalk:

*Time = Distance / Speed*

So, her time on the sidewalk is 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

Finally, to get the total time for her 3-mile walk, we add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:

*Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk*

*Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes*

*  We know the red rope is four times as long as the blue rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
*  All three ropes together measure 37 centimeters.

Let's use 'y' to represent the length of the yellow rope.  This means the blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long, and the red rope is 4 * (y - 7) centimeters long.

Now we can set up an equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

So the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.

So, he's really making a net of 12 snowballs each hour (20 snowballs - 8 snowballs = 12 snowballs).

To get to 60 snowballs, it will take him 5 hours (60 snowballs / 12 snowballs/hour = 5 hours).

* Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she's currently 9 years old.
* James is twice Dora's age, making him 18 years old.
* John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.
* John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.
* In 3 years, his youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Let's figure this out!

Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes and Jane every 4 minutes.  That means in an hour (60 minutes), Ana will peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.  Jane will peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

So Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Let's figure this out!

* Mark saved $400 * 0.80 = $320 on the radiator.
*  That means he paid $400 - $320 = $80 for the radiator.
* The mechanic's labor cost him 3 hours * $50/hour = $150.
*  In total, Mark paid $80 + $150 = $230.

"Let's figure this out! 

If Farmer Brown has 20 animals and they have a total of 70 legs, we can use a little bit of math to find out how many are chickens. 

*  Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs. 

Let's think about it this way: if all the animals were cows, they would have 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs.  That's more than the 70 legs they actually have. This means there must be some chickens! 


Let me know if you want to try solving it together!

"Let's figure this out!

They have 7 pizzas with 8 slices each, so that's 7 * 8 = 56 slices total.  

With Henry and his 3 friends, there are 4 people sharing.

56 slices divided by 4 people means each person gets 56 / 4 = 14 slices.
