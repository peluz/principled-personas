"Alright, let's break this down.  

Josh spent $80,000 on the house and then put another $50,000 into repairs, for a total investment of $130,000. The repairs increased the house's value by 150%, which is the same as multiplying the original value by 2.5. So the house is now worth $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000.

To find his profit, we subtract his total investment from the new value: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Carla downloads 2 GB every minute, so a 200 GB file would normally take 100 minutes (200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes).

But, she gets interrupted!  She's downloaded 40% of the file, which is 80 GB (200 GB * 40% = 80 GB).  

After the restart, she has to download the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB).

That'll take another 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes).

Adding the restart time (20 minutes) to the download times, the total time is 120 minutes (100 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes).

* Melanie started with some number of vacuum cleaners, let's call that number 'x'.

* At the green house, she sold x/3 of her vacuum cleaners.

* Then she sold 2 more at the red house.

*  After the green and red houses, she had (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

* At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1 vacuum cleaners.

*  Finally, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. This means: (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

* Simplifying the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5

* Adding 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6

* Multiplying both sides by 3: x = 18

The merchant has two options:

* **Option 1:** Jewelry worth $5,000 that's predicted to increase by 2.5%
* **Option 2:** Electronic gadgets worth $8,000 that are predicted to increase by 1.2%

To figure out the most profitable choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

**Option 1 (Jewelry):**

* Increase in value: $5000 * 0.025 = $125
* Total value at the end of the month: $5000 + $125 = $5125
* Profit: $5125 - $5000 = $125

**Option 2 (Electronic Gadgets):**

* Increase in value: $8000 * 0.012 = $96
* Total value at the end of the month: $8000 + $96 = $8096

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If Kyle got a 25% discount on a book that cost $19.50, we can think of that $19.50 as 75% of the original price (because 100% - 25% = 75%).

To find the original price, we can set up a little equation:

0.75 * original price = $19.50

Divide both sides by 0.75 to isolate the original price:

original price = $19.50 / 0.75

Gretchen has 110 coins total, and 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  If we let 's' represent the number of silver coins, we know there are 's + 30' gold coins.  

Since all the coins add up to 110, we can write the equation: s + (s + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get 2s + 30 = 110.  

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we have 2s = 80.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that s = 40 silver coins.

* Jim watches TV for 2 hours each time, and reads for half that, which is 1 hour.
* So, he spends a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading each time.
* He does this 3 times a week, meaning he spends 3 hours/time * 3 times/week = 9 hours per week.
* Over 4 weeks, that adds up to 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

If they won 8 more games than they lost, we can think of it like this:

*  Let 'L' be the number of games they lost.
*  They won 'L + 8' games.

Since they played a total of 22 games, we have:

* L + (L + 8) = 22

Combining like terms:

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

* We know there are 700 bees total.
* There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens.

Let's think about it step-by-step:

1. **Queens:**  Let's say there are 'q' queen bees.
2. **Babies:** Since there are twice as many babies as queens, there are 2q baby bees.
3. **Workers:**  There are twice as many worker bees as babies, so there are 2 * (2q) = 4q worker bees.

Now we can set up an equation:

q + 2q + 4q = 700

Combine like terms: 7q = 700

Divide both sides by 7: q = 100

So there are 100 queen bees.

Now we can find the number of worker bees:

4q = 4 * 100 = 400


There are **400** worker bees.

Kelly starts with one round trip across the whole field, which is 200 yards. Then she decides to run to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each of those trips is 40 yards * 2 = 80 yards.  So she runs a total of 200 yards + (80 yards/round * 34 rounds) = 200 yards + 2720 yards = 2920 yards.

In two years, they'll both be a couple of years older.  Their ages will add up to 28: (s + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Now we can use a little substitution! Since we know s = 2b, let's plug that into the second equation:

(2b + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Simplify that: 3b + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3b = 24

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

Gary walks around a rectangle-shaped park that's 1.5 miles wide and 6 miles long. To find out how long his walk takes, we need to know the total distance he covers.

First, let's find the perimeter (the total distance around the park):

* Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
* Perimeter = 2 * (6 miles + 1.5 miles)
* Perimeter = 2 * 7.5 miles
* Perimeter = 15 miles

Now we know Gary walks 15 miles.  Since he walks at 3 miles per hour, we can find the time:

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Let's say the small pool had *x* gallons of water 4 minutes ago.  That means the big pool had 2*x* gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons per minute, the small pool now has *x* - 16 gallons, and the big pool has 2*x* - 16 gallons.

We know the big pool now has four times the amount of water as the small pool, so:

2*x* - 16 = 4(*x* - 16)

Let's solve for *x*:

2*x* - 16 = 4*x* - 64
48 = 2*x*
*x* = 24

So the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago.  

Now, subtract the 16 gallons that leaked out: 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* There were 15 women at the start.
*  1/4 of the total people left, so 40 people * (1/4) = 10 people left.
*  We know 22 men stayed, so that means 10 - 22 = -12. This doesn't make sense! It means more men left than women. 

Let's think about this differently. Since 22 men stayed, and there were 25 men to begin with, 25 - 22 = 3 men left.  

That means 10 - 3 = 7 women left.

"Let's break this problem down!

If Mr. Ruther had 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, we can think of it this way: 12.8 hectares represents 2/5 of his original land.  

To find the whole amount, we can set up a proportion:

(2/5) * x = 12.8

Where 'x' is the original amount of land.

Solving for x:

x = 12.8 / (2/5) 
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32 hectares



**Answer:** Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, find out how much energy the AC uses in a day: 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours.

Then, figure out how much energy it uses after Mel reduces the time: 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours.

Now, subtract to find the daily savings: 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours.

Finally, multiply that by 30 days to get the total savings: 4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours.

* **Joanne's Shortest Trees:** Joanne picked half as many apples from the shortest trees as the tallest trees, so she got 30 / 2 = 15 apples.

* **Sister's Tallest Trees:** Joanne's sister picked twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, meaning she picked 30 * 2 = 60 apples.

* **Sister's Shortest Trees:** The sister picked three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she picked 15 * 3 = 45 apples.

* **Sister's Total:**  The sister gathered a total of 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

* **Joanne's Total (Excluding Average):** Joanne picked 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

* **Joanne's Average Apples:** Since the sisters gathered 500 apples total, Joanne must have picked 500 - 105 = 395 apples.  Subtracting her apples from the tallest and shortest trees, she picked 395 - 45 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. 

We know there are 180 heads total and 304 bumps.  Camels have two humps, and dromedaries have one.  

Let's say 'c' is the number of camels and 'd' is the number of dromedaries.  We can set up two equations:

*  c + d = 180  (one head per animal)
*  2c + d = 304 (two humps per camel)

To solve for 'd', we can use a little algebra.  Let's solve the first equation for 'c':

c = 180 - d

Now, substitute that value of 'c' into the second equation:

2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':

360 - 2d + d = 304
-d = -56
d = 56


There are **56** dromedaries in the herd.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

First, we need to make sure we're using the same units. Since the area is in square feet, let's convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in every yard, so a 3-yard length is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now we know the length is 9 feet and the area is 360 square feet.  We can find the width by dividing the area by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Finally, the perimeter of a rectangle is found with the formula: 2 * (length + width).  So, the perimeter is 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

"Let's figure this out!

First, we need to find out how far the horse runs.  It runs at 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour.  So, the horse runs 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats half a bale of hay for every mile, it eats 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so 8 bales cost 8 bales * $3/bale = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is 6 bills * $5/bill = $30.

After buying the hay, Michael will have $30 - $24 = $6 left.

Now we can add up the animals at the farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.

And the animals at the zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Finally, let's add the animals from both places: 40 animals + 80 animals = 120 animals.

"Hey there! Let's break down this food truck's profit.

First, each sandwich costs $0.30 for the bread.  

Then, they spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for every 10 sandwiches.

So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese & condiments) = $33.00

They sell those 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, bringing in $70.00.

Finally, their profit is $70.00 (revenue) - $33.00 (cost) = $37.00

"Let's break this problem down!

*  Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.

*  Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, there are 0.99b red jelly beans.

*  And because there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, there are 1.01b green jelly beans.

*  The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so:  0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500

*  Combining like terms, we get 2.99b = 4500

"Hey there!  Let's break this triangle problem down.

*  Imagine the smallest angle is like a little 'x'.

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Let's combine those 'x's: 6x = 180

To find out what 'x' is, we divide both sides by 6: x = 30

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

If four apples cost $5.20, one apple costs $1.30 ($5.20 / 4 = $1.30).

And since three oranges cost $3.30, one orange costs $1.10 ($3.30 / 3 = $1.10).

So, five apples would cost $6.50 ($1.30 x 5 = $6.50), and five oranges would cost $5.50 ($1.10 x 5 = $5.50).

Together, that's $12.00!

"Let's figure out the total cost of Bill's truck!

* The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.
* Leather seats are one-third the price of the king cab, so they cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
* Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, making them $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
* The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Adding up all the extra features: $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500

Finally, we add the base price of the truck: $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500

*  4s + 2g = 70 (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)

Now we can solve for 's'.  Let's rearrange the first equation to get 'g' by itself:

* g = 20 - s

Substitute that value of 'g' into the second equation:

* 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

* Marta has 3 times the points Tom has, so she has 35 * 3 = 105 points.

Adding up everyone's points, we get 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

To reach the 400 point goal, they need 400 - 255 = 145 more points.

"Let's break this problem down:

*  If the second house needs 'x' cases of shingles, the first house needs half that amount, or x/2.

* The third house needs double the amount the first house needs, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

*  Together, all three houses need 250 cases: (x/2) + x + x = 250

*  Combining like terms, we get 2.5x = 250

*  Solving for x, we find x = 100.

*  Since the third house needs the same number of cases as the second house, it needs 100 cases.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

First, figure out the Llesis family's hiking speed. They hiked 5 miles per hour slower than half their driving speed, which is 50 mph / 2 = 25 mph.  So their hiking speed was 25 mph - 5 mph = 20 mph.

Next, calculate the distance they covered while hiking. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 mph, meaning they hiked 1.5 hours * 20 mph = 30 miles.

Now, determine how long they spent driving. Their total trip was 6 hours, and they hiked for 1.5 hours, so they drove for 6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours.

Finally, calculate the driving distance. They drove at 50 mph for 4.5 hours, covering 50 mph * 4.5 hours = 225 miles.

To find the total distance to their vacation spot, add the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Ava's enemies:** Emma jumps on 'x' enemies, and Ava jumps on 8 more, so Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.
* **Ava's berries:** Emma collects 'y' berries, and Ava collects 3 more, so Ava collects y + 3 berries.
* **Time difference:** Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Now let's think about their scores:

* **Emma's score:** 10 points per enemy + 5 points per berry + 30 points per second left on the timer = (x * 10) + (y * 5) + (timer * 30)
* **Ava's score:** 10 points per enemy + 5 points per berry + 30 points per second left on the timer = (x + 8) * 10 + (y + 3) * 5 + (timer - 4) * 30

To find the difference in their scores, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's score:

[(x + 8) * 10 + (y + 3) * 5 + (timer - 4) * 30] - [(x * 10) + (y * 5) + (timer * 30)]

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

*  Let's say PJ has 'x' Magic Cards.
*  Smendrick has 3 times the amount PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
*  Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total is 341 cards, so:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Let's simplify:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now we know PJ has 47 cards.  Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.


Becca has 153 Magic Cards.

"Let's figure out Milly's loss!

First, calculate the shipping cost:

* Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
* Mileage cost: 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
* Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Next, determine the refund amount:

* Refund: $32 * 0.75 = $24.00

Finally, subtract the refund from the shipping cost to find the loss:

* Total loss: $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00

"Let's figure this out!

* Boris makes 8,000 chocolate bars in the first week.
* The second week, he makes half that amount: 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
* The third week, he makes three times the amount from the first week: 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how many bars he makes in the fourth week, we need to see how many he makes in total over the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Finally, subtract that number from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Angela's installation cost.

She needs 6 mirrors installed (6 - 4 = 2 extra), 2 chandeliers (2 - 1 = 1 extra), and 20 pictures (20 - 10 = 10 extra).

* Extra mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $30.00
* Extra chandeliers: 1 chandelier * $15.00/chandelier = $15.00
* Extra pictures: 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00

Adding those up: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

"Hey there! Let me break this problem down for you. 

*  Let's say my brother is 'b' years old.
*  Since I'm three years younger than him, I'm 'b - 3' years old.

Now, if we add up all our ages, we get 87:

(b - 3) + b + (b - 5) + (3b - 1) = 87

Let's simplify that:

6b - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

* The hospital starts with 1/5 of its 1000 beds occupied, which is 200 beds.
* Over two weeks (14 days), 50 patients are admitted each day, totaling 50 * 14 = 700 new patients.
*  That means there are now 200 + 700 = 900 occupied beds.
*  Finally,  1000 total beds - 900 occupied beds = 100 unoccupied beds.


So the answer is **100**.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

* Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'W' Pokemon.
* Stan caught 4 times that amount minus 13, so Stan caught (4W - 13) Pokemon.
* Alex caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan, so Alex caught (4W - 13) + 5 = (4W - 8) Pokemon.

Together they caught 339 Pokemon, so:

W + (4W - 13) + (4W - 8) = 339

Combining like terms:

9W - 21 = 339

Adding 21 to both sides:

9W = 360

Dividing both sides by 9:

W = 40

Now we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon.  

Stan caught 4 times that amount minus 13:

(4 * 40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147

So Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

"Let's figure this out!

First, we need to figure out how many plants Pat needs.  Her flower bed is 111 feet long, and each plant needs 12 inches of space plus 1.5 feet (18 inches) of space between them.  That means she needs 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches of space for the plants themselves.  

Then we subtract the space between the plants: 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.  

Now we can see how many plants she needs: 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants. Since Pat can't buy half a plant, she needs to buy 110 plants.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants.

*  Maria's power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours, totaling a loss of 45%.
*  Then, it lost 7% per hour for 3 hours, for a total loss of 21%.

*  This means the power bank lost a total of 45% + 21% = 66% of its charge.

*  Since the power bank had 28% remaining, its initial charge must have been 100% - 28% = 72%.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

The price of carrots goes up by 5% each year.  So, in the first year, the price increases by $120 * 0.05 = $6. That means they'll cost $126.

The next year, the price goes up another 5% on that new price: $126 * 0.05 = $6.30.  So now they cost $132.30.

And in the third year, it's another 5% increase: $132.30 * 0.05 = $6.615.  

Adding that to the price, we get $138.915.  Rounding that to the nearest dollar, the carrots will cost $139.

"Let's break this problem down:

*  If a small stuffed animal costs $4, Teresa made $4 times the number of small stuffed animals sold.
*  She made twice as much from small stuffed animals as large ones.
*  Let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Now we can set up an equation:

* Earnings from small stuffed animals: 2x * $4 = $8x
* Earnings from large stuffed animals: x * $12 = $12x
* Total earnings: $8x + $12x = $120

Combining like terms:

* $20x = $120

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Marcus has a 50% chance of having a substitute teacher who won't collect homework.  If his regular teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. Even if no one gets an extension, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing her his dog ate it.

So, to figure out the chance he *has* to do the homework, we need to think about when he *doesn't* get out of it.

*  He won't have to do it if he has the substitute.
*  He won't have to do it if his teacher gives an extension.
*  He won't have to do it if he convinces her about the dog.

Let's calculate those chances:

*  Substitute teacher: 50%
*  Teacher gives extension: 40%
*  Dog ate it excuse: 20%

Now, we need to figure out the chances of *none* of those happening. That's:

*  (100% - 50%) * (100% - 40%) * (100% - 20%) = 30% * 60% * 80% = 14.4%

Finally, to get the chance he *does* have to do the homework, we subtract that from 100%:

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find the area of each wall:

* The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so each is 80 square feet (10 x 8 = 80).
* The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so each is 40 square feet (5 x 8 = 40).

Now, let's add up the area of all the walls:

*  (80 sq ft x 2) + (40 sq ft x 2) = 160 sq ft + 80 sq ft = 240 sq ft

Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we'll need 12 gallons (240 sq ft / 20 sq ft/gallon = 12 gallons).

* **Beach Speed:** Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, so her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

* **Sidewalk Speed:** She walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, meaning her speed there is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

* **Sidewalk Time:**  She walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at 0.1 miles per minute, so it takes her 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

* **Total Time:**  Adding the beach time and sidewalk time, her total walk time is 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

John spends $60 on each of his 10 bottles of scotch, so that's a total of $600.  He then buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which cost 50% more than the scotch.  That means each cognac bottle costs $60 * 1.50 = $90.

Since he buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac, his total cognac cost is 20 * $90 = $1800.

Adding the cost of the scotch and cognac, John spends a total of $600 + $1800 = $2400.

On his first day, he planted 20 White Oak trees and twice that amount of Lodgepole Pine, which is 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine.

On the second day, he added 10 more White Oak trees to his total, bringing it to 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak.  He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine than the first day, so that's (1/4) * 40 + 40 = 10 + 40 = 50 Lodgepole Pine.

* **On land:** He hops at 20 yards per minute, so 100 yards will take him 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

* **In water:** He swims at 10 yards per minute, so 100 yards will take him 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

* **Total time:**  5 minutes (land) + 10 minutes (water) = 15 minutes.
