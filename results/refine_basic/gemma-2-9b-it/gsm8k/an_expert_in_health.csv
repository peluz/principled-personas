"It sounds like Kylar is getting ready to furnish his new apartment!  

To figure out the cost of his glasses, let's break it down:

* **Every other glass is discounted:** This means he'll pay the full price for some and a reduced price for others.
* **Think in pairs:**  He'll buy glasses in pairs, with one full-price and one discounted.

Since he's buying 16 glasses, he'll have 8 pairs.  Each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8.

Therefore, the total cost for 16 glasses is 8 * $8 = $64.

"Let's break down this problem to understand how long it takes Carla to download the file. 

First, we need to figure out how long it takes to download the entire file at her normal speed: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

However, the Windows update throws a wrench in the works!  She's already downloaded 40% of the file, which is 200 GB * 0.40 = 80 GB.

Now, she has to start over, so she needs to download the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).  

At her normal speed, this will take 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Finally, we add the time spent on the initial download (40 minutes) and the time lost due to the restart (20 minutes) to get the total time: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.



**Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.**

"It sounds like Eliza is working hard!  To figure out her earnings, we need to break it down:

* **Regular Pay:**  Eliza earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours. So, her regular pay is 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

* **Overtime Pay:**  She works 5 extra hours (45 total hours - 40 regular hours = 5 overtime hours).  Since overtime is 1.2 times her regular rate, she earns $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour for overtime.  Her overtime pay is 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

* **Total Earnings:**  Adding her regular pay and overtime pay, Eliza earns $400 + $60 = $460 this week.

"To figure this out, we need to focus on the water content in each drink and how it changes when combined. 

First, let's calculate the water in each drink:

* **Orange Drink:** Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 liters = 6.67 liters of water.
* **Pineapple Drink:** Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 liters = 9 liters of water.

Now, remember that one liter of orange drink was spilled, so we have 6.67 liters - 1 liter = 5.67 liters of water from the orange drink remaining.

Finally, add the water from both drinks to find the total water in the mixture: 5.67 liters + 9 liters = 14.67 liters. 



**Therefore, there are 14.67 liters of water in the final mixture.**

To figure out how much shorter the candle gets, we need to know how long it burns.  Since it melts 2 centimeters per hour, and it burns for four hours, it will be 8 centimeters shorter. 



"
"To figure this out, we need to think about percentages.  A 25% discount means Kyle paid 75% of the original price.  

Let's say the original price was $100.  A 25% discount would be $25, leaving him to pay $75.  

We know he paid $19.50, which is 75% of the original price.  We can set up a proportion to find the original price:

75/100 = $19.50 / x

To solve for x (the original price), we can cross-multiply:

75 * x = 100 * $19.50

75x = $1950

x = $1950 / 75

x = $26.00

"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we need to understand the relationship between his current age and Darrell's.  

We know their ages are in the ratio 7:11. This means for every 7 years Darrell ages, Allen ages 11 years.  

Since their combined age is 162, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.  Let's say Darrell's current age is 7a and Allen's is 11a.  

We know: 7a + 11a = 162

Combining like terms: 18a = 162

Solving for 'a': a = 9

Now we can find Allen's current age: 11a = 11 * 9 = 99

Finally, to find Allen's age in 10 years, simply add 10: 99 + 10 = 109


**Allen's age in 10 years will be 109.**

"It sounds like Gretchen is quite the coin collector!  To figure out how many gold coins she has, we need to think about the relationship between her gold coins and silver coins.  

Let's break it down:

* **We know:** Gretchen has 110 coins total.
* **We also know:** She has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

To solve this, we can use a little bit of algebra.  Let's say 'x' represents the number of silver coins.  Since she has 30 more gold coins than silver, she has 'x + 30' gold coins.

Now we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  

To find the number of gold coins, we add 30:

40 + 30 = 70


**Gretchen has 70 gold coins.**

"To figure this out, let's break down Dana's movement:

* **Running:**  We know skipping is half her running speed, and she skips at 3 mph. So, she runs at 3 mph * 2 = 6 mph.
* **Walking:**  She runs four times faster than she walks, meaning her walking speed is 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph.
* **Time Breakdown:**  She spends one-third of her time running (6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours) and two-thirds walking (6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours).
* **Distance Calculation:**
    * Running distance: 2 hours * 6 mph = 12 miles
    * Walking distance: 4 hours * 1.5 mph = 6 miles

"To ensure the safety of the delivery truck and its occupants, we need to carefully consider the weight distribution.  

The bridge has a weight limit, and we need to make sure the truck doesn't exceed that.  

Let's break down the problem:

* **Truck and Driver:** 3755 pounds
* **Bridge Limit:** 5000 pounds
* **Weight Allowance:** 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds

"To figure this out, let's think about it like this:

*  We know the team played a total of 22 games.
*  They won a certain number of games, and they lost a certain number of games.
*  We're told they won 8 *more* games than they lost.

Let's use a little algebra to represent this:

* Let 'L' stand for the number of games they lost.
* Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won 'L + 8' games.

Now we can set up an equation:

*  L + (L + 8) = 22

This equation says that the number of games lost plus the number of games won equals the total number of games played.

Let's solve for L:

* 2L + 8 = 22
* 2L = 14
* L = 7

So, they lost 7 games.  To find out how many they won, we add 8:

* 7 + 8 = 15



They won **15** games.

"To figure this out, we need to think about ratios.  If Marilyn's record sales were 10 times Harald's, we can represent Harald's sales as ""x"".  Marilyn's sales would then be ""10x"".  

Since their combined sales were 88,000, we can set up an equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combining like terms:

11x = 88,000

To isolate x, we divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000


Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.

"It's great that Christina is planning a party!  

To figure out the cost of the gift bags, we need to know how many guests she'll actually have. Since 1/4 of the invited guests usually don't show up, she can expect 3/4 of her 16 friends to attend.  

That means she'll have 16 * (3/4) = 12 guests.

She needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, so she'll need 12 * 0.75 = 9 gift bags.

With each gift bag costing $2, the total cost will be 9 * $2 = $18.

* **Dropped cookies:** He dropped 5 cookies.

Let's work backward:

1. **Before dropping cookies:** He had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.
2. **Before the extra cookies:** He baked 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Since he baked twice as many cookies this year compared to last year, we can say:

* **This year's cookies (100) = 2 * Last year's cookies**

To find last year's cookies, divide this year's total by 2:

* **Last year's cookies = 100 / 2 = 50**




**Answer:** Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"It seems like Sasha is trying to make some extra money by selling her leftover lumber!  While I'm an expert in health, I can help with this calculation. 

To figure out her profit, we need to know the selling price of each board type.  

* **2x4 boards:**  She bought them for $10 each, and prices have increased by 50%.  That means each 2x4 now sells for $10 * 1.50 = $15.

* **4x4 boards:** She bought them for $16 each, and prices have increased by 50%. That means each 4x4 now sells for $16 * 1.50 = $24.

Now let's calculate her total earnings and profit:

* **Earnings from 2x4 boards:** 10 boards * $15/board = $150
* **Earnings from 4x4 boards:** 5 boards * $24/board = $120
* **Total Earnings:** $150 + $120 = $270
* **Total Cost:** $100 (2x4s) + $80 (4x4s) = $180
* **Profit:** $270 - $180 = $90

"To figure this out, we need to understand the concept of ratios in cooking.  A ratio of 7:13 means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.  

Think of it like this: the ratio represents a proportion.  If we know the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, we can set up a proportion to find out how much sugar was used.  

Let 'x' represent the number of teaspoons of sugar.  We can set up the following proportion:

7/13 = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7 * 120 = 13 * x

840 = 13x

Now, divide both sides by 13 to isolate x:

x = 64.62 (approximately)



**Therefore, Katy used approximately 64.62 teaspoons of sugar.**

"To determine the hospital's profit, we need to consider the revenue generated from patient visits and the costs associated with the doctors' services. 

The hospital earns $200 per hour for each patient visit.  With 500 patients seen daily, and an average visit length of 24 minutes (or 0.4 hours), the hospital's revenue is:

* 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient * $200/hour = $40,000

The hospital pays the doctors $150 per hour.  Since the doctors work for 200 hours collectively, their total earnings are:

* 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

Therefore, the hospital's profit is:

* $40,000 (revenue) - $30,000 (doctor's earnings) = $10,000

"To figure out the number of worker bees, we need to understand the relationships within the hive.  

* **Queens:**  These are the essential reproductive females.
* **Babies:** These are the developing bees, eventually becoming either workers or new queens.
* **Workers:** These are the busy bees responsible for all the hive's tasks, like collecting nectar, building comb, and caring for the young.

The problem tells us there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens.  Let's think about this logically:

If we start with a small number of queens, the number of babies and then workers will increase proportionally.  

To find the exact number of worker bees, we'd need a bit more information or a way to work through the relationships mathematically.

To figure out the total number of fish they caught, we need to be careful about what counts as a ""fish."" Starfish are actually echinoderms, not fish. Sea horses are also fish, and clownfish are definitely fish. 

So, let's focus on the sea horses and clownfish:

* Anakin caught 6 sea horses and 3 clownfish, for a total of 6 + 3 = 9 fish.
* Locsin caught 3 sea horses and 5 clownfish, for a total of 3 + 5 = 8 fish.

Together, they caught 9 + 8 = 17 fish.

"Let's break down this relay race scenario to see how the teams' times compare.

The well-rounded team has a consistent pace with each runner completing their 400-meter leg in 55 seconds.  This means their total time is 4 runners * 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

The other team has a staggered approach, with their runners progressively improving their times.  While this strategy can be effective, it doesn't quite match the consistency of the well-rounded team.  

To determine the winning margin, we need to calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team.  

* Runner 1: 60 seconds
* Runner 2: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
* Runner 3: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
* Runner 4: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Adding these times together, we get 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Therefore, the well-rounded team wins by 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

"Let's break down this probability problem.  

Think of it this way:

* **Rolling a number greater than 3:**  There are three favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of six total possibilities.

* **Rolling two even numbers in a row:**  You need to consider the chance of rolling an even number first, and then another even number.  There are three even numbers, so the probability of rolling one is 3/6 or 1/2.  Since the die rolls are independent events, the probability of rolling two evens in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, to find the difference in probability, subtract the smaller probability from the larger one: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

Finally, convert that fraction to a percentage: (1/4) * 100% = 25%.




**Answer:** 25%

"To determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ten ducks, we need to consider their weekly needs. Ducks require 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive.  

Therefore, a flock of ten ducks would need 35 pounds of insects per week (3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds).

Dividing the weekly requirement by seven days gives us the daily requirement: 5 pounds per day (35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds/day).

"It sounds like Tom is trying to create a sustainable tree population!  To figure out how many trees he has left, we need to consider a few things:

* **Growth:** He plants 10 trees each year and removes 2, resulting in a net gain of 8 trees per year.
* **Time:** Over 10 years, this means he adds 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees to his initial amount.
* **Mortality:**  Unfortunately, some trees will die.  A 30% mortality rate means he loses 30/100 * 130 trees = 39 trees.

Therefore, after 10 years, Tom will have 130 trees (initial + growth) - 39 trees (mortality) = 91 trees left.

"It sounds like Sloane is doing some great observational work!  To figure out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to work backward. 

* We know she had a total of 500 customers by the third day.
* On the second day, she counted 50 more than the first day. 
* Let's represent the number of customers on the first day as ""x"".  

So, the number of customers on the second day would be ""x + 50"".

The total for all three days is: x + (x + 50) + 500 = 500

Simplifying the equation: 2x + 50 = 500

Subtracting 50 from both sides: 2x = 450

Dividing both sides by 2: x = 225

This means Sloane counted 225 customers on the first day.  

Now we can find the number of customers on the second day: 225 + 50 = 275

Finally, the total number of customers on the third day is 500 - 225 - 275 = **0**

"It sounds like Jerry's dealing with a frustrating situation!  While I'm a health expert, I can help with this logic puzzle. 

Let's break it down:

* **Let 's' represent the amount of water the small pool has now.**

* **Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the water of the small pool.**  This means the big pool had 2s gallons.

* **Both pools leak at 4 gallons per minute.**  Over four minutes, each pool lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

* **Now, the big pool has four times the water of the small pool.** This means 2s - 16 = 4(s - 16)

**Let's solve for 's':**

* 2s - 16 = 4s - 64
* 48 = 2s
* s = 24


**Answer:** The small pool now has 24 gallons of water.

"To calculate the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to first determine their ages in three years. 

Harriet is currently 21, so in three years she will be 24.  Since Adrian is three times Harriet's age, he will be 24 * 3 = 72 years old.  

Zack is twice Harriet's age, meaning he is currently 21 * 2 = 42 years old. In three years, Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

Finally, to find the average age of the three in three years, we sum their ages and divide by three: (24 + 45 + 72) / 3 = 45.


**Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years will be 45.**

"It's great that you're interested in understanding fruit consumption!  To figure out the total number of fruits, let's break down the information:

* **Andrea:** We know Andrea has 52 apples.  
* **Jamal:** We know Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.  Since we don't know how many apples Jamal has, we can't directly calculate his bananas.  
* **Relationship:** We also know Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.

To solve this, we need to find a way to relate Andrea's apples to Jamal's bananas.  

Let's think about it this way:

* If Andrea has 52 apples, and Jamal has 8 more apples than her, Jamal has 52 + 8 = 60 apples.
* Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, he has 60 + 4 = 64 bananas.
* Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 64 / 2 = 32 bananas.

Now we can calculate the total fruits for each person:

* **Andrea:** 52 apples + 32 bananas = 84 fruits
* **Jamal:** 60 apples + 64 bananas = 124 fruits

Finally, to find the total number of fruits, we add their amounts: 84 + 124 = 208 fruits.

"It seems like you're interested in the financial well-being of these young ladies!  While I'm an expert in health, I can help with this math problem. 

Let's break it down:

* Carmen has $100.
* Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so she has $100 + $25 = $125.
* Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, meaning she has $125 + $50 = $175.

To find the total amount of money they have together, we add it all up: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

"It sounds like Mrs. Cruz is carefully considering the financial aspects of buying a new home!  It's great that she's thinking about all the costs involved, not just the initial selling price.  

To figure out how much more the total price is than her budget, we need to add up the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.  

* **Brokerage fee:** 5% of $350,000 is (0.05) * $350,000 = $17,500
* **Transfer fee:** 12% of $350,000 is (0.12) * $350,000 = $42,000

The total additional costs are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500.

Adding that to the selling price, the total cost of the house is $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.

Finally, to see how much more that is than her budget, we subtract: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"It seems you're interested in understanding financial transactions! While I'm an expert in health, I can still help with this calculation.  

To figure out Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to subtract all his expenses from the selling price of his house:

* **Selling price:** $400,000
* **Transfer fees:** 3% of $400,000 = $12,000
* **Brokerage fees:** 5% of $400,000 = $20,000
* **Remaining loan amount:** $250,000

**Total expenses:** $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

"It sounds like you're trying to figure out a pattern!  

To solve this, we need to work our way through the problem step-by-step:

* **Start with the total:** Carly had 80 cards.
* **Find the cards with 'A':**  2/5 of the cards had 'A', so that's (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.
* **Cards left:**  Subtract the 'A' cards from the total: 80 - 32 = 48 cards.
* **Find the cards with 'B':** Half of the remaining cards had 'B', so that's (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.
* **Cards left again:** Subtract the 'B' cards: 48 - 24 = 24 cards.
* **Find the cards with 'C':** 5/8 of the remaining cards had 'C', so that's (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

"It's wonderful that Mico and Marco are getting to know each other!  

To figure out the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to remember that everyone ages by the same amount each year. Since they are currently 20 years old combined, in 10 years they will each be 10 years older.  

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 20 + 20 = 40. 



"
"To figure this out, let's think about how age works.  

Let's say Sam is ""S"" years old right now.  Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, Ruby is 6S years old.

In nine years, Sam will be S + 9 years old. Ruby will be 6S + 9 years old.  We know that in nine years, Ruby will be three times as old as Sam.  This means:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now we can solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27
3S = 18
S = 6


Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To figure this out, we need to first determine the number of spots on each type of snake.  

* **Mambas:** Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 spots / 2 = 35 spots.

* **Total Cobra Spots:**  With 40 cobras, the total number of spots on cobras is 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots.

* **Total Mamba Spots:** With 60 mambas, the total number of spots on mambas is 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots.

* **Combined Spots:**  The total number of spots on all the snakes is 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots.

"It's important to understand that ingesting experimental serums is incredibly dangerous and can have unpredictable consequences for the human body.  

That said, if we were to hypothetically analyze the effects of this serum, we'd need to consider the rate of limb growth and the duration of the experiment.  

Assuming the serum consistently adds limbs at the stated rates, a person would grow a new arm every three days and a new leg every five days.  Over a period of fifteen days, the number of new limbs would depend on how many full cycles of these growth periods occur within that timeframe.

* **Defense:** This is our starting point. Let's call the number of defensive players ""D"".

* **Offense:** We know there are twice as many offensive players as defensive players, so there are 2D offensive players.

* **Special Teams:**  There are half as many special teams players as defensive players, meaning there are D/2 special teams players.

* **Total:**  Adding up all the players, we get D + 2D + D/2 = 105

Now we can solve for D:

1. Combine like terms: (5/2)D = 105
2. Multiply both sides by 2/5: D = 42



**Therefore, there are 42 players on the defense.**

"It sounds like Martha is having a bit of a party planning challenge!  To figure out how many people are actually at her Christmas gathering, we need to consider those who couldn't make it.  

It's important to remember that illness can be contagious, so it's great that those who are sick are staying home to prevent spreading germs.  

Let's focus on the numbers:

* Martha invited 24 people in total.
* 10 people couldn't attend due to illness or prior commitments.

Therefore, 24 - 10 = 14 people are likely at Martha's party.

"It's great that Solomon is collecting marbles!  

To figure out the total weight, we need to know how many marbles he has in total.  He starts with 50 marbles, gets 20 more from Johanna, and then his father gives him 2/5 of the amount he got from Johanna, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8 marbles.

Adding all those up, Solomon has 50 + 20 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2 kgs, the total weight of his marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"It sounds like you're planning a refreshing dip!  

To figure out the cost of filling your pool, we need to know its volume.  

* **Volume = length x width x depth**

Let's plug in the numbers:

* Volume = 6 feet x 4 feet x 5 feet
* Volume = 120 cubic feet

Now, knowing the cost per cubic foot is $0.10, we can calculate the total cost:

* **Total Cost = Volume x Price per cubic foot**
* Total Cost = 120 cubic feet x $0.10/cubic foot
* Total Cost = $12.00

"It's great that you're interested in understanding classroom demographics!  

To figure out the total number of children, we need to consider all the different groups: boys, girls, and those who identify as nongendered.  

* **Boys:** We know there are 30 boys.
* **Girls:** Since there are three times as many girls as boys, there are 30 * 3 = 90 girls.
* **Nongendered:** There are 1/10 the number of nongendered children compared to boys, so there are 30 * (1/10) = 3 nongendered children.

Finally, to find the total number of children, we add up all the groups: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 children.

"Let's break this problem down to understand the relationship between electric poles and wires.  

Think of it like this: each electric pole needs to be connected to a certain number of wires to distribute electricity to homes.  The ratio 1:3 tells us that for every one pole, there are three wires.

If we know there are 45 wires needed in total, we can figure out how many poles are required.  Since each pole needs 3 wires, we divide the total number of wires by 3: 45 wires / 3 wires per pole = 15 poles. 



**Therefore, the electric company needs 15 electric poles.**

"It's great that Shannon is enjoying iced coffee!  

To figure out how much weaker her coffee is, we need to consider both the ice and the cream.  Each ice cube dilutes the coffee by 12 milliliters, and she uses enough to cool it by 65 degrees.  

Let's break it down:

* **Ice dilution:** 65 degrees cooled / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes.
* **Total dilution from ice:** 5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters per ice cube = 60 milliliters.

* **Cream dilution:**  She adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also dilutes the coffee.

* **Total dilution:** 60 milliliters (ice) + 15 milliliters (cream) = 75 milliliters.



Shannon's iced coffee is **75 milliliters** weaker.

"To figure this out, let's think about it like this:

*  We know there are 200 students total.
*  Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the third group is smaller.

Let's say the two equal groups each have 'x' students.  The smaller group would then have 'x - 10' students.

Adding up the number of students in all three groups, we get:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 70

So, each of the larger groups has 70 students.  The smaller group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"To determine the total number of legs, we need to consider the number of legs each animal type has. 

* Cows have 4 legs.
* Chickens have 2 legs.

Let's assume there are 'c' cows and 'h' chickens. We know:

*  c + h = 60  (total animals)

We also need to figure out the relationship between the number of cows and chickens.  The problem states there are twice as many chickens as cows, so:

* h = 2c

Now we can substitute '2c' for 'h' in the first equation:

* c + 2c = 60

Combining like terms:

* 3c = 60

Dividing both sides by 3:

* c = 20 cows

Now we can find the number of chickens:

* h = 2 * 20 = 40 chickens

Finally, calculate the total number of legs:

* Cows: 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs
* Chickens: 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs
* Total legs: 80 legs + 80 legs = 160 legs

"It sounds like Ethan is trying to save some money by making his own wallpaper!  While I'm an expert in health, I can help with this math problem. 

To figure out the total cost of Ethan's DIY wallpaper, we need to know how much he saved.  He saved 20% of the original $400 price.  

Let's calculate that:

* 20% of $400 = (20/100) * $400 = $80

So, Ethan saved $80 by making his own wallpaper.  

To find the total cost, we subtract his savings from the original price:

* $400 - $80 = $320


**Therefore, the total cost of Ethan's hand-painted wallpaper was $320.**

"It's great that Millie is starting a lemonade stand!  

While I'm a health expert, I can help with the financial side of things. To figure out Millie's profit per hour, we need to consider her costs and earnings. 

* **Costs:** Millie spent $18 on supplies.
* **Earnings:** She sells each cup for $1 and sells an average of 4 cups per hour, so she earns $1 * 4 = $4 per hour.

* **Profit:** Her profit per hour is $4 (earnings) - $18 (cost) = -$14. 

It looks like Millie is actually losing $14 per hour she runs her lemonade stand.  She might want to consider raising her prices or finding ways to reduce her costs to make a profit.

"It's great that Mel is looking to reduce his energy consumption!  

To figure out his savings, we need to understand how much energy his air conditioner uses.  

* **First, calculate the daily energy usage:**  The air conditioner uses 900 watts for 8 hours a day, so that's 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours.

* **Next, calculate the new daily energy usage:**  After reducing the time by 5 hours, he'll use it for 3 hours a day, which is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours.

* **Find the daily energy savings:**  Subtract the new usage from the old usage: 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours.

* **Calculate the savings over 30 days:** Multiply the daily savings by 30 days: 4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours.

* **Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours:**  Divide the total watt-hours by 1000: 135,000 watt-hours / 1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours.



Mel will save **135 kilowatt-hours** of energy in 30 days.

"It's great that Allan is enjoying cannolis and corn!  To figure out the total, we need to make sure we're talking about healthy portions.  

While both can be part of a balanced diet, it's important to remember:

* **Cannolis** can be high in sugar, so enjoying them in moderation is key. 
* **Corn** is a good source of fiber and nutrients, but it's best to choose whole-grain varieties. 

Let's focus on the numbers:

*  Allan starts with 40 cannolis and buys 60 more, for a total of 100 cannolis.
*  He has twice as many corns as cannolis initially, meaning he has 40 cannolis * 2 = 80 corns.
*  Then he buys 40 fewer corns than cannolis, so he has 100 cannolis - 40 = 60 corns.

Adding his corns and cannolis together, Allan has 80 corns + 60 corns = 140 corns and cannolis.

"It's important to prioritize safety when it comes to candles.  While a 99% guarantee against explosions sounds reassuring, any risk of a candle exploding is concerning.  

To determine the number of candles that might both explode and have an unpleasant odor, we need to consider the probability of both events happening.  Unfortunately, the information provided doesn't give us enough details to accurately calculate this. 

We know:

* **Explosion Rate:** 1% of the candles are expected to explode.
* **Odor Rate:** 5% of the candles with defects smell like wet dog.

However, we don't know if the defect that causes the odor is related to the potential for explosion.  

**To get a reliable answer, we'd need to know:**

* **Is the defect that causes the odor a contributing factor to the risk of explosion?**  If so, we could potentially calculate the overlap.
* **What is the overall defect rate for the candles?** This would help us understand the likelihood of any given candle having a defect. 


Without this additional information, it's impossible to say for sure how many candles would both explode and smell like wet dog.

"It sounds like Misha is getting a great deal on some new blouses!  To figure out the total cost, we need to know the sale price of each blouse.  

Since each blouse is 30% off the regular $20 price, we can calculate the discount: $20 * 0.30 = $6.

Then, subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price: $20 - $6 = $14.

Finally, multiply the sale price by the number of blouses to get the total cost: $14 * 4 = $56. 



"
"It's great that Joanne and her sister are enjoying the bounty of their family orchard!  To figure out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, let's break down the information:

* **Joanne's Apples:** We know Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half that amount (15) from the shortest trees. 
* **Sister's Apples:** Her sister gathered twice as many from the tallest trees (60) and three times as many from the shortest trees (45) as Joanne.
* **Combined Total:** Together, they gathered 500 apples.

To find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Joanne's total apples from the tallest and shortest trees:** 30 + 15 = 45 apples.
2. **Calculate the sister's total apples:** 60 + 45 = 105 apples.
3. **Calculate Joanne's apples from the average trees:** 500 (total) - 105 (sister's apples) = 395 apples.
4. **Subtract Joanne's apples from the tallest and shortest trees:** 395 - 45 = 350 apples.




**Answer:** Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. 
"
"To determine the number of dromedaries, we need to consider the unique characteristic of each animal.  Camels have two humps, while dromedaries have one.  

Let's think about it this way:

* **Humps:** The total number of humps (304) can be represented as 2 times the number of camels plus the number of dromedaries.

* **Heads:** The total number of heads (180) is simply the number of camels plus the number of dromedaries.

We can set up a system of equations to solve for the number of dromedaries:

*  Let 'c' represent the number of camels
*  Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries

* Equation 1: c + d = 180 
* Equation 2: 2c + d = 304

Solving for 'd' (the number of dromedaries)  involves a bit of algebra.

"It's wonderful that Lillian is creating a welcoming environment for birds in her garden!  To estimate the number of birds she can expect, we need to consider a few things. 

While it's impossible to say for sure how many birds will visit, we can make an educated guess.  

* **Bird feeder type:**  Birds often have preferences for different feeder types and food sources.  It's great that Lillian is providing a variety!
* **Location:** The garden's location and surrounding environment will also influence bird activity. 

Assuming the feeders are well-placed and the birds enjoy the offerings, Lillian could see a significant number of visitors.  

Let's focus on the information given:

* **Homemade feeders:** Attract 30 birds each
* **Store-bought feeders:** Attract 20 birds each

With 3 of each type, we can calculate:

* **Homemade feeder birds:** 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds
* **Store-bought feeder birds:** 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds

**Total estimated birds:** 90 birds + 60 birds = 150 birds



Lillian can likely expect to see around 150 birds in her garden each day.

"It seems like Kenny is making a smart financial decision by selling his Pokemon cards to afford a fun outing!  

To figure out how many cards he started with, we need to think about the math involved.  

Let's break it down:

* **He made enough money to cover the ticket and have spending cash:** This means the money from selling the cards was $100 (ticket) + $50 (spending money) = $150.
* **We know the price per card:** Each card sells for $1.50.
* **To find the total number of cards sold:** Divide the total earnings by the price per card: $150 / $1.50 = 100 cards.

* **He kept a portion of his cards:** Since he kept 1/3, the 100 cards sold represent 2/3 of his original collection.

* **To find the original number of cards:** Divide the number of cards sold by 2/3: 100 cards / (2/3) = 150 cards.

"It's great that Billie is thinking about the dimensions of his room!  To figure out the perimeter, we first need to make sure we're using the same units.  Since the area was given in square feet, let's convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in every yard, so a 3-yard length is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now we know the length is 9 feet and the area is 360 square feet.  We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = length * width

360 square feet = 9 feet * width

width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet

Finally, we can calculate the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)

Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet

Perimeter = 98 feet

* **Elizabeth:** 1 pack of red beads + 2 packs of clear beads = 3 packs total.
* **Margareth:** 3 packs of blue beads + 4 packs of red beads = 7 packs total.

Since each pack has 20 beads, we can find the total for each sister:

* **Elizabeth:** 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
* **Margareth:** 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads

The difference in their bead collections is 140 - 60 = 80 beads. 




"
"It sounds like Marcus is getting a bit toasty in his house!  

To figure out the final temperature, we need to consider the heat from the oven and the cooling effect of the open window. 

* **Oven Heat:**  The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour for 3 hours, so that's a total increase of 15 degrees.
* **Window Cooling:**  The window cools the house 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it's open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, that's a total cooling of 6 degrees.

Now, let's add the initial temperature and the changes:

* Starting temperature: 40 degrees
* Oven heat increase: +15 degrees
* Window cooling decrease: -6 degrees

Final temperature: 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees

"Let's break down this triathlon problem step-by-step to figure out James' run time.

First, we know Jon's times: 40 minutes for swimming, 80 minutes for biking (since 1 hour 20 minutes is 80 minutes), and 50 minutes for running.  

Now, let's look at James' performance:

* **Swimming:** James is 10% faster than Jon in the swim.  That means he saves 10/100 * 40 minutes = 4 minutes. So, James' swim time is 40 minutes - 4 minutes = 36 minutes.
* **Biking:** James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike, so his bike time is 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

We know Jon finished in 170 minutes (40 + 80 + 50) and won by 10 minutes. This means James took 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes to complete the triathlon.

Finally, to find James' run time, subtract his swim and bike times from his total time: 180 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 59 minutes.



**Therefore, it took James 59 minutes to run the triathlon.**

"It sounds like Marissa's class went through a lot of pencils!  To figure out how many are left, we need to think about the pencil usage over the year. 

Let's break it down:

* **Start:** 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils
* **After two months:**  A fifth of the pencils were used, so 300 pencils * (1/5) = 60 pencils were used.
* **Remaining:** 300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils
* **End of year:**  A third of the remaining pencils were left, so 240 pencils * (1/3) = 80 pencils.



**Therefore, 80 pencils were left at the end of the year.**

"To figure this out, we need to think about proportions.  

First, let's convert everything to the same units. Since the shark's length is in feet, let's convert the remoras' length to feet as well:

* 2 remoras * 6 inches/remora = 12 inches
* 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = 1 foot

Now we can easily see that the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot, which is 1/10 the length of the shark.  

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is **10%** of the shark's body length. 


"
"It sounds like we're dealing with a bit of a schoolyard math problem!  

To figure this out, we need to think about fractions. If 3/4 of the students have desktop computers, that means 1/4 of the students don't.  We know 20 students fall into that ""no desktop"" group.  

To find the total number of students, we can think:  If 1/4 of the students is equal to 20, then the whole group (which is 4/4) must be four times larger.  

So, 20 students * 4 = 80 students.

"
"To determine the number of children in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything, we need to consider the overlap in allergies.  

Here's how to approach this:

1. **Identify those allergic to dairy only:** 9 (total dairy allergic) - 3 (both dairy and peanuts) = 6 children

2. **Identify those allergic to peanuts only:** 6 (total peanut allergic) - 3 (both dairy and peanuts) = 3 children

3. **Calculate the total allergic:** 6 + 3 + 3 = 12 children

4. **Subtract the allergic children from the total class size:** 32 - 12 = 20 children




Therefore, 20 children in Gina's class are not allergic to either dairy or peanuts.

"To determine the break-even point for the two venues, we need to consider the total cost at each venue for a given number of guests. 

Venue 1 has a fixed cost of $200 plus an additional $5 per guest for food. Venue 2 charges $25 per guest, which includes food.  

Let's set up an equation to represent the cost at each venue:

* **Venue 1:** $200 + $5x 
* **Venue 2:** $25x

Where 'x' represents the number of guests.

To find the point where the costs are equal, we set the two equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Solving for x:

* Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x
* Divide both sides by $20: x = 10


Therefore,  **10 guests** is the number needed for the two venues to have equal costs.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step to understand the passenger flow on the bus:

* **Start:** The bus begins with 48 passengers.
* **First Stop:** 8 passengers disembark.  This leaves us with 48 - 8 = 40 passengers. Then, 5 times the number who got off board the bus (5 * 8 = 40)  bringing the total to 40 + 40 = 80 passengers.
* **Second Stop:** 21 passengers exit the bus, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers.  Then, 3 times fewer passengers than those who got off board (21 / 3 = 7) bringing the total to 59 + 7 = 66 passengers.



Therefore, there are **66** passengers on the bus after the second stop.

"To determine the age difference, we need to figure out how old Jame's cousin is now.  

We know Jame will be 27 in 5 years, so he's currently 22.  In 8 years, Jame will be 30.  

Let's say Jame's cousin is currently ""c"" years old. In 8 years, his cousin will be c + 8 years old.  The problem tells us that in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age (which will be 30).  

We can set up an equation to represent this:

c + 8 = 2(30) - 5

Simplifying the equation:

c + 8 = 60 - 5
c + 8 = 55
c = 47

So, Jame's cousin is currently 47 years old.  

The age difference between them is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"It sounds like you're describing a fascinating scenario!  

To figure out the angle from the ground to the sun, we need to consider a few things:

* **The sun's path:** The sun moves in an arc across the sky, appearing to rise in the east and set in the west. 
* **The pyramid's angle:** The pyramid's angle of 32 degrees tells us its orientation relative to the ground.
* **The sun's movement:** The sun's movement of 5 degrees per hour is important because it tells us how much the angle between the sun and the ground is changing.

Let's break it down:

1. **Start with the pyramid's angle:**  The sun begins at the tip of the pyramid, so the initial angle is 32 degrees.

2. **Calculate the sun's total movement:** Over 10 hours, the sun moves 5 degrees per hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.

3. **Add the movement to the initial angle:**  The final angle from the ground to the sun is 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.

* **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** This includes the direct costs of making each sandwich.  We know the bread costs $3.00 per loaf and makes 10 sandwiches, so that's $0.30 per sandwich.  Plus, they spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for every 10 sandwiches, which is another $3.00 per sandwich.  So, the total COGS per sandwich is $3.30.

* **Revenue:** They sell each sandwich for $7.00.

* **Profit:** To find the profit per sandwich, we subtract the COGS from the revenue: $7.00 - $3.30 = $3.70.


Since they sell 10 sandwiches, their total profit is $3.70 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $37.00

"To figure this out, we need to think about how age works.  

Let's say Jerry's current age is ""j"".  We know that in 3 years, he'll be j + 3 years old.  

The problem tells us that Jerry's current age is double what he was 5 years ago.  That means his age 5 years ago was j - 5.  

So, we can set up an equation:

j = 2(j - 5)

Now, let's solve for j:

j = 2j - 10
10 = j

This means Jerry is currently 10 years old.  

In 3 years, he will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

"While I'm an expert in health, I can certainly help with this geometry problem! 

Think of a triangle like a healthy body – it needs balance.  The angles inside a triangle always add up to 180 degrees, just like a balanced diet provides all the necessary nutrients.

Let's break down this problem:

*  One angle is twice the smallest angle.
*  Another angle is three times the smallest angle.

This means the angles are related.  If we let the smallest angle be 'x', the other angles are 2x and 3x.

Now, remember that all the angles in a triangle must add up to 180 degrees:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine the 'x' terms: 6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6 to find the value of 'x': x = 30

The largest angle is 3 times the smallest angle, so it measures 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"Let's break this down.  

It's great that Ashley is thinking about her internet speed!  To figure out her connection in Mb per hour, we need to do a little conversion. 

* There are 1000 kilobytes (kb) in 1 megabyte (Mb).
* There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.

So, we can calculate her speed as follows:

20 kb/second * (1 Mb / 1000 kb) * (60 seconds / 1 minute) * (60 minutes / 1 hour) = 7.2 Mb/hour 



Ashley's internet connection speed is **7.2 Mb per hour**.

"To figure this out, let's break it down:

* **First three days:** The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for a total of 10 * 3 = 30 cars.
* **Remaining days:**  It pulled 4 fewer cars each day, meaning 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day.
* **Total for remaining days:** Over the next 4 days, that's 6 * 4 = 24 cars.
* **Grand total:** Adding both parts together, the tow truck pulled 30 + 24 = 54 cars that week.

"To determine when Adam can ride the roller coaster, we need to figure out how much more he needs to grow.  

Remember, there are 12 inches in a foot.  The roller coaster requires a height of 4 feet, which is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Adam is currently 40 inches tall.  He needs to grow 48 - 40 = 8 more inches.

If he grows 2 inches each year, it will take him 8 / 2 = 4 years to reach the required height.

"To figure this out, let's break it down:

*  The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, which means the extended length is 150% of the original.
*  We know the final length (including the lace trim) is 140cm.  
*  Let 'x' represent the original length of the dress.

We can set up an equation:

1.50x + 20cm = 140cm

Now, solve for x:

1.50x = 120cm
x = 80cm 



The original length of the dress was **80cm**.

"To figure this out, let's think about the ages in a way that makes sense for health and development.  

We know there's a 7-year age difference between a twin and a triplet.  Since we're dealing with children, it's likely the twin is older.  

When we consider the combined age of 44,  it's reasonable to assume the twins are closer in age than the triplets.  

Let's try a few scenarios, keeping in mind the 7-year difference:

* If one triplet is 6, the twin would be 13. This seems like a plausible age difference for twins and triplets.



**Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.**

"Let's break down John's vet bill:

* **Vaccines:** Two vaccines at $20 each cost $40.
* **Heartworm Check:**  The heartworm check represents 60% of the total bill.  

To find the total bill, we can think of it this way:

* The heartworm check cost is a portion (60%) of the total bill.
*  If we add the vaccine cost ($40) to the heartworm check cost, that equals the total bill.

Let's represent the total bill as 'x'. We know:

* 0.60x = heartworm check cost

So,  $40 + 0.60x = x

Solving for x:

* 0.60x = x - $40
* $40 = 0.40x
* x = $100 

John brought $125 and his bill was $100, so he leaves with $25.

"To figure out how many points the class needs, let's break it down:

* **Betty's points:**  We know Adam has 50 points, and Betty did better, collecting 30% more. That means Betty has 50 + (50 * 0.30) = 65 points.

* **Tom's points:** Tom has 30 fewer points than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

* **Marta's points:** Marta collected three times the amount Tom did, so she has 35 * 3 = 105 points.

* **Total class points:**  Adding up everyone's points, we get 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

"To determine the average time it takes for the cat and dog to eat the sausages, we need to consider their individual eating rates. 

The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes, meaning it consumes sausages at a rate of 0.3 sausages per minute (9 sausages / 30 minutes).

The dog eats the same number of sausages in 20 minutes, meaning it consumes sausages at a rate of 0.45 sausages per minute (9 sausages / 20 minutes).

Since we're looking for the average time, we need to find the combined time it takes for both animals to eat the sausages.  

Let's assume they eat simultaneously.  

The average time would be the total time divided by the number of animals.

"To figure this out, we need to think about the relationship between the votes.  

Let's say 'x' represents the number of votes against the regulation. Since there were twice as many votes in favor, that means there were 2x votes in favor.  

We know the total number of council members is 33, so:

x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms:

3x = 33

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 11

"It seems like Mike is making a big change to his movie collection!  While I'm an expert in health, I can help with the math.  

Let's break down the costs:

* **Series Movies:**  Since he gets a discount on series, we need to figure out how much he'd normally spend on those movies. 600 movies / 3 = 200 series movies.  At $10 per movie, that's 200 * $10 = $2000.  But he gets a discount, so he'll spend $2000 / 6 = $333.33.

* **Older Movies:**  40% of the remaining movies are older, so that's 600 movies * (40/100) = 240 movies.  Those cost $5 each, so that's 240 * $5 = $1200.

* **Remaining Movies:**  That leaves 600 movies - 200 movies - 240 movies = 160 movies.  Those cost $10 each, so that's 160 * $10 = $1600.

* **Total Cost:**  Adding it all up, the total cost is $333.33 + $1200 + $1600 = $3133.33

"It sounds like Ava and Emma are having some friendly competition!  

To figure out the difference in their scores, we need to break down how points are earned:

* **Enemies:** Each enemy jumped on is worth 10 points.
* **Berries:** Each berry collected is worth 5 points.
* **Timer:**  They get 30 points for every second left on the timer.

Let's analyze the information given:

* Ava jumps on 8 *more* enemies than Emma.
* Ava collects 3 *more* berries than Emma.
* Ava finishes 4 seconds *slower* than Emma.

To calculate the difference in their scores, we'd need to know how many enemies each girl jumped on and how many berries each collected.  We also need to know the total time for the level. 

Without that specific information, we can't determine the exact difference in their scores.

"It sounds like you're trying to figure out a budget breakdown for your pizza party!  

To figure out the cost of each of the less expensive pizzas, we need to do a little subtraction.  

First, we know the total cost was $64 and two pizzas cost $30.  

So, the remaining cost for the other two pizzas is $64 - $30 = $34.

Since those two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost in half: $34 / 2 = $17. 


Each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

"To figure this out, let's break down their biking schedule:

*  They ride three times a day for five days, which is a total of 15 rides.
*  Then, they have two days where they double their usual rides, meaning they ride six times each day on those days.
*  That's 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 extra rides.

Adding those together, they ride a total of 15 + 12 = 27 times a week.

"It's great that Bob is expanding his fish collection!  To figure out how many white fish he bought, let's think about the ratios. 

* We know he wants twice as many orange fish as white fish. 
*  This means for every 1 white fish, he wants 2 orange fish.

Let's consider the possibilities:

* If he bought 1 white fish, he'd buy 2 orange fish.
* If he bought 2 white fish, he'd buy 4 orange fish.
* If he bought 3 white fish, he'd buy 6 orange fish.

And so on...

We need to find a combination that adds up to 17 fish total.

* **Fuel Efficiency:** His car gets 10 miles per gallon (MPG).
* **Gas Price:** Gas costs $3 per gallon.

Let's break it down:

1. **Weekly Distance:** 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles
2. **Gallons Used:** 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons
3. **Weekly Cost:** 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

"A diet rich in fruits and vegetables is essential for good health!  Tomatoes and eggplants are both excellent choices, offering various vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. 

To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can harvest, we need to consider the yield of each plant type:

* **Tomatoes:**  Each tomato plant produces 22 tomatoes. With 5 tomato plants, Ricardo can expect 22 * 5 = 110 tomatoes.
* **Eggplants:** Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants. With 8 eggplant plants, Ricardo can expect 4 * 8 = 32 eggplants.

Adding the tomatoes and eggplants together, Ricardo can harvest a total of 110 + 32 = 142 fruits. 


"
"It sounds like Samwell's appliances store is having a great week!  To figure out how many OLED TVs they sold, we need to think about the percentages.  

* Smart TVs make up 1/4 of the sales.
* Analog TVs make up 1/8 of the sales.

That means together, they make up 1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8 of the total sales.

The remaining portion of the sales must be OLED TVs, which is 1 - 3/8 = 5/8 of the total.

Since they sold 40 TVs in total, the number of OLED TVs sold is (5/8) * 40 = 25 TVs.

"To keep those pipes from freezing, Carson needs to make sure the temperature inside the house stays above 32 degrees.  

It sounds like he's facing a pretty chilly night!  Since each log raises the temperature by 5 degrees, we need to figure out how many logs will get the temperature from 12 degrees up to a safe 32 degrees. 

That means he needs to raise the temperature by 20 degrees (32 - 12 = 20).  

So, Carson will need to burn **4** logs. 



"
"It sounds like a fun scavenger hunt!  To figure out how many seashells were brought back, we need to focus on the groups that collected them.  

If 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, and there were 10 groups total, that means 6 groups brought back seashells ( (3/5) * 10 = 6).

Since each of those 6 groups brought back 2 seashells, the total number of seashells is 12 (6 * 2 = 12). 



"
"To figure this out, we need to think about the changes in the number of passengers.  

*  First stop: 47 people leave, then 13 join. That's a net change of 47 - 13 = 34 fewer people.

"It sounds like Bubbles is having fun collecting stuffed animals!  To figure out how many goats she needs, we need to think about percentages.  

A percentage is a way of representing a part of a whole as a fraction of 100.  So, 30% means 30 out of every 100.

If Bubbles wants 30% of her stuffed animals to be goats, we can set up a simple equation:

* 0.30 * (total number of stuffed animals) = number of goats

Let's plug in the number of stuffed animals Bubbles already has:

* 0.30 * 14 = number of goats

* 4.2 = number of goats

Since Bubbles can't buy parts of goats, she'll need to round up to the nearest whole number. 


Bubbles should buy **5** stuffed goats.

"To calculate the overall pass rate, we need to figure out the total number of students who passed and divide that by the total number of students.  

Let's break it down:

* **Third Grade:** 340 out of 500 students passed.
* **Fourth Grade:** 40 out of 100 students passed.
* **Fifth Grade:** The fifth grade pass rate was twice the fourth grade's, meaning 40 * 2 = 80 students passed.

Now, let's add up the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460

Finally, divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students in the school: 460 / 1000 = 0.46

"It sounds like Jack and his friends are having a fun time at the arcade!  

While I'm an expert in health, I can help with this math problem.  To figure out how much money they spent, we need to figure out how many quarters each person used. 

* **Jack:** He plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Since each game costs 1 quarter for 20 minutes, he uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

* **Weaker Friends:** Each of his two weaker friends plays for half as long as Jack, so they each play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter.  They each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters.

* **Stronger Friend:** His stronger friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. They use 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

* **Total:**  Adding up the quarters used by everyone, we get 12 + (24 * 2) + 8 = 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

* **Money Spent:** Since each quarter is worth $0.25, they spent a total of 68 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17.00.

"To figure out how much oil Tanya uses, let's break down the ingredients:

* **Citrus Zest and Fragrance:** These are used in equal amounts.
* **Salt and Sugar:** These are also used in equal amounts.
* **Oil:**  Tanya uses twice the amount of salt as citrus zest and fragrance.

Since all the ingredients go into a 10-ounce jar, we need to figure out the right proportions.  

Think of it this way: if we let 'x' represent the amount of citrus zest and fragrance, then:

* Salt and sugar are also 'x' ounces each.
* Oil is twice the amount of salt, so it's 2 * x = 2x ounces.

To make a 10-ounce jar, the total of all these ingredients must equal 10 ounces: x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combining like terms, we get 5x = 10.  

Dividing both sides by 5, we find x = 2.

Now we know that oil is 2x ounces, so Tanya uses 2 * 2 = 4 ounces of oil in her salt scrub.

* **Joe's starting point:**  We know Joe has double the number of cars Robert has, who has 20 cars. So Joe begins with 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

* **Sales:** Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is the same as (20/100) * 40 = 8 cars.

* **Gifts:** He then gives away twice the number of cars he sold, meaning he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

* **Final count:** To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the sold and gifted cars from his starting amount: 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars.




Joe has 16 cars remaining.

"It seems you're interested in card games! While I'm an expert in health, I can still help with this puzzle.  

To figure out how many cards Becca has, let's break it down:

* **Let's use 'P' for the number of cards PJ has.**
* **Smendrick has three times the amount PJ has, so Smendrick has 3P cards.**
* **Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3P + 12 cards.**

* **We know the total number of cards is 341, so:** P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341

* **Combine like terms:** 7P + 12 = 341

* **Subtract 12 from both sides:** 7P = 329

* **Divide both sides by 7:** P = 47

* **Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find Becca's cards:** 3 * 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

"It seems like Angela is getting her home ready for some beautiful new decor!  While I'm an expert in health, I can help with this calculation.  

Let's break down the cost:

* **Mirrors:** The base price covers 4 mirrors, and Angela needs 6, so that's 6 - 4 = 2 extra mirrors.
* **Chandeliers:** The base price covers 1 chandelier, and Angela needs 2, so that's 2 - 1 = 1 extra chandelier.
* **Pictures:** The base price covers 10 pictures, and Angela needs 20, so that's 20 - 10 = 10 extra pictures.

Now, let's calculate the extra cost:

* **Extra mirrors:** 2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $30.00
* **Extra chandeliers:** 1 chandelier * $15.00/chandelier = $15.00
* **Extra pictures:** 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00

Finally, add the extra cost to the base price:

* **Total cost:** $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 + $129.00 = $324.00

"It's great that Isaias is looking to make a profit from selling his chickens!  To figure out how much he spent on the chickens he's taking to market, we need to think about the relationship between profit, selling price, and cost. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Profit:** The money Isaias makes after selling the chickens, which is $2000.
* **Selling Price:** The price per chicken Isaias is selling them for, which is $50.
* **Cost:** The original price Isaias paid for the chickens he's selling.

* **Earnings:** Sarah will earn $2 per meter for her 20-meter rope, so she'll make 20 * $2 = $40.
* **Expenses:** The new rope costs $1.50 per meter, so a 20-meter rope will cost 20 * $1.50 = $30.

* **Leftover Money:**  Subtracting her expenses from her earnings, Sarah will have $40 - $30 = $10 left over.

"To figure this out, we need to think about how age works.  

Let's say Melanie's current age is represented by the variable 'm'. In 10 years, she'll be 18, so we know:

m + 10 = 18

Solving for 'm', we find her current age is 8.

Now, we want to know when her age will be three times her current age.  That means we're looking for a time when:

3 * 8 = m + x

Where 'x' is the number of years it will take.

Simplifying, we get:

24 = m + x

Since we know m (Melanie's current age) is 8, we can substitute:

24 = 8 + x

Solving for 'x', we find:

x = 16


**Answer:** It will take Melanie **16** years for her age to be thrice her present age.

"It's great that Kelly is being mindful of her budget while grocery shopping!  To figure out how much money she has left, let's calculate her total spending.

* **Bacon:** $10
* **Chicken:** Since each pack of chicken costs twice the price of a pack of bacon, they cost $2 * $2 = $4 each. With 6 packs, that's $4 * 6 = $24.
* **Strawberries:** 3 packs at $4 each equal $4 * 3 = $12.
* **Apples:** Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so they cost $4 / 2 = $2 each. With 7 packs, that's $2 * 7 = $14.

Adding up all her expenses: $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Finally, subtracting her spending from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.


Kelly has $5 left in her budget. 
"
"To figure this out, we need to think about the relationship between Elaina's usual concert length and the final concert length.  

Let's break it down:

* The final concert was twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore. 
* We know the final concert was 65 minutes long.

Let 'x' represent the length of her usual concerts. We can set up an equation:

2x + 15 = 65

Now, let's solve for x:

1. Subtract 15 from both sides: 2x = 50
2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 25


Elaina's usual concerts are **25 minutes** long.

* **Difference:** 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals 


The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. 
"
"To figure this out, we need to break down the problem step-by-step.  

First, find out how many plants are *not* flowering.  

*  One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, so that's 100 * (1/4) = 25 plants.

*  This leaves 100 - 25 = 75 plants that are either outdoor or flowering.

*  Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, meaning (2/3) * 75 = 50 plants are outdoors.

*  Therefore, 75 - 50 = 25 plants must be flowering.

Finally, to express this as a percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100%: (25/100) * 100% = 25%.

"It sounds like this problem is trying to trick us into focusing on the wrong thing!  

While it talks about notebooks, the real question is about the *difference* in the number of notebooks between Joseph and Martha.  

To figure that out, we need to think about how many more notebooks Joseph has *than* Martha.  

Let's break it down:

* **Martha's notebooks:** Martha started with 2 notebooks and bought 5 more, so she has 7 notebooks now.
* **Joseph's notebooks:** Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, meaning he had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.
* **The difference:** Joseph has 6 - 7 = -1 more notebook than Martha.  

This means Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"It's great that Dijana and Anis are staying active with their rowing!  To figure out their total distance, we need to know how far each person rowed. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 more than Dijana, which is the same as saying she rowed 20% more.  

To calculate that, we can do:

* 50 miles * 0.20 = 10 miles more than Dijana.

So Anis rowed 50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles.

Finally, to find their total distance, we add their individual distances: 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles.

* **Red Balloons:**  He threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
* **Yellow Balloons:** He threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.

We also know he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.  

To find the number of yellow balloons, we can use a little bit of algebra. Let's say there are ""y"" yellow balloons.  

Here's the equation:

2 * (number of red balloons) + 3 * (number of yellow balloons) = total bologna

We know there are 20 red balloons, so we can plug that in:

2 * 20 + 3 * y = 58

Simplifying:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides:

3y = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

y = 6



There are **6** yellow balloons.

"To determine Peter's age, let's break down the information given:

* We know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
* We're told Paul is 10 years older than John.
*  Importantly, Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's ages.

Let's use these clues to find Peter's age:

1. **Let's represent the ages:**
   *  Peter's age: P
   *  Paul's age: Pa
   *  John's age: J

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * P + Pa + J = 100  
   * Pa = J + 10
   * P = Pa + J

3. **Solve for Peter's age (P):**

   Since we know P = Pa + J, and Pa = J + 10, we can substitute to get:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

   Now, substitute this value of P into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

   Simplify and solve for J:
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

   Now that we know J = 20, substitute it back into the equation for P:

"It sounds like Fern is looking to maximize her widget-making profits!  To figure out which machine is more profitable, we need to consider both the production rate and the selling price.  

Let's break it down:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** Makes 60 widgets per hour at $6 each, so it earns $360 per hour.
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** Makes 45 widgets per hour at $6 each, so it earns $270 per hour.

Since Fern is running the machines 24 hours a day, we can calculate the daily earnings:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** $360/hour * 24 hours/day = $8640/day
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** $270/hour * 24 hours/day = $6480/day

Over a month with 30 days, the difference in earnings becomes:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** $8640/day * 30 days/month = $259,200/month
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** $6480/day * 30 days/month = $194,400/month

The Widgeteer 3000 will earn Fern $64,800 more per month.

"It sounds like Cameron is trying to be budget-conscious during his stay!  To figure out his savings, we need to understand the hotel's pricing structure. 

Let's break it down:

* **Option 1:** 24-hour stay for 1600 pesos.
* **Option 2:** 12-hour stay (5 pm to 5 am) for 1000 pesos, plus 70 pesos for each additional hour.

Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am, which is 17 hours.  

* **Cost of extra hours:** 17 hours - 12 hours = 5 hours. 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.
* **Total cost of Option 2:** 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

* **Savings:** 1600 pesos (Option 1) - 1350 pesos (Option 2) = 250 pesos.




Cameron saves 250 pesos by choosing the hourly rate option.

"To determine the total hay needed, we first need to figure out how much hay each sheep needs.  

* A sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount a goat needs.
* Since a goat needs 5 pounds of hay, twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.
*  Subtracting 3 pounds, a sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

Now we can calculate the total hay needed:

* Goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
* Sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds
* Total: 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

"It seems like James had a bit of a financial setback with his CD purchase!  

To figure out how much money he was out, we need to consider a few things:

* **The initial cost:**  He spent $15 per CD for 10 CDs, totaling $150.
* **The discount:**  He got a 40% discount, which saved him $60 ($150 x 0.40 = $60).
* **The selling price:** He sold 5 CDs for $40 each, earning $200 in total.

To find his net loss, we subtract his total spending from his earnings:

$150 (initial cost) - $60 (discount) = $90 (final cost)

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept in bed, we need to consider her usual sleep schedule and the time she spent sleepwalking. 

She typically sleeps from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., which is 8 hours.  Converting that to minutes, we get 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to use the bathroom.  This means she was awake for a total of 5 minutes before her usual wake-up time.

We also know she sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., a duration of 23 minutes.

Therefore, to find the total time she spent sleeping in bed, we subtract her sleepwalking time and the extra 5 minutes she was awake:

480 minutes (total sleep) - 23 minutes (sleepwalking) - 5 minutes (extra awake) = 452 minutes.

"Let's break down this hospital capacity problem:

*  The hospital starts with 1000 beds.
*  A fifth of those beds are occupied initially, meaning 200 beds are in use.
*  Each day, 50 new patients are admitted. Over two weeks (14 days), that's 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 new patients.
*  Adding those new patients to the existing occupied beds, we have a total of 200 + 700 = 900 occupied beds.
*  Finally, to find the unoccupied beds, subtract the occupied beds from the total capacity: 1000 beds - 900 occupied beds = 100 unoccupied beds. 



**Therefore, there will be 100 unoccupied beds after two weeks.**

"It's important to remember that concert attendance figures can sometimes be estimates.  If Kelly believes Courtney overestimated the number of attendees by 20%,  we can work backward to find a more accurate estimate.  

A 20% overestimation means the actual number is lower than Courtney's count.  To find the likely true number, we need to consider a reduction of about 20% of the original figure. 


Let's think about it this way: if 20% of the audience represents 9.6 people, the actual number of attendees is likely closer to 38.

"It seems like Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are having a blast catching Pokemon!  To figure out how many Pokemon Stan caught, we need to use some logic and a little bit of math. 

Let's break it down:

* **We know:**
    * Together they caught 339 Pokemon.
    * Alex caught 5 more than Stan.
    * Stan caught 13 less than 4 times the number Adelwolfe caught.

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan caught.

* **Set up an equation:**

Since Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch, we can write that as:

S = 4W - 13  (where 'W' represents the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught)

We also know that Alex caught 5 more than Stan:

A = S + 5

And finally, the total number of Pokemon caught is 339:

A + S + W = 339

Now we have a system of equations.  We can use substitution to solve for 'S'.

Let's break it down:

* **Friday's catch:**  Joe caught four times the amount on Friday compared to Thursday, so he caught 3 pounds * 4 = 12 pounds on Friday.
* **Saturday's catch:** He caught half the amount from Friday on Saturday, meaning he caught 12 pounds / 2 = 6 pounds.
* **Total catch:**  Adding up his catches from each day, Joe has a total of 3 pounds + 12 pounds + 6 pounds = 21 pounds of crawfish.
* **Servings:**  Since each serving is 3 pounds, Joe has 21 pounds / 3 pounds/serving = 7 servings.

"To figure this out, we need to think about the groups of students leaving early and how many are in each group. 

* **Football Players:** 20% of the class are football players, so that's 30 students * 0.20 = 6 students.

* **Cheerleaders and Band:**  The remaining students are not football players, so there are 30 students - 6 students = 24 students left.  Of those, 25% are cheerleaders or in band, which is 24 students * 0.25 = 6 students.

* **Total Leaving Early:**  Add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members: 6 students + 6 students = 12 students.



**Answer:** 12 students are leaving early.

"To figure this out, we need to consider both the time it takes to prepare the shrimp and the time it takes to cook them. 

Let's break it down:

* **Peeling:**  The time to peel the shrimp will depend on how quickly Emily can work. 
* **Cooking:**  We know she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so we can use that to calculate the time for 90 shrimp.

"To figure this out, we need to consider the temperature changes:

* **Cooling:** The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high.
* **Warming:** The room naturally warms up 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.

Let's break down the cooling periods:

* **Low setting:** 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees cooling
* **High setting:** 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees cooling

The total cooling effect is 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees.

Then, the room warms up 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees during the time the air conditioner is off.

Finally, the net temperature change is 18 degrees cooling - 4 degrees warming = 14 degrees cooler.

"This is a bit of a trick question!  It's designed to make you think about time and age relationships.  

Here's how to break it down:

* **Focus on the key information:** We know the comet returns every 75 years and Bill saw it twice.
* **Think about the age difference:** Bill was three times his father's age when he saw the comet the second time. This means there's a significant age gap between them.

Let's use a little logic:

* If Bill was much older the second time he saw the comet, it means he must have been quite young the first time.  

Considering the comet's 75-year cycle, the most logical answer is that Bill was likely a teenager the first time he saw it.

"To figure out the total howling time, we need to convert everything to minutes for easier calculation. 

*  Tobias howls for 20 seconds, which is 20/60 = 1/3 of a minute.
*  Chikote howls twice as long as Tobias, so he howls for 2 * (1/3) = 2/3 of a minute.
*  Igneous howls for the combined time of Tobias and Chikote, meaning he howls for (1/3) + (2/3) = 1 minute.

Finally, the total howling time is 1/3 + 2/3 + 1 = 2 minutes.

"When dividing a watermelon among family members, it's important to consider everyone's nutritional needs.  

While the specific size of slices can vary,  a good rule of thumb is to ensure each person gets a fair and balanced portion.  

In this case, with two adults and four children,  it's wise to aim for a distribution that accounts for the different caloric needs of adults and children.  

For example, you could divide the watermelon into six equal slices and have the adults each take two slices, while the children each take one slice. This ensures a balanced distribution while still accommodating the preference for adults to have larger portions.

"It's great that you're interested in porcupine populations!  

To figure this out, we need to consider a few things:

* **Growth Rate:** Porcupines reproduce quickly, with females typically giving birth to several babies per year.
* **Carrying Capacity:**  Parks have limited resources, so the porcupine population will eventually reach a point where it can't grow any larger.

Without more information about the specific park's environment and resource availability, it's impossible to give a precise answer.  

However, we can make a general estimate. If each female porcupine has 4 babies per month, and there are 30 females, that's 120 babies per month. Over a year, that's 1440 babies.  Adding those to the initial 50 porcupines, we'd have a significant increase in the population. 


Keep in mind, this is a simplified calculation.  In reality, factors like predation, disease, and competition for resources would all play a role in determining the actual porcupine population. 

"
"It's great that the Smith family is getting their pool ready for summer!  

To figure out the cost of filling the pool, we need to know how much water it holds.  We can do that by calculating the pool's volume.  

* **Volume = width x length x depth**

Let's plug in the numbers:

* **Volume = 14 feet x 25 feet x 4 feet**
* **Volume = 1400 cubic feet**

Now, we need to convert cubic feet to gallons.  A general rule of thumb is that 1 cubic foot equals about 7.48 gallons.

* **Gallons = Volume (cubic feet) x 7.48 gallons/cubic foot**
* **Gallons = 1400 cubic feet x 7.48 gallons/cubic foot**
* **Gallons = 10472 gallons**

Finally, we know the pool company charges $0.10 per gallon.

* **Cost = Gallons x Price per gallon**
* **Cost = 10472 gallons x $0.10/gallon**
* **Cost = $1047.20**

"To figure this out, we need to break down the student population:

* **Over 16:** Half the students are over 16, so that's 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
* **Males over 16:** One-fourth of the students over 16 are male, meaning 1500 / 4 = 375 students.
* **Females over 16:**  Subtracting the males from the total over 16, we have 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students.

* **Under 16:** The other half of the students are under 16, so there are 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
* **Males under 16:** Half of the students under 16 are male, meaning 1500 / 2 = 750 students.
* **Females under 16:**  Subtracting the males from the total under 16, we have 1500 - 750 = 750 female students.

* **Total Females:**  Finally, add the females in both age groups: 1125 + 750 = 1875 female students.

"It sounds like Wanda and Ms. B are making great progress filling that tank!  To figure out how much more water they need, let's break it down:

* **Day 1:**  We know Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 gallons * (1/4) = 4500 gallons.  Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she pumped 4500 gallons * (3/4) = 3375 gallons.

* **Day 2:** Wanda pumped 2/3 of her Day 1 amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her Day 1 amount, so she pumped 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

* **Total:**  Let's add up all the gallons pumped: 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons + 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

* **Remaining:**  To find out how much more water is needed, subtract the total pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons.

* **Yellow balloons released:** She let go of half her yellow balloons, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 balloons.
* **Blue balloons added:** She found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them, meaning 8 * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons joined her collection.

* **Final count:**  Let's add up the remaining balloons: 15 red + 6 yellow + 6 blue = 27 balloons.

"It seems you're interested in how money is divided! While I'm an expert in health, I can still help with this math problem. 

Let's break it down:

*  Imagine the first person's share is represented by the variable 'x'.
*  The second person gets $80 more than the first, so they have 'x + $80'.
*  The third person gets twice the amount the second person has, which is 2 * (x + $80).

To find the first person's share, we know the total amount is $1920.  So:

x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920

Now we can solve for x:

x + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920
4x + $240 = $1920
4x = $1680
x = $420



The first person's share is $420.

"Let's break down this problem to find out how many tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set.  

Think of it this way:

* **Set 2:**  We'll call the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set ""x"".
* **Set 1:** He got 4 more balls in the first set than the second, so that's ""x + 4"".
* **Set 3:** He got half the number of balls in the third set compared to the second, meaning he got ""x / 2"".

Now, we know the total number of balls is 19:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Let's solve for x:

1. Combine like terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19
2. Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15
3. Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.  

Finally, to find the number of balls in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10


Rory retrieved **10** tennis balls in the first set.

* **Calculating Depreciation:**

    * 2008: $20000 * 0.21 = $4200 depreciation
    * 2009: $15800 * 0.21 = $3318 depreciation 
    * 2010: $12482 * 0.21 = $2622.62 depreciation

* **Finding the Price:**

    * 2008: $20000 - $4200 = $15800
    * 2009: $15800 - $3318 = $12482

"It's great that Betsy and Donovan are cooking together!  To figure out how long Betsy's part took, we need to think about the relationship between their cooking times.  

Let's say Donovan's cooking time was 'x' minutes. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer, her time would be 'x + 18' minutes.  

We know their combined cooking time was 98 minutes, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtracting 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 40

This means Donovan cooked for 40 minutes.  

Now we can find Betsy's cooking time:

Betsy's time = x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

* **Seconds to hours:** There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 3600 seconds in an hour.

* **Spring output:** If one spring creates one jellyfish per second, in an hour it would create 3600 jellyfish.

* **Multiple springs:** With five springs working simultaneously, the total number of jellyfish created per hour would be 3600 jellyfish/spring * 5 springs = 18,000 jellyfish.

* **Total jellyfish:** Over four hours, the five springs would create 18,000 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 72,000 jellyfish.

"It sounds like Frankie had a great bowling game!  To figure out Frankie's score, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Double Binkie's score:**  Since Frankie scored 15 more than twice Binkie's score, we start by doubling Binkie's 90: 90 * 2 = 180

2. **Add the extra 15:**  Now, add 15 to that doubled score: 180 + 15 = 195


Frankie's score was 195.

"It's great that James is getting some exercise!  To figure out how long it took him, we need to consider the whole journey.  

He walked 2 miles to the halfway point and then 2 miles back home.  Since he walks at a steady pace of 4 miles per hour, it took him 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours for each leg of the trip.  

In total, it took him 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour. 



"
"It's great that Jenny is buying bananas! They're a fantastic source of potassium and fiber.  

To figure out her savings, let's think about it this way:

* **Cost of bunches:** 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00
* **Cost of individual bananas:**  Since each bunch has 4 bananas, she'd need 40 bananas total.  At $0.80 per banana, that's 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00

* **Savings:** $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00


Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches! 
"
"It sounds like Sam and Harry are trying to divide their fence fairly!  To figure out how much fence Sam gets, we need to think about how to split 100 feet evenly while also making sure Harry has 60 more feet than Sam.  

Let's break it down:

* **Think of it like a seesaw:**  We want one side to be 60 feet heavier than the other.
* **Find the middle:**  100 feet divided by 2 is 50 feet.
* **Adjust for the difference:** Since Harry needs 60 more feet, subtract 50 from Sam's share and add it to Harry's.

Sam gets 50 - 30 = 20 feet. 



"
"To figure this out, we need to understand the crocodile's growth rate.  If it grows 8 inches in 4 years, that means it grows an average of 2 inches per year (8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year).

Now, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years, we simply multiply its yearly growth by the number of years: 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

"It seems like Marcel is doing a great job keeping people active with his bicycle store!  To figure out his earnings, we need to break it down:

* **BMX Bikes:**  Since a BMX bike costs half the price of an MTB ($500), it costs $250.
* **Trekking Bikes:**  These bikes sell for $450 each.
* **MTB Bikes:** These are the priciest at $500 each.

Now, let's calculate his earnings for each type of bike based on the number sold:

* **Trekking Bikes:** 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
* **BMX Bikes:** 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
* **MTB Bikes:** 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

Finally, add up the earnings from all three types:

$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250



**Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles that month.** 
"
"It sounds like you're describing a scenario where the farmer is working hard to keep up with the demand for hay!  

To figure out how much hay is left, we need to consider the balance between how much is made and how much is removed.  

Think of it like this:

* **Hay Production:** The farmer is making 5 bales per hour.
* **Hay Removal:** The truck is taking away 3 bales per hour.

Over a 6-hour workday, we can calculate the total amount of hay produced and removed.  Then, we can find the difference to determine how much hay is left. 



"
"To calculate John's total weekly learning time, let's break it down:

* **Regular classes:**  He attends 6 periods a day for 40 minutes each, totaling 240 minutes per day (6 * 40 = 240).
* **Extra classes:** He has 2 extra classes of 40 minutes each, adding another 80 minutes to his daily schedule (2 * 40 = 80).
* **Daily total:**  His total daily class time is 320 minutes (240 + 80 = 320).
* **Weekly class time:**  Over 5 school days, this amounts to 1600 minutes (320 * 5 = 1600).
* **Weekend learning:** He dedicates 1/16 of his weekly class time to extra learning on weekends, which is 100 minutes per day (1600 / 16 = 100).
* **Total weekend learning:**  This adds up to 200 minutes over the weekend (100 * 2 = 200).
* **Grand total:**  His total weekly learning time is 1800 minutes (1600 + 200 = 1800).
* **Hours:**  Converting minutes to hours, he spends 30 hours a week learning (1800 / 60 = 30).





"
"It's great that Nathan is having fun with his bouncy ball!  

To figure out how high the ball bounces on its second attempt, we need to understand how much energy it loses with each bounce.  Bouncing is a great example of energy transfer and loss due to friction.  

Let's break it down:

* **First Bounce:** When Nathan drops the ball, it loses some energy due to the impact with the ground.  We're told it bounces to 2/3 of its original height.
* **Second Bounce:** The ball again loses energy upon impact, bouncing to 2/3 of its *previous* height.

Since each story is 24 feet, the third-floor balcony is 72 feet high.  

Therefore, the ball's height on its second bounce is (2/3) * 48 feet = 32 feet. 




"
"To determine the fourth child's height, let's break it down:

* **First child:** 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.
* **Second child:** 2 inches taller than the first, so 72 + 2 = 74 inches.
* **Third child:** 5 inches shorter than the second, so 74 - 5 = 69 inches.
* **Fourth child:** 3 inches taller than the third, so 69 + 3 = 72 inches.


The fourth child is **72 inches** tall. 
"
"It's great that the orchard is selling apples!  Apples are a fantastic source of fiber and vitamin C.  To figure out their earnings, we need to know how many bags of apples they sold.

"To figure this out, we need to work backward!  

Think of it like this:

* The Allosaurus ate the last bit, which was 270 kilograms.
* Before the velociraptors got to it, there must have been double that amount, since they ate half. So, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.
*  Before the T-Rex took its share, there was double that amount again, because the T-Rex ate half.  That means the original triceratops weighed 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

"It sounds like Tony needs to do some refreshing!  Painting can be a great way to boost your mood and create a more inviting space.  

To figure out how much paint he'll need, we need to know the total area of the walls.  

* **First, calculate the area of each wall:**

    * North and South walls: 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet each
    * East and West walls: 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet each

* **Next, add up the area of all the walls:**

    * Total area: (80 square feet * 2) + (40 square feet * 2) = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet

* **Finally, divide the total area by the coverage of each gallon of paint:**

    * Gallons needed: 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons

* **Remember:** It's always a good idea to have a little extra paint on hand, just in case!

"It's important to remember that shaking carbonated beverages can lead to dangerous pressure buildup, potentially causing the can to explode and spray its contents.  

To answer your question about the likelihood of someone getting sprayed, we need to consider the remaining sodas and how many are shaken.  Let's break it down:

* **Shaken sodas:**  We know 3 sodas were initially shaken.
* **Unshaken sodas:**  The remaining sodas are assumed to be unshaken.

Without knowing how many sodas were taken by Ellen and her brother, we can't determine the exact number of shaken sodas left. 

**Therefore, we cannot calculate the probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can.**

"It's important to prioritize breaks throughout the workday to maintain focus and well-being.  

Let's calculate Bobby's total break time:

* He takes a 30-minute lunch each day.
* He takes two 15-minute breaks, totaling 30 minutes.
* This means he takes a total of 60 minutes (30 + 30) off each day.

Over five days, that adds up to 300 minutes (60 minutes/day * 5 days).

Converting minutes to hours, Bobby takes a total of 5 hours of breaks over five days.

"To figure out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first determine how far Micah ran.  Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, Micah ran 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.

Next, we add the distances Amber and Micah ran to find their combined total: 8 miles + 28 miles = 36 miles.

Finally, subtract that combined distance from the total distance all three ran to find Ahito's distance: 52 miles - 36 miles = 16 miles. 


Ahito ran **16** miles.

"It seems like Sheila is trying to manage her spending!  While I'm a health expert, I can help with the math.  

Let's break down her credit card activity:

* **Starting Balance:** $85.00
* **Return:**  She gets $15.00 back, so her balance is now $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
* **Frying Pan:** The frying pan costs $20.00, but it's 20% off, which is $4.00.  So the frying pan costs $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
* **Towels:** The towels cost $30.00, but they're 10% off, which is $3.00. So the towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
* **New Purchases:** She spends $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00
* **Final Balance:** Her new balance is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

"To determine the number of girls in the school, we need to understand the relationship between the percentage of boys and the total student population.  

If 40% of the school represents 240 boys, we can use this information to calculate the total number of students.  

Let's assume the total number of students is represented by 'x'. We can set up a proportion:

40/100 = 240/x

Cross-multiplying gives us:

40x = 24000

Solving for x (the total number of students):

x = 24000 / 40 = 600

Now that we know the total number of students is 600, we can find the number of girls:

Girls = Total Students - Boys

Girls = 600 - 240 = 360



Therefore, there are **360** girls in the school.

"To figure this out, we need to think about speed and distance.  

* **Beach Walk:** Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at a certain pace, and we know it takes her 40 minutes.  

* **Sidewalk Walk:** She walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, covering 1 mile.

Let's focus on the beach first.  We can calculate her speed on the beach:

* **Speed = Distance / Time**
* **Speed = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute**

Now, on the sidewalk, she walks twice as fast:

* **Sidewalk Speed = 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute**

Finally, let's calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:

* **Time = Distance / Speed**
* **Time = 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes**

Adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk gives us the total walk time:

* **Total Time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes**

"To figure this out, we need to think about how much money Jane needs to save and how much she saves each week.  

Let's break it down:

* **Goal:** Jane wants to save $60.
* **Savings per week:** Jane saves $4 each week.

To find out how many more weeks it will take, we can divide the remaining amount needed by her weekly savings:

$60 (goal) - $32 (current savings) = $28 (remaining)

$28 (remaining) / $4 (weekly savings) = 7 weeks 


**Answer:** It will take Jane 7 more weeks to save $60.

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to consider the concept of heat transfer.  

When Donny mixes the water, the final temperature will be a weighted average of the initial temperatures.  Since the mixed water needs to be at least 40 degrees, the second mug must contribute enough heat to raise the overall temperature. 

Let's think about it this way: the 33-degree water is relatively cool. To reach 40 degrees, the hotter water needs to be significantly warmer.  

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees or warmer for Donny to be able to drink the mixed water.

"It's great that Melanie's father is starting an animal farm!  To figure out the total number of animals after three weeks, we need to consider the increase in both cows and chickens. 

* **Cows:**  He starts with 50 cows and gets 20 more each day for 21 days (3 weeks * 7 days/week). That's a total increase of 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.  Adding those to his starting number, he'll have 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows.

* **Chickens:**  He begins with 20 chickens and gets 10 more each day for 21 days. That's a total increase of 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.  Adding those to his starting number, he'll have 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens.

"To determine Colin's current age, let's break down the problem step-by-step.

Let's use the following:

*  'w' = Wendy's current age
*  'c' = Colin's current age

We're given two pieces of information:

1. **Wendy's age in relation to Colin's future age:** Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.  This translates to the equation: w = 5(c + 7)

2. **Colin's age in the future in relation to Wendy's current age:** In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be represented as: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.  Let's rearrange the first equation to solve for 'w':

w = 5c + 35

Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for 'c':

3c + 75 = 5c + 35
40 = 2c
c = 20



**Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.**

Since he spends $27,000 and can buy 100 books for $500, he can buy 27,000 / 500 = 54 sets of 100 books.

That means he can buy a total of 54 * 100 = 5400 books.

Finally, dividing the total number of books by the number of schools (3) tells us he can buy 5400 / 3 = 1800 books per school.

"It sounds like Jay needs to be careful about those melting snowballs!  

To figure this out, we need to think about how many snowballs he's actually keeping.  He makes 20 snowballs per hour, but loses 8 because of melting. That means he has a net gain of 12 snowballs each hour. 

To reach 60 snowballs, he'll need to keep making them for 5 hours. 


"
"To figure this out, we need to think about how age works.  

Let's say Jim's current age is ""x"".  Since John is 28 now and was twice Jim's age when Digimon came out, we can set up an equation:

John's age when Digimon came out = 2 * Jim's age when Digimon came out

This means John's age 20 years ago was twice Jim's age 20 years ago.  

Since John is 28 now, he was 8 years old when Digimon came out (28 - 20 = 8).

Therefore, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out (8 / 2 = 4).

Now we know Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago, so he is currently 24 years old (4 + 20 = 24).

"Let's break down this bandage inventory problem step-by-step:

* **Day 1:** The nurses used 38 bandages and received a new pack of 50, so they had 38 + 50 = 88 bandages at the end of the day.

* **Day 2:** They used 10 fewer bandages than day 1, meaning they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.  They now have 88 - 28 = 60 bandages.

* **Day 3:** They ordered two packs of 50 bandages each, bringing their total to 60 + (2 * 50) = 160 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.  This leaves them with 160 - 25 = 135 bandages.

* **Starting Point:** Since they had 135 bandages at the end of day 3, and they used 78 bandages over the three days, they must have started with 135 + 78 = 213 bandages.




**Therefore, they started with 213 bandages on the first day.**

"It's fascinating to think about the circulatory systems of these marine creatures!  

While the exact blood volume can vary between species, a general estimate for a shark's blood volume is indeed significantly higher than a whale's.  

To get a rough idea, we can use the provided information:

* **Whale blood:**  Let's assume a whale has 40 gallons of blood.
* **Shark blood:** Sharks typically have about three times the blood volume of a whale, so a shark might have around 40 gallons * 3 = 120 gallons of blood.

Therefore, ten sharks could have a combined blood volume of approximately 120 gallons/shark * 10 sharks = 1200 gallons.

"It seems like John is enjoying a bit of a celebratory splurge!  While I can't offer advice on alcohol consumption, I can help with the math.  

To figure out his total spending, we need to know the cost of each type of alcohol and how many bottles he buys.  

Let's break it down:

* **Scotch:** He buys 10 bottles for $600, so each bottle costs $60.
* **Cognac:** He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, which is 10 * 2 = 20 bottles.  
* **Cognac Price:** Cognac costs 50% more than scotch, so each bottle costs $60 * 1.50 = $90.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

* **Total Scotch Cost:** 10 bottles * $60/bottle = $600
* **Total Cognac Cost:** 20 bottles * $90/bottle = $1800

"It's great that Tim is thinking about volume and packing efficiency!  To figure out how far off his guess was, we need to understand how many jelly beans *could* fit in the jar. 

First, we calculate the jar's volume: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Next, we consider that jelly beans aren't perfectly packed.  With 80% efficiency, the usable volume is 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Knowing a jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, we can estimate the maximum number of jelly beans: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

Since Tim thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red, his guess would be 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

Finally, the difference between his guess and the actual 900 red jelly beans is 900 - 864 = 36.

"It sounds like Regina is a very productive writer!  To figure out how many novels she wrote this year, we need to think about proportions.  

If 9 novels represent three-quarters of her total output this year, we can set up a simple equation. Let 'x' represent the total number of novels written this year.  We know:

(3/4) * x = 9

To isolate 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by (4/3):

x = 9 * (4/3)

x = 12 


Regina wrote **12** novels this year.

"It sounds like Elly is getting organized!  To figure out how many bookcases she needs, let's focus on the capacity of each bookcase.  

* **Middle shelves:**  Each holds 10 books.
* **Bottom shelf:** Holds twice the amount of a middle shelf, so it holds 10 * 2 = 20 books.
* **Top shelf:** Holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, meaning it holds 20 - 5 = 15 books.

* **Total capacity per bookcase:** 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books

* **Number of bookcases needed:** 110 books / 55 books per bookcase = 2 bookcases

"
"It's great that Rose is selling eggs!  To figure out her profit, we need to know how much she makes from selling them and how much she spent to buy them. 

* **Cost:**  Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen, so her total cost was 5 * $2.40 = $12.00.

* **Revenue:** She sells 3 eggs for $1.00, so she'll make $1.00 for every 3 eggs she sells. Since she has 60 eggs (5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen), she can sell them in 60 / 3 = 20 sets of 3 eggs.  This means she'll make 20 * $1.00 = $20.00.

* **Profit:**  Her profit is her revenue minus her cost: $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

"
"It's great that Mary is making healthy and refreshing ice cubes for her party!  To figure out how many blueberry cubes she made, we need to think about the relationship between the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes.  

Let's say 's' represents the number of strawberry cubes.  Since she makes 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4 for blueberry cubes, we can write that as 5s - 4.  

We know the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combining like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Dividing both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know she made 20 strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Blueberry cubes = 5 * 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96




**Answer:** Mary made 96 blueberry cubes.

"It sounds like Brendan had a bit of a mishap with his marbles!  Let's focus on the important part:  how many marbles did he end up with?  

To figure that out, we need to think about the steps:

* He started with 10 marbles.
* He lost some, but then found some.
*  He realized one wasn't even a marble!

Let's break it down:

1. **Losing marbles:**  When Brendan dropped half his marbles, he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
2. **Finding marbles:** He found 3 marbles after dropping some.
3. **The bead:**  He found something that wasn't a marble, so we need to subtract 1 from his total.

Putting it all together: 10 - 5 + 3 - 1 = 7 


Brendan ended up with **7** marbles.

"To figure this out, we need to consider both Phineas's hopping speed and his swimming speed.  

First, we need to know how long it takes him to travel each half of the distance.  Since the distance is split evenly, he'll spend the same amount of time on land and in water.

* **Land Travel:**  He hops 20 yards per minute, and he needs to cover 100 yards on land.  That means it will take him 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

* **Water Travel:** He swims 10 yards per minute and needs to cover 100 yards.  This will take him 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

* **Total Time:**  Adding his land and water travel times, it will take Phineas 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes to get home.

"It's great that Garrett is enjoying a classic snack like popcorn!  

To figure out how much popcorn Garrett has, we need to break down the popping process step-by-step:

* **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
* **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate triples, so 20 * 3 = 60 kernels pop.
* **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate quadruples, meaning 20 * 4 = 80 kernels pop.
* **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate halves from the previous 30 seconds, resulting in 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popping.
* **Residual heat:** A quarter of the kernels that popped in the last 30 seconds pop afterward, so 40 / 4 = 10 kernels pop.

Adding up all the popped kernels: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels.


Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to enjoy!

"It's great that Tim is making a healthy and delicious honey and jam mix!  To figure out his profit, we need to look at the cost of ingredients and the selling price. 

Let's break it down:

* **Passion fruit:**  Packed with Vitamin C and antioxidants, passion fruit adds a tangy flavor. At $6 per pound, 2 pounds for each jar costs $12.
* **Jackfruit:** This tropical fruit is a good source of fiber and is often used as a meat substitute. At $8 per pound, 1.5 pounds per jar costs $12.
* **Honey:**  A natural sweetener with antibacterial properties, honey adds sweetness and a unique flavor. At $10 per pound, 2 pounds per jar costs $20.

So, the total cost of ingredients per jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Since Tim sells each jar for $50, his profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6.

Making 10 jars would bring him a total profit of $6 x 10 = $60.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step to figure out how many beakers Igor lost.

First, we know Igor had 29 items on the lab bench in total.  

We also know he gathered:

* Half the requested number of test tubes (16 / 2 = 8)
* Two more Petri dishes than requested (14 + 2 = 16)
* The correct number of beakers (7)

To find out how many beakers he lost, we can subtract the number of test tubes and Petri dishes from the total number of items:

29 - 8 - 16 = 5

This means Igor had 5 beakers on the bench. Since he was supposed to have 7, he lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

"Let's break down this relay race scenario to figure out Vanessa's time. 

We know Vanessa ran twice the distance Aaron did, covering 4 miles.  We also know Aaron completed his 2-mile leg in 16 minutes.  Since Aaron is twice as fast as Vanessa, we can determine Vanessa's speed by dividing Aaron's speed by 2.  

To find Aaron's speed, we use the formula: speed = distance / time.  His speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.  

Vanessa's speed is then 0.125 miles per minute / 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute.

Finally, we can calculate Vanessa's time using the formula: time = distance / speed.  Her time is 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute = 64 minutes. 



**Answer:** Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine the number of chickens, we need to consider the fact that each chicken has two legs and each cow has four legs.  Let's think about it this way:

* **Scenario:** We have 20 animals with a total of 70 legs.

* **Logic:**  If all the animals were cows, they would have 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs.  Since we have fewer legs (70), there must be some chickens.

* **Conclusion:**  The presence of chickens, with their two legs, reduces the overall number of legs.
