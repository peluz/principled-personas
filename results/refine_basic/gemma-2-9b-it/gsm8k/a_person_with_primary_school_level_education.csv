"Okay, so Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 fixing it up.  That means he put $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000 into the house.

Then the house became worth $200,000 because the fixing up made it worth 150% of what it was before.

To find out how much money Josh made, we subtract what he put in from what it's worth now: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000!

"Let's figure this out!

First, John drove 3 hours at 60 miles per hour, so he went 3 x 60 = 180 miles.

Then he drove back home. He was stuck in traffic for 2 hours, so he didn't go anywhere those 2 hours.

He drove for half an hour at 30 miles per hour, which is 30 x 0.5 = 15 miles.

He had 4 hours to get home, but he already used 2.5 hours, so he had 4 - 2.5 = 1.5 hours left.

He drove the rest of the way at 80 miles per hour, so he went 80 x 1.5 = 120 miles.

In total, he drove 180 miles away and 15 + 120 = 135 miles back.

So, he is 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home.

"Eliza makes $10 for every hour she works.  She worked 40 hours at that rate, so she made 40 times 10, which is $400.

She worked 5 extra hours, and for those she gets paid $12 an hour because that's her regular pay times 1.2. So she made 5 times 12, which is $60 for overtime.

She skips for some time, but she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking.  So she runs for 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours and walks for 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours.

She runs 2 hours * 6 miles/hour = 12 miles.

"Marigolds cost $3 each, petunias cost $2 each, and begonias cost $2 each.

Artie sells 12 marigolds, so he makes 12 times $3, which is $36.

He sells 9 petunias, so he makes 9 times $2, which is $18.

He sells 17 begonias, so he makes 17 times $2, which is $34.

If you add all that money together, he makes $36 + $18 + $34 = $88!

"Each level is half the size of the one below it.  The top level is 16 square feet.  

So the bottom level must be 16 times 2, which is 32 square feet. Then the next level up is 32 times 2, which is 64 square feet. And the level before that is 64 times 2, which is 128 square feet.

Adding all the levels together, we get 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

To find the average, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.

"The puppy needs 1 cup of food each day for 180 days, so that's 180 cups. Then it needs 2 cups each day for the rest of the year, which is 185 days. So that's 185 times 2, which is 370 cups.  

In total, the puppy needs 180 + 370 = 550 cups of food in a year.

Since each bag has 110 cups, Cecilia needs 550 / 110 = 5 bags of food.

"Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs.  

Let's figure out how much Alex weighs:

* Four times Grace's weight is 125 x 4 = 500 pounds.

"Marilyn sold lots more records than Harald!  She sold 10 times as many as him.  If they sold 88,000 records together,  we need to figure out how many Harald sold.  

Let's think: if Marilyn sold 10 times more,  that means Harald sold a smaller number.  We can try dividing 88,000 by 11 because Marilyn sold 10 times more, so it's like they sold 11 groups of the same amount.

88,000 divided by 11 is 8,000!

"Okay, so each grown-up eats 10 pounds of potato salad.  There are 20 grown-ups, so that's 10 times 20 which is 200 pounds!

The kids eat half as much as the grown-ups, so they eat 10 pounds divided by 2 which is 5 pounds each.

There are 5 kids, so they'll eat 5 times 5 which is 25 pounds.

To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we add the grown-up's food and the kids' food: 200 pounds plus 25 pounds is 225 pounds!

Let's think:

* Lee runs it in 38 seconds.
* Gerald is 2 seconds slower than Lee, so he used to run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.
* Gerald got 10% faster, which is like getting 4 seconds faster.
* So now Gerald runs it in 40 - 4 = 36 seconds!

* Five people with bikes needed two tires each, so that's 5 times 2 which is 10 tires.
* Three people with tricycles needed three tires each, so that's 3 times 3 which is 9 tires.
* One person with a unicycle needed one tire.

That means Shawnda inflated a total of 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Each tire cost 25 cents, so she made 20 times 25 cents which is $5.00!

"Carl has ten packs of cookies and each pack has six cookies. So he has 10 times 6 which is 60 cookies!  Each cookie costs a dime, so 60 cookies cost 60 times 10 cents, which is 6 dollars. If Carl pays with a ten dollar bill, he gets 10 dollars minus 6 dollars, which is 4 dollars back!

"Let's count the fries!

* Dave ate 14 fries.
* The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so it ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
* That means there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.
* Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
*  That means there were 7 - 9 = -2 fries left.  Hmm, that doesn't make sense!  The pigeons must have eaten more than were left!
* The raccoon didn't eat any fries because there weren't any left.
*  In the end, there were 5 fries left, and one ant took one away, so there must have been 5 + 1 = 6 fries before that.
*  Before the pigeons ate any, there were 6 + 9 = 15 fries.
*  Before the seagull ate any, there were 15 + 7 = 22 fries.

"Kimo goes to school for 3 hours on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's 3 hours each day times 3 days is 9 hours!

Then he goes to school for 4 hours on Tuesday and Thursday. That's 4 hours each day times 2 days is 8 hours!

So, he goes to school for 9 hours plus 8 hours, which is 17 hours every week.

He goes to school for 17 hours a week for 16 weeks, so he goes to school for 17 times 16, which is 272 hours!

"Let's figure this out!

* Rolls are 4 inches long each, and Bill bakes 300 rolls, so that's 4 times 300 which is 1200 inches!
* Croissants are 6 inches long each, and he bakes 120, so that's 6 times 120 which is 720 inches!
* Baguettes are 2 feet long each, and he bakes 60, so that's 2 times 60 which is 120 feet!

Now we need to add it all up!  

* 1200 inches is the same as 100 feet (because there are 12 inches in a foot).
* So, 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet!

"Blake runs back and forth across the whole football field 15 times. That's a lot! Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line a bunch of times, 34 times to be exact.  

To figure out who ran farther, we need to see how many yards each person ran. Blake runs 100 yards each way, so that's 200 yards for each trip across the field. He did that 15 times, so he ran 200 times 15, which is 3000 yards!

Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 40 yards each way, so that's 80 yards for each trip. She did that 34 times, so she ran 80 times 34, which is 2720 yards.

Blake ran way farther than Kelly! He ran 3000 yards and she ran 2720 yards.  If we subtract, we find out he ran 280 yards more.

"On Monday, the tank had 17 feet of water.  On Tuesday, it had 7 feet more, so it had 17 + 7 = 24 feet of water.

On Wednesday, the water was two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday.  That means we need to divide Tuesday's amount by 3 and then multiply by 2: (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.


So the answer is 16 feet.

"Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. That's a lot of fish!  Locsin caught 5 less starfish than Anakin, so he caught 5 starfish.  Locsin also caught 3 less sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 3 sea horses.  Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 5 clownfish.

Let's see, Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.  Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

Together they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish!

"Let's think about this step by step!

The marbles cost $20 to start.  Every two months, the price goes up by 20%.  That means it gets more expensive!

After two months, the price goes up by $4 (20% of $20). So it costs $24.

Then, after another two months, it goes up another $4.80, and so on.

It's a bit tricky to keep adding it up all the way to 36 months!

Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so if Brooke is 2 years old, Seth is 4 years old.  

If we add 2 years to both of them, Brooke will be 4 and Seth will be 6.

"Jessica has to pay $300 for her student loans, $200 for her credit card, and $500 for her house.  That's $1000 in total every month.

She wants to pay 50% more than that, so she needs to find 50% of $1000.  That's like cutting the $1000 in half and then taking half of that!  

Half of $1000 is $500, and half of $500 is $250. So she pays an extra $250 each month.

That means she pays $1000 + $250 = $1250 every month.

If she pays $1250 every month, she pays $1250 x 12 = $15,000 every year.

"Let's think about this!

There are 3 numbers bigger than 3 on a die (4, 5, and 6). There are 6 numbers total. So, there's a 3 out of 6 chance of rolling a number bigger than 3. That's like saying there's a 50% chance!

Now, to roll two even numbers in a row, we need to roll an even number first, then another even number. There are 3 even numbers on the die. So, there's a 3 out of 6 chance of rolling an even number.  Then, we have to roll another even number, which is also a 3 out of 6 chance.

To get the chance of both things happening, we multiply those chances together: 3/6 * 3/6 = 9/36. That's the same as 1/4, which is like 25%.

So, rolling a number bigger than 3 is more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

"Janeth has to pay back $200 extra because it's 10% of the $2000 she borrowed. So she needs to pay back $2200 in total.

If she pays $165 each month for 12 months, that's $165 x 12 = $1980.

To find out how much is left, we take the total she needs to pay back ($2200) and subtract how much she paid ($1980).

$2200 - $1980 = $220 


**Answer:** $220

"Harriet is 21 years old now. Zack is twice as old as Harriet, so Zack is 21 times 2 which is 42 years old. Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so Adrian is 21 times 3 which is 63 years old.

In three years, Harriet will be 21 plus 3 which is 24 years old. Zack will be 42 plus 3 which is 45 years old. Adrian will be 63 plus 3 which is 66 years old.

So, their total age in three years will be 24 plus 45 plus 66 which is 135 years.

The average age will be 135 divided by 3 which is 45 years old.

"James has 32 water cards, 34 grass cards, and 30 fire cards.  That means there are 32 water cards out of 96 total cards.  

To find the percentage, we can think of it like this:

* If we divide the water cards (32) by the total cards (96), we get 0.3333.

* To turn that into a percentage, we multiply by 100, which gives us 33.33%.

* Rounding that to the nearest whole number, we get 33%.

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Each cookie has 200 calories, so Sue ate 46 * 200 = 9200 calories. Her sister ate 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

So, there are 12 + 3 + 24 = 39 people in total.

Each pizza feeds 3 people, so we need 39 divided by 3 which is 13 pizzas.

If each pizza costs $15, then 13 times $15 is $195!

"Katerina uses 8 sparkly topaz stones for each necklace. Each stone is one inch long.  The necklace is 25 inches long in total. The little silver beads go in between the stones. Each silver bead is a quarter of an inch long.  

Let's see... if the stones are 8 inches long, that leaves 25 - 8 = 17 inches for the silver beads.  

If each bead is a quarter of an inch, then she uses 17 / 0.25 = 68 silver beads!

"Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40, and Margot wrote 60.  That's 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories in the first week.

Then they doubled the stories they wrote! So Alani wrote 20 times 2 = 40 more stories. Braylen wrote 40 times 2 = 80 more stories. And Margot wrote 60 times 2 = 120 more stories.

That means they wrote 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 more stories in the second week.

If you add the stories from both weeks, they wrote 120 + 240 = 360 stories altogether!

"The fast car goes 60 miles every hour. The slow car goes half as fast, so it goes 30 miles every hour.  

If the fast car drives 480 miles, we need to figure out how long it took the slow car to drive the same distance.  

To do that, we divide the total miles (480) by the slow car's speed (30 miles per hour):

480 miles / 30 miles per hour = 16 hours.

"Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice for each meal.  If 5 people eat rice for lunch and dinner, that's 5 people times 0.2 kg each, which is 1 kg of rice for each meal.

If they eat 2 kg of rice every day for a whole week, that's 2 kg times 7 days, which is 14 kg of rice for the whole week.

* He pays $2 for every mile, so he pays 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000 for driving.
* He also gives his driver $150 every month, which is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800 a year.

* The team has 105 players total.
* There are twice as many players on offense as defense.
* There are half as many players on special teams as defense.

If we think about the defense as a group of 'd' players, the offense would have 2 times 'd' players, and the special teams would have 'd'/2 players.

Adding all the groups together, we get: d + 2d + d/2 = 105

To make the adding easier, let's think of it like this:

* d + 2d + d/2 = 105
*  (1 + 2 + 1/2)d = 105
* (5/2)d = 105

Now, to find 'd', we need to divide both sides by 5/2.  That's the same as multiplying by 2/5.

* d = 105 * (2/5)
* d = 42

If 15 hours is 30% of his time, then 100% of his time is 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours.

He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so he spent 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours sightseeing.

"The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet taller than that, so it's 11 feet tall.  

The tallest tree is twice as tall as the other two trees together.  So, we add the heights of the shorter trees: 6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet.

Then we double that number: 17 feet * 2 = 34 feet.

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall!

"Morgan has $90 for her party. Mini-golf costs $5 per person, and she wants to go-kart twice, which costs $10 each time.  She also wants $5 for arcade tokens for each person.

Let's see how many friends she can invite:

* Mini-golf: $5 x (Morgan + friends) 
* Go-karts: $10 x 2 = $20
* Arcade: $5 x (Morgan + friends)

Adding it all up: $5(Morgan + friends) + $20 + $5(Morgan + friends) = $90

That's like saying: $10(Morgan + friends) + $20 = $90

Then: $10(Morgan + friends) = $70

So, Morgan + friends = 7

Since Morgan is one person, she can invite 6 friends!

"Billy had $10. Candy costs $1.50 for each pound.  He bought some candy and then used half of his change to buy 40 gumballs. Each gumball costs $0.05.  How many pounds of candy did Billy buy? 

Here's how to solve it:

* First, find out how much the gumballs cost: 40 gumballs * $0.05 = $2.00
* Then, figure out how much money Billy had left after buying the candy: $2.00 * 2 = $4.00
* Next, find out how much he spent on candy: $10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00
* Finally, divide the amount he spent on candy by the price per pound to find out how many pounds he bought: $6.00 / $1.50 = 4 pounds

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* The train goes 75 miles, then 100 miles, and then 100 + 75 - 50 miles (that's 125 miles).

* It does this 3 times a day, so that's 300 x 3 = 900 miles each day.
* The train needs service every 18,000 miles.
* To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

"A Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing, a chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds, and a collie bed needs the same amount as the average of those two.  

First, let's find out how much stuffing a collie bed needs: (8 pounds + 2 pounds) / 2 = 5 pounds.

Then, let's see how much stuffing is needed for the chihuahua beds: 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds.

Finally, let's see how much stuffing is needed for the collie beds: 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds.

To find the total stuffing needed, we add it all up: 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds.

John drives 200 miles to his friend's house, but he takes a detour that adds 10 more miles, so that's 210 miles total.  He drives 70 miles per hour, so it takes him 210 miles / 70 miles per hour = 3 hours to get there.

Then he drives 240 miles back home at 80 miles per hour. That takes him 240 miles / 80 miles per hour = 3 hours.

The whole trip takes 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

"Okay, so each picture frame costs $20 and there are 44 seniors, so that's $20 times 44 which is $880.  

Then, they need to put a logo on each frame, and that costs 20% more.  20% of $20 is $4, so each frame costs $20 plus $4, which is $24.

So, all the frames cost $24 times 44, which is $1056.

Then, 11 seniors get special cords that cost $12 each, so that's $12 times 11, which is $132.

And 2 seniors get pins that cost $5 each, so that's $5 times 2, which is $10.

* After that, it cost $14 for a whole year, which is 12 times $14, so that's $168.

If we add all that up, it's $48 + $96 + $168 = $312!

"Let's think about this step-by-step:

* The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22.
*  He saved $6 in total.
*  He saved some money on the jogger jeans and some on the tattered jeans.

To figure out how much more the jogger jeans cost originally, we need to think about how much more he saved on the tattered jeans.  Since he saved $6 total, and we know he saved $2 on the jogger jeans, he saved $6 - $2 = $4 on the tattered jeans. 


*  The jogger jeans were $22 and he saved $2 on them, so they originally cost $22 + $2 = $24. 
*  The tattered jeans were $28.

*  The jogger jeans cost $24 and the tattered jeans cost $28, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $24 = $4 more than the tattered jeans.




**Answer:**  The jogger jeans originally cost $4 more than the tattered jeans.

"Lillian made 3 bird feeders and bought 3 more.  The ones she made attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones.  Each feeder gets 20 birds.

So the homemade feeders get 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

That means her 3 homemade feeders get 30 * 3 = 90 birds.

The store-bought feeders get 20 birds each, so her 3 get 20 * 3 = 60 birds.

All together, Lillian has 90 + 60 = 150 birds in her garden!

"Kenny sold his Pokemon cards to get to the amusement park.  The ticket cost $100 and he had $50 for spending money.  That means he made $100 + $50 = $150 from selling his cards.

If each card sold for $1.50, he sold $150 / $1.50 = 100 cards.

Since he kept some cards, he must have started with more than 100.  If he kept 1/3 of his cards, that means the 100 cards he sold were 2/3 of his collection.

To find out how many cards he started with, we can think: if 100 cards is 2/3, then 1/3 is 100 cards / 2 = 50 cards.

So he started with 100 cards + 50 cards = 150 cards.

"Let's think about this!

The first place costs $200 no matter how many people come.  Then, it costs $5 for each person to eat.  The second place costs $25 for each person, and that includes food.

"Let's figure out how much it costs to put in new carpet!

* The carpet costs $12 for each square foot, and the room is 18 feet long and 12 feet wide. So, it's 18 times 12, which is 216 square feet.
* The carpet costs $12 times 216, which is $2592.
*  He also needs padding, which costs $2 for each square foot, so that's $2 times 216, which is $432.
* Taking out the old carpet costs $4 for each square foot, so that's $4 times 216, which is $864.
* Putting in the new carpet costs $34 for each square foot, so that's $34 times 216, which is $7344.

* To find the total cost, we add all the prices together: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

"Maggie's oven is a bit wonky! It gets 18 degrees hotter than what she sets it to.  

If her recipe needs 520 degrees, we need to figure out what number to put on the oven to get that.  

Let's think: if it's 18 degrees hotter than 450, that means it's like adding 18 degrees to whatever she sets it to.  

So, we need to find a number that, when we add 18 to it, equals 520.

"John worked more hours than Jill, so he made more money!

* Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday + 1 hour on Sunday = 3 hours total.
* John worked 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
* John worked 1 hour * 3 = 3 hours on Sunday.
* John worked 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours total.

Since they both make $10 an hour, John made 7 hours * $10 = $70.
Jill made 3 hours * $10 = $30.

John made $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill!

"Hannah did aerobics for 2 hours and running for 1 hour.  Aerobics burns 500 calories each hour and running burns 600 calories each hour.  

First, let's see how many calories she burned doing aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

Then, let's see how many calories she burned running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add those up: 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, she needs to drink 1600 calories / 200 calories/100 ml = 800 ml of water.

"Let's think about this like a pizza!  A triangle is like cutting a pizza into three slices. All the slices together make a whole pizza, which is 180 degrees.

*  One slice is the smallest, let's call it 'x' degrees.
*  Another slice is twice as big as the smallest, so it's 2x degrees.
*  The last slice is three times as big as the smallest, so it's 3x degrees.

If we add all the slices together, we get x + 2x + 3x = 180 degrees.

That's like saying 6x = 180 degrees.

To find out how big one slice (x) is, we divide both sides by 6: x = 30 degrees.

The biggest slice is 3 times the smallest, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees!

"Colby has lots of coins!  Let's see how many gumballs he can buy.

* Quarters are worth 25 cents each, so 8 quarters is 8 times 25 cents, which is 200 cents.

* Nickels are worth 5 cents each, so 14 nickels is 14 times 5 cents, which is 70 cents.
* Pennies are worth 1 cent each, so 15 pennies is 15 times 1 cent, which is 15 cents.

If we add all that up, Colby has 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, Colby can buy 345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs!

"Okay, so the truck starts at $30,000.  

The king cab costs $7,500 more. Then the leather seats cost one-third of that, so they cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The fancy lights cost $1,500.

Let's add all the extra stuff up: $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500

Now we add that to the price of the truck: $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500

"Tim gets $20000 every month.  He got a raise of 5%, which is like getting $1000 more each month.  He also got a bonus that's half of his normal pay, so that's $20000 divided by 2, which is $10000.

So now he makes $20000 plus $1000 plus $10000 every month, which is $31000.

If he makes $31000 every month, in a year he makes $31000 times 12 months, which is $372000.

"The plane cost $150,000.  

He pays $5,000 a month for the hanger, and twice that for gas, so that's $5,000 times 2 which is $10,000.

That means he spends $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000 every month on the plane.

In a year, there are 12 months, so he spends $15,000 times 12 which is $180,000 on keeping the plane.

"Lee has sheep and geese.  He has 20 heads in total.  All the animals have 70 legs together.  Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs.  

How many sheep does Lee have?

Let's think:

* If all the animals were sheep, they would have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
* But they only have 70 legs, so there must be some geese.

Let's try some numbers! If Lee has 15 sheep, that's 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

That leaves 70 - 60 = 10 legs for the geese.

10 legs means there are 10 / 2 = 5 geese.

That works! 15 sheep + 5 geese = 20 heads.

"Bryce and his friends ate pizza!  They had 5 pizzas, and each pizza had 12 slices. Bryce and two friends ate two-thirds of their pizzas, and the other two friends ate three-fourths of theirs.  

Let's see... two-thirds of 12 slices is 8 slices, so they ate 8 slices * 2 pizzas = 16 slices.

Three-fourths of 12 slices is 9 slices, so they ate 9 slices * 2 pizzas = 18 slices.

That means they ate a total of 16 slices + 18 slices = 34 slices.

If they had 5 pizzas with 12 slices each, that's 5 pizzas * 12 slices = 60 slices.

To find the total distance, we add the driving miles and the hiking miles: 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles!

"Ava got more points for jumping on enemies because she jumped on 8 more than Emma!  She also got more points for berries because she found 3 more. But Emma finished faster, so she got more points for that.  

Let's see... Ava got 80 points for jumping on more enemies.  She got 15 more points for berries.  But Emma got 120 points for finishing faster!  

Ava's score is 80 + 15 = 95 points.

Emma's score is 120 points.

"They ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, so that's 3 times a day times 5 days which is 15 times. Then they ride twice as much on 2 other days, so that's 3 times a day times 2 which is 6 times each day.  That's 6 times a day times 2 days which is 12 times.  So they ride their bikes 15 times plus 12 times which is 27 times!

"Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.  He bought some more fish from the pet store. Now he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  If he bought 17 fish in total, how many white fish did he buy?

Let's think:

*  He started with 4 white fish.
*  He wants twice as many orange fish as white fish. 

That means he must have bought more orange fish than white fish.  

Hmmm...  Let's try some numbers! If he bought 5 white fish, that means he bought 12 orange fish (because 17 total fish - 5 white fish = 12 orange fish).  

That works!

"Andy drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home, so that's 10 miles every day.  

He drives to work five days a week, so that's 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles a week.

His car uses 10 miles for every gallon of gas. So, he uses 50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons of gas a week.

Gas costs $3 per gallon, so he spends 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15 a week on gas.

"Let's think about this step by step!

* PJ has some cards, let's say 'x' cards.
* Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ, so Smendrick has 3 * x = 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that all together they have 341 cards. So:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Let's combine the 'x's:

7x + 12 = 341

Now, let's take away 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

And then divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

So PJ has 47 cards.

Now we can find out how many cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.




Becca has 153 cards.

"Let's think about this step by step!

* I'm 3 years younger than my brother, so if he's 16, I'm 13. 
* I'm 2 years older than my sister.

"Let's think about this problem step-by-step.

* Fawn has some books, let's say 'F'.
* Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has 'F - 12' books.
* Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has 'F - 12 + 25' which is 'F + 13' books.

Together they have 85 books, so:

F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Let's combine the 'F's:

3F + 1 = 85

Now, let's take away 1 from both sides:

3F = 84

Finally, divide both sides by 3 to find out how many books Fawn has:

F = 28

"Rita picked 39 Junebugs on Monday.  She picked twice as many on Tuesday and Wednesday, so that's 39 times 2 which is 78 Junebugs each day.  That's 78 + 78 = 156 Junebugs for Tuesday and Wednesday together.  Then she picked 48 on Thursday and 57 on Friday.  So in total she picked 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs.  

If she picked Junebugs for 5 days, she picked an average of 300 / 5 = 60 Junebugs each day.

"The bus drove for 5 hours and went 60 miles each hour, so it drove 5 times 60 which is 300 miles!  The car drove for 8 hours and went 30 miles each hour, so it drove 8 times 30 which is 240 miles.  

To find out how much farther the bus drove, we need to subtract: 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.


The bus drove 60 miles farther than the car.

"Peter, Paul, and Jean are 100 years old together. Paul is 10 years older than John. Peter is as old as Paul and John together. How old is Peter?

Let's think about it:

* If Paul is 10 years older than John, that means if John is 10, Paul is 20.
* Peter is as old as Paul and John together, so if John is 10 and Paul is 20, Peter is 30.

So Peter is 30 years old.

"The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets every hour and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45.  Each widget sells for $6.  If they both run for 24 hours a day for a whole month (30 days),  the Widgeteer 3000 will make more money.  

Let's see... the Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 times $6 = $360 every hour. In a day, that's $360 times 24 = $8640.  In a month, that's $8640 times 30 = $259,200!

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 times $6 = $270 every hour. In a day, that's $270 times 24 = $6480. In a month, that's $6480 times 30 = $194,400.

So the Widgeteer 3000 makes $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800 more!

"Let's see... Cameron stays for a long time!  He's at the hotel for 17 hours.  

The hotel costs 1000 pesos for 12 hours, and then 70 pesos for each extra hour.  

So, he stays 17 - 12 = 5 extra hours.

That's 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos extra.

So, he pays 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

If he stayed for the whole 24 hours, it would cost 1600 pesos.

He saves 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos!

* Stan caught 13 less than 4 times the number Adelwolfe caught.
* Together they caught 339 Pokemon.

Hmm, that's tricky!  Let's try to figure out how many Pokemon Stan caught.  

If we think about it, we know Stan caught less than Alex, and Adelwolfe caught the fewest.  

Let's try some numbers! If Adelwolfe caught 10 Pokemon, Stan would have caught 4 times that minus 13, which is 27.  

That means Alex caught 27 plus 5, which is 32.  

Together, they caught 10 + 27 + 32 = 69 Pokemon.  That's not enough!

Let's try a bigger number for Adelwolfe.  If Adelwolfe caught 30 Pokemon, Stan would have caught 4 times that minus 13, which is 107.

That means Alex caught 107 plus 5, which is 112.

Together, they caught 30 + 107 + 112 = 249 Pokemon.  Still not enough!

Let's keep trying!  If Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon, Stan would have caught 4 times that minus 13, which is 147.

That means Alex caught 147 plus 5, which is 152.

Together, they caught 40 + 147 + 152 = 339 Pokemon!

Then it flew south again for 5 hours at 22 miles an hour, so it flew 22 times 5, which is 110 miles.

To find the total distance south, we add up all the miles it flew south: 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles.

* She started with 12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges
* She gave away 4 boxes, so that's 4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges.
* That means she had 240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges left.

Adam needed $30 for the trousers and his parents gave him $18, so he had to pay $30 - $18 = $12 himself.

"Let's figure this out!

Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4, so together they are 3 + 4 = 7 years old.

Helene is twice the average age of all the kids. The average age is 20 years / 4 kids = 5 years old.

So Helene is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

That means Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene are a total of 7 + 10 = 17 years old.

Since all four kids are 20 years old together, Wilfred must be 20 - 17 = 3 years old. 


**Wilfred is 3 years old.**

"There were 100 people at the wedding, and each person brought 15 cookies. That means there were 100 times 15, which is 1500 cookies!

The bride gave half of the cookies to the church, so that's 1500 divided by 2, which is 750 cookies.

Each person at the church got 15 cookies, so there must have been 750 divided by 15, which is 50 people at the church!

"Okay, so there are 2 grown-ups and 4 kids.  The grown-ups get twice as much watermelon as the kids.  

If we think of the watermelon like a pizza cut into 6 slices, the grown-ups get 2 big slices each, and the kids each get 1 small slice.

That means the grown-ups get 4 big slices in total, and the kids get 4 small slices.

So, the grown-ups get 4 out of 6 slices, which is 2/3 of the watermelon.

If we want to know that as a percentage, we can say that's 66.66%

"Doctor Jones works for nine hours.  He spends time checking on patients and seeing people with appointments.  

Checking on patients takes 20 minutes for each of the 9 patients, so that's 20 times 9, which is 180 minutes.

His appointments take 30 minutes each, and he has 10 appointments, so that's 30 times 10, which is 300 minutes.

That's a total of 180 minutes plus 300 minutes, which is 480 minutes.

If there are 60 minutes in an hour, then 480 minutes is 480 divided by 60, which is 8 hours.

So he spends 8 hours checking on patients and seeing people.  That means he has 9 hours minus 8 hours, which is 1 hour left to update his records.

So that's 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes total.

If we take away 180 minutes from 5:00 pm, that means she needs to start making the cake at 2:00 pm!

"Okay, so the studio costs $25 to rent each time, and each student costs $1.50.  

With 10 students, that's $1.50 times 10, which is $15 extra.

So each time they use the studio, it costs $25 + $15 = $40.

They use the studio 3 times a week, so that's $40 times 3, which is $120 each week.

"There are 50 porcupines, and 3 out of every 5 are girls. So, there are 30 girl porcupines.  Each girl has 4 babies every month, so in a year (12 months) they have 4 babies * 12 months = 48 babies each. That means all the girl porcupines have 30 girls * 48 babies = 1440 babies!  If you add the babies to the original 50 porcupines, there will be 50 + 1440 = 1490 porcupines.

"The pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.  

To find out how many gallons of water it needs, we need to multiply those numbers together first: 14 x 25 x 4 = 1400 cubic feet.

Then we multiply that by 5.9 because the pool company said to do that: 1400 x 5.9 = 8260 gallons.

Finally, it costs $0.10 for each gallon, so we multiply that by 8260: 8260 x $0.10 = $826.00


**Answer:** It will cost $826.00 to fill the pool.

"Okay, so there are 3000 students at the school. Half of them are older than 16, which is 1500 students.  

Then, a quarter of those older students are boys, so that's 1500 / 4 = 375 boys. That means 1500 - 375 = 1125 girls are older than 16.

The other half of the students are younger than 16, which is also 1500 students. Half of those are boys, so 1500 / 2 = 750 boys. That means 1500 - 750 = 750 girls are younger than 16.

To find the total number of girls, we add the number of girls older than 16 and younger than 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls.

"Okay, so Wanda and Ms. B filled up a big tank that holds 18,000 gallons of water.

On the first day, Wanda put in 1/4 of the tank, which is 18,000 / 4 = 4,500 gallons.  Ms. B put in 3/4 of what Wanda put in, so she put in 3/4 * 4,500 = 3,375 gallons.

Together, they put in 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 gallons on the first day.

On the second day, Wanda put in 2/3 of what she put in on the first day, so she put in 2/3 * 4,500 = 3,000 gallons. Ms. B put in 1/3 of what she put in on the first day, so she put in 1/3 * 3,375 = 1,125 gallons.

Together, they put in 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons on the second day.

In total, they put in 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 gallons.

So, there are 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons left to fill the tank.

Jamaar bought 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples. Let's see how much that cost:

* Peaches: 3 x $0.50 = $1.50
* Pears: 4 x $0.50 = $2.00
* Apples: 5 x $0.75 = $3.75
* Kiwis: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

That's a total of $1.50 + $2.00 + $3.75 + $2.00 = $9.25

Jamaar had $10.00 and spent $9.25, so he has $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

He can buy $0.75 / $0.25 = 3 plums.

"Anne had a big box of sweets with lots of little packs. Each pack had 60 sweets inside, and there were 15 packs in total.  She kept 2 packs for herself, so that means she gave 13 packs to her friends.  She shared the sweets equally with her 10 friends.  

To find out how many sweets each friend got, we can do some counting! 

* 13 packs * 60 sweets/pack = 780 sweets
* 780 sweets / 10 friends = 78 sweets/friend


Each friend got 78 sweets.

"Teresa sells big stuffed animals for three times the price of the small ones.  She sold twice as many small ones as big ones and made $120.  A small stuffed animal costs $4.  How many small stuffed animals did she sell?

Let's think:

* If a small one costs $4, and she sold twice as many small ones as big ones, she made a lot of money from the small ones! 
*  She made $120 total, so she must have sold a good number of small ones.

Hmmm... let's try 10 small ones. That would be 10 * $4 = $40.  That's not enough to reach $120.

Let's think:

* He borrowed $50,000 each year for four years, so that's $50,000 x 4 = $200,000.
* He lost $25,000 each year for four years, so that's $25,000 x 4 = $100,000.

To find out how much his friend saved, we need to see how much less his friend paid compared to the original price.  His friend paid $1800, and the watch originally cost $2000.  That means his friend saved $200!

To find the percentage, we divide the savings by the original price: $200 / $2000 = 0.10.

* Half the bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so Marcel sold 300 bikes / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

* 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, so he sold 300 bikes * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

* That means he sold 300 bikes - 150 bikes - 45 bikes = 105 MTB bikes.

*  Marcel made $450 * 150 = $67,500 from the Trekking bikes.

* He made $250 * 45 = $11,250 from the BMX bikes.

"John goes to school for 6 periods each day, but he has 2 extra classes that are 40 minutes long each. That's 80 extra minutes!

He goes to school 5 days a week, so that's 6 periods * 40 minutes each = 240 minutes each day. Plus his extra 80 minutes, that's 320 minutes a day.

So in a week, he spends 320 minutes a day * 5 days a week = 1600 minutes in class.

On Saturday and Sunday, he spends 1/16 of his week learning extra, which is 1600 minutes / 16 = 100 minutes each day.

That's 100 minutes * 2 days = 200 extra minutes.

So all together, he spends 1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes learning each week.

If there are 60 minutes in an hour, he spends 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours learning each week.

* They need to make 400 toys, and they still need 20 more, so they need to make 400 + 20 = 420 toys.
* That means the fifth worker needs to make 420 - 200 = 220 toys.
* If they work for 10 hours, the fifth worker makes 220 / 10 = 22 toys each hour.

"Kory's dog is 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the size of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the size of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Together, Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

All together, Kory's dog and Elijah's dogs weigh 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

"Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.  

Let's think about it:

* If Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, and they painted 30 eggs together, Sarah must have painted 9 eggs (because 30 - 12 = 18, and 18 / 2 = 9).

* Camden painted 21 eggs (because 9 + 12 = 21).

* Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and they painted 56 eggs total.  

* So, Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs together.

* That means Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs (because 26 / 2 = 13).

* Camden painted 21 eggs and Arnold painted 13 eggs.

* Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"The yellow rope is the longest.  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. The red rope is four times as long as the blue rope.

If all three ropes are put together, they are 37 centimeters long.

Let's think:

* If the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, and they add up to a certain length, the yellow rope must be longer.

* The red rope is four times longer than the blue rope, so it will be the longest.

Let's try some numbers! If the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, the blue rope would be 5 centimeters long (12 - 7 = 5). The red rope would be 20 centimeters long (5 x 4 = 20).

* On the second day, they used 10 less bandages than the first day, so 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
* On the third day, they used half a pack of 50 bandages, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.
* In total, they used 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages.
* They had 78 bandages left, so they must have had 91 + 78 = 169 bandages before the third day.
* They got two new packs of 50 bandages on the third day, so that's 50 * 2 = 100 bandages.
* Before getting those new packs, they had 169 - 100 = 69 bandages.
*  At the very beginning, they had 69 + 38 + 50 = 157 bandages.

"Jen works for 7.5 hours each day and 6 days a week. That means she works 7.5 times 6 which is 45 hours a week!

She makes $1.50 for each hour, so she makes 45 times 1.50 which is $67.50 each week.

April has 4 weeks, so she makes 67.50 times 4 which is $270.00 in a month.

But wait, she also gets an extra $10 for not missing any days! So she makes 270 plus 10 which is $280.00 for April!

"Jason got $3.00 for doing his laundry, $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 for taking out the trash, and $0.50 for doing the dishes.

He did the dishes 6 times, his laundry once, took out the trash twice, and cleaned his room once.

Let's see how much he made:

* Dishes: 6 times * $0.50 = $3.00
* Laundry: 1 time * $3.00 = $3.00
* Trash: 2 times * $0.75 = $1.50
* Cleaning: 1 time * $1.50 = $1.50

Now let's add it all up: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00

"John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. That means each bottle costs $60.  

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 bottles. Cognac costs 50% more than scotch, so each bottle costs $60 plus half of $60, which is $30 more. That means each cognac bottle costs $90.

To find out how much he spends on cognac, we multiply the number of bottles by the price per bottle: 20 bottles times $90 each is $1800.

Finally, to find out how much he spends on everything, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 plus $1800 is $2400.

"Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day. He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, so he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.

He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 / 4 = 10 more. So he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

In total, he planted 50 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 100 trees!

"Let's think about this!

*  Four times the number of mugs means we multiply the number of mugs by 4.

So, if four times the number of mugs plus 8 equals 40, we can write it like this:

4 times the mugs + 8 = 40

To find out how many mugs there are, we need to figure out what number, when multiplied by 4 and then added to 8, gives us 40.  

Let's try some numbers! If we have 8 mugs, four times that is 32, and 32 plus 8 is 40!

"Amy had two palettes with four colors each, so that's 2 times 4 which is 8 colors.  Then she had three makeup sets with six colors each, so that's 3 times 6 which is 18 colors.  That means she had 8 plus 18 which is 26 colors in total.

Her sister took one palette, which had 4 colors, so now Amy has 26 minus 4 which is 22 colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which is 6 colors divided by 2 which is 3 colors.

So now Amy has 22 minus 3 which is 19 colors left.

"Mattison is 60 inches tall, and his house is 7 times taller than him. That means his house is 60 * 7 = 420 inches tall!

The first floor is 3 times taller than Mattison, so it's 60 * 3 = 180 inches high.

To find how high the roof is from the second floor, we need to subtract the first floor's height from the whole house's height: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

"Brian's dehumidifier takes out water from the air.  

* On low, it takes out 1 liter of water each day.
* On medium, it takes out twice as much as low, so 1 liter * 2 = 2 liters each day.
* On high, it takes out twice as much as medium, so 2 liters * 2 = 4 liters each day.

Brian used it on low for 3 days, so it took out 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

Then he used it on medium for 3 days, so it took out 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

Finally, he used it on high for 5 days, so it took out 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

But jelly beans don't fit perfectly, they have some space between them.  We know they fit about 80% of the space, so we multiply 540 by 0.80: 540 * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, so we divide the space they fit by the space each jelly bean takes up: 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans.

Tim thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red, so we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.30: 2880 * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

"It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry with the old varnish, but 12 minutes with the new one.  

So, with the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes times 6 paintings, which is 72 minutes.

With the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes times 6 paintings, which is 42 minutes.

If we take away the old drying time from the new drying time, we get 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

"Crista needs to water her plants every day.  

* Four plants need half a cup of water, so that's 4 x 0.5 = 2 cups.
* Eight plants need a whole cup of water, so that's 8 x 1 = 8 cups.
* The rest of the plants, which is 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants, need a quarter cup each, so that's 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups.

If you add all the water together, Crista needs 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water.

"Phineas has to go 200 yards back home.  He goes half the way on land and half in water.

He hops 20 yards every minute on land and swims 10 yards every minute in water.

So, he takes 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes to hop.

And he takes 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes to swim.

That means it takes him 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes to get home.

"Let's figure this out!

* First year, the boat lost 30% of its value, which is like losing $9000 * 0.30 = $2700.  So it's worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

* The next year, it loses another 30% of the *new* price, so that's $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.  Now it's worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

*  The last year, it loses 20% of *that* price, which is $4410 * 0.20 = $882.
