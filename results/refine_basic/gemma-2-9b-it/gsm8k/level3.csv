"Let's break down Josh's real estate venture:

First, we need to determine the house's value after the 150% increase.  A 150% increase means the value tripled. So, the house's value jumped from $80,000 to $240,000 ($80,000 * 3 = $240,000).

Next, we add the cost of repairs to find the total investment: $80,000 (initial cost) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.

Finally, subtract the total investment from the final value to calculate the profit: $240,000 (final value) - $130,000 (investment) = $110,000.



**Profit: $110,000**

"Ah, a classic download disruption scenario!  Let's break it down:

First, we need to figure out how long it takes to download the initial chunk before the interruption.  Since the download speed is 2 GB per minute and the file is 200 GB, that's 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

Now, the interruption occurs 40% of the way through, meaning 100 minutes * 40% = 40 minutes.  

This means 80 GB (40 minutes * 2 GB/minute) have already been downloaded.  

The remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB) will take another 60 minutes to download.

Finally, we add the interruption time (20 minutes) to get the total download time: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down methodically.

First, we need to determine the amount of water in each drink separately. The orange drink is two-thirds water, so in 10 liters, there are (2/3) * 10 liters = 6.67 liters of water.  

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, meaning it contains (3/5) * 15 liters = 9 liters of water.

Now, we account for the spilled orange drink.  This reduces the water content of the orange drink by 1 liter, leaving us with 6.67 liters - 1 liter = 5.67 liters.

Finally, we add the water content of both drinks to find the total water in the mixture: 5.67 liters + 9 liters = 14.67 liters.

We know the heels cost b - $5, so we can set up the equation:

b - $5 = $99

To solve for 'b', add $5 to both sides of the equation:

b = $104



**Therefore, the boots cost $104.**

"To find the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we can represent this problem with a system of equations.

Let 'g' represent the number of gold coins and 's' represent the number of silver coins. We know:

*  g + s = 110  (The total number of coins is 110)
*  g = s + 30   (There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

We can solve for 'g' by substituting the second equation into the first:

Combining like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

s = 40

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can substitute that value back into either of the original equations to solve for 'g'. Let's use g = s + 30:

g = 40 + 30

g = 70


**Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.**

"This problem involves a geometric series where the first term is 16 and the common ratio is 1/2 (each level is half the size of the one below).  

The sum of a finite geometric series is given by:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where:

* S is the sum of the series
* a is the first term
* r is the common ratio
* n is the number of terms

In this case:

* a = 16
* r = 1/2
* n = 4

Plugging these values into the formula:

S = 16 (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
S = 16 (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 (15/16) * 2
S = 30

"Let's break down this cookie conundrum step-by-step.

*  Let 'x' represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

*  This year, he baked twice that amount, so he baked 2x cookies.

*  He ended up with 15 more cookies than intended, meaning he baked 2x + 15 cookies.

*  After dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 left, so we can write the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110

*  Simplifying the equation: 2x + 10 = 110

*  Subtract 10 from both sides: 2x = 100

*  Divide both sides by 2: x = 50


Henry baked **50** cookies last year.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

* **Adrien's Initial Salary:** We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000 and it increased by 40%.  This means his salary four years ago was 100% of his salary, and the increase represents 40%.  To find his initial salary, we can set up a proportion:

   (Initial Salary) / (40,000) = 100% / (100% + 40%)

   Solving for Initial Salary, we get:

   Initial Salary = (40,000 * 100%) / (140%) = $28,571.43 (approximately)

* **Lylah's Initial Salary:**  Adrien's initial salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.  Let Lylah's initial salary be represented by 'x'. We can set up the equation:

   1.30x = $28,571.43

   Solving for x, we get:

   x = $28,571.43 / 1.30 = $21,978.03 (approximately)

* **Salaries Four Years Later:**  We don't know the exact percentage increase for Lylah, but we know it happened simultaneously with Adrien's 40% increase.  To find their salaries four years later, we need to assume a percentage increase for Lylah.  

**Without knowing Lylah's percentage increase, we cannot calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later.**

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

* Let  'w' represent the cost of a watermelon.
* Let 'p' represent the cost of a pepper.
* Let 'o' represent the cost of an orange.

We're given the following information:

*  w = 3p  (A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs)
*  o = w - 5 (An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon)
*  Dillon buys 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.

We can express Dillon's total cost (T) as:

T = 4w + 20p + 10o

Now, substitute the expressions for 'w' and 'o' in terms of 'p':

T = 4(3p) + 20p + 10(3p - 5)

Simplify the equation:

T = 12p + 20p + 30p - 50
T = 62p - 50

We know that p = $15, so substitute that in:

T = (62 * $15) - $50
T = $930 - $50
T = $880



**Therefore, Dillon will spend a total of $880.**

"Ah, a classic example of exponential growth!  

When a price increases by a percentage over a set period, and that percentage is applied to the *new* price each time, we're dealing with compound growth.  

In this case, the price of the marbles increases by 20% every two months.  To find the price after 36 months, we can use the following formula:

Final Price = Original Price * (1 + Growth Rate) ^ (Number of Periods)

Let's plug in our values:

* Original Price = $20
* Growth Rate = 20% = 0.20
* Number of Periods = 36 months / 2 months/period = 18 periods

Final Price = $20 * (1 + 0.20) ^ 18 
Final Price = $20 * (1.20) ^ 18
Final Price ≈ $201.25

"Let's break this problem down systematically.  

Let Seth's current age be represented by the variable 's' and Brooke's current age by 'b'.  We can formulate two equations based on the given information:

*  Equation 1: s = 2b  (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
*  Equation 2: s + 2 + b + 2 = 28 (In two years, their ages sum to 28)

Simplifying Equation 2, we get: s + b = 24

Now we can use substitution. Since we know s = 2b from Equation 1, substitute '2b' for 's' in the simplified Equation 2:

2b + b = 24

Combining like terms: 3b = 24

Solving for 'b': b = 8

Now that we know Brooke is 8 years old, we can plug that back into either Equation 1 or the simplified Equation 2 to solve for 's'. Let's use Equation 1:

s = 2 * 8

Therefore, s = 16.

*  Therefore, 20 dozen cups cost $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

* Since 20 dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups, we can set up the equation: 240c = $34800

*  Solving for 'c', we divide both sides by 240: c = $34800 / 240 = $145



**The total cost of buying each cup is $145.**

"Let's break down this classic problem:

**Define our variables:**

* Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

**Set up our equations:**

* We know that 3r + 5w = 42 (the total number of eggs collected daily).
* We also know that w = r + 2 (there are two more white chickens than red chickens).

**Solve for 'r' using substitution:**

1. Substitute (r + 2) for 'w' in the first equation: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

2. Simplify and solve for 'r':
   3r + 5r + 10 = 42
   8r + 10 = 42
   8r = 32
   r = 4



**Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.**

"Ah, a classic perimeter and time problem!  

First, we need to find the total distance Gary walks, which is the perimeter of the rectangular park.  The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).  

In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.  So, the perimeter is:

2 * (6 miles + 1.5 miles) = 2 * 7.5 miles = 15 miles

Now that we know the distance, we can calculate the time it takes Gary to walk the entire perimeter.  We use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, so the time is:

Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours.

"Let's model this problem with a system of differential equations.

Let:

*  *S(t)* represent the amount of water in the small pool at time *t*
*  *B(t)* represent the amount of water in the big pool at time *t*

We know the following:

*  The rate of change of water in each pool is -4 gallons per minute due to the leaks:
    *  *dS/dt* = -4
    *  *dB/dt* = -4

*  Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
    *  *B(0)* = 2*S(0)*

*  Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
    *  *B(4)* = 4*S(4)*

Now we have a system of differential equations and initial conditions.  Solving this system will give us the amount of water in each pool at any time *t*.  

To find the amount of water in the small pool now (at *t* = 4 minutes), we can directly solve the system.  

Integrating the differential equations, we get:

*  *S(t)* = -4t + C₁
*  *B(t)* = -4t + C₂

Using the initial conditions:

*  *B(0)* = 2*S(0)*  =>  C₂ = 2C₁
*  *B(4)* = 4*S(4)*  =>  -16 + C₂ = 4(-16 + C₁)

Substituting C₂ = 2C₁ into the second equation and solving for C₁, we can find the values of C₁ and C₂.  Finally, substitute *t* = 4 into the equation for *S(t)* to find the amount of water in the small pool now.

    *  ""Harriet is half the age of Zack"": h = z / 2
    *  ""Harriet is 21 years old now"": h = 21

* **Solve for the ages:**
    * Since we know h = 21, we can substitute that into the second equation: 21 = z / 2.  Solving for z, we get z = 42.
    * Now, substitute h = 21 into the first equation: a = 3 * 21, which gives us a = 63.

* **Calculate ages in three years:**
    * Adrian in three years: 63 + 3 = 66
    * Harriet in three years: 21 + 3 = 24

"Let's represent the unknowns with variables:

* Let 'a' be the number of apples Jamal has.
* Let 'b' be the number of bananas Jamal has.
* Let 'c' be the number of apples Andrea has.
* Let 'd' be the number of bananas Andrea has.

We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

* c = a + 8  (Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal)
* d = b / 2  (Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal)
* b = a + 4  (Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples)
* c = 52    (Andrea has 52 apples)

Now we can solve for the unknowns:

1. **Substitute** the value of 'c' (52) into the first equation: 52 = a + 8.  Solving for 'a', we get a = 44 (Jamal's apples).

2. **Substitute** the value of 'a' (44) into the third equation: b = 44 + 4.  Solving for 'b', we get b = 48 (Jamal's bananas).

3. **Substitute** the value of 'b' (48) into the second equation: d = 48 / 2.  Solving for 'd', we get d = 24 (Andrea's bananas).

4. **Calculate** the total fruits for each person:
   * Jamal: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits
   * Andrea: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits

5. **Add** the fruits of both individuals to find the total: 92 + 76 = 168 fruits.

* **Six years ago:**
    * Cera was C - 6 years old.
    * Noah was N - 6 years old.

* **We know:**
    *  N - 6 = (C - 6) / 2  (Noah was half Cera's age six years ago)
    *  C = 46 (Cera's current age)
    *  3000 * (N - 6) = Chile's population six years ago

* **Substitute C = 46 into the first equation:**
    * N - 6 = (46 - 6) / 2
    * N - 6 = 20
    * N = 26 (Noah's current age)

* **Calculate Chile's population six years ago:**

"To find the cost of filling the pool, we first need to determine its volume.  

The volume of a rectangular pool is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth:

Volume = length x width x depth
Volume = 6 feet x 4 feet x 5 feet
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Now, knowing the volume and the cost per cubic foot, we can calculate the total cost:

"To determine the total weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we need to consider the contributions from both the ice cubes and the added cream.

The ice cubes cool the coffee by 13 degrees per cube, and each cube also weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters.  Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we know she used 65 degrees / 13 degrees/cube = 5 ice cubes.  This means the ice cubes contribute a total of 5 cubes * 12 milliliters/cube = 60 milliliters of weakening.

The added cream directly weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

"Let's break down this word problem step-by-step.

Let 'x' represent the son's age.  We know:

* Twice the son's age is 2x.
* Five years less than twice the son's age is 2x - 5.
* This expression equals Carver's age, which is 45.

Therefore, we have the equation: 2x - 5 = 45

To solve for x, we can follow these steps:

1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x = 50
2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 25


The son is 25 years old.

"Let's break down this train travel problem step-by-step:

* **Leg 1 & 2:** The train travels 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.
* **Leg 3:**  Leg 3 is 50 miles less than the combined distance of Leg 1 & 2, so it's 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.
* **Round Trip:**  The total distance for one complete round trip is 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.
* **Daily Distance:** Since the train makes 3 trips per day, it covers 300 miles/trip * 3 trips = 900 miles each day.
* **Service Interval:**  The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so it travels for 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days between services.



**Answer:** The train goes 20 days between services.

"Let's break down this energy consumption problem:

First, we need to figure out the daily energy usage of the air conditioner.  It uses 900 watts for 8 hours, so the daily consumption is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours.

Now, Mel reduces his usage by 5 hours, meaning he'll use it for 3 hours daily.  This results in a new daily consumption of 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours.

The daily energy savings are the difference: 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours.

Finally, to find the savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days: 4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours.

To express this in kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000: 135,000 watt-hours / 1000 = 135 kWh.

   The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog, given that it's one of the more dangerous candles, is 5% or 0.05.

* **Independent Events:** We assume the events of a candle exploding and smelling like wet dog are independent. This means the occurrence of one doesn't affect the probability of the other.

* **Probability of Both Events:** To find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities of each individual event: 0.01 * 0.05 = 0.0005

* **Number of Candles:**  Finally, multiply this probability by the total number of candles to find the expected number: 0.0005 * 50000 = 25



**Answer:** 25 candles are expected to both explode and smell like wet dog.

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

* Let  't' represent the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees.
* Let 's' represent the number of apples Joanne gathered from the shortest trees.
* Let 'a' represent the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

We know:

* t = 30
* s = t/2 = 15
* t + s + a = Joanne's total apples
* 2t + 3s = Sister's total apples from shortest and tallest trees
* Joanne's total apples + Sister's total apples = 500

Now we can substitute and solve:

* 30 + 15 + a = Joanne's total apples
* 2(30) + 3(15) = Sister's total apples from shortest and tallest trees
* 45 + a + 60 + 45 = 500

Simplifying the last equation:

* 45 + a + 105 = 500
* a + 150 = 500
* a = 350



**Answer: Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.**

"To determine the number of dromedaries, we can set up a system of equations. Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.

*  Equation 1: c + d = 180 (The total number of heads)
*  Equation 2: 2c + d = 304 (The total number of humps)

We can solve for 'd' using elimination.  Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now, substitute the value of 'c' back into Equation 1:

124 + d = 180
d = 56

"Let's break down this strawberry-picking problem step by step:

* **Tony's Rate:** Tony picks 6 quarts per hour.

* **Bobby's Rate:** Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so he picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

* **Kathy's Rate:** Kathy picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, meaning she picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.

* **Ricky's Rate:** Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so he picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

* **Total Rate:** To find the combined rate, we add up their individual rates: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour.

"Let's break this problem down using a system of linear equations.

Let:

*  *o* represent the number of chairs Ophelia has
*  *j* represent the number of chairs Jenna has
*  *s* represent the number of sofas Ophelia has
*  *t* represent the number of sofas Jenna has

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

*  *s* = *o* - 2  (Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs)
*  *t* = *j* - 2  (Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs)
*  *j* = 3*o* (Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia)
*  *s* = 20 (Ophelia has 20 sofas)

Now we can solve for the unknowns.  Since we know *s* = 20, we can substitute that into the first equation to find *o*:

* 20 = *o* - 2
* *o* = 22

Next, we can use *j* = 3*o* to find *j*:

* *j* = 3 * 22
* *j* = 66

Now we can find *t* using *t* = *j* - 2:

* *t* = 66 - 2
* *t* = 64

Finally, to find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add up all the values:

* Total = *s* + *t* + *o* + *j*
* Total = 20 + 64 + 22 + 66 
* Total = 172

"Let's break this problem down using a system of linear equations.

Let  'j' represent Jame's current age and 'c' represent his cousin's current age.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:** j + 5 = 27  (Jame will be 27 in 5 years)
* **Equation 2:** c + 8 = 2(j + 8) - 5 (In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age)

Now we can solve for our variables.

From Equation 1, we find:
j = 22

Substitute this value of 'j' into Equation 2:

c + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5
c + 8 = 60 - 5
c + 8 = 55
c = 47

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is:

"Let's represent the cost of one monitor with the variable 'm'. We can set up a system of equations to solve for 'm':

*  Equation 1:  computer + 2*monitor + printer = $2400
*  Equation 2: computer = $1100
*  Equation 3: printer = computer - $400

Substituting the value of the computer from Equation 2 into Equation 3, we get:

* Equation 3: printer = $1100 - $400 = $700

Now, substitute the values of the computer and printer into Equation 1:

* $1100 + 2m + $700 = $2400

"To determine the food truck's net profit, we need to analyze their cost structure and revenue generation. 

First, let's break down the costs:

* **Variable Costs:** These costs fluctuate directly with the number of sandwiches produced. In this case, the variable costs are the cost of bread and cheese/condiments.
    * Bread cost per sandwich: $3.00 (loaf) / 10 sandwiches = $0.30
    * Cheese/condiment cost per 10 sandwiches: $30.00

* **Fixed Costs:** These costs remain constant regardless of the number of sandwiches produced.  We'll assume there are no fixed costs mentioned in the scenario.

Now, let's calculate the revenue:

* Revenue per 10 sandwiches: 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

Finally, we can determine the net profit:

* Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Costs
* Net Profit = $70.00 - ($3.00 + $30.00) 
* Net Profit = $70.00 - $33.00
* Net Profit = $37.00




**Therefore, the food truck's net profit is $37.00.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using a system of equations.

Let:

*  'c' represent the number of cups Judy brought.
*  'd' represent the number of dishes Judy brought.

We know:

*  Judy brought a dozen cups, so c = 12.
*  Judy brought twice as many dishes as cups, so d = 2c = 2 * 12 = 24.
*  Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and d + 20 dishes.

To find the total number of utensils brought by both, we need to add up the cups and dishes:

* Judy's total utensils: c + d = 12 + 24 = 36
* Friend's total utensils: 40 + (d + 20) = 40 + 24 + 20 = 84
* Total utensils: 36 + 84 = 120

"Ah, a classic example of compound growth!  Let's break down John's research costs.

The key here is recognizing that the funding isn't increasing at a constant rate, but rather at a rate that grows with each passing month.  

Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Initial Funding:**  John starts with $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Growth Factor:**  Each month after the initial 5, his funding increases by 50%, meaning his funding is multiplied by 1.50.

3. **Calculating Monthly Funding:**

   * Month 6: $100,000 * 1.50 = $150,000
   * Month 7: $150,000 * 1.50 = $225,000

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Find the total number of seats:**  The auditorium has 4 rows with 18 seats each, so there are 4 * 18 = 72 seats in total.

* **Calculate the number of seats occupied by administrators:** One-fourth of the seats were taken by administrators, meaning 72 * (1/4) = 18 seats were occupied.

* **Determine the number of seats remaining:**  After the administrators took their seats, 72 - 18 = 54 seats were left.

* **Calculate the number of seats occupied by parents:** One-third of the remaining seats were filled by parents, so 54 * (1/3) = 18 seats were occupied by parents.

* **Find the number of student seats:**  Subtracting the seats taken by administrators and parents from the total remaining seats, we find 54 - 18 = 36 seats were occupied by students.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

*  Let 'x' represent the original length of the dress.

*  A 50% increase in length is equivalent to 0.50x.

*  The dress's length after the extension is x + 0.50x = 1.50x.

*  Adding the 20cm lace trim brings the total length to 1.50x + 20cm.

*  We know this final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 1.50x + 20 = 140

*  Subtracting 20cm from both sides, we get: 1.50x = 120cm

*  Finally, dividing both sides by 1.50 gives us the original length: x = 80cm




**Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm.**

"Let's break this problem down systematically.

**Define Variables:**

* Let 't' represent the age of one triplet.
* Let 'w' represent the age of one twin.

**Set up the Equations:**

We're given two key pieces of information:

1.  The twin is 7 years older than a triplet:  w = t + 7
2.  The combined ages of all five children are 44: w + w + t + t + t = 44

**Simplify and Solve:**

*  Combine like terms in the second equation: 2w + 3t = 44

*  Substitute the first equation (w = t + 7) into the simplified second equation: 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

*  Expand and solve for 't': 2t + 14 + 3t = 44  =>  5t + 14 = 44  =>  5t = 30  =>  t = 6

*  Now that we know 't' (the age of one triplet), we can find 'w' (the age of one twin) using the first equation: w = 6 + 7 => w = 13

"Let's represent Dora's age as ""D"", her father's age as ""F"", and her mother's age as ""M"".  We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

*  F = 2D + 8  (Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age)
*  M = F - 4   (Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father)
*  D = 15      (Dora is 15 years old)

Now, substitute the value of D into the first equation to find F:

* F = (2 * 15) + 8
* F = 30 + 8
* F = 38

Next, substitute the value of F into the second equation to find M:

* M = 38 - 4

"Let's break down this basketball problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many points Julie scored in the first game.  We know Sasha scored 14 points, and Julie scored 4 fewer than that, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

Now, for the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie scored in the first game.  That means Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Finally, to find Sasha's total score for both games, we add her scores from each game: 14 + 4 = 18 points.



**Answer:** Sasha scored a total of 18 points.

"Let's break this problem down systematically.

Let:

*  *x* represent the number of cards PJ has.
*  *y* represent the number of cards Smendrick has.
*  *z* represent the number of cards Becca has.

We can translate the given information into a system of equations:

1.  *z = y + 12*  (Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick)
2.  *y = 3x*  (Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has)
3.  *x + y + z = 341* (The total number of cards is 341)

Now we can use substitution to solve for *z* (the number of cards Becca has):

* Substitute equation 2 into equation 1: *z = (3x) + 12*
* Substitute equations 2 and the modified equation 1 into equation 3: *x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341*
* Simplify and solve for *x*: *7x + 12 = 341*  =>  *7x = 329*  =>  *x = 47*
* Substitute the value of *x* back into equation 2 to find *y*: *y = 3 * 47 = 141*
* Substitute the value of *y* into equation 1 to find *z*: *z = 141 + 12 = 153*



**Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.**

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the speed of one kangaroo.
* Let 't' represent the time it takes one turtle to cross the highway.

**2. Set Up Equations:**

* We know that distance = rate * time.  Since the distance across the highway is the same for all animals, we can set up the following:
    *  3 kangaroos * x speed * 18 hours = distance 
    *  1 turtle * (x/2) speed * t hours = distance

**3. Solve for 't':**

*  From the first equation, we can see that the distance is 54x.
*  Substitute this distance into the second equation: 1 * (x/2) * t = 54x
*  Simplify: (x/2) * t = 54x
*  Solve for 't': t = 54x * 2 / x = 108 hours

**4. Calculate Time for Four Turtles:**

* Since one turtle takes 108 hours, four turtles would take 108 hours/turtle * 4 turtles = 432 hours.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using a system of equations.

Let:

*  *j* represent the number of socks Jack has
*  *d* represent the number of dishes Jack has
*  *p* represent the number of socks Peter has

We're given the following information:

*  *p* = 2*j* (Peter has twice as many socks as Jack)
*  *d* = 2*j* (Jack has twice as many dishes as socks)
*  *p* = *d*/2 (Peter has half as many dishes as Jack)
*  *d* = 60 (Jack collected 60 dishes)

Now we can use substitution to solve for the unknowns:

1. **Substitute** *d* = 60 into the equation *p* = *d*/2:
   *p* = 60 / 2 = 30

2. **Substitute** *j* = 30 (since *d* = 2*j*) into the equation *p* = 2*j*:
   *p* = 2 * 30 = 60

3. **Calculate the total socks:** *j* + *p* = 30 + 60 = 90

"To solve this problem, we'll set up a system of equations.  Let's use the following variables:

*  *j* = the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn
*  *k* = the amount of money Tasha made from mowing Kamala's lawn
*  *a* = the amount of money Tasha made from mowing Alba's lawn

We know the following:

*  *k* = 3*j* (Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's)
*  *a* = 5*j* (Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's)
*  *k* + *a* + 6*j* = 80 (Total earnings from mowing lawns)

We also know that Tasha earned $6 per lawn mowing job.  Therefore:

*  *k* = 3*j* * $6 = $18*j*
*  *a* = 5*j* * $6 = $30*j*

Now we can substitute these expressions for *k* and *a* into the third equation:

*  $18*j* + $30*j* + 6*j* = 80

Combining like terms:

*  $54*j* = 80

Solving for *j*:

*  *j* = 80 / 54 = 1.48 (approximately)

Now that we know *j*, we can find the total earnings from mowing lawns:

*  *k* + *a* + 6*j* = 80
*  ($18 * 1.48) + ($30 * 1.48) + (6 * 1.48) = 80
*  $26.64 + $44.40 + $8.88 = 80
*  $80 = 80

"Let's represent the ages with variables:

*  Let Peter's age be represented by  'P'
*  Let Paul's age be represented by 'Pa'
*  Let John's age be represented by 'J'

We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

1.  P + Pa + J = 100  
2.  Pa = J + 10
3.  P = Pa + J

Now, we can use substitution to solve for P:

Substitute equation 2 into equation 3:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Substitute equations 2 and the modified equation 3 into equation 1:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Simplify and solve for J:

4J + 20 = 100
4J = 80
J = 20

Substitute the value of J (20) back into the equation P = 2J + 10:

P = (2 * 20) + 10
P = 40 + 10
P = 50



Therefore, Peter is 50 years old.

"Let's break down Fern's widget-making dilemma.  

First, we need to figure out the daily earnings for each machine. The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and sells them for $6 each, so in a 24-hour day, it makes 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * $6/widget = $8640.

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour, resulting in 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * $6/widget = $6480 per day.

Now, let's calculate their monthly earnings, assuming a 30-day month. The Widgeteer 3000 would earn $8640/day * 30 days/month = $259,200 per month.  The WidgetMaster 9000 would earn $6480/day * 30 days/month = $194,400 per month.

Finally, the difference in their monthly earnings is $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

First, we need to figure out how much hay each sheep needs.  We know a goat needs 5 pounds, and a sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice that amount.  Twice the amount a goat needs is 5 pounds * 2 = 10 pounds.  Subtracting 3 pounds, we find that each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds of hay.

Now we can calculate the total hay needed for the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.

Similarly, the total hay needed for the sheep is 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

Finally, to find the total amount of hay Nate needs, we add the hay for the goats and the sheep: 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

"Let's represent the number of Pokemon caught by each person with variables:

*  Let  'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
*  Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
*  Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

1.  A + S + W = 339  (The total number of Pokemon caught)
2.  A = S + 5         (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
3.  S = 4W - 13       (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

To solve for 'S', we can use substitution.  Substitute equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

(S + 5) + S + (4W - 13) = 339

Simplify the equation:

2S + 4W - 8 = 339

2S + 4W = 347

Now, substitute 'S = 4W - 13' from equation 3 into the simplified equation:

2(4W - 13) + 4W = 347

8W - 26 + 4W = 347

12W - 26 = 347

12W = 373

W = 31.0833

Now that we know W, we can find S:

S = 4W - 13

S = 4(31.0833) - 13

S = 124.3332 - 13

S = 111.3332



Since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, we'll round to the nearest whole number. 

**Stan caught approximately 111 Pokemon.**

* Let 'R' represent the number of cherries Richard has.

We know the following:

* R + J + 20 = 60  (The total number of cherries)
* R = J + 10       (Robert has 10 more cherries than Jerry)
* R = 30            (Robert has 30 cherries)

Since we know R = 30, we can substitute that into the second equation:

30 = J + 10

Solving for J:

J = 20

Now we can find the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries:

R - J = 30 - 20 = 10



**Answer:** Robert has 10 more cherries than Jerry.

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

* Let 'd' represent the dad's current age.
* Let 'b' represent the brother's current age.

Here's what we know:

* In 5 years, Emil will be 24:  Emil's current age + 5 = 24  
   This simplifies to: Emil's current age = 19

* In 5 years, the dad will be twice Emil's age: d + 5 = 2 * 24
* In 5 years, the brother will be half Emil's age: b + 5 = 24 / 2

Now we have a system of equations:

* d + 5 = 48
* b + 5 = 12

Solving for 'd' in the first equation:
* d = 48 - 5
* d = 43

Solving for 'b' in the second equation:

"Let's break down Pat's flower bed project:

First, we need to figure out how much space Pat has for her new plants.  Her flower bed is 111 feet long, which is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.  She needs 1.5 feet of space between each plant, or 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches.  This means she has 1332 - 18 = 1314 inches of space for her plants.

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, she can fit 1314 / 12 = 109.5 plants.  Since Pat can't buy half a plant, she'll need to purchase 110 plants.

She already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 110 - 17 = 93 more.

*  We know his father was 30 years old when he saw the comet. Bill saw it again when he was three times his father's age, meaning he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

*  Since Halley's Comet returns every 75 years, the time between Bill's two sightings is 75 years.

*  This means Bill's age when he saw it the second time (90) minus his age when he saw it the first time (x) equals 75: 90 - x = 75

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

Let:

*  *x* represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.
*  *y* represent the number of small stuffed animals sold.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1 (Sales Relationship):**  y = 2x  (Teresa sold twice as many small as large)
* **Equation 2 (Earnings):** 4y + 12x = 120 (Price of small * quantity of small + price of large * quantity of large = total earnings)

Now we can solve for *y* (the number of small stuffed animals sold).

1. **Substitute** the value of *y* from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
   4(2x) + 12x = 120

2. **Simplify and solve for *x*:**
   8x + 12x = 120
   20x = 120
   x = 6

3. **Substitute the value of *x* back into Equation 1 to find *y*:**
   y = 2 * 6
   y = 12

"Let's break down this dwarven mining problem:

* **Iron Pickaxe Output:** A dwarf mines twice as much with an iron pickaxe compared to bare hands, so that's 12 pounds * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

"Depreciation with a constant rate is my specialty!  Let's break this down:

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations:

* Let  'j' represent the number of slices Jake ate.
* Let 'b' represent the number of slices Becky ate.

We know the following:

*  b = j + 3  (Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake)
*  s = 2j      (Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake)
*  b + j + s = 4 * 8  (They ate a total of 32 slices from 4 pizzas)

Now we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation:

(j + 3) + j + 2j = 32

Combining like terms:

4j + 3 = 32

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

4j = 29

Dividing both sides by 4:

j = 7.25

Now that we know Jake ate 7.25 slices, we can find Becky and Silvia's slices:

* b = j + 3 = 7.25 + 3 = 10.25

"Let's break down this floral transaction step-by-step:

First, we need to figure out the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses costs $15,  15 roses is equal to 1.25 dozens (15 / 12 = 1.25).  Multiplying that by the price per dozen, we get a total cost of $18.75 (1.25 * $15 = $18.75).

Next, calculate how much change Jenny receives. She paid with five $5 bills, totaling $25 ($5 * 5 = $25).  Subtracting the cost of the roses from the amount paid gives us her change: $25 - $18.75 = $6.25.

Finally, determine the number of quarters in her change.  Each quarter is worth $0.25, so dividing the total change by the value of a quarter yields 25 quarters ($6.25 / $0.25 = 25).

"Ah, a classic case of reverse deduction!  Let's break it down step-by-step.

We know the Allosaurus feasted on the final 270 kilograms, which represents the remaining portion after the velociraptors took their share.  Since the raptors gobbled up half of what was left after the T-Rex, those 270 kg represent half of the amount the T-Rex left behind.

This means the T-Rex left 270 kg * 2 = 540 kg of meat.

And since the T-Rex devoured half the original triceratops, those 540 kg represent half the original weight.  Therefore, the original triceratops weighed 540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using a system of equations:

* Let  'A' represent the number of eggs Arnold painted.
* Let 'M' represent the number of eggs Madeline painted.
* Let 'C' represent the number of eggs Camden painted.
* Let 'S' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

* A + M =  (Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same amount)
* C + S = 30  (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
* C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)
* A + M + C + S = 56 (The total number of eggs painted is 56)

Now we can solve for our variables.  Substitute the third equation (C = S + 12) into the second equation:

* (S + 12) + S = 30
* 2S + 12 = 30
* 2S = 18
* S = 9

Now that we know Sarah painted 9 eggs, we can find Camden's eggs:

* C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21

We also know that A + M = 56 - 30 - 21 = 5.  Since A = M, we can say:

* 2A = 5
* A = 2.5

Finally, to find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs:

* 21 - 2.5 = 18.5

Now, each box weighs 8 ounces, and he has 25 boxes, meaning the boxes themselves weigh 8 * 25 = 200 ounces.

The crayons weigh 200 ounces as well, since each crayon is 1 ounce.

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and boxes is 200 + 200 = 400 ounces.

Finally, we convert ounces to pounds: 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.

"Let's break this problem down systematically:

* **Define variables:**
    * Let  'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
    * Let 'b' represent the length of the blue rope.
    * Let 'r' represent the length of the red rope.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  b = y - 7  (The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope)
    *  r = 4b     (The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope)
    *  y + b + r = 37 (The combined length of all three ropes is 37 cm)

* **Substitute to solve for 'r':** 
    * Since we want to find the length of the red rope ('r'), let's substitute the first two equations into the third equation:
       y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

* **Simplify and solve for 'y':**
    * y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
    * 6y - 35 = 37
    * 6y = 72
    * y = 12

* **Find 'b' and 'r':**
    * b = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5
    * r = 4b = 4 * 5 = 20



**Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.**

"Let's break down this problem step by step.

* **Rissa's Starting Amount:**  Rissa received three times the amount Ronnie did, so she began with 3 * $5 = $15.

* **Equal Giving:**  Let 'x' represent the amount of money each sibling gave to their sister.

* **Rissa's Remaining Money:** After giving away 'x', Rissa has $15 - x left. We know this is equal to 4/5 of her original amount:  $15 - x = (4/5) * $15

* **Solving for x:**
    * $15 - x = $12
    * -x = -3
    * x = $3

* **Ronnie's Remaining Money:** Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, leaving him with $5 - $3 = $2.



**Therefore, Ronnie has $2 left.**

"Let's break this mural problem down step by step:

* **Yellow Dominance:**  We know half the mural is yellow, meaning 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint were used.

* **The Rest:** This leaves 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints for the red, white, and purple paint.

* **Equal Shares:** Since red, white, and purple are used in equal amounts, each color gets 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.



**Therefore, 2 pints of red paint were used in the mural.** 
"
"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Bedroom Area:** Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

2. **Total Bedroom Area:**  Since there are four bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 240 * 4 = 960 square feet.

3. **Living Room Area:** The living room is five times the size of a bedroom, making its area 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

4. **Total House Area:**  Adding the areas of the bedrooms, living room, and the remaining space, we get 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.



Therefore, the total area of the house is **3160 square feet**.

"This problem describes a geometric sequence where the first term is 3 and the common ratio is 2 (each day, the number of clouds doubles).  

To find the sum of a finite geometric series, we use the formula:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where:

* S is the sum of the series
* a is the first term
* r is the common ratio
* n is the number of terms

In this case:

* a = 3
* r = 2
* n = 5

Plugging these values into the formula:

S = 3 (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 (-31) / (-1)
S = 93


**Therefore, Alice will have counted 93 clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days.**

"Let's break down Thomas's financial journey step by step:

* **Starting Point:** Thomas begins with $1000, which translates to 1000 / 20 = 50 twenty-dollar bills.

* **Loss:**  He unfortunately loses 10 bills along the way, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

* **Payment:** Thomas uses half of his remaining bills to pay a bill, spending 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

* **Multiplication:**  He's left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.  Tripling his money means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

* **Conversion:** Finally, he converts all his bills to five-dollar denominations, resulting in 60 bills.



Therefore, Thomas has **60** five-dollar bills.

"Let's break down this soccer match goal frenzy step-by-step:

* **First Half:** Team A scores 4 goals, and Team B scores 2 fewer than Team A, so they score 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

* **Second Half:** Team B really steps up their game, scoring 4 times the number of goals they scored in the first half, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals.  Team A, in the second half, scores 1/4 the number of goals Team B scored, meaning they scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

* **Total Goals:**  To find the total goals for each team, we add their first and second-half scores:
    * Team A: 4 + 2 = 6 goals
    * Team B: 2 + 8 = 10 goals

* **Grand Total:**  Finally, we add the goals from both teams to find the total goals in the match: 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Define Variables:**

* Let Wendy's current age be represented by 'w'.
* Let Colin's current age be represented by 'c'.

**Formulate Equations:**

We're given two pieces of information, which we can translate into equations:

*  ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now"":  w = 5(c + 7)
*  ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now"": c + 25 = (1/3)w

**Solve the System of Equations:**

We now have two equations and two unknowns, allowing us to solve for 'c' (Colin's current age).  

1. **Substitution Method:**  Since the first equation already expresses 'w' in terms of 'c', let's substitute that expression into the second equation:

   c + 25 = (1/3) * [5(c + 7)]

2. **Simplify and Solve for 'c':**

   c + 25 = (5/3)c + (35/3)
   (3/3)c + 75/3 = (5/3)c + (35/3)
   75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
   40/3 = (2/3)c
   c = (40/3) * (3/2)
   c = 20

"Let's break down this bandage inventory problem step-by-step:

* **Day 1:** The nurses used 38 bandages and received a new pack of 50, leaving them with 38 + 50 = 88 bandages.

* **Day 2:** They used 10 fewer bandages than Day 1, meaning they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.  They now have 88 - 28 = 60 bandages.

* **Day 3:** They ordered two new packs of 50 bandages each, bringing their total to 60 + (2 * 50) = 160 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.  This leaves them with 160 - 25 = 135 bandages.

* **Starting Inventory:** Since they had 135 bandages at the end of Day 3, and they started with some unknown amount, we can represent that as ""x"".  We know that x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 = 135.

* **Solving for x:** Combining like terms, we get x + 84 = 135. Subtracting 84 from both sides, we find x = 51.

Now, we can determine the maximum number of jelly beans the jar could hold: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

Finally,  we calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans based on Tim's 30% estimate: 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans. 


The difference between Tim's estimate and the actual number of red jelly beans is 864 - 900 = -36.

"Let's represent the length of the shorter piece with the variable 'x'.  Since the longer piece is four times the length of the shorter piece, we can express its length as '4x'.  

The total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 40

To isolate 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the shorter piece is 8 feet long, we can find the length of the longer piece:

4x = 4 * 8 = 32 feet 



**Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.**

"Let's represent the number of strawberry ice cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry ice cubes as 'b'.  We know:

*  b = 5s - 4  (The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4)
*  s + b = 116 (The total number of ice cubes is 116)

Now we can use substitution to solve for 's' and 'b'. Substitute the first equation into the second equation:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

* The two-legged animals contribute 10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs.
* The four-legged animals contribute 15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs.

Adding those together, we have a grand total of 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs on the farm.

And since each pair of legs has two legs, we simply divide the total legs by two: 80 legs / 2 legs/pair = 40 pairs of legs.
