"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Josh spent $80,000 on the house and another $50,000 on repairs, for a total investment of $130,000.  The repairs increased the house value by 150% of the original price, which is $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.  

So the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.  

His profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Wendi feeds her 20 chickens 3 cups of food each day, split into three meals. She already gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon.  

To find out how much she needs to give them in the last meal, we can subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed:

* Total daily feed: 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups
* Feed needed in the last meal: 60 cups - 15 cups - 25 cups = 20 cups

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Kylar buys glasses in pairs, with every other one being discounted.  That means he pays $5 for the first glass, then $3 for the second.  

Since he wants 16 glasses, he'll buy 8 pairs. Each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8.

So, the total cost is 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, which has 20. So Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, meaning Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Adding them all up, Seattle's 20 + Charleston's 80 + Toulouse's 160 gives us a total of 260 sheep.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Carla downloads 2 GB every minute, so a 200 GB file would normally take 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

But, she gets interrupted!  She's downloaded 40% of the file, which is 200 GB * 0.40 = 80 GB.  

That means she has to start over from scratch, downloading another 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB.

So, the total download time is 100 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 60 minutes (remaining download) = 180 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down. 

First, John drives 3 hours at 60 mph, so he covers 180 miles.  Then he heads back, but spends 2 hours stuck in traffic, so he doesn't get anywhere.  He drives for half an hour at 30 mph, which is 15 miles.  Finally, he speeds up to 80 mph for the rest of the 4-hour trip.  That last part takes 1.5 hours (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours).  At 80 mph, he covers 120 miles in that time.

Adding up all the distances, he travels 180 miles out + 15 miles + 120 miles back = 315 miles total.  

But remember, he's trying to get *home*, so we need to subtract the distance he covered on the way back. That means he's 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles from home.

"Hey there! Let's break down Eliza's earnings.

She makes $10 per hour for the first 40 hours, so that's 40 * $10 = $400.

Then she works 5 extra hours of overtime at 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.  

Her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

Adding that to her regular pay, her total earnings are $400 + $60 = $460.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to see how much money Carlos makes each year from the lemon tree. He sells 7 lemons at $1.50 each, so that's 7 * $1.50 = $10.50.  

Then, we subtract the $3 it costs to take care of the tree, leaving him with $10.50 - $3.00 = $7.50 profit each year.

To figure out how long it takes to make back the $90 he spent planting the tree, we divide the planting cost by his yearly profit: $90.00 / $7.50 = 12 years.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

Melanie started with some vacuum cleaners, let's say 'x'.  

* She sold a third at the green house, so that's x/3.
* Then she sold 2 more at the red house.
*  After those sales, she had some left over, and sold half of *that* at the orange house. 

We know she has 5 left in the end.  Let's work backwards:

* Before the orange house, she must have had 5 + (half of what she sold there) = 5 + (x/3 - 1) = x/3 + 4
* Before the red house, she had x/3 + 4 + 2 = x/3 + 6
*  Before the green house, she had x/3 + 6 + x/3 = (2x/3) + 6
*  And that's where we started, with x vacuum cleaners!

So, (2x/3) + 6 = x

Let's solve for x:

* Subtract (2x/3) from both sides: 6 = x/3
* Multiply both sides by 3: x = 18



Melanie started with **18** vacuum cleaners.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

First, we find out how many students chose contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students is 4 students.  

That leaves 16 students who didn't pick contemporary.  Of those, 25% chose jazz, which is 4 students.

So, 12 students must have chosen hip-hop!  

To find the percentage, we divide the hip-hop dancers (12) by the total number of students (20) and multiply by 100%: (12/20) * 100% = 60%. 


**60%**

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.  

The merchant has two options:

* **Option 1:** Jewelry worth $5,000 that's predicted to increase by 2.5%
* **Option 2:** Electronic gadgets worth $8,000 that are predicted to increase by 1.2%

To figure out the most profitable choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

**Option 1 (Jewelry):**

* Increase in value: $5000 * 0.025 = $125
* Total value at the end of the month: $5000 + $125 = $5125
* Profit: $5125 - $5000 = $125

**Option 2 (Electronic Gadgets):**

* Increase in value: $8000 * 0.012 = $96
* Total value at the end of the month: $8000 + $96 = $8096
* Profit: $8096 - $8000 = $96


So, the merchant would make the most profit by choosing the jewelry.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If Kyle got a 25% discount on a book that cost $19.50, we can think of that $19.50 as 75% of the original price (because 100% - 25% = 75%).

To find the original price, we can set up a little equation:

0.75 * original price = $19.50

Divide both sides by 0.75 to isolate the original price:

original price = $19.50 / 0.75 

original price = $26.00

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Gretchen has 110 coins total, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  

To find out how many gold coins she has, we can think of it like this:

*  If we let 's' represent the number of silver coins, then the number of gold coins is 's + 30'.
*  Since all the coins together make 110, we can write the equation: s + (s + 30) = 110

Now, let's solve for 's':

*  2s + 30 = 110
*  2s = 80
*  s = 40  (So Gretchen has 40 silver coins)

Finally, to find the number of gold coins:

*  g = s + 30
*  g = 40 + 30
*  g = 70

Gretchen has 70 gold coins!

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Aleena pays $140 per month for the first six months, so that's $140 * 6 = $840.

Then, the price drops by 10%, which is $140 * 0.10 = $14 less per month.  

That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 for each of the next six months, totaling $126 * 6 = $756.

Adding both halves together, she pays $840 + $756 = $1596 for the whole year.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then reads for half that time, which is 1 hour. So each time he does this, he spends a total of 3 hours.

He does this three times a week, meaning he spends 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours per week on TV and reading.

Over four weeks, that adds up to 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

We've got four schools, and each school has two teams (girls and boys). That means there are 4 * 2 = 8 teams in total.

Each team has 5 players, so that's 8 teams * 5 players/team = 40 players.

And each school has one coach for each team, so there are 4 schools * 2 coaches/school = 8 coaches.

Adding it all up, we have 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

"Hola! Let's crack this treasure code!

There were 175 diamonds, 35 fewer rubies than that, and twice as many emeralds as rubies.  

First, we find the rubies: 175 diamonds - 35 = 140 rubies.

Then, the emeralds: 140 rubies * 2 = 280 emeralds.

Finally, add them all up: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 gems!

Artie rounds his prices to the nearest dollar, so marigolds are now $3, petunias are $2, and begonias are $2 a pop.

* Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
* Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18

Each level is half the size of the one below it, and the top level is 16 square feet.  So, we need to work our way up:

* Bottom level: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
* Second level: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
* Third level: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Adding all the levels together: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

* He had 115 cookies before dropping any (110 + 5).
* Before the extra 15, he had 100 cookies (115 - 15).
* Since he baked twice as many this year as last year, let's say he baked 'x' cookies last year. This means he baked 2x cookies this year.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down. Katy's ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.

"Hey there! Let's break down this hospital profit problem.

First, we need to figure out how many hours the doctors spend with patients.  They see 500 people a day at 24 minutes each, which is a total of 12,000 minutes.  That's 200 hours!

The doctors make $150 an hour, so they earn $30,000 for their work.  The hospital charges patients $200 an hour, so they bring in $40,000 for those 200 hours.

To find the profit, we just subtract the doctors' earnings from the patient charges: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.


The hospital makes a profit of $10,000.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

We know there are 700 bees total.  There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens.  

Let's think about it step-by-step:

* If we let 'q' represent the number of queens, there are 2q baby bees.
* Since there are twice as many worker bees as babies, there are 2 * (2q) = 4q worker bees.
*  Now we can add up all the bees: q + 2q + 4q = 700
*  That simplifies to 7q = 700
*  Dividing both sides by 7, we find q = 100 queens.
*  With 100 queens, there are 2 * 100 = 200 baby bees.
*  And finally, there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.



So the answer is 400.

"Alright, let's break this down. Dave started with a big ol' pack of fries, ate 14, and then a sneaky seagull swiped the whole thing! That seagull gobbled up half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.  

After the seagull, there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left. Then, three pigeons came along and each ate 3 fries, so they took a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.  That leaves us with 7 - 9 = -2 fries.  Wait a minute... that doesn't make sense!  The pigeons must have eaten more than were left!

So, let's think about it this way.  The ants took the last fry, leaving 5. Before that, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.  Then the pigeons came along and ate 9, so there must have been 6 + 9 = 15 fries before they showed up.  And before the seagull swiped the pack, there were 15 + 7 = 22 fries.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, the price goes up 20% every two months. That means every two months, the price is 120% of what it was before (100% + 20% = 120%).

* Month 4: $24 * 1.20 = $28.80
* Month 6: $28.80 * 1.20 = $34.56
* ... and so on

We keep multiplying by 1.20 for each two-month period.

Then, the two rides cost $33 each, so they spent 2 * $33 = $66 on rides.

Adding it all up, the total cost was $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

*  Tom adds 8 trees to his grove each year (10 planted - 2 chopped).
*  Over 10 years, that's 80 more trees (8 trees/year * 10 years).
*  So he has 130 trees after 10 years (50 starting + 80 more).
*  Unfortunately, 30% of those trees die, which is 39 trees (130 * 0.30).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Elaine started with 20 cards and tripled that amount in the first month, so she had 20 * 3 = 60 cards.  

The next month, she got 20 fewer than the first month, meaning she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

Then, in the third month, she collected twice the amount from the first two months combined (60 + 40 = 100), so she got 100 * 2 = 200 cards.

Adding up all her cards, she has 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards now.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Mark edits 1000 sentences total, split evenly between two publishers. Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A does, we know Publisher B pays $0.10 per sentence while Publisher A pays $0.05 per sentence.

* Publisher A's earnings: 500 sentences * $0.05/sentence = $25.00
* Publisher B's earnings: 500 sentences * $0.10/sentence = $50.00

Adding those together, Mark makes $25.00 + $50.00 = $75.00 per week.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, Jerry has red chickens that lay 3 eggs each and white chickens that lay 5 eggs each.  He gets 42 eggs a day in total.  We also know he has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's think: if he had all red chickens, he'd get 3 times the number of red chickens in eggs.  To get to 42 eggs, he'd need a lot of red chickens!  But we know he has more white chickens, which lay more eggs each.

Let's try a few numbers. If he had 4 red chickens, that's 12 eggs (4 x 3).  That leaves 30 eggs to come from the white chickens.  If he has 6 white chickens, that's 30 eggs (6 x 5).  

That works!  He has 4 red chickens.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

Gary's walk is like going around the outside of a rectangle. To find out how long it takes, we need to know how far that walk is.

* The rectangle is 1.5 miles wide and 6 miles long.
*  The total distance around the rectangle (the perimeter) is found by adding up all the sides: 1.5 + 6 + 1.5 + 6 = 15 miles.

* Gary walks at 3 miles per hour.

*  To find out how long it takes to walk 15 miles at 3 miles per hour, we divide the distance by the speed: 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours.


So, Gary spends **5** hours walking.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

So, we know both pools leak at 4 gallons a minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had double the water of the small pool.  Now, the big pool has four times the water of the small pool.  

Let's say the small pool had *x* gallons four minutes ago. That means the big pool had 2*x* gallons.

After four minutes, both pools lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

Now, the small pool has *x* - 16 gallons, and the big pool has 2*x* - 16 gallons.

We know the big pool now has four times the water of the small pool, so:

2*x* - 16 = 4(*x* - 16)

Let's solve for *x*:

2*x* - 16 = 4*x* - 64
48 = 2*x*
*x* = 24

That means the small pool had 24 gallons four minutes ago.  

Now, after the leaks, the small pool has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

* Yuri scored 10 more than that, so he scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Now let's find Brianna's score:

* Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Okay, now we know Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored a total of 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

So, we've got 4 snails in one tank and 32 in the other. That means there are 32 - 4 = 28 more snails in the bigger tank.  

The problem says this difference in snails is twice the number of fish in *both* tanks.  Since the tanks have the same number of fish, let's say there are 'f' fish in each tank.  

That means 28 snails = 2 * f fish.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, so she went down 30 times * 0.30 = 9 fewer times. That means Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down 4 times as many times as Anne, so he went down 21 * 4 = 84 times.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, there are 20 stalls with 20 cows each, meaning there are 200 cows in total. Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them evenly among all the stalls. That means each stall gets 2 more cows.

Now, if each stall has 22 cows (20 original + 2 new), then 8 stalls would have 176 cows (8 stalls * 22 cows/stall).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to know how many 10-foot sections are in the whole tree: 200 feet / 10 feet/section = 20 sections.

Now, each section weighs 400 pounds, so the whole tree weighed 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

But wait, those pesky termites ate 30% of the wood! That's 8000 pounds * 0.30 = 2400 pounds.

So, the redwood weighs 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds now.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

So, Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.  Andrea has 52 apples, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples. That means Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.  Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Andrea has 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits. Jamal has 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits.

Together they have 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Chris has 6 trees, and Ferdinand has half that amount, so Ferdinand has 3 trees.

Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has is 3 * 2 = 6 trees.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we need to calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 is $17,500.  

Then, the transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which is $42,000.

Adding those fees to the original price, the total cost of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Finally,  $409,500 minus Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000 means the house is $9,500 more than she can afford.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Mr. Tan made $400,000 from selling his house.  He had to pay 3% for transfer fees, which is $12,000.  Then there was a 5% brokerage fee, so he paid another $20,000.  On top of that, he still had a remaining loan of $250,000.

To find his net proceeds, we need to subtract all his expenses: $400,000 - $12,000 - $20,000 - $250,000 = $118,000

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

First, the oil takes 20 minutes to hit 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to get to 400 degrees, which is an extra 8 minutes (20 * 0.40 = 8).  

So, heating the oil takes a total of 28 minutes (20 + 8).  

Cooking the chicken takes 5 minutes less than that, meaning it takes 23 minutes to cook (28 - 5).

Finally, add the heating and cooking times together: 28 minutes + 23 minutes = 51 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how many spots are on one mamba. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 spots / 2 = 35 spots.

Next, let's calculate the total spots on all the cobras: 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots.

Now, let's do the same for the mambas: 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots.

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we add those together: 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

First, we need to figure out how many junior programmers there are.  Since they make up 2/5 of the 100 employees, there are (2/5) * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

That means there are 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Junior programmers earn $2000 a month, so the total pay for all junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers make $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.  Their total pay is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

Finally, the total amount paid to all programmers is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

**Job A:**

* Nick makes $15 an hour and works 2000 hours, so his gross pay is $15 * 2000 = $30,000.
*  With a 20% tax rate, he pays $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000 in taxes.
*  His net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

**Job B:**

* Job B pays a flat $42,000 a year.
*  After paying $6,000 in property tax, his net income is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
*  He then pays 10% tax on that remaining amount, which is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600.
*  His final net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

"Hey there!  Let's break this problem down.

If two of the groups have the same number of students, let's call that number 'x'.  The smallest group has 10 fewer students than the others, so it has 'x - 10' students.

We know the total number of students is 200, so:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now we can find the size of the smallest group:

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60


So, there are **60** students in the smallest group.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and twice as many chickens as cows.  

First, let's say 'c' is the number of cows. That means he has 2c chickens.  

Since all the animals are chickens or cows, we know: c + 2c = 60

Combining those, we get 3c = 60.  

Dividing both sides by 3, we find out there are 20 cows (c = 20).

That means he has 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs.

So, the cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.

And the chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

Adding those together, all the animals have 80 + 80 = 160 legs!

Boating and swimming took up 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours.

We know 6 hours of shows is 30% of his total vacation time.  To find the total time, we can set up a proportion: 6 hours / 0.30 = Total Time.  That means his vacation was 6 hours / 0.30 = 20 hours long.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

* The train travels 75 miles the first leg, 100 miles the second, and 50 miles less than that combined distance for the third leg. So, the third leg is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

*  The total distance for one round trip is 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

*  Since the train makes 3 trips a day, it travels 300 miles/trip * 3 trips = 900 miles each day.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Cho hiked for 8 hours at 14 kilometers per hour, so they covered 8 * 14 = 112 kilometers. Chloe hiked for 5 hours at 9 kilometers per hour, covering 5 * 9 = 45 kilometers.  

To find the difference, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance: 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers.

"Hey there! Let's break down Millie's lemonade stand situation.

First, she makes 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups of lemonade.

Then, she earns $1/cup * 36 cups = $36.

Since she spent $18 on supplies, her profit per hour is $36 - $18 = $18.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If Mr. Ruther had 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, we can think of it like this:

* That 12.8 hectares represents 2/5 of his original land (because he sold 3/5).

* To find the whole amount, we need to figure out what 1/5 of his land is worth.

* Divide the remaining land by 2: 12.8 hectares / 2 = 6.4 hectares

* Now, since 6.4 hectares is 1/5 of his original land, multiply that by 5 to find the total: 6.4 hectares * 5 = 32 hectares.



So, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.

"Alright, let's figure this out!

*  There are 52 choir members, and half are girls, so there are 26 girls.
*  Half the girls couldn't make it, which is 26 / 2 = 13 girls.
*  That means 26 - 13 = 13 girls performed.
*  Plus the 3 teachers, that makes a total of 13 + 3 = 16 singers.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

Betty and Sam's popsicle ratio is 5:6, meaning for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  Since they have a total of 165 popsicles, we can think of it like this: their ratio represents 11 parts (5 + 6).

To find out how many popsicles are in one part, we divide the total popsicles by the number of parts: 165 popsicles / 11 parts = 15 popsicles per part.

Now we can figure out how many popsicles each person has:

* Betty: 5 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 75 popsicles
* Sam: 6 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 90 popsicles

Finally, to see how many more popsicles Sam has, we subtract Betty's amount from Sam's: 90 popsicles - 75 popsicles = 15 popsicles.


Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Tim's Hulu and Disney Plus bundle costs $10 + $10 = $20.  But wait, he gets a 20% discount for bundling, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4. So his bundle actually costs $20 - $4 = $16.

Adding Netflix at $10 a month, his total streaming cost is $16 + $10 = $26.

That means he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by ditching cable!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Mark needs four times the normal amount of ingredients, so that's 3 cups of flour times 4, which is 12 cups of flour.  Since flour comes in 2-cup bags, he'll need 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour.

For milk, he needs 1 cup times 4, which is 4 cups. Milk comes in 2-cup bottles, so he'll need 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk he needs, we subtract: 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

First, Mel's AC uses 900 watts for 8 hours a day, so that's 900 * 8 = 7200 watt-hours per day.

If he cuts back to 3 hours, it'll use 900 * 3 = 2700 watt-hours per day.

That means he'll save 7200 - 2700 = 4500 watt-hours each day.

Over 30 days, that's a total of 4500 * 30 = 135,000 watt-hours.

To make it easier, let's convert that to kilowatt-hours: 135,000 watt-hours / 1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours.


So the answer is **135**.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Start with the cannolis:** Allan has 40 cannolis to begin with.
* **More cannolis:** He buys 60 more, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.
* **The corns:**  He has twice as many corns as cannolis at the start, meaning he has 40 cannolis * 2 = 80 corns.
* **Fewer corns:** He then buys 40 fewer corns than cannolis, so he has 100 cannolis - 40 = 60 corns.
* **Total count:** Finally, add up the corns and cannolis: 60 corns + 100 cannolis = 160.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Toby's book has 45 pages with 200 words each, so that's 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

He reads 300 words per minute, so it'll take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to finish.

Adding the 10 minutes to get to the airport, he'll be done in 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.

Since he has to be there in 60 minutes, he'll be 60 - 40 = 20 minutes early.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, we need to figure out how many employees were working in June. Since 1/4 of the employees left, that's 40 employees * (1/4) = 10 employees who left.  

So, there were 40 employees - 10 employees = 30 employees left in June.

Each employee makes $15 an hour for a 40-hour week, which means they earn $15 * 40 = $600 per week.

In May, the company paid each employee $600/week * 4 weeks = $2400.  

That means the total pay for May was $2400 * 40 employees = $96,000.

In June, the total pay was $2400 * 30 employees = $72,000.

Adding those together, the company paid out a total of $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000 over the two months.

He got a sweet 20% discount, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240 off.  

So, after the discount, his firework packages cost $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, he added a $150 finale firework, bringing his total spending to $960 + $150 = $1110.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Joanne's Shortest Trees:** Joanne picked half as many apples from the shortest trees as the tallest trees, so she got 30 / 2 = 15 apples.

* **Sister's Tallest Trees:** Joanne's sister picked twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, meaning she picked 30 * 2 = 60 apples.

* **Sister's Shortest Trees:** The sister picked three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she picked 15 * 3 = 45 apples.

* **Sister's Total:**  The sister gathered a total of 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

* **Joanne's Total (Excluding Average):** Joanne picked 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

* **Joanne's Average Apples:** Since the sisters gathered 500 apples total, Joanne must have picked 500 - 105 = 395 apples.  Subtracting her apples from the tallest and shortest trees, she picked 395 - 45 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

We know there are 180 heads total and 304 bumps.  Camels have two humps, and dromedaries have one.  

Let's think: if all the animals were camels, we'd have 180 heads * 2 humps/camel = 360 humps. That's too many! So, there must be some dromedaries.

Let's say there are 'd' dromedaries. That means there are 180 - 'd' camels.

Now, the total humps are: 2 * (180 - 'd') + 'd' = 304

Simplifying that: 360 - 2'd' + 'd' = 304

Combining like terms: 360 - 'd' = 304

Subtracting 360 from both sides: - 'd' = -56

Finally, multiplying both sides by -1: 'd' = 56


There are **56** dromedaries in the herd.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Elizabeth has 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, which is a total of 3 packs. That's 3 packs * 20 beads per pack = 60 beads.

Margareth has 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads, for a total of 7 packs.  She has 7 packs * 20 beads per pack = 140 beads.

Margareth has 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"Alright, let's break this down.  Marcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees.  He bakes for 3 hours, and his oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees each hour, so that's 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees warmer.  

That means the temperature is now 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.

Then he opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees every 10 minutes.  So, the window is open for 30 minutes / 10 minutes/cooling = 3 times cooling.  

That's a total cooling of 3 times * 2 degrees/cooling = 6 degrees.

Finally, we subtract the cooling from the temperature after baking: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

"Alright, let's break this triathlon problem down!

First, we need to figure out how long James took for each leg of the race.  We know he was 10% faster than Jon in the swim, so he finished it in 40 minutes * 0.90 = 36 minutes.

For the bike, James took 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

Now, we know Jon finished in 170 minutes and James finished 10 minutes later.  That means James' total time was 180 minutes.

Finally, to find James' run time, we subtract his swim and bike times: 180 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 59 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's break this movie problem down.

* Movie C is 1.25 hours long, which is 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.
* Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.
* Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, meaning Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.


So the answer is **20**.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to see how far that speedy horse runs.  It goes 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, it runs 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

Now, for every mile, the horse eats half a bale of hay. That means it eats 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so 8 bales cost 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is 6 * $5 = $30.

After buying the hay, he'll have $30 - $24 = $6 left.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

First, we figure out how much each balloon cost originally.  Since 20 balloons cost $900, one balloon cost $900 / 20 = $45.

Then, the price went up by $20, so each balloon now costs $45 + $20 = $65.

Finally, to find the cost of 170 balloons at the new price, we multiply: $65 * 170 = $11,050.


So the answer is $11,050.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find the total distance the car traveled.  It went 60 miles per hour for two hours, so that's 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then it went 30 miles per hour for one hour, so that's 30 * 1 = 30 miles.  

Adding those together, the car traveled a total of 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

Now, it took 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours for the whole trip.

Finally, to find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Grayson makes 2 cents for each aluminum can and 3 cents for each plastic bottle. She recycles 3 cans and 5 bottles each week.

First, let's see how much she makes from the cans: 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents

Then, let's see how much she makes from the bottles: 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents

Now, add those together to find her total weekly earnings: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents

Finally, since there are 4 weeks in a month, multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

So Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling each month.

"Alright, let's build this pyramid!

* The bottom layer has 4 cheerleaders at 64 inches each, so that's 4 * 64 = 256 inches.

* The layer above that has 2 cheerleaders at 64 inches each, so that's 2 * 64 = 128 inches.
* And finally, the top cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

Adding all those up: 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half the amount Bodhi did.  

To find out how many insects Lily found, we can use a little bit of logic.  Let's think about it step-by-step:

* **Bodhi's insects:** Since David found half of Bodhi's insects, let's say Bodhi found 'B' insects. That means David found B/2 insects.

* **Lily's insects:** Lily found 7 more than David, so she found (B/2) + 7 insects.

* **Total insects:**  Now we know: B + (B/2) + (B/2) + 7 = 43

* **Simplifying:**  This becomes B + B + 7 = 43, which is 2B + 7 = 43

* **Solving for B:**  Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36. Then divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

* **Finding Lily's insects:** Bodhi found 18 insects, so David found 18/2 = 9 insects.  Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.



Lily found **16** insects.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so they have 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so they have 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.

Adding it all up, the farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Together, they have 40 animals + 80 animals = 120 animals.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, which is four times the amount Sophia bought.  

To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we can divide Rose's onion amount by 4: 12 onions / 4 = 3 onions.

For potatoes, we do the same: 4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato.

So, Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items total.

Julie started with $500. She spent 20% of that on clothes, which is $500 * 0.20 = $100.  That leaves her with $500 - $100 = $400.

Then she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs, so that's $400 * 0.25 = $100.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

If the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can think of it like this:

*  Let 'x' represent the cost of the lot.
*  The house costs 3x.

Together, they cost $120,000, so:

x + 3x = $120,000

Combining those 'x' terms, we get:

4x = $120,000

To find out what 'x' is (the cost of the lot), we divide both sides by 4:

x = $30,000

Now, since the house costs 3 times the lot, we multiply:

3 * $30,000 = $90,000


So the house cost $90,000.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, so that's 8 * 5 = 40 bags.  Each bag cost $4, so the total cost was 40 * $4 = $160.

She sold each bag for $8, so she made 40 * $8 = $320.

To find her profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $320 - $160 = $160.

*  Let's say Elvis saves 'x' dollars each day in the first half.

*  In the second half, he'd save 2x dollars each day.

*  His total savings would be: (15 * x) + (15 * 2x) = $1125

*  Simplifying that: 15x + 30x = $1125

*  Combining like terms: 45x = $1125

*  To find 'x', divide both sides by 45: x = $25

Over two years, she'll take out $1200 * 2 = $2400.

That means she'll have $3000 - $2400 = $600 left.

"Hey there! Let's break down this grilled cheese business.

First, the bread costs $3.00 per loaf and makes 10 sandwiches, so each sandwich costs $0.30 to make.

Then, they spend $30.00 on cheese and stuff for every 10 sandwiches.

So, for 10 sandwiches, the total cost is $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and stuff) = $33.00

They sell those 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, which brings in $70.00.

Finally, subtract the cost from the revenue: $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

Their net profit is $37.00!

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much this carpet job will cost Michael.

First, we need to find the area of his bedroom: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

Now, let's break down the costs:

* **Carpet:** 216 square feet * $12/square foot = $2592
* **Padding:** 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432
* **Removal:** 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864
* **Installation:** 216 square feet * $34/square foot = $7344

Finally, add it all up: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232


So, it will cost Michael $11232 to replace the carpet.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

Maggie's oven is a bit of a hothead, running 18 degrees hotter than what she sets it to.  

To get 520 degrees in the oven, she needs to set it to a temperature that will result in 520 degrees *after* the oven's extra heat.  

Think of it like this: if she sets it to 'x', the actual temperature will be x + 18.  We know that x + 18 = 520.  

Solving for x, we get x = 502.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Judy brought twice as many dishes as cups, so she brought 12 cups * 2 = 24 dishes. That means she brought a total of 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so they brought 24 dishes + 20 dishes = 44 dishes.  Her friend's total is 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils.

Together, they brought 84 utensils + 36 utensils = 120 utensils.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

* Each box has 90 contacts and lasts Pete 45 days, so that means he uses 2 contacts per day (90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts/day).

*  A box costs $100, but it's 10% off, which is a $10 discount. So each box costs $90.

*  He buys two boxes, so that's $180 total ($90 x 2 = $180).

*  With two boxes, he has 180 contacts in total (90 contacts/box x 2 boxes = 180 contacts).

*  To find the cost per pair, divide the total cost by the number of pairs: $180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday (2 hours * 2 = 4 hours) and three times as long on Sunday (1 hour * 3 = 3 hours). That means he worked a total of 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours.

So, John made 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

John earned $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this jelly bean problem down.

First, we know there are 4500 jelly beans total.  Let's say there are 'b' blue jelly beans.  

* Red jelly beans are 1% fewer than blue, so there are 0.99b red jelly beans.
* Green jelly beans are 1% more than blue, so there are 1.01b green jelly beans.

Now we can set up an equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms:

2.99b = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99 to find 'b':

b ≈ 1505 blue jelly beans

Now we can find the rest:

* Red: 0.99 * 1505 ≈ 1490 red jelly beans
* Green: 1.01 * 1505 ≈ 1520 green jelly beans

Finally, subtract the red jelly beans from the green jelly beans:

1520 - 1490 = 30

So, there are **30** more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Hey there!  Let's break this triangle problem down.

*  Let's say the smallest angle is 'x'.
*  The second angle is twice the smallest, so it's 2x.
*  The biggest angle is three times the smallest, making it 3x.

That simplifies to 6x = 180.  

Divide both sides by 6, and we find x = 30 degrees.

The largest angle is 3x, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

First, let's see how much money he has in total:

* Quarters: 8 * $0.25 = $2.00
* Dimes: 6 * $0.10 = $0.60
* Nickels: 14 * $0.05 = $0.70
* Pennies: 15 * $0.01 = $0.15

Then, for the next two hours, he sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 each, so he made 10 cups * $0.60 = $6.00 per hour. Over two hours, that's $6.00 * 2 = $12.00.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles driven.  Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, which means his tires rotate 400 miles / 2 miles/rotation * 725 rotations/2 miles = 145,000 times per month.

Over a year, that's 145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations.

Now, each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing a replacement.  

Dividing the total tire lifespan by the monthly rotations, we get 10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years.


The tires will need to be replaced in **6 years**.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

If four apples cost $5.20, that means one apple costs $1.30 ($5.20 / 4 = $1.30).

And since three oranges cost $3.30, one orange costs $1.10 ($3.30 / 3 = $1.10).

Now, five apples would cost $6.50 ($1.30 x 5 = $6.50), and five oranges would cost $5.50 ($1.10 x 5 = $5.50).

So, Clyde would pay a total of $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges ($6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00).

* Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

Now, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:

* Almonds: (1/5 pound) * ($10/pound) = $2
* Walnuts: (1/3 pound) * ($15/pound) = $5
* Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

We know Lee has 20 heads total and 70 legs.  Let's think:

* Each sheep has 4 legs.
* Each goose has 2 legs.

If we had only sheep, we'd have 70 / 4 = 17.5 heads. That's too many! So, there must be some geese.  Let's try different numbers of sheep and see if we can make the math work.

Hmm... if we have 15 sheep, that's 60 legs (15 x 4). That leaves us with 10 legs for the geese (70 - 60 = 10).  And 10 legs for geese means there are 5 geese (10 / 2 = 5).

Let's check: 15 sheep + 5 geese = 20 heads, and 60 sheep legs + 10 goose legs = 70 legs.  

It works!


So, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

So, Shania made her dress longer by 50% of its original size, and then added 20cm of lace.  If the dress is now 140cm long, we can figure out the original length.

Let's say the original length was 'x' centimeters.

* After the 50% extension, the dress was 1.50x centimeters long.
* Adding the lace trim makes it 1.50x + 20 centimeters.
* We know this final length is 140cm, so: 1.50x + 20 = 140

Now, let's solve for 'x':

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, we've got twins and triplets, and one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.  Their total age is 44.  

Think of it this way:

* Let's say one triplet is 't' years old.
* The twin would be 't + 7' years old.

Together, all five kids are 't + t + 7 + t + t = 44' years old.

Simplifying that, we get  '4t + 7 = 44'.

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we have '4t = 37'.

Then, dividing both sides by 4, we find 't = 9.25'.

Since the twin is 7 years older than the triplet, the twin is 9.25 + 7 = 16.25 years old.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Rong saves 20 coins each month, and Neil saves 2/5 more than that.  So Neil saves (2/5) * 20 coins = 8 more coins each month. That means Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Over a year, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins. Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year = 336 coins per year.

After ten years, Rong will have saved 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins. Neil will have saved 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

So, the vaccines cost $20 each and John needs two, so that's $20 * 2 = $40.  The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which means we need to figure out the total bill first.  Let's call the total bill 'x'. We know:

* Vaccines: $40
* Heartworm check: 0.60x 
* Total bill: x

Putting it together: $40 + 0.60x = x

To solve for x, let's subtract $40 from both sides: 0.60x = x - $40

Then, subtract 0.60x from both sides: 0 = 0.40x - $40

Add $40 to both sides: $40 = 0.40x

Finally, divide both sides by 0.40: x = $100

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

* Adam has 50 points.
* Betty did better than Adam and got 30% more points, so she has 50 + (50 * 0.30) = 65 points.
* Tom has 30 fewer points than Betty, meaning he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
* Marta has 3 times the points Tom has, so she has 35 * 3 = 105 points.

Adding up everyone's points, we get 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

To go on the trip, they need 400 points.  That means they're still missing 400 - 255 = 145 points.

Colorado City uses 40% of the Colorado River's water, and 80% of that 40% goes to industry.  So, to find out what percentage is used for non-industrial stuff, we need to do a little subtracting.

Think of it like this:

*  They use 40% of the river water.
*  80% of that 40% is for industry, which is 32% of the total river water (40% * 80% = 32%).

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

*  20% of the 50 people like horse #2, so that's 20/100 * 50 = 10 people.

*  That leaves 50 - 10 = 40 people who like other horses.

*  60% of those 40 people like horse #7, which is 60/100 * 40 = 24 people.

*  So, 40 - 24 = 16 people must like horse #12.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If 6 puppies are one-third of the Pomeranians, there are 6 * 3 = 18 Pomeranians.

Since two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we know there are 18 Pomeranians, that means Jana has 18 / (2/3) = 27 puppies in total.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

*  If the second house needs 'x' cases of shingles, the first house needs half that, or x/2.

* The third house needs double the shingles of the first, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

*  Together, all three houses need 250 cases: (x/2) + x + x = 250

*  Combining like terms, we get 2.5x = 250

*  Solving for x, we find x = 100.

*  Since the third house needs the same number of cases as the second house, it needs 100 cases.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we need to find out how much Mike's series movies cost. Since he gets them for 1/6 the price of a normal movie, that's 600 movies / 3 = 200 series movies * ($10 / 6) = $333.33.

Next, let's see how much the older movies cost.  40% of the remaining movies are older, so that's (600 movies - 200 movies) * 0.40 = 160 movies * $5 = $800.

Finally, the rest of the movies cost $10 each, so that's (600 movies - 200 movies) - 160 movies = 240 movies * $10 = $2400.

Adding it all up, the total cost is $333.33 + $800 + $2400 = $3533.33.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how fast the Llesis family hiked. They hiked 5 miles per hour slower than half their driving speed, which is 50 mph. Half their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 mph.  So they hiked at 25 - 5 = 20 mph.

Next, we know they hiked for 1.5 hours, so they covered 1.5 * 20 = 30 miles while hiking.

They drove for 6 hours total minus their 1.5 hours of hiking, which means they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Since they drove at 50 mph, they covered 4.5 * 50 = 225 miles while driving.

Finally, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Ava gets 10 points for each enemy she jumps on, 5 for each berry, and 30 for every second left on the timer. Emma gets the same.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so that's 8 * 10 = 80 extra points for Ava.

Ava also collects 3 more berries, which is 3 * 5 = 15 extra points.

But, Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so she loses 4 * 30 = 120 points.

Let's add it all up: 80 + 15 - 120 = -25

The difference in their scores is **-25**.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish, so he had a total of 7.  He bought 17 more fish, and now he has twice as many orange as white.  

Let's think: if he bought 'w' white fish, he must have bought '2w' orange fish.  That means w + 2w = 17.  

Combining those terms, we get 3w = 17.  

Dividing both sides by 3, we find out he bought 5.67 white fish.  But since you can't buy parts of fish, Bob must have bought 5 white fish.

Andy drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home each day, so that's 10 miles total per day.  

Over a five-day work week, he drives 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles.

Since his car gets 10 miles per gallon, he uses 50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons of gas per week.

With gas costing $3 per gallon, that means he spends 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15 per week on gas.

First, we need to figure out how long each friend plays. Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter, two friends play for half that (10 minutes per quarter), and the best friend plays for 1.5 times as long (30 minutes per quarter).

They play for a total of 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.  

* Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
* The worse friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters.
* The better friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

Adding it all up, they use a total of 12 + (24 * 2) + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, they spend 68 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar.  She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.  

* Let's say 'x' represents the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance).
* Since salt and sugar are the same, they're also 'x' ounces.
* Oil is twice the amount of salt, so that's 2x ounces.

Now, the total in the jar is 10 ounces: x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combining like terms, we get 5x = 10.  

Dividing both sides by 5, we find x = 2.

Since oil is 2x, Tanya uses 2 * 2 = 4 ounces of oil.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

John makes $1.20 for each task, and he does 5 tasks per cycle. So, he earns $1.20 * 5 = $6.00 per cycle.

Since he does 30 cycles a day, he makes $6.00 * 30 = $180.00 each day.

Over a 7-day week, he earns $180.00 * 7 = $1260.00.

"Hey there! Let's break this basketball problem down. 

Sasha scored 14 points in the first game, and Julie scored 4 fewer than that, so she scored 10 points.  

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie scored in the first game, which means Sasha scored 4 points.

Adding up Sasha's points from both games, we get 14 + 4 = 18 points.


Sasha scored a total of 18 points.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Kimberly has 8 packages of cat food with 11 tins each, so that's 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.  She also has 6 packages of dog food with 6 tins each, which is 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.  

To find the difference, we subtract: 88 - 36 = 52 tins. 

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 Magic Cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the amount PJ has.  

Let's think about it step-by-step:

* **Let's say PJ has 'x' cards.**
* **Smendrick has 3 times PJ's amount, so Smendrick has 3x cards.**
* **Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.**

Now we know:

* x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Let's solve for x:

* 7x + 12 = 341
* 7x = 329
* x = 47  (So PJ has 47 cards)

Finally, let's find out how many cards Becca has:

* Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.



Becca has 153 Magic Cards!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars each month.  He makes 8,000 in the first week. The second week, he makes half of that, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.  

The third week, he makes three times the amount of the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how many he makes in the fourth week, we add up the bars from the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Then, we subtract that from his monthly total: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.


Boris makes 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

The base installation is $129.00, and that covers 4 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.  

Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.

* **Mirrors:** She needs 6 - 4 = 2 extra mirrors at $15.00 each, so that's 2 * $15.00 = $30.00 extra.
* **Chandeliers:** She needs 2 - 1 = 1 extra chandelier at $15.00, so that's $15.00 extra.
* **Pictures:** She needs 20 - 10 = 10 extra pictures at $15.00 each, so that's 10 * $15.00 = $150.00 extra.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, you're three years younger than your brother, two years older than your sister, and together you all add up to 87 years.  

To make things easier, let's use some numbers:

*  Let your brother's age be ""b""
*  Let your sister's age be ""s""
*  And your age is ""y""

Now, we can write some equations based on what we know:

*  y = b - 3 
*  y = s + 2
*  y + b + s + (3b - 1) = 87

Let's simplify that last equation:

*  4b + y + s = 88

Now, we can use the first two equations to replace ""y"" in the simplified equation:

*  4b + (b - 3) + (y - 2) = 88

Combine like terms:

*  5b + y - 5 = 88

And again, replace ""y"":

*  5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88

Simplify and solve for ""b"":

*  6b - 8 = 88
*  6b = 96
*  b = 16

Now that we know your brother is 16, we can find your age:

*  y = b - 3
*  y = 16 - 3
*  y = 13


So, you are 13 years old!

First, let's see how much the chicken costs. Each pack is twice the price of a pack of bacon, which is $2. So, each chicken pack costs $4.  Since Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, that's $4 * 6 = $24.

Next, the strawberries cost $4 each, and she has 3 packs, so that's $4 * 3 = $12.

The apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2 per pack. With 7 packs of apples, that comes to $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the cost of everything: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, subtract that from her budget of $65 to see how much she has left: $65 - $60 = $5.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. 

So, Elaina's final concert was twice as long as her usual ones, plus a 15-minute encore, and it lasted 65 minutes.  

Let's say her usual concerts are 'x' minutes long.  We can set up an equation:

2x + 15 = 65

Now, subtract 15 from both sides:

2x = 50

And finally, divide both sides by 2:

x = 25


Her usual concerts are **25** minutes long.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If 20% of the microphones couldn't be paired, that means 20% of 50 microphones is 10 microphones.  

So, 50 - 10 = 40 microphones were paired up.

And since each pair has 2 microphones, he made 40 / 2 = 20 pairs.

The daisies have 10 petals each and the orchids have 5.  

* Daisies total petals: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we find out how many indoor plants Mrs. Smith has: 100 plants * (1/4) = 25 plants.

That leaves us with 100 plants - 25 plants = 75 plants outside.

Now, two-thirds of those are outdoor plants: 75 plants * (2/3) = 50 plants.

So, there are 75 plants - 50 plants = 25 flowering plants.

Finally, we calculate the percentage: 25 plants / 100 plants * 100% = 25%

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

We know a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, and that's 11 times faster than a thingamabob. So, a thingamabob spins at 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Now, a whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob, meaning it spins at 11 * 5 = 55 meters per second.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days, so that's 8 * 5 = 40 hours a week.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

So, Tasha made $80 total, and we know she earned some from mowing lawns and some from lemonade.  

*  She mowed Joe's lawn some number of times, let's call that 'x'.
*  Kamala's lawn was mowed 3 times as much as Joe's, so that's 3x times.
*  Alba's lawn was mowed 5 times as much as Joe's, so that's 5x times.

Each time she mowed a lawn, she made $6.  

To find her total mowing money, we add it all up: 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x

Now, to find out how much she made from lemonade, we subtract her mowing money from her total earnings: $80 - 54x 

Without knowing how many times she mowed Joe's lawn (that 'x' value), we can't say for sure how much she made from lemonade.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

* Carl weighs 16 kg more than Martin, who weighs 55 kg. So Carl weighs 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg.
* Christian weighs 8 kg more than Carl, meaning Christian weighs 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg.
* Finally, Harry weighs 5 kg less than Christian, so Harry weighs 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.


Harry weighs 74 kg.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we need to find out how much the balloons cost.  A dozen balloons is 12 balloons, and they cost $0.50 for every 2 balloons. So, they bought 12 / 2 = 6 sets of 2 balloons. That means the balloons cost 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

Next, the ice cream cost 2 tubs * $7.00 per tub = $14.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $11.00 (cake) + $3.00 (balloons) + $14.00 (ice cream) = $28.00.

Since Julia and Nadine split the cost evenly, their mom gave each of them $28.00 / 2 = $14.00.

* First, let's see how much he's spent on popcorn and candy already: 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each is $16, and 4 boxes of candy at $2 each is $8. That's a total of $24.

*  He's already seen 5 movies on Friday or Saturday at $10 each, which is $50.

*  He's also seen 8 movies on other days at $7 each, costing him $56.

*  So far, he's spent $50 + $56 + $24 = $130.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45.  Each widget sells for $6.  

First, we need to figure out how many widgets each machine makes in a day:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day

Now, let's calculate their daily earnings:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** 1440 widgets/day * $6/widget = $8640/day
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** 1080 widgets/day * $6/widget = $6480/day

Finally,  let's see how much more Fern makes with the Widgeteer 3000 over a month (30 days):

* **Widgeteer 3000:** $8640/day * 30 days/month = $259,200/month
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** $6480/day * 30 days/month = $194,400/month

* **New York Times:** He makes 10% commission on each $5 paper, so that's $5 * 0.10 = $0.50 per paper.  With 6 copies, he earns $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

* **Wall Street Journal:**  He makes 8% commission on each $15 paper, so that's $15 * 0.08 = $1.20 per paper. With 10 copies, he earns $1.20 * 10 = $12.00.

* **Total:**  Adding his earnings from both papers, Cayley makes a total of $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00 in commission.

"Let's break this problem down!

*  Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points.

*  Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, so Bahati scored 'x + 20' points.

*  Dinar scored 10 fewer points than Bahati, so Dinar scored 'x + 20 - 10' or 'x + 10' points.

*  Together, their scores add up to 45 points: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

*  Combining like terms: 3x + 30 = 45

*  Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

*  Dividing both sides by 3: x = 5


Azibo scored 5 points.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, and he's working from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a long day!  

First, let's see how many 15-minute chunks are in that time.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 hours is 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.  Then, 900 minutes divided by 15 minutes per chunk gives us 60 chunks.

Since Vince staples 30 reports per chunk, he staples a total of 60 chunks * 30 reports/chunk = 1800 reports.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If Courtney overstated the number by 20%, that means Kelly is saying there were actually fewer people at the concert. To find the real number, we need to figure out how much Courtney overestimated. 

20% of 48 is (20/100) * 48 = 9.6 people.

So, we subtract that from Courtney's count: 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Since we can't have parts of people, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have caught a total of 339 Pokemon. Alex caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe caught.  

To solve this, let's use some algebra.  Let's say:

*  A = the number of Pokemon Alex caught
*  S = the number of Pokemon Stan caught
*  W = the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught

We know:

* A + S + W = 339 
* A = S + 5
* S = 4W - 13

Now we can substitute to solve for S! Let's plug A and S from the second and third equations into the first equation:

(S + 5) + S + W = 339

Simplify that:

2S + W = 334

Now, let's solve for W in terms of S using the third equation:

W = (S + 13) / 4

Substitute that value of W back into the equation:

2S + (S + 13) / 4 = 334

Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:

8S + S + 13 = 1336

Combine like terms:

9S + 13 = 1336

Subtract 13 from both sides:

9S = 1323

Finally, divide both sides by 9:

S = 147


Stan caught 147 Pokemon!

First, the bird flies 30 miles per hour for 10 hours south, so that's 30 * 10 = 300 miles.

Then, it flies 18 miles per hour for 2 hours north, covering 18 * 2 = 36 miles.

Finally, it flies 22 miles per hour for 5 hours south, which is 22 * 5 = 110 miles.

To find the total distance south, we add the first and last legs: 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles.

But remember, it flew north a bit, so we need to subtract that: 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.


The distance between the bird's homes is **374 miles**.

Now, let's calculate his earnings:

* Saturday gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6/box = $60
* Saturday apple pie: 11 boxes * $15/box = $165
* Sunday gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6/box = $90

That means there are 1500 students - 375 students = 1125 girls over 16.

Next, we look at the under 16 crowd: 3000 students / 2 = 1500 students.

Half of those are boys: 1500 students / 2 = 750 students.

So, there are 1500 students - 750 students = 750 girls under 16.

Finally, we add up all the girls: 1125 students + 750 students = 1875 students.

"Alright, let's figure this out!

First, let's see how much water Wanda pumped on the first day: (1/4) * 18000 gallons = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she pumped (3/4) * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.

Together, they pumped 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons on the first day.

On the second day, Wanda pumped (2/3) * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped (1/3) * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons on the second day.

That means they pumped a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons on the second day.

Over the two days, they pumped 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

Finally, to find out how much more water is needed, we subtract that from the tank's full capacity: 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons.



**Answer:** 6000 gallons

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

Maria's power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours, which is a total of 45%.  That means 55% of the original charge was left.

Then, it lost another 7% each hour for 3 hours, totaling 21%.

We know the final charge was 28%, so we can set up an equation:

0.55x - 0.21x = 0.28

Combining like terms, we get:

0.34x = 0.28

To find the original charge (x), we divide both sides by 0.34:

x = 0.28 / 0.34 

x ≈ 0.82 or 82%




So the power bank was about **82%** charged when Maria left for the park.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, let's see how much Jamaar spent on those other fruits:

* Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
* Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
* Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
* Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Adding that up, he spent $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

That means he has $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since each plum costs $0.25, he can buy $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

The price of carrots goes up by 5% each year.  So, in the first year, the price increases by $120 * 0.05 = $6. That means they'll cost $126.

The next year, the price goes up another 5% on that new price: $126 * 0.05 = $6.30.  So now they cost $132.30.

And in the third year, it's another 5% increase: $132.30 * 0.05 = $6.615.  

Adding that to the price, we get $138.915.  Rounding that to the nearest dollar, the carrots will cost $139.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Marcus has a 50% chance of having a substitute teacher who won't collect homework.  If his regular teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. Even if no one gets an extension, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing her his dog ate it.

So, to figure out the chances he *has* to do the homework, we need to think about when he *doesn't* get out of it.

*  He won't have to do it if he has the substitute.
*  He won't have to do it if his teacher gives an extension.
*  He won't have to do it if he convinces her about the dog.

Let's calculate those chances:

*  Substitute teacher: 50%
*  Teacher gives extension: 40%
*  Dog ate it excuse: 20%

Now, we need to figure out the chances of *none* of those happening. That's:

*  (100% - 50%) * (100% - 40%) * (100% - 20%) = 30% * 60% * 80% = 14.4%

Finally, to get the percentage of times he *does* have to do the homework, we subtract that from 100%:

"Let's figure this out!

*  Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks that couldn't deliver because a quarter of them broke down. That's 20 trucks * (1/4) = 5 trucks.
*  So, 20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks made it to the farmers.
*  Each truck carried 20 tons, so 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons of fertilizer were delivered.


**Answer: 300 tons**

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter for his croissants.  Since the store has that buy-one-get-one-half-off deal, he'll get 3 pounds at half price.  

That means he'll pay full price for 3 pounds, which is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.

The discounted butter will cost him 3 * $4.00 / 2 = $6.00.

Adding those together, the total cost is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Kayla's got 25 classmates + 7 dance friends + 13 family members = 45 guests total.  Since the theater costs $125 for 20 people, that means she needs to pay extra for 45 - 20 = 25 more guests.  That's 25 guests * $6 each = $150 extra.  So the whole party will cost $125 + $150 = $275.

"Let's figure this out!

*  Each monkey eats a different amount of bananas each day.
*  The first monkey eats 10 bananas.
*  The second monkey eats 4 more than the first, so 10 + 4 = 14 bananas.
*  That means the first two monkeys eat a total of 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day.
*  Since there are 315 bananas for the whole week, they eat 315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.
*  To find out how many the third monkey eats, we subtract the amount the first two eat: 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

"Alright, let's figure this out!

Jenny buys 15 roses.  Since a dozen is 12 roses, she buys a little more than a full dozen.  

* A dozen roses costs $15, so 15 roses cost a bit more than that.  Let's figure out exactly how much more.

* 15 roses / 12 roses per dozen = 1.25 dozens.

* 1.25 dozens * $15 per dozen = $18.75

So the roses cost $18.75.  Jenny paid with five $5 bills, which is $25 total.

* $25 - $18.75 = $6.25 in change.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, she gets 6.25 / 0.25 = 25 quarters.

*  Mr. Rogers bought the watch for 75% of the original price, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.
*  He then sold it to his friend for 120% of what he paid, meaning he sold it for 1.20 * $1500 = $1800.
*  The friend got a discount of $2000 - $1800 = $200.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Sam gets 'x' feet of fence, and Harry gets 'x + 60' feet.  Since they have 100 feet total, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combining like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

First, a BMX bike costs half the price of an MTB, which is $500, so a BMX is $250.

Marcel sold 150 Trekking bikes (half of the total), 45 BMX bikes (15% of the total), and 105 MTB bikes (the rest).

Now, let's calculate his earnings:

* Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
* BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
* MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

Adding it all up, Marcel earned $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250 from selling bikes that month.

The truck takes away 3 bales each hour for 6 hours, so that's 3 times 6 which is 18 bales.  If the farmer makes 30 bales and the truck takes 18, there are 30 minus 18, which is 12 bales left.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

John has 2 extra classes that are 40 minutes each, so that's 2 * 40 = 80 minutes extra.

He goes to regular classes for 6 periods * 40 minutes each = 240 minutes a day.

Adding his extra classes, that's 240 + 80 = 320 minutes per day.

Over 5 days, that's 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes of class time.

He spends an extra 1/16 of his total weekly class time on Saturday and Sunday, which is 1600 / 16 = 100 minutes each day.

So, his extra learning time is 100 * 2 = 200 minutes.

In total, he spends 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes learning each week.

Converting that to hours, we get 1800 / 60 = 30 hours.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

We know the Allosaurus gobbled up the last 270 kilograms.  Before that, the velociraptors had half of what was left after the T-Rex ate.  So, the amount the velociraptors ate represents half of the amount the T-Rex left behind.

Let's say the whole triceratops weighed 'x' kilograms. The T-Rex ate half, leaving x/2. The velociraptors then ate half of that, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4.

That means the 270 kilograms the Allosaurus ate was the remaining half: x/2 - x/4 = 270

Combining like terms, we get x/4 = 270.  

To find the original weight (x), we multiply both sides by 4: x = 1080 kilograms.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find the area of each wall:

* The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so each is 80 square feet (10 x 8 = 80).
* The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so each is 40 square feet (5 x 8 = 40).

Now, let's add up the area of all the walls:

*  (80 sq ft x 2) + (40 sq ft x 2) = 160 sq ft + 80 sq ft = 240 sq ft

Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we'll need 12 gallons (240 sq ft / 20 sq ft/gallon = 12 gallons).

Finally, each gallon costs $12, so the total cost will be $144 (12 gallons x $12/gallon = $144).

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If 40% of the school is made up of 240 boys, we can find the total number of students first.  

Think of it like this: 40% represents 240 students, so 100% represents the whole school.  

To find 100%, we can set up a little equation:

40/100 = 240/x

Where 'x' is the total number of students.  Cross-multiplying gives us:

40 * x = 100 * 240

Simplifying:

40x = 24000

Now, divide both sides by 40 to find x:

x = 600

So, there are 600 students in total.

Since 240 are boys, we can subtract to find the number of girls:

600 - 240 = 360


There are **360** girls in the school.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and he's using 25 boxes, so the boxes themselves weigh 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces.

Now, each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and he has 200 crayons, so they weigh 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces.

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes, we get 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.

Finally, there are 16 ounces in a pound, so 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.


So the total weight of the crayons and boxes is **25 pounds**.

"Hey there! Let's break this tree-chopping problem down:

First, John can use 80% of the 80-foot tree, which is 64 feet.  

Then, he cuts those 64 feet into 4-foot logs, giving him 64 feet / 4 feet/log = 16 logs.

Each log makes 5 planks, so he has 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks.

Finally, he sells each plank for $1.20, earning 80 planks * $1.20/plank = $96.00.


So, John makes $96.00 from selling the planks.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Valerie makes $5000 a month, and that's half of what her brother earns. So her brother makes $5000 * 2 = $10000 per month.

Together, Valerie and her brother make $5000 + $10000 = $15000.

Their mom makes twice that amount, so she makes $15000 * 2 = $30000 per month.

Adding it all up, they make a total of $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000 per month.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Grandma's a speedy walker! She covers 2 miles on the beach at a certain pace, and we know that takes her 40 minutes.  That means she walks at a rate of 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute on the beach.

On the sidewalk, she's twice as fast, so she walks at 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, so it takes her 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

Adding that to her beach time, her total walk takes 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So Donny needs his water to be at least 40 degrees. He mixes some 33-degree water with some hotter water.  To make it drinkable, the mixed water has to be at least 40 degrees.  

Let's say the hotter water is 'x' degrees.  

He mixes 4 ounces of the 33-degree water with 1 ounce of the 'x' degree water.  

That means the total amount of water is 5 ounces.  

We can set up an equation:

(33 * 4) + (x * 1) >= 40 * 5

Simplifying:

132 + x >= 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x >= 68


Donny needs the second mug to be at least 68 degrees.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, let's calculate the total number of cows:

* Melanie's dad starts with 50 cows.
* Milkie Cows Limited delivers 20 cows per day for 3 weeks * 7 days a week = 420 cows.
* That means he'll have 50 + 420 = 470 cows.

Now, let's do the same for the chickens:

* He starts with 20 chickens.
* Broilers Limited delivers 10 chickens per day for 3 weeks * 7 days a week = 210 chickens.
* So, he'll have 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

Finally, add up the cows and chickens: 470 + 230 = 700 animals.

"Alright, let's break this down. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so he ate 18 scoops.  

Now, it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. That means it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops.  

So, for 1 scoop, it takes 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes.

Finally, Gomer ate 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

*  Now, Carlos found twice as many as Carrey, so Carrey found 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

*  Together, they found 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

*  Finally, they split the shells evenly, so each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

So, we've got a red rope that's four times longer than the blue rope. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  If all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long, how long is the red rope?

Let's break it down:

*  Let's say the yellow rope is 'y' centimeters long.
*  The blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (y - 7) centimeters long.

Now we know: y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Let's solve for 'y':

* y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
* 6y - 35 = 37
* 6y = 72
* y = 12

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, we can find the red rope's length:

* Red rope = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20

The red rope is 20 centimeters long!

"Alright, let's break this down step-by-step. 

Thomas starts with 1000 dollars, and since each bill is 20 dollars, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 on the way home, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

He uses half of those to pay a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

That leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Now, he triples his money, meaning he has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  Since each bill is now worth 5 dollars, he has 60 * 5 = 300 dollars.

To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide the total amount by the value of each bill: 300 / 5 = 60.



He has **60** five dollar bills.

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down. 

Let's say Wendy's current age is ""w"" and Colin's current age is ""c"".

*  We know Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years:  w = 5(c + 7)
*  And in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.  Let's rearrange the first equation to solve for 'w':

w = 5c + 35

Now, substitute that value of 'w' into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for 'c':

3c + 75 = 5c + 35
40 = 2c
c = 20


So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Hey there! Let's break down Jen's earnings for April.

She makes $1.50 per hour and works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. That means she earns $11.25 each day.

Over a week, she makes $11.25/day * 6 days/week = $67.50.

Since April has 4 weeks, her total earnings for the month would be $67.50/week * 4 weeks = $270.

But wait, there's more! She gets an extra $10 for perfect attendance, so her final take-home pay for April is $270 + $10 = $280.

"Alright, let's break this tree-planting problem down!

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice that amount of Lodgepole Pine, which is 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine.

On the second day, he added 10 more White Oak trees, bringing his total to 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak.  He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine than the first day, so that's 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pine.  That means he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine on the second day.

Adding up all the trees, he planted a total of 30 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 80 trees on the second day.

Over the two days, he planted 20 White Oak + 30 White Oak = 50 White Oak and 40 Lodgepole Pine + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 90 Lodgepole Pine for a grand total of 50 + 90 = 140 trees!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we find out how many fish have red stripes: 66 fish / 3 = 22 fish.

Then, we see how many fish are left after taking out the red striped ones: 66 fish - 22 fish = 44 fish.

Next, we calculate how many of those remaining fish have blue stripes: 44 fish * (5/11) = 20 fish.

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes: 22 fish + 20 fish = 42 fish.


So the answer is 42.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Amy starts with 2 palettes * 4 colors each = 8 colors.

Then she has 3 makeup sets * 6 colors each = 18 colors.

That's a total of 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister takes one palette, so she loses 4 colors.

Now she has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

She uses up half of one makeup set, which is 6 colors / 2 = 3 colors.

That leaves her with 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Mattison's house is 7 times his height, so it's 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches tall.  The first floor is three times his height, meaning it's 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches high.  

To find the roof height from the second floor, we subtract the first floor height from the total house height: 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.  Then, we subtract the second floor height from that: 240 inches - 180 inches = 60 inches.


So the roof is 60 inches high from the second floor.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

* The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day.
* The medium setting removes twice the amount of the low setting, so it removes 1 liter * 2 = 2 liters per day.
* The high setting removes twice the amount of the medium setting, so it removes 2 liters * 2 = 4 liters per day.

Now, let's calculate the total water removed for each setting:

* Low setting: 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters
* Medium setting: 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters
* High setting: 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Finally, add up the water removed from all the settings: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters.


So the answer is **29 liters**.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

First, we need to figure out how many jelly beans the jar could hold.  It's 6 inches by 6 inches by 15 inches, so that's 540 cubic inches.  But remember, they don't pack them in perfectly, so we need to multiply that by 80% efficiency, which gives us 432 cubic inches.

Now, each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, so we can divide to find out how many fit: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

Tim thinks 30% of those are red, so he'd guess there are 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

But the real answer is 900 red jelly beans.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, Mary makes strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes.  The blueberry cubes are 5 times the number of strawberry cubes, minus 4.  If she makes 116 ice cubes total, how many blueberry cubes does she make?

Let's say 's' is the number of strawberry cubes.  That means the blueberry cubes are 5s - 4.  Together, they equal 116:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combining like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Dividing both sides by 6:

s = 20

If there are 20 helmets and Dominick sees half as many robots as helmets, that means there are 20 / 2 = 10 robots.

Since he sees half as many helmets as footballs, there must be 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

Adding it all up, we have 10 robots + 20 helmets + 40 footballs = 70 items in total.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Tim works 6 hours a day, and each call takes 15 minutes.  So in an hour, he handles 60 minutes / 15 minutes/call = 4 calls.  

Over 6 hours, that's 4 calls/hour * 6 hours = 24 calls per day.

Across his 5 day work week, he makes 24 calls/day * 5 days/week = 120 calls.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Crista has 8 plants that need a quarter cup of water, so that's 8 * (1/4) = 2 cups.

Then she has 4 plants that need half a cup, which is 4 * (1/2) = 2 cups.

And finally, 8 plants need a full cup, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

Adding it all up, she needs 2 + 2 + 8 = 12 cups of water for her plants.

"Hola! Let's help Phineas get home.  

First, we need to figure out how long it takes him to travel each half of the distance.  He hops 20 yards per minute on land and swims 10 yards per minute in water.

* **Land travel:** 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes
* **Water travel:** 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

Now, add those times together: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.


**Answer:** 15 minutes

"
"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

The main phone is twice as expensive as the extra phones, and the main one costs $20.  So each extra phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

Since there are four extra phones, they cost a total of $10 * 4 = $40.

Adding the cost of the main phone, the whole plan comes to $20 + $40 = $60. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Derrick bakes 10 dozen doughnuts a day, which is 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts.  Since each doughnut sells for $2, he makes 120 * $2 = $240 each day.  June has 30 days, so he'll make $240 * 30 = $7200 in June.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Alicia spends $5.00 per blouse, $6.00 per skirt, and $8.00 per pair of pants each week.  

* Blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00
* Pants: 2 pants * $8.00/pant = $16.00
* Skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00

That means she spends $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00 each week.

Over 5 weeks, that's $47.00/week * 5 weeks = $235.00

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

* Day 2: Conor saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.
* Day 3:  There were twice as many people on day 3 as day 2, so 70 * 2 = 140 people.
* Days 4-7:  He saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week, so that's 60 * 4 = 240 people.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon of lemonade, and he's making 5 gallons total (4 for the party + 1 for Allen).  That's 5 cups of juice he'll need. Since each cup comes from 6 lemons, he'll need 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.  

But wait! Allen wants his lemonade extra tart, twice as tart as the regular batch. That means he needs double the lemon juice, so Tim needs another 5 cups of juice for Allen's gallon. That's another 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.

In total, Tim needs 30 lemons + 30 lemons = 60 lemons.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

First year depreciation: $9000 * 0.30 = $2700.  So the boat is worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

Second year depreciation: $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.  That means it's worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

Third year depreciation: $4410 * 0.20 = $882.  

Finally, the boat is worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

First, we need to find out how many holes the dog digs in total: 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

Then, we see that Nate fills in 9 holes each day, but the dog digs 6 new ones, so he's really making a net progress of 3 holes per day (9 - 6 = 3).

To find out how many days it takes to fill all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the daily progress: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

Finally, to find out how many weeks that is, we divide the number of days by the number of days in a week: 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.


So the answer is **4 weeks**.
