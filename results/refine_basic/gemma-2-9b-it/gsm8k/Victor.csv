"Alright, let's break this down. Josh spent $80,000 on the house and then another $50,000 on repairs, for a total investment of $130,000.  The repairs increased the house's value by 150% of the original price, which is $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.  So the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.  His profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Kylar buys glasses in pairs, with every other one being discounted.  That means he's paying $5 for one and $3 for the next.  

Since he wants 16 glasses, he'll buy 8 pairs.  Each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8.

So, the total cost is 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, which has 20. So Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, meaning Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Adding them all up, Seattle's 20 + Charleston's 80 + Toulouse's 160 gives us a total of 260 sheep.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Carla downloads 2 GB every minute, so a 200 GB file would normally take 100 minutes (200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes).

But, she gets interrupted!  She's downloaded 40% of the file, which is 80 GB (200 GB * 40% = 80 GB).  

After the restart, she has to download the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB).

That'll take another 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes).

Adding the restart time of 20 minutes, the total download time is 100 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 180 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **First leg:** John drives 3 hours at 60 mph, covering 180 miles (3 * 60 = 180).

* **Return trip:**
    * He spends 2 hours stuck in traffic, covering 0 miles.
    * He drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph, covering 15 miles (0.5 * 30 = 15).
    * He has 1.5 hours left to drive (4 hours total - 2 hours traffic - 0.5 hours) at 80 mph, covering 120 miles (1.5 * 80 = 120).

* **Total return distance:** 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

* **Final distance from home:** John traveled 180 miles out and 135 miles back, so he's 45 miles from home (180 - 135 = 45).

"Hey there! Let's break down Eliza's earnings.

She makes $10 per hour for the first 40 hours, so that's 40 * $10 = $400.

For the extra 5 hours (45 total - 40 regular hours), she gets overtime at 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.  

That means her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

Adding her regular pay and overtime pay, her total earnings are $400 + $60 = $460.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to see how much profit Carlos makes each year from the lemon tree. He sells 7 lemons at $1.50 each, which brings in $10.50.  Then we subtract the $3 it costs to care for the tree, leaving him with a profit of $7.50 per year.

To figure out how long it takes to make back the initial $90 planting cost, we divide the cost by the yearly profit: $90 / $7.50 = 12 years.


So it will take Carlos **12** years to start earning money on his lemon tree.

"Let's break this problem down.  

* Melanie started with some number of vacuum cleaners, let's call that number 'x'.

* At the green house, she sold x/3.

* At the red house, she sold 2 more.

*  That means she had x - x/3 - 2 left.

* At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she sold (x - x/3 - 2) / 2.

*  We know she has 5 left over, so: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2) / 2 = 5

Now we can solve for x.  It takes a bit of algebra, but you'll find that x = 18.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

First, we find out how many students chose contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students is 4 students.  

That leaves 16 students who didn't pick contemporary.  Of those, 25% chose jazz, which is 4 students.

So, 12 students must have chosen hip-hop!  

To find the percentage, we divide the number of hip-hop dancers (12) by the total number of students (20) and multiply by 100%: (12/20) * 100% = 60%.




**Answer: 60%**

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.  

The merchant has two options:

* **Option 1:** Jewelry worth $5,000 that's predicted to increase by 2.5%
* **Option 2:** Electronic gadgets worth $8,000 that are predicted to increase by 1.2%

To figure out the most profitable choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

**Option 1 (Jewelry):**

* Increase in value: $5000 * 0.025 = $125
* Total value at the end of the month: $5000 + $125 = $5125
* Profit: $5125 - $5000 = $125

**Option 2 (Electronic Gadgets):**

* Increase in value: $8000 * 0.012 = $96
* Total value at the end of the month: $8000 + $96 = $8096
* Profit: $8096 - $8000 = $96


The jewelry option yields a higher profit of $125.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

You've got 10 liters of orange drink that's two-thirds water, so that's (2/3) * 10 liters = 6.67 liters of water.

Then you have 15 liters of pineapple drink that's three-fifths water, which is (3/5) * 15 liters = 9 liters of water.

Oops! You spill a liter of the orange drink, so you lose a bit of that water. That leaves you with 6.67 liters - 1 liter = 5.67 liters of water from the orange drink.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If Kyle got a 25% discount on a book that cost $19.50, we can think of that $19.50 as 75% of the original price (because 100% - 25% = 75%).

To find the original price, we can set up a little equation:

0.75 * original price = $19.50

Divide both sides by 0.75 to isolate the original price:

original price = $19.50 / 0.75 

original price = $26.00

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Gretchen has 110 coins total, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  

If we think of 's' as the number of silver coins, we know there are 's + 30' gold coins.  

Since all the coins add up to 110, we can write the equation: s + (s + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get 2s + 30 = 110.  

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we have 2s = 80.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that s = 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the number of gold coins, we add 30 to the number of silver coins: 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.



Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then reads for half that time, which is 1 hour. So each time he does this, he spends a total of 3 hours.

He does this routine 3 times a week, meaning he spends 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours per week on TV and reading.

Over 4 weeks, that adds up to 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

"Alright, let's figure this out!  

We know there are 700 bees total.  Let's say there are 'q' queen bees. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, there are 2q baby bees. And there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so that means there are 2 * (2q) = 4q worker bees.

Now we can set up an equation: q + 2q + 4q = 700

Combining like terms, we get 7q = 700.  

Dividing both sides by 7, we find q = 100.

That means there are 2 * 100 = 200 baby bees.

And finally, there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.

Let's say Brooke is 'b' years old, and Seth is 's' years old. We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so s = 2b.

In two years, they'll both be a couple of years older.  Their ages will add up to 28: (s + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Now we can use a little substitution. Since we know s = 2b, let's plug that into the second equation:

(2b + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Simplify that: 3b + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3b = 24

Divide both sides by 3: b = 8

So Brooke is 8 years old.  Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is 16.

"Alright, let's break this flamingo situation down:

* **Friday:** Sue starts with 18 pink flamingos.
* **Saturday:**  They take away 1/3 of the pink flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6. That leaves 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos. They then paint 6 white and put them back out.
* **Sunday:** They add another 18 pink flamingos, so now there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

So, on Sunday at noon, there are 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos. That means there are 30 - 6 = 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos.

*  Now the small pool has x - 16 gallons.
*  And the big pool has 2*x* - 16 gallons.

*  We know the big pool now has four times the water of the small pool: 2*x* - 16 = 4(x - 16)

**Job A:**

*  He earns $15 per hour and works 2000 hours a year, so his gross pay is $15 * 2000 = $30,000.
*  With a 20% tax rate, he'll pay $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000 in taxes.
*  His net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

**Job B:**

*  Job B pays a flat $42,000 per year.
*  He'll pay $6,000 in property taxes, leaving him with $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
*  Then, he pays 10% tax on that remaining amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600.
*  His net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

If two of the groups have the same number of students, let's call that number 'x'.  The smallest group has 10 fewer students than the others, so it has 'x - 10' students.

We know the total number of students is 200, so:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and twice as many chickens as cows.  To find the total number of legs, we need to figure out how many chickens and cows he has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos, for a total of 130 pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which is 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos.  She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos. That means Anna has 100 + 120 = 220 pesos.

Together, they have 130 + 220 = 350 pesos.

"Let's break this problem down.  If Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, we can think of that 12.8 hectares as representing 2/5 of his original land.

To find the whole amount, we can set up a proportion:

(2/5) * x = 12.8

Where 'x' is the original amount of land.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12.8 * (5/2) 
x = 32 hectares

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

First, find out how much energy the AC uses in a day: 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours.

Then, figure out how much energy it uses after the reduction: 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours.

Now, subtract to find the daily savings: 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours.

Finally, multiply that by 30 days to get the total savings: 4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours.

Convert that to kilowatt-hours: 135,000 watt-hours / 1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Joanne's Shortest Trees:** Joanne picked half as many apples from the shortest trees as the tallest trees, so she got 30 / 2 = 15 apples.

* **Sister's Tallest Trees:** Joanne's sister picked twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, meaning she picked 30 * 2 = 60 apples.

* **Sister's Shortest Trees:** The sister picked three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she picked 15 * 3 = 45 apples.

* **Sister's Total:**  The sister gathered a total of 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

* **Joanne's Total (Excluding Average):** Joanne picked 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

* **Joanne's Average Apples:** Since the sisters gathered 500 apples total, Joanne must have picked 500 - 105 = 395 apples.  Subtracting her apples from the tallest and shortest trees, she picked 395 - 45 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

We know there are 180 heads total and 304 bumps.  Camels have two humps, and dromedaries have one.  

Let's think: if all the animals were camels, we'd have 180 heads * 2 humps/camel = 360 humps. That's too many!  

This means there must be some dromedaries.  Let's say there are 'd' dromedaries. That means there are 180 - 'd' camels.

Now, the total humps are: 2 * (180 - 'd') + 'd' = 304

Simplifying that: 360 - 2'd' + 'd' = 304

Combining like terms: 360 - 'd' = 304

Subtracting 360 from both sides: - 'd' = -56

Finally, multiplying both sides by -1: 'd' = 56


There are **56** dromedaries in the herd.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to convert those yards to feet.  Since there are 3 feet in a yard, Billie's room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet long.

Now we know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet.  To find the width, we can use the formula: Area = length * width.

So, 360 square feet = 9 feet * width.  

Dividing both sides by 9 feet, we get a width of 40 feet.

Finally, the perimeter of a rectangle is found with: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

    * Swim: 10% faster than Jon's 40 minutes, so 40 * 0.10 = 4 minutes faster.  His swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.
    * Bike: 5 minutes longer than Jon's 80 minutes, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.
* **Jon's total time:** 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes
* **James' total time:** Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time was 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.  

If the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can think of it like this:

* Let 'x' represent the cost of the lot.
* The house costs 3x.

Together, they cost $120,000, so:

x + 3x = $120,000

Combining those 'x' terms:

4x = $120,000

To find out what 'x' is (the cost of the lot), we divide both sides by 4:

x = $30,000

Now, we know the lot costs $30,000.  To find the house price, we multiply that by 3:

3 * $30,000 = $90,000


$90,000

"Alright, let's break this down. Elvis wants to save $1125 in April.  He plans to save twice as much each day in the second half of the month compared to the first half.

*  April has 30 days, so that's 15 days in each half.

Let's say Elvis saves 'x' dollars each day in the first half.  In the second half, he'd save 2x dollars per day.

*  Total savings in the first half: 15x
*  Total savings in the second half: 15 * 2x = 30x
*  Total savings for the whole month: 15x + 30x = $1125

Combining like terms:

* 45x = $1125

Now, solve for x:

* x = $1125 / 45
* x = $25

So, Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half.  In the second half, he saves twice that amount:

"Let's figure this out!

Mack saw 50 birds on the first two days, then 120 birds on days four and five, 20 on day six, and 90 on day seven.  Don't forget he saw zero birds on day three.  

To find the average, we add up all the birds he saw (50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280) and then divide that number by the total number of days (7).

280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds per day.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

Diane starts with 20.  Then, she adds half the number to 20.  Let's call the mystery number ""n"". So, we have 20 + n/2.

Next, she divides that sum by 5: (20 + n/2) / 5

Then, she multiplies the result by 20 minus 12, which is 8: [(20 + n/2) / 5] * 8

Finally, we simplify: (160 + 4n) / 5


To get a final numerical answer, we need to know the value of ""n"".

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

The oven is 18 degrees hotter than it should be at 450 degrees. That means it's off by 4%.  To get 520 degrees, Maggie needs to set the oven to a temperature that will be 4% lower than the actual desired temperature.

Here's how to do that:

* **Let 'x' be the temperature Maggie should set.**
* **The actual temperature will be x + (0.04x) = 520**
* **1.04x = 520**
* **x = 520 / 1.04**

"Alright, let's break this down.  We know there are 4500 jelly beans total, and the colors have this funky relationship.

*  Let's say there are 'b' blue jelly beans.
*  Red jelly beans are 1% *fewer* than blue, so there are 0.99b red jelly beans.
*  Green jelly beans are 1% *more* than blue, so there are 1.01b green jelly beans.

Now we can set up an equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms:

2.99b = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99 to find 'b':

b ≈ 1505 blue jelly beans

* Red: 0.99 * 1505 ≈ 1490 red jelly beans
* Green: 1.01 * 1505 ≈ 1520 green jelly beans

"Hey there!  Let's break this triangle problem down.

"Alright, let's figure this out!  

Lee has 20 heads total, and each sheep has one head and each goose has one head.  

He also has 70 legs in total. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2.

Let's use a little algebra:

* Let 's' be the number of sheep
* Let 'g' be the number of geese

We know:

* s + g = 20 
* 4s + 2g = 70

We can solve for 's' (the number of sheep).  

Let me think...  

Aha!  If we solve the first equation for 'g', we get g = 20 - s.  

Now we can substitute that into the second equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Simplifying: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70

Combining like terms: 2s + 40 = 70

Subtracting 40 from both sides: 2s = 30

Finally, dividing both sides by 2: s = 15



There are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

First, we need to figure out how many people are going to the movies: Aiden plus his 12 friends plus the 7 they meet up with makes a total of 19 people.

Each seat holds two drinks and three snacks, so they need enough for 38 drinks (19 people * 2 drinks/person) and 57 snacks (19 people * 3 snacks/person).

That means they're buying a total of 95 items (38 drinks + 57 snacks).

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost is $190 (95 items * $2/item).

*  Together, all three houses need 250 cases: (x/2) + x + x = 250

*  Simplifying the equation: 2.5x = 250

*  Solving for x: x = 250 / 2.5 = 100

*  The third house needs x cases, so it needs 100 cases of shingles.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

First, figure out the Llesis family's hiking speed.  They hiked 5 miles per hour slower than half their driving speed, which is 50 mph / 2 = 25 mph. So their hiking speed was 25 mph - 5 mph = 20 mph.

Next, calculate the distance they covered while hiking. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 mph, meaning they hiked 1.5 hours * 20 mph = 30 miles.

Now, determine how long they spent driving. Their total trip was 6 hours, and they hiked for 1.5 hours, so they drove for 6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours.

Finally, calculate the driving distance. They drove at 50 mph for 4.5 hours, covering 50 mph * 4.5 hours = 225 miles.

To find the total distance to their vacation spot, add the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Ava and Emma are playing a video game, and they each get points for jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and having time left on the timer.  

* Ava beats Emma on enemies by 8 and berries by 3, but she's 4 seconds slower.

To figure out the difference in their scores, we need to think about how many points each action is worth:

* **Enemies:** 10 points each
* **Berries:** 5 points each
* **Timer:** 30 points per second

Let's set up the scores:

* **Emma's Score:** (Enemies * 10) + (Berries * 5) + (Timer * 30)
* **Ava's Score:** (Enemies + 8) * 10 + (Berries + 3) * 5 + (Timer - 4) * 30

Now we need to subtract Emma's score from Ava's score to find the difference.  It'll get a little messy with all the variables, but we can simplify it.  

After doing all the math, the difference in their scores is **-25**.

"Let's break this problem down:

*  Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, let's call that amount 'z'.
*  She uses the same amount of salt and sugar, let's call that amount 's'.
*  Oil is twice the amount of salt, so oil is 2s.

We know the total weight of the scrub is 10 ounces: z + z + s + s + 2s = 10

Simplifying the equation: 2z + 4s = 10

Since zest and fragrance are equal (z), and salt and sugar are equal (s), we can rewrite the equation: 2z + 4z = 10

Combining like terms: 6z = 10

Solving for z: z = 10/6 = 5/3 ounces

Now we know z (zest and fragrance) is 5/3 ounces.  Since salt and sugar are equal to z, they are also 5/3 ounces each.

Finally, oil is twice the amount of salt, so oil is 2 * (5/3) = 10/3 ounces.

*  Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

Together, they have 341 cards:  x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Let's simplify and solve for x:

* 7x + 12 = 341
* 7x = 329
* x = 47  (So PJ has 47 cards)

Now we can find how many cards Becca has:

* Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.



Becca has 153 Magic Cards.

"Let's break down Cindy's egg collection:

* **Blue eggs:** Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, which is 5 green eggs * 2 = 10 blue eggs.
* **Pink eggs:** She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 blue eggs - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
* **Yellow eggs:** Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, meaning she had 9 pink eggs / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Finally, add up all the colors: 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = 27 eggs.

"Let's figure out Milly's loss. 

First, the shipping cost is $0.35 per pound times 4 pounds, which is $1.40.  Then, there's $0.08 per mile times 20 miles, making the mileage cost $1.60.  That means the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

"Let's break down Boris's chocolate production:

* **Week 1:** 8,000 bars
* **Week 2:** Half of week 1, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
* **Week 3:** Three times week 1, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

To find out how much Boris produces in week 4, we need to figure out his total production for the month and subtract the amount from the first three weeks:

* **Total for weeks 1-3:** 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars
* **Week 4 production:** 50,000 (monthly total) - 36,000 (weeks 1-3) = 14,000 bars




**Answer:** Boris produces 14,000 bars in week 4.

"Let's break this down step by step:

* Pompei can lift a 1-inch mountain.
* Saskay can lift 12 times that, so Saskay can lift a 12 * 1 inch = 12-inch mountain.
* Kagiyami can lift 4 times what Saskay can, meaning Kagiyami lifts a 4 * 12 inch = 48-inch mountain.
* Finally, Naruto can lift 10 times what Kagiyami can, so Naruto lifts a 10 * 48 inch = 480-inch mountain.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.  

Tasha made $80 total, and we know she earned money from both lemonade and mowing lawns.  To figure out how much she made from lemonade, we need to figure out how much she made from mowing.

*  She mowed Joe's lawn some number of times, let's call that 'x'.
*  She mowed Kamala's lawn three times that amount, so 3x times.
*  She mowed Alba's lawn five times Joe's amount, so 5x times.

*  Joe paid her $6 per mowing, so she made 6x from Joe.
*  Kamala paid her 3 times Joe's rate, so 3 * 6x = 18x
*  Alba paid her 5 times Joe's rate, so 5 * 6x = 30x

*  Her total mowing earnings are 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x

*  To find her lemonade earnings, we subtract her mowing earnings from her total earnings: 80 - 54x 



Without knowing how many times she mowed Joe's lawn (the value of 'x'), we can't say for sure how much she made from lemonade.

* The hospital starts with 1000 beds and 1/5 are full, so that's 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds.
* Over two weeks, which is 14 days, they admit 50 patients per day, for a total of 14 * 50 = 700 patients.
*  That means there are now 200 + 700 = 900 occupied beds.
*  Finally,  1000 total beds - 900 occupied beds = 100 unoccupied beds.

"Robyn sends 16 emails a day.  Seven are work emails, and two-thirds of the rest are to family. One-third of the emails that are *not* work or to family are to her boyfriend. Let's figure this out!

First, find out how many emails aren't work emails: 16 total emails - 7 work emails = 9 emails.

Next, calculate how many emails are to family: (2/3) * 9 emails = 6 emails.

Now, determine how many emails are left: 9 emails - 6 emails = 3 emails.

Finally, find out how many emails are to her boyfriend: (1/3) * 3 emails = 1 email.

"Let's figure this out! 

If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we need to find out what 100% represents.  Think of it this way: 48 people is 120% (100% + 20%).  

To find 100%, we can set up a proportion:

120% / 48 people = 100% / x people

Cross-multiply and solve for x:

120 * x = 48 * 100
120x = 4800
x = 40

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

* Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'W' Pokemon.
* Stan caught 4 times that amount minus 13, so Stan caught (4W - 13) Pokemon.
* Alex caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan, so Alex caught (4W - 13) + 5 = (4W - 8) Pokemon.

Together they caught 339 Pokemon, so:

W + (4W - 13) + (4W - 8) = 339

Combining like terms:

9W - 21 = 339

Adding 21 to both sides:

9W = 360

Dividing both sides by 9:

W = 40

Now we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon.  

Stan caught 4 times that amount minus 13:

(4 * 40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147

So Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

"Let's figure this out! 

First, we need to find out how much Jamaar spent on the fruit he already bought:

* Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
* Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
* Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
* Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Adding those up, he spent $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

That means he has $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since each plum costs $0.25, he can buy $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums.

"Let's break this down:

* **Year 1:** The price goes up by 5% of $120, which is $6. So the price is now $126.
* **Year 2:**  Another 5% increase on $126 is $6.30, making the price $132.30.
* **Year 3:**  A 5% increase on $132.30 is $6.615, bringing the price to $138.915.

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $139.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

* Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, so a large one costs $12.
* She made $120 total, and we know each small one costs $4. 
* Let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Now we can set up an equation:

* Earnings from small stuffed animals: 2x * $4 = $8x
* Earnings from large stuffed animals: x * $12 = $12x
* Total earnings: $8x + $12x = $120

Combining like terms:

* $20x = $120

Solving for x:

* x = $120 / $20 = 6

Since she sold 2x small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"Alright, let's figure this out!

* A dwarf with bare hands mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
* With an iron pickaxe, they mine twice as much: 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
* A steel pickaxe lets them mine 50% more than the iron pickaxe, so that's 24 * 0.50 = 12 more pounds.  That means they mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.
*  With 40 dwarves using steel pickaxes, they mine a total of 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds per day.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

Marcus has a 50% chance of having a substitute teacher who won't collect homework.  

If his regular teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. That means there's a 60% chance she won't.

Even if no one gets an extension, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing the teacher his dog ate his homework.

So, to figure out the chances Marcus *has* to turn in his homework, we need to consider the opposite:

*  He *doesn't* have a substitute.
*  He *doesn't* get an extension.
*  He *doesn't* convince the teacher about the dog.

Let's calculate those odds:

*  60% (no extension) * 80% (no dog excuse) = 48%

That means there's a 48% chance Marcus has to turn in his homework.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Find the sale price:**  The watch was sold for 75% of the original price, so Mr. Rogers paid 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

* **Find the selling price:** Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch for 120% of what Mr. Rogers paid, so the friend paid 1.20 * $1500 = $1800.

* **Calculate the discount:** The friend paid $1800, and the original price was $2000, so the discount was $2000 - $1800 = $200.

* **Calculate the discount percentage:** The discount percentage is ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%.

If Sam gets 'x' feet, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet.  

Together, that's x + (x + 60) = 100 feet.

Simplifying the equation: 2x + 60 = 100

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find the area of each wall:

* The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so each is 40 square feet (5 x 8 = 40).

Now, let's add up the area of all the walls:

*  (80 sq ft x 2) + (40 sq ft x 2) = 160 sq ft + 80 sq ft = 240 sq ft

Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we'll need 12 gallons (240 sq ft / 20 sq ft/gallon = 12 gallons).

*  Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs in total, with Camden painting 12 more than Sarah.  Let's say Sarah painted 'y' eggs, meaning Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.

*  We know y + (y + 12) = 30

*  Combining like terms: 2y + 12 = 30

*  Subtracting 12 from both sides: 2y = 18

*  Dividing both sides by 2: y = 9 (Sarah painted 9 eggs)

*  Camden painted y + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

*  We also know that 2x (Arnold and Madeline's eggs) + 30 (Camden and Sarah's eggs) = 56 total eggs.

*  So, 2x + 30 = 56

"Alright, let's figure this out!

Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them in boxes of 8.  That means he'll need 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at a certain speed and 1 mile on the sidewalk at twice that speed.  We're given that she spends 40 minutes on the beach.

To find her speed on the beach, we can use the formula:

*Speed = Distance / Time*

So, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed there is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now we can find the time she spends on the sidewalk:

*Time = Distance / Speed*

Time on the sidewalk is 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

Finally, to get the total time for her 3-mile walk, we add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:

40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Let's break this down.  Donny needs his water to be at least 40 degrees.  He mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of water from the mystery mug.  This means the mixed water has to be at least 40 degrees.

Here's how to figure out the minimum temperature of the mystery mug:

* **Total water:** 4 ounces + 1 ounce = 5 ounces
* **Total temperature needed:** 40 degrees * 5 ounces = 200 degrees
* **Temperature from the 33-degree mug:** 33 degrees * 4 ounces = 132 degrees
* **Temperature needed from the mystery mug:** 200 degrees - 132 degrees = 68 degrees



The second mug needs to be at least 68 degrees.

"Alright, let's break this down. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so he ate 18 scoops.  

Now, it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. That means it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops.  

So, to make 1 scoop, it takes 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes.

"Alright, let's break this rope problem down!

*  We know the red rope is four times as long as the blue rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
*  Together, all three ropes measure 37 centimeters.

Let's use some variables to make this easier:

*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is 4 * (y - 7) centimeters long.

Now we can set up an equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Let's solve for 'y':

* y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
* 6y - 35 = 37
* 6y = 72
* y = 12

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, we can find the red rope's length:

* Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20


The red rope is 20 centimeters long.

* **Day 2:** He added 10 more White Oak trees (20 + 10 = 30) and planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine than Day 1, which is (1/4) * 40 = 10 more.  So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine on Day 2.

* **Total:**  Over the two days, Mr. Julius planted 30 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 80 trees.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we find out how many fish have red stripes: 66 fish / 3 = 22 fish.

Then, we see how many fish are left after taking out the red striped ones: 66 fish - 22 fish = 44 fish.

Next, we calculate how many of those remaining fish have blue stripes: 44 fish * (5/11) = 20 fish.

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes: 22 fish + 20 fish = 42 fish.


So the answer is 42.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

First, we need to figure out how many jelly beans the jar could hold.  The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches by 15 inches, so that's 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.  

Since they don't pack the jelly beans perfectly, we need to account for that 80% efficiency.  So, the jar can hold 540 * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches of jelly beans.

Now, each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, so we can fit 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans in there.

Tim thinks 30% of those are red, so he'd guess there are 2880 * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can think of it like this:

*  Let the shorter piece be 'x' feet long.
*  The longer piece is then '4x' feet long.

Together, they make up the whole board, which is 40 feet. So:

x + 4x = 40

"Let's break this down:

* Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
* He's making 4 gallons for the party, so that's 4 cups of juice.
* Since 6 lemons make 1 cup of juice, he'll need 4 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons for the party lemonade.
* Allen wants a gallon that's twice as tart, meaning he needs twice the lemon juice. That's 1 cup * 2 = 2 cups of juice.
*  For 2 cups of juice, Tim needs 2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons.
*  In total, Tim needs 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

* **Year 1:** The boat loses 30% of its value, which is $9000 * 0.30 = $2700.  So it's worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

* **Year 2:**  Another 30% depreciation on $6300 is $6300 * 0.30 = $1890. That means it's worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

* **Year 3:** This time it loses 20% of its value, which is $4410 * 0.20 = $882.  So the final value is $4410 - $882 = $3528.
