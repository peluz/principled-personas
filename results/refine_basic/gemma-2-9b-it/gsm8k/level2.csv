* **Define variables:**

   * Let 'w' represent Dana's walking speed.
   * Let 'r' represent Dana's running speed.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**

   * We know r = 4w (running speed is four times walking speed)
   * We also know that skipping speed is half her running speed, and this is given as 3 miles per hour. So, r/2 = 3.

* **Solve for 'r' (running speed):**

   * From r/2 = 3, we get r = 6 miles per hour.

* **Solve for 'w' (walking speed):**

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step using our understanding of proportions and unit conversions.

First, we need to figure out how much water the boat takes on per second.  Since it takes on 2 liters for every 10 feet rowed, we can express this as a rate:

2 liters / 10 feet

Next, we need to find out how many feet Julia rows in total. We know she takes 64 seconds to reach the shore.  We can use her rowing speed to calculate this:

*  She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so her speed is 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.
*  Over 64 seconds, she rows 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.

Now we can use the rate we established earlier to find the total amount of water taken on:

*  For every 10 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters.
*  Over 80 feet, the boat takes on (2 liters / 10 feet) * 80 feet = 16 liters.

"Let's break down this lumber profit problem step-by-step:

First, we need to figure out the new prices of the lumber after the 50% increase.  

* The 2x4 boards originally cost $10 each, so a 50% increase is $10 * 0.50 = $5.  Their new price is $10 + $5 = $15 each.

* The 4x4 boards originally cost $16 each, so a 50% increase is $16 * 0.50 = $8. Their new price is $16 + $8 = $24 each.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:

*  10 2x4 boards * $15/board = $150
*  5 4x4 boards * $24/board = $120

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, subtract the original cost of the lumber to find the profit:

* $270 (revenue) - $180 (cost) = $90 profit

"Let's break this problem down using algebra:

* Let 'p' represent the cost of one pepper.

* A watermelon costs 3 times the price of a pepper, so a watermelon costs 3p.

* An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, meaning an orange costs 3p - $5.

* Dillon buys 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.  We can express the total cost (T) as:

T = (4 * 3p) + (20 * p) + (10 * (3p - 5))

* We know each pepper costs $15, so p = $15.  Substitute this value into the equation:

T = (4 * 3 * $15) + (20 * $15) + (10 * (3 * $15 - $5))

* Simplify and solve for T:

T = $180 + $300 + (10 * $40)
T = $180 + $300 + $400
T = $880



**Therefore, Dillon will spend a total of $880.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

First, we need to figure out the total time the doctors spend with patients in hours.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 24 minutes per patient times 500 patients equals 12,000 minutes.  Dividing 12,000 minutes by 60 minutes per hour gives us 200 hours.

The doctors earn $150 per hour, so their total earnings are 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The hospital charges patients $200 per hour, so their total revenue is 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the doctors' earnings from the hospital's revenue: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

* **Formulate equations:**

   * We know b = 2q (twice as many babies as queens)

   * Finally, q + b + w = 700 (the total number of bees)

* **Solve for 'w' (the number of worker bees):**

   1. Substitute '2q' for 'b' in the second equation: w = 2(2q) = 4q
   2. Substitute '2q' for 'b' and '4q' for 'w' in the third equation: q + 2q + 4q = 700
   3. Combine like terms: 7q = 700
   4. Isolate 'q' by dividing both sides by 7: q = 100
   5. Now that we know q = 100, find 'b': b = 2q = 2 * 100 = 200

"Ah, a classic example of exponential growth!  

Here's how to tackle this problem:

The price of the marbles increases by 20% every two months. This means the price is multiplied by a factor of 1.20 every two months.  

Since there are 18 two-month periods in 36 months, the final price will be the original price multiplied by 1.20 raised to the power of 18:

$20 * (1.20)^18  ≈ $201.25

"Let's break this problem down systematically.  

Let Seth's current age be represented by the variable 's' and Brooke's current age by 'b'.  We are given two key pieces of information:

1. **""Seth is twice as old as Brooke""**: This translates to the equation s = 2b.

2. **""In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28""**: This gives us the equation (s + 2) + (b + 2) = 28.

Now we have a system of two equations:

* s = 2b
* s + b + 4 = 28

We can solve for 's' (Seth's age) using substitution.  Substitute the first equation (s = 2b) into the second equation:

2b + b + 4 = 28

Combine like terms:

3b + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3b = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

b = 8

Now that we know Brooke is 8 years old, we can substitute that back into either of the original equations to find Seth's age. Let's use s = 2b:

s = 2 * 8

s = 16



Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"Let's break down this relay race!

Team 1's consistency is their strength.  Each of their runners completes the 400-meter leg in a steady 55 seconds.  That means their total time is a straightforward calculation: 4 runners * 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

Team 2's strategy is a bit more dynamic.  Their first runner takes 60 seconds, but each subsequent runner shaves 3 seconds off their time.  This gives us:

* Runner 1: 60 seconds
* Runner 2: 57 seconds
* Runner 3: 54 seconds
* Runner 4: 51 seconds

Adding those times together, Team 2's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The difference in their times is 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds. 


Therefore, Team 1 wins by 2 seconds.

"Let's break down this probability problem.

First, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a standard six-sided die. There are three favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of a total of six possible outcomes.  So, the probability is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2.

Next, consider the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.  There are three even numbers on a die (2, 4, and 6). The probability of rolling one even number is 3/6, or 1/2.  Since the die rolls are independent events, the probability of rolling another even number after the first is also 1/2.  To get the probability of both events happening, we multiply: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Finally, to find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

Converting this to a percentage, we get (1/4) * 100% = 25%.

We can solve for 'r' using a substitution method:

1. **Substitute** the second equation into the first equation:
   3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

2. **Simplify and solve for 'r':**
   3r + 5r + 10 = 42
   8r + 10 = 42
   8r = 32
   r = 4



Therefore, Jerry has **4** red chickens.

"To determine the time Gary spends walking, we first need to find the total distance of the park's perimeter.  The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides.  

In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.  Therefore, the perimeter is:

2 * (6 miles + 1.5 miles) = 2 * 7.5 miles = 15 miles

Now that we know the distance, we can calculate the time it takes Gary to walk the entire perimeter.  We know his speed is 3 miles per hour.  

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step using algebraic equations.

Let  's' represent the current amount of water in the small pool.

* Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, it had 2s gallons.

* Both pools leak at 4 gallons per minute, so in the last 4 minutes, each pool lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* The big pool now has 2s - 16 gallons, and we know this is four times the amount in the small pool: 2s - 16 = 4s

* Solving for 's', we get: 16 = 2s,  so s = 8.



**Answer:** The small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"Let's break this problem down using algebra:

* Let Zack's age be represented by the variable 'z'.
* Harriet's age is half of Zack's age, so Harriet's age is z/2.
* Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age is 3*(z/2) = 3z/2.

We know Harriet is currently 21, so z/2 = 21.  Solving for z, we get z = 42 (Zack's age).

Now we can find Adrian's age: 3z/2 = 3*42/2 = 63.

In three years:

* Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
* Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.
* Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.

The average age of the three in three years is (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 45 years.

*  Yuri's score is (1/2)*68 + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 points.
* Brianna's score is 68 + 17 = 85 points.

* The total score of all four students is 68 + 44 + 85 + x = 197 + x

* We are given that the total score is 251 points, so 197 + x = 251

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Heating to 400 degrees:** The oil takes 40% longer to reach 400 degrees than it does to reach 300 degrees.  Since it takes 20 minutes to reach 300 degrees, the extra time is 20 * 0.40 = 8 minutes.  Therefore, heating to 400 degrees takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

* **Cooking time:** The cooking time is 5 minutes less than the heating time, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

* **Total time:**  Adding the heating and cooking times, the total time is 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

"Let 'b' represent the number of boys.  We know:

* Girls: 3b
* Nongendered: (1/10)b
* Total: b + 3b + (1/10)b = 30

Combining like terms:

Multiply both sides by (10/14):

* b = 21.43 (approximately)

Since we can't have fractions of children, we'll round to the nearest whole number.  

* b = 21

Now we can find the total:

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Start with the total:** There were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.
* **Figure out who left:**  One-fourth of the party left, which is (1/4) * 40 = 10 people.
* **Determine the number of women remaining:**  We know 22 men stayed. Since 10 people left in total,  the number of women who stayed is 15 - (number of women who left).  

To find the number of women who left, we can subtract the number of men who stayed from the total number who left: 10 - 22 = -12. This means more men left than women.

* **Calculate the final number of women:**  15 women - (-12) = 27 women



**Therefore, there are 27 women left at the party.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Ice Cube Impact:** Each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools it by 13 degrees, we need 65 degrees / 13 degrees/ice cube = 5 ice cubes.  This means the ice cubes weaken the coffee by 5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters/ice cube = 60 milliliters.

* **Cream's Contribution:** The cream adds 15 milliliters of liquid, directly weakening the coffee by that amount.

* **Total Weakening:**  The total weakening is the sum of the ice cube's effect and the cream's effect: 60 milliliters + 15 milliliters = 75 milliliters.



**Answer:** 75 milliliters

Let  'x' represent the number of students in each of the two larger groups.  Since the smallest group has 10 fewer students than the larger groups, it has 'x - 10' students.

The total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms, we get:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

"To determine Karan's monthly payment, we first need to calculate the total interest she'll accrue.  

Interest is calculated as: (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100

In this case:

* Principal = $3650
* Rate = 10%
* Time = 5 months

So, the interest is: ($3650 * 10 * 5) / 100 = $1825

Next, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan needs to repay:

Total amount = Principal + Interest = $3650 + $1825 = $5475

Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find her monthly payment:

Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months = $5475 / 5 = $1095

"Ah, a classic ratio problem!  Let's break it down.

The ratio 5:6 tells us that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  We know their combined total is 165 popsicles.  To find out how many more popsicles Sam has, we need to figure out the value of one share in this ratio.

Think of it like this: the ratio represents 5 + 6 = 11 total shares.  Since they have 165 popsicles altogether, each share is worth 165 / 11 = 15 popsicles.

Now we can easily determine how many popsicles each person has:

* Betty: 5 shares * 15 popsicles/share = 75 popsicles
* Sam: 6 shares * 15 popsicles/share = 90 popsicles

Finally, the difference is 90 - 75 = 15 popsicles.

"Let's break down this energy savings problem step-by-step:

1. **Daily energy consumption:** The air conditioner uses 900 watts for 8 hours, so its daily consumption is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours.

2. **Reduced energy consumption:**  After reducing usage by 5 hours, the daily consumption becomes 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours.

3. **Daily savings:** The daily energy savings are 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours.

4. **Monthly savings:** Over 30 days, the total energy savings are 4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours.

5. **Converting to kilowatt-hours:**  To express this in kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000: 135,000 watt-hours / 1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours.

"Let's break this problem down using algebra:

* Let 'c' represent the number of corns Allan has.
* Let 'n' represent the number of cannolis Allan has.

We know:

*  c = 2n  (There are twice as many corns as cannolis)
*  n = 40 (Allan initially has 40 cannolis)
*  c = n + 20 (Allan buys 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns)

Now we can solve for 'c':

1. Substitute the value of 'n' from the second equation into the first equation: c = 2 * 40 = 80

2. Substitute the value of 'n' from the second equation into the third equation: c = 40 + 20 = 60

3.  We now have two equations:
    * c = 80

"Let's break down this problem:

* We know 1% of the candles are expected to explode.
*  5% of the candles that *do* explode also have the wet dog scent.

To find the number of candles that meet both criteria, we need to consider the intersection of these two events.  This is a case of conditional probability.

The probability of a candle exploding *and* smelling like wet dog is:

P(explode and smelly) = P(explode) * P(smelly | explode)

Where P(smelly | explode) is the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog *given* that it explodes.

Plugging in our values:

P(explode and smelly) = 0.01 * 0.05 = 0.0005

"Ah, a classic geometry problem!  Let's break it down.  

We know the area of a rectangle is found by multiplying length and width:  Area = length * width.  We're given the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards, which is 9 feet).  

Let's plug those values into our formula and solve for the width:

360 square feet = 9 feet * width
width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
width = 40 feet

Now that we have both the length and width, we can find the perimeter.  The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet

"Let's break this problem down using set theory.

*  Let D represent the set of students allergic to dairy.
*  Let P represent the set of students allergic to peanuts.

We know:

*  |D| = 9 (9 students are allergic to dairy)
*  |P| = 6 (6 students are allergic to peanuts)
*  |D ∩ P| = 3 (3 students are allergic to both)

To find the number of students not allergic to either, we can use the following formula:

|D' ∩ P'| = |Universal Set| - |D ∪ P|

Where:

* |D' ∩ P'| represents the set of students not allergic to either dairy or peanuts.
* |Universal Set| = 32 (the total number of students)
* |D ∪ P| represents the set of students allergic to either dairy or peanuts.

We can calculate |D ∪ P| as follows:

|D ∪ P| = |D| + |P| - |D ∩ P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, we can plug the values into our original formula:

|D' ∩ P'| = 32 - 12 = 20

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let 'x' represent the number of guests.

* **Venue 1 Cost:**  The cost at Venue 1 is a fixed $200 plus $5 per guest for food, so the total cost is represented by the expression 200 + 5x.

* **Venue 2 Cost:** Venue 2 charges a flat $25 per guest, including food, so the total cost is 25x.

To find the point where the costs are equal, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, we solve for 'x':

1. Subtract 5x from both sides: 200 = 20x
2. Divide both sides by 20: x = 10


Therefore, Mark needs **10** guests for the two venues to cost the same.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.

Let  *B* represent the number of insects Bodhi found, *D* represent the number David found, and *L* represent the number Lily found. We're given the following information:

*  *L* + *D* + *B* = 43 
*  *L* = *D* + 7
*  *D* = *B* / 2

We can use substitution to solve for *L*.  Since we know *L* = *D* + 7, we can substitute (*D* + 7) for *L* in the first equation:

(*D* + 7) + *D* + *B* = 43

Simplifying:

2*D* + *B* + 7 = 43

2*D* + *B* = 36

Now, substitute *B* / 2 for *D* in the equation:

2(*B* / 2) + *B* = 36

*B* + *B* = 36

2*B* = 36

*B* = 18

Now that we know *B* = 18, we can find *D*:

*D* = *B* / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

"To maximize popsicle sticks within Frederick's budget, we need to analyze the cost-effectiveness of each wood type. 

A 2x4 yields 200 sticks for $4, resulting in a cost per stick of $0.02.  

A 2x8 yields 400 sticks for $6, resulting in a cost per stick of $0.015.

Since the 2x8 offers a lower cost per stick, Frederick should prioritize purchasing 2x8 lumber.  

With a budget of $24, he can purchase $24 / $6 per 2x8 = 4 2x8s.

"Let's break this problem down using algebra.

Let Jame's current age be represented by the variable 'j' and his cousin's current age be 'c'.

We know:

*  j + 5 = 27  (Jame will be 27 in 5 years)
*  c + 8 = 2(j + 8) - 5 (In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age)

Now we can solve for 'j' in the first equation:

* j = 27 - 5
* j = 22

Substitute this value of 'j' into the second equation:

* c + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5
* c + 8 = 2(30) - 5
* c + 8 = 60 - 5
* c + 8 = 55
* c = 55 - 8
* c = 47

Finally, to find the age difference, subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age:

* 47 - 22 = 25

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let 'x' represent the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.  Since he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half, he'll save 2x each day during that time.

The total savings for the first half of the month are 15x, and the total savings for the second half are 30(2x) = 60x.  

We know his total savings goal for the month is $1125, so we can set up the equation:

15x + 60x = 1125

Combining like terms:

75x = 1125

Dividing both sides by 75:

x = 15

Therefore, Elvis saves $15 each day in the first half of April.  In the second half, he saves twice that amount, or $30 per day.

"Let's break down this hydration problem step-by-step:

First, we need to determine the total calories burned.  Hannah burns 500 calories per hour during aerobics for 2 hours, totaling 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.  

Then, she burns 600 calories per hour running for 1 hour, resulting in 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

Adding these together, her total calorie expenditure is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Finally, we know she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.  Therefore, she needs 1600 / 200 * 100 = 800 ml of water.

"Let's break this problem down systematically.

Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.  We know:

* Red jelly beans: 0.99b 
* Green jelly beans: 1.01b

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so:

0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms:

2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b':

b = 4500 / 2.99 
b ≈ 1505

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

* Red: 0.99 * 1505 ≈ 1490
* Green: 1.01 * 1505 ≈ 1520

Finally, the difference between green and red jelly beans is:

1520 - 1490 = 30

"To find the total cost, we need to determine the price of a single apple and a single orange.

*  Four apples cost $5.20, so one apple costs $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

*  Three oranges cost $3.30, so one orange costs $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now we can calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:

* 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50
* 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50

Finally, add the cost of the apples and oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

"To determine the time it takes Bob to dig the hole, we first need to find the volume of the hole.  The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

In this case:

* Length = 6 feet
* Width = 4 feet
* Depth = 3 feet

Therefore, the volume of the hole is 6 * 4 * 3 = 72 cubic feet.

Since Bob takes 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth, it will take him 72 * 3 = 216 seconds to dig the entire hole.

"Let's calculate the total cost of Bill's truck:

* **Leather seats:** The leather seats cost one-third the price of the king cab, which is $7500 / 3 = $2500.
* **Running boards:** The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2500 - $500 = $2000.
* **Total extra features cost:** Adding up the cost of all the extra features, we get $7500 + $2500 + $2000 + $1500 = $13500.
* **Total truck cost:**  Finally, we add the base price of the truck to the cost of the extra features: $30000 + $13500 = $43500.



**Therefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43500.**

"Let's break this down step-by-step.  

First, calculate Tim's raise: 5% of $20,000 is (5/100) * $20,000 = $1,000.

Next, add the raise to his original salary: $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

Now, determine the value of his bonus: half his new monthly salary is $21,000 / 2 = $10,500.

Finally, add his new monthly salary and bonus to find his total monthly earnings: $21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500.

To calculate his yearly earnings, multiply his total monthly earnings by 12: $31,500 * 12 = $378,000.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically:

* Let 'x' represent the total sales from green hats in the first month.
* We know red hat sales were half the amount of green hat sales, so red hat sales were x/2.
* Total sales in the first month are x + x/2 = 1.5x
* Sales in the second month were 3/4 of the first month's sales, so they were (3/4) * 1.5x = 1.125x
* Total sales over two months are 1.5x + 1.125x = 2.625x
* We also know that red hat sales in the first month were $400, so x/2 = $400.
* Solving for x, we get x = $800.
*  Therefore, total sales over two months are 2.625 * $800 = $2100.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically:

* Let 'r' represent the cooking time for the rice (in minutes).
* Pork took 20 minutes longer than rice, so its cooking time is 'r + 20'.
* Beans took half the time of rice and pork combined, so their cooking time is (r + r + 20) / 2 = (2r + 20) / 2 = r + 10.

The total cooking time is the sum of all three: r + (r + 20) + (r + 10) = 3r + 30

We know rice took 30 minutes to cook, so r = 30.  

Substitute this value back into the total cooking time equation: 3(30) + 30 = 90 + 30 = 120 minutes.

Solving for C:

C = 68 - 7
C = 61

Now that we know the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies, we can find the total number of cookies:

* **Heartworm Check:**  The heartworm check represents 60% of the entire bill.  Let 'x' be the total bill.  We know 0.60x = cost of heartworm check.

* **Total Bill:** The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check: $40 + 0.60x = x

* **Solving for x:**  Subtract $40 from both sides: 0.60x = x - $40.  Then, subtract 0.60x from both sides: 0 = 0.40x - $40.  Add $40 to both sides: $40 = 0.40x. Finally, divide both sides by 0.40 to find x: $40 / 0.40 = $100.

* **Change:** John brought $125 and the bill was $100, so he has $125 - $100 = $25 left.

"Let's break down the cost of this fruit crate:

* **Bananas:** Each banana costs twice the price of an apple, which is $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.
* **Oranges:** Oranges are three times the price of a banana, so they cost $1.00 * 3 = $3.00 each.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:

* **Bananas:** 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* **Apples:** 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* **Oranges:** 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

Finally, add up the costs of all the fruits:

* **Total crate price:** $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00 



**Therefore, the price of the crate of fruit is $32.00.**

* **Tom's Points:** Tom has 30 fewer points than Betty, meaning he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

* **Marta's Points:** Marta collected three times the amount Tom earned, so she has 35 * 3 = 105 points.

* **Total Class Points:**  Adding up everyone's points, we get 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

"Let's break this problem down using algebra:

* Let 'C' represent the number of marbles Cal has.
* Let 'S' represent the number of marbles Sean has.
* Let 'Ca' represent the number of marbles Carl has.

We know:

* S = 56 (Sean's marbles)
* Ca = 4S (Carl has four times as many as Sean)
* S = C/2 (Sean has half as many as Cal)

Now we can substitute to find the number of marbles Cal has:

* 56 = C/2
* C = 56 * 2
* C = 112

Next, we can find Carl's marbles:

* Ca = 4 * 56
* Ca = 224

Finally, to find the combined total of Carl and Cal's marbles:

* Ca + C = 224 + 112 = 336 



Therefore, Carl and Cal have a combined total of 336 marbles.

"Let's break down this sticker-button trade step by step.

* **Small Stickers to Large Buttons:**  Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers, which is 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, these 27 stickers are equivalent to 27 small buttons.  We can trade these for 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

* **Large Stickers to Large Buttons:** Lorraine trades 50% of her 40 large stickers, which is 0.50 * 40 = 20 large stickers.  Each large sticker is worth three small stickers, so these 20 large stickers are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.  We can trade these 60 small stickers for 60 / 3 = 20 large buttons.

* **Large Stickers to Small Stickers:** Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers remaining.  These can be traded for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

"Let's break down this arcade spending problem step-by-step:

* **Time Conversion:** First, we need to convert the 4 hours of playtime into minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

* **Individual Playtime:**
    * Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter.
    * The two weaker players play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter.
    * The stronger player plays for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

* **Quarters Used:**
    * Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
    * The weaker players each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters.
    * The stronger player uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

* **Total Quarters:**  Adding up the quarters used by everyone: 12 + (24 * 2) + 8 = 68 quarters.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

Let  'z' represent the number of ounces of citrus zest (and fragrance since they are equal).  Let 's' represent the number of ounces of salt and sugar (also equal).  Since oil is twice the amount of salt, we can express it as '2s'.

Now, we know the total weight of the scrub is 10 ounces.  This gives us the equation:

z + z + s + s + 2s = 10

Simplifying the equation:

2z + 4s = 10

We can substitute 'z' for 's' since they are equal:

2s + 4s = 10

Combining like terms:

6s = 10

Dividing both sides by 6:

s = 10/6 = 5/3

Since oil is 2s, we have:

Oil = 2 * (5/3) = 10/3 ounces.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using algebraic representation.

Let  'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.  

* Smendrick has 3 times the amount PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms: 7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7: x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find Becca's cards:

Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"Let's represent students good at math as set M and students good at English as set E.  We know:

* |M| = 5 (5 students are good at math only)
* |E| = 8 (8 students are good at English only)
* |M ∪ E| = 20 (Total students)

To find the total number of students good at math, we use the formula:

|M ∪ E| = |M| + |E| - |M ∩ E|

We need to find |M ∩ E|, the number of students good at both.  Substituting the known values:

20 = 5 + 8 - |M ∩ E|

Solving for |M ∩ E|:

|M ∩ E| = 5 + 8 - 20 = -7

"Let's break down this age puzzle step-by-step.

*  Let your brother's age be represented by the variable 'b'.
*  Since you are three years younger than your brother, your age is 'b - 3'.
*  You are two years older than your sister, so your sister's age is 'b - 3 - 2' which simplifies to 'b - 5'.
*  Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age, meaning her age is '3b - 1'.

Now, we know the sum of all your ages is 87.  We can express this mathematically:

b + (b - 3) + (b - 5) + (3b - 1) = 87

Combining like terms:

6b - 9 = 87

Adding 9 to both sides:

6b = 96

Dividing both sides by 6:

b = 16

Now that we know your brother's age (b = 16), we can find your age:

y = b - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13




Therefore, you are 13 years old.

*  *S* = *A* + 25
*  *A* = *F* - 12

Our goal is to find *F*.  We can use substitution to solve for it.

First, substitute the second equation (*S* = *A* + 25) into the first equation:

(*A* + 25) + *A* + *F* = 85

Simplify:

2*A* + *F* + 25 = 85

"To figure this out, we need to think about the material usage per mask type.

* **Small masks:** Jo uses 2 yards of material for every 4 small masks, meaning she uses 0.5 yards per small mask (2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards/mask).

* **Large masks:** She uses 2.25 yards for every 3 large masks, meaning she uses 0.75 yards per large mask (2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards/mask).

Now, let's calculate the material needed for each type:

* **Small masks:** 20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards
* **Large masks:** 8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards

Finally, add the material needed for both types: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

"Let's break this problem down using algebra:

* Let 'j' represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
* Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey, so Jason carried 2j balls.
* Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * (2j) = 4j balls.

Together, they carried 7 balls: j + 2j + 4j = 7

Combining like terms: 7j = 7

Dividing both sides by 7: j = 1

Since Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried 2 * 1 = 2 balls, and Jordan carried 4 * 1 = 4 balls. 


Therefore, the coach brought a total of 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls to practice.

"Let's break down this pirate treasure puzzle:

*  The pirates dug a total of 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes in the first three days.
*  They filled in 2 holes, leaving them with 31 - 2 = 29 holes.
*  The problem states there were four times as many holes at the end of the third day as there were at the end of the first day.  

To find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day, we need to figure out how many holes they had at the end of the first day.  Let 'x' represent the number of holes at the end of the first day.

We know:

* 4x = 29  (Four times the number of holes at the end of day 1 equals the number of holes at the end of day 3)

Solving for x:

* x = 29 / 4 
* x = 7.25

Since we can't have parts of holes, this problem has an inconsistency. It's impossible to have four times as many holes at the end of the third day as there were at the end of the first day given the information provided.

* Collins received 'x + 15' corn chips.

We know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of what each person received: x + x + (x + 15) = Total corn chips

Simplifying the equation: 3x + 15 = Total corn chips

We are given that x = 70 (Amora and Lainey's share).  Substitute this value into the equation:

3(70) + 15 = Total corn chips

210 + 15 = Total corn chips

Total corn chips = 225

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as A, S, and W respectively. We are given the following system of equations:

* A + S + W = 339 
* A = S + 5
* S = 4W - 13

To find Stan's Pokemon count (S), we can use substitution.  

First, substitute the second equation (A = S + 5) into the first equation:

(S + 5) + S + W = 339

Simplify:

2S + W = 334

Now, substitute the third equation (S = 4W - 13) into the simplified equation:

2(4W - 13) + W = 334

Expand and solve for W:

8W - 26 + W = 334
9W = 360
W = 40

Now that we know W (Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon), substitute it back into the equation S = 4W - 13:

S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147



Therefore, Stan caught **147** Pokemon.

"To find the total distance between the bird's homes, we need to consider the southward and northward journeys separately.

* **Southward Journey:** The bird flies 30 miles per hour for 10 hours, covering 300 miles (30 * 10 = 300).  Then, it flies another 22 miles per hour for 5 hours, covering 110 miles (22 * 5 = 110). The total southward distance is 410 miles (300 + 110 = 410).

* **Northward Journey:** The bird flies 18 miles per hour for 2 hours, covering 36 miles (18 * 2 = 36).

* **Net Distance:**  To find the final distance, we subtract the northward journey from the southward journey: 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically:

* Let 'R' represent the number of cherries Robert has.
* Let 'J' represent the number of cherries Jerry has.
* Let 'Ri' represent the number of cherries Richard has.

We know:

* R + J + Ri = 60  (The total number of cherries)
* R = Ri + 10  (Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard)
* R = 30 (Robert has 30 cherries)

Now we can substitute to solve for J:

1.  Since R = 30, we can substitute that into the second equation: 30 = Ri + 10
2.  Solving for Ri: Ri = 20
3.  Substitute Ri = 20 and R = 30 into the first equation: 30 + J + 20 = 60
4.  Combine like terms: 50 + J = 60
5.  Subtract 50 from both sides: J = 10

Therefore, Jerry has 10 cherries.  

To find the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries, subtract: 30 - 10 = 20

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

First, we need to find the total number of cookies brought to the wedding.  There were 100 guests, each with 15 cookies, so that's 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

Next, the bride donated half of the cookies to the church, which is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Finally, since each person in the church received 15 cookies, the number of people in the church is 750 / 15 = 50.

"Ah, a classic ratio problem!  Let's break it down.

Think of the watermelon as a whole, representing 100%.  Since each adult gets twice the slice of a child, we can set up a ratio:

*  Adult slice : Child slice = 2 : 1

This means for every 2 slices an adult gets, a child gets 1.  

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we need to figure out what portion of the 100% the adult's 2 slices represent.

*  There are 3 parts in total (2 adult parts + 1 child part).
*  Each adult part represents 100% / 3 = 33.33% (approximately).

*  Since each adult gets 2 parts, they receive 2 * 33.33% = 66.67% of the watermelon.




**Answer:** 66.67%

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Cost per session:** The studio rental is a fixed cost of $25, and each student adds $1.50 to the cost. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 + (10 students * $1.50/student) = $40.

* **Weekly earnings:** The studio rents the space 3 days a week, so the weekly earnings are $40/session * 3 sessions/week = $120.

* **Monthly earnings:** Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the monthly earnings are $120/week * 4 weeks/month = $480.



Therefore, the dance studio's expected earnings in a month are **$480**.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

First, we need to find the number of female porcupines.  Since they represent 3/5 of the total population, we calculate (3/5) * 50 = 30 female porcupines.

Next, we determine the number of babies born in a year. Each female gives birth to 4 babies per month, so in a year (12 months), they'll have 30 females * 4 babies/female * 12 months/year = 1440 babies.

Finally, to find the total porcupine population after a year, we add the original population to the number of babies: 50 original porcupines + 1440 babies = 1490 porcupines. 



**Therefore, there will be 1490 porcupines in the park after a year.**

"Ah, a classic volume and cost calculation! Let's break it down.

First, we need to find the pool's volume.  We know the width is 14 feet, the length is 25 feet, and the depth is 4 feet.  The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which a pool is) is length times width times height.  

So, the volume is 14 feet * 25 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

Now, the pool company tells us we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.  

Therefore, the pool needs 1400 cubic feet * 5.9 = 8260 gallons of water.

Finally, the cost is $0.10 per gallon, so filling the pool will cost 8260 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $826.00.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

The price of carrots increases by 5% each year.  This means we're dealing with compound growth. Here's how to calculate the price after three years:

* **Year 1:**  A 5% increase on $120 is (0.05) * $120 = $6.  The new price is $120 + $6 = $126.

* **Year 2:**  A 5% increase on $126 is (0.05) * $126 = $6.30. The new price is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

* **Year 3:** A 5% increase on $132.30 is (0.05) * $132.30 = $6.615. The new price is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let  'x' represent the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.  

* **First set:** x + 4 
* **Third set:** x / 2

We know the total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

To solve for x, let's simplify the equation:

1. Combine like terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19
2. Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15
3. Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6

Now that we know x = 6, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

First set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10




Therefore, Rory retrieved **10** tennis balls in the first set.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically:

* Let 'j' represent the number of slices Jake ate.
* Becky ate 3 more than Jake, so she ate 'j + 3' slices.
* Silvia ate twice as many as Jake, so she ate '2j' slices.

We know they ate a total of 4 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 32 slices.  

Therefore, we have the equation: j + (j + 3) + 2j = 32

Simplifying the equation: 4j + 3 = 32

Subtracting 3 from both sides: 4j = 29

Dividing both sides by 4: j = 7.25

Now we can find the number of slices each person ate:

* Jake: 7.25 slices
* Becky: 7.25 + 3 = 10.25 slices
* Silvia: 2 * 7.25 = 14.5 slices

"Let's break down Sheila's credit card activity step-by-step:

1. **Initial Charge:** Sheila starts with a $85.00 charge.

2. **Return:** She returns an item worth $15.00, reducing her balance to $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. **Frying Pan Discount:** The frying pan is 20% off $20.00, meaning the discount is $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00.  The frying pan's price after the discount is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

4. **Towel Discount:** The towels are 10% off $30.00, resulting in a discount of $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. The price of the towels after the discount is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

5. **New Purchases:** Sheila spends a total of $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00 on the frying pan and towels.

"Let's break this problem down using our fraction expertise!

*  We know that 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color, and this represents 6 jellyfish. 
*  This means that 1/3 of the large jellyfish is equal to 6.
*  To find the total number of large jellyfish, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3: (1/3) * 3 = 6 * 3, which gives us 1 large jellyfish = 18.
*  Since 1/5 of the total jellyfish are large, we can set up the equation (1/5) * total jellyfish = 18.
*  Multiplying both sides by 5, we get total jellyfish = 18 * 5 = 90.

"Ah, a classic percentage problem!  Let's break it down.

If 40% of the school population represents 240 boys, we can use that information to find the whole school population.  

Think of it this way: 40% is equivalent to 40/100, which simplifies to 2/5.  So, 2/5 of the school population is 240 boys.  

To find the whole population (which is represented by 5/5 or 1), we can set up a proportion:

(2/5) * (total population) = 240

Multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate the total population:

(total population) = 240 * (5/2) = 600

Now that we know the total population is 600, we can find the number of girls:

Girls = Total population - Boys 
Girls = 600 - 240 = 360

"Let's break this problem down using algebra:

* Let 'A' represent the number of eggs Arnold painted.
* Let 'M' represent the number of eggs Madeline painted.
* Let 'C' represent the number of eggs Camden painted.
* Let 'S' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.

We know the following:

* A + M = 2A  (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number)
* C + S = 30 
* C = S + 12

We also know the total number of eggs painted is 56:

* A + M + C + S = 56

Now we can use substitution to solve for the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs:

1. **Substitute** the values from our known equations into the total eggs equation:
   * A + A + C + S = 56
   * 2A + C + S = 56

2. **Substitute** 'S + 12' for 'C' in the equation:
   * 2A + (S + 12) + S = 56

3. **Simplify** the equation:
   * 2A + 2S + 12 = 56
   * 2A + 2S = 44

4. **Substitute** '30 - C' for 'S' (from the equation C + S = 30):
   * 2A + 2(30 - C) = 44

5. **Substitute** 'S + 12' for 'C':
   * 2A + 2(30 - (S + 12)) = 44

6. **Simplify** and solve for A:
   * 2A + 2(18 - S) = 44
   * 2A + 36 - 2S = 44
   * 2A - 2S = 8
   * A - S = 4
   * A = S + 4

7. **Substitute** 'S + 12' for 'C' and 'S + 4' for 'A' into the equation C = S + 12:
   * S + 12 = S + 4 + 12
   * S + 12 = S + 16

8. **This equation is not possible**, meaning there is an inconsistency in the problem statement.

We know the following:

*  2x + 8y = 26 + 56  (Total earnings from sunflowers and bouquets)
* 12y = x  (Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers)

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first:

"Let's break this problem down using algebra:

* Let 'C' represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.
* Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carlos collected 2C seashells.
* Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected 2C + 5 seashells.

The total number of seashells is the sum of what each person collected: C + 2C + (2C + 5) = 60

Combining like terms: 5C + 5 = 60

Subtracting 5 from both sides: 5C = 55

Dividing both sides by 5: C = 11

Now that we know Carrey collected 11 seashells, we can find out how many each person got:

* Carrey: 11 seashells
* Carlos: 2 * 11 = 22 seashells
* Jim: 22 + 5 = 27 seashells

Finally, they divided the total seashells equally: 60 seashells / 3 people = 20 seashells per person.

    *  Of the purple-wearing babies, 1/3 also wear bows.
    *  All the blue-wearing babies wear bows.

* **Step 3: Calculate the probability of a baby wearing a bow being purple.**  We need to consider both the purple babies wearing bows and the blue babies wearing bows.

Let's represent the babies wearing bows as a fraction of the total babies:

*  Purple babies wearing bows: (1/3) * (3/4) = 1/4
*  Blue babies wearing bows: (1/4) * 1 = 1/4

* **Step 4:  Add the probabilities to find the total probability of a baby wearing a bow.**

"Let's break this problem down systematically.

Let  'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so its length is 'y - 7'.  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, making its length '4(y - 7)'.

We know the total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  This gives us the equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20


Therefore, the length of the red rope is **20 centimeters**.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we find the cost of a single bottle of scotch: $600 / 10 bottles = $60 per bottle.

Next, we determine the cost of a bottle of cognac. Since cognac costs 50% more than scotch, we add 50% of the scotch price: $60 * 0.50 = $30.  Therefore, a bottle of cognac costs $60 + $30 = $90.

Now, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, meaning he buys 10 bottles * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the cognac: 20 bottles * $90/bottle = $1800.

Adding the cost of the scotch, we get a grand total of $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"Let's break down Mr. Julius' tree-planting endeavors step by step.

On his first day, he planted 20 White Oak trees and twice that amount of Lodgepole Pine, which is 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine.

On the second day, he increased his White Oak planting by 10 trees, bringing his total to 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak.  For Lodgepole Pine, he planted 1/4 more than the previous day, which is (1/4) * 40 = 10 more trees, giving him a total of 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine for the day.

Finally, to find the grand total, we add up all the trees planted: 20 White Oak + 40 Lodgepole Pine + 30 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 140 trees.



**Therefore, Mr. Julius planted a total of 140 trees.**

"Let's break down this problem step by step:

* **House Height:** Mattison's house is 7 times his height, so it's 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches tall.

* **First Floor Height:** The first floor is three times Mattison's height, making it 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches high.

* **Second Floor Height:**  Since the house is 420 inches tall and the first floor is 180 inches, the second floor is 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches from the ground.

* **Roof Height:**  The roof height from the second floor is simply the difference between the house's total height and the second floor height: 240 inches - 180 inches = 60 inches.



Therefore, the roof is **60** inches high from the second floor's floor.

"Let's break down Brian's dehumidifier problem step-by-step:

* **Low setting:** The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting.
* **Medium setting:**  The medium setting removes twice the amount of the low setting, so it removes 1 liter * 2 = 2 liters per day.
* **High setting:** The high setting removes twice the amount of the medium setting, meaning it removes 2 liters * 2 = 4 liters per day.

Now, let's calculate the water removed for each setting:

* **Low setting (3 days):** 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters
* **Medium setting (3 days):** 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters
* **High setting (5 days):** 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

"Let's break this problem down methodically.  

First, we need to find the jar's volume. It's a rectangular prism, so we multiply length, width, and height: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Next, we consider the packing efficiency.  Since they only pack 80% efficiently, the usable volume for jelly beans is 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we know each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches.  To find the maximum number of jelly beans that could fit, we divide the usable volume by the volume of a single jelly bean: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

Finally, we estimate that 30% of the jelly beans are red.  Therefore, Tim would estimate there are 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans. 


The problem states the true number of red jelly beans is 900.  To find how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract his estimate from the actual number: 900 - 864 = 36.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Flashlights:**  Each of the 4 family members has one flashlight, so there are 4 flashlights in total.

* **Small Candles:** Half the rooms (8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms) have small candles.  Since each of those rooms has 4 small candles, there are 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles.

* **Medium Candles:** The other half of the rooms (also 4 rooms) have medium candles.  With 5 medium candles per room, there are 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles.

* **Total Candles:**  Adding the small and medium candles, there are 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

* **Grand Total:**  Combining the flashlights and candles, Brianna's family has 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40 light sources.

*  Butler High School enrolls 3/4 the amount of Norman High School, which is (3/4) * 4000 = 3000 students.
*  To find the difference in enrollment, we subtract Butler's enrollment from Norman's: 4000 - 3000 = 1000 students.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically:

* Let 'b' represent the number of beakers Igor lost.
* He gathered half the requested test tubes, so he had (16/2) = 8 test tubes.
* He gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so he had 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
* The total number of items on the bench is 8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) - b (lost beakers) = 29.

Simplifying the equation: 31 - b = 29

Solving for 'b':
b = 31 - 29
b = 2



**Answer:** Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To determine the number of screws left over, we first calculate the total number of screws needed.  

There are 4 tables * 4 legs/table = 16 legs.

Since each leg requires 2 screws, a total of 16 legs * 2 screws/leg = 32 screws are needed.

Subtracting the number of screws needed from the initial amount, we find 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws left over.

"Let's break down this fundraising problem:

* Alexandra raises $430.
* Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
* Sarah raises $300.
* Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Finally, to find the total amount raised, we add up everyone's contributions: $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180. 


**Answer:** $2180

"Let's break this problem down using algebra.

Let... 

*  'x' represent Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.

We know:

* Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so his speed is 2x.
* Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, meaning she runs 4 miles while Aaron runs 2 miles.

We also know Aaron's time is 16 minutes.  We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

For Aaron: 16 = 2 / 2x

Solving for x:

16 = 1 / x
x = 1/16 miles per minute

Now we can find Vanessa's time:

Vanessa's time = Distance / Speed = 4 / (1/16) = 64 minutes




**Answer:** 64 minutes

"Ah, a classic profit margin problem!  Let's break it down.

First, we need to determine the selling price of all the watermelons.  Since the vendor made a 25% profit on his $80 investment, his total earnings were $80 + (0.25 * $80) = $100.

Now, to find the price per watermelon, we simply divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons: $100 / 50 = $2.

"Let's break this problem down using algebra:

* Let John's youngest son's current age be represented by the variable 'x'.

* We know John had James when he was 19, and James is now twice Dora's age.  Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.  This means James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

*  Since John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old, we know he was 32 when his youngest son was born.  Therefore, x = 37 - 32 = 5.

*  In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Ana's peeling rate:** Ana peels one orange every 3 minutes.
* **Jane's peeling rate:** Jane peels one orange every 4 minutes.

* **Oranges peeled in an hour:**  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour:
    * Ana peels 60 minutes / 3 minutes/orange = 20 oranges.
    * Jane peels 60 minutes / 4 minutes/orange = 15 oranges.

* **The difference:** Ana peels 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Let's calculate Mark's expenses:

First, find the discount amount: $400 * 0.80 = $320

Next, subtract the discount from the original price: $400 - $320 = $80

Then, calculate the mechanic's labor cost: 3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Finally, add the radiator cost and labor cost: $80 + $150 = $230


**Therefore, Mark paid $230 in total.**

"Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We are given two pieces of information:

1.  c + w = 20  (The total number of animals is 20)
2.  2c + 4w = 70 (The total number of legs is 70)

We can solve this system of equations.  Let's use the substitution method.  From the first equation, we can isolate 'w':

w = 20 - c

Now, substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplify and solve for 'c':

2c + 80 - 4c = 70
-2c = -10
c = 5



Therefore, there are **5** chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.
