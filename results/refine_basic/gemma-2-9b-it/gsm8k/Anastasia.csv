"Okay, let's break this down!

Josh spent $80,000 on the house and then put another $50,000 into repairs, for a total investment of $130,000.  The repairs increased the house's value by 150% of the original price, which is $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.  

This means the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Finally, his profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

Carla downloads 2 GB every minute, so a 200 GB file would normally take 100 minutes (200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes).

But, she gets interrupted!  She's downloaded 40% of the file, which is 80 GB (200 GB * 40% = 80 GB).  

After the restart, she has to download the whole 200 GB again.  That means she has 60 minutes of downloading left (200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB, and 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes).

Adding the time for the interruption, the total download time is 120 minutes (60 minutes + 20 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes).

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

First, John drives 3 hours at 60 mph, covering a distance of 180 miles.  

Then, he spends 2 hours stuck in traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during that time.

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, which takes him 15 miles closer to home.

Finally, he has 1.5 hours left to get home and drives at 80 mph, covering 120 miles.

To find his total distance from home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled on his return trip from the distance he traveled initially: 180 miles - (0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles) = 45 miles.

*  Melanie started with some number of vacuum cleaners, let's call that number 'x'.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3 of her vacuum cleaners.

*  Then, she sold 2 more at the red house.

*  After the green and red houses, she had (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1 vacuum cleaners.

*  Finally, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left.  This means (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

*  Simplifying the equation, we get x/3 - 1 = 5

*  Adding 1 to both sides, we have x/3 = 6

*  Multiplying both sides by 3, we find x = 18

* **Option 2:** Electronic gadgets worth $8,000 that are predicted to increase by 1.2%

To find the most profitable option, we need to calculate the potential profit for each:

**Option 1 (Jewelry):**

* Increase in value: $5000 * 0.025 = $125
* Total value at the end of the month: $5000 + $125 = $5125
* Profit: $5125 - $5000 = $125

Now, let's simplify and solve for 's':

2s + 30 = 110
2s = 80
s = 40

Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then reads for half that time, which is 1 hour.  So each time he does this, he spends a total of 3 hours.  

He does this 3 times a week, meaning he spends 3 hours/time * 3 times/week = 9 hours per week on TV and reading.

Over 4 weeks, that adds up to 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

If the team won 8 more games than they lost, we can think of it like this:

*  Let 'L' be the number of games they lost.
*  They won 'L + 8' games.

Since they played a total of 22 games, we have:

* He's also buying 20 peppers at $15 each, totaling 20 * $15 = $300.

* Finally, he needs 10 oranges at $40 each, costing 10 * $40 = $400.

* To find the total cost, we add everything up: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.



Dillon will spend $880 at the store.

"Let's break down the hospital's profit:

* **Doctor's Earnings:** The doctors work for 200 hours (12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour) and earn $150 per hour, so they make $30,000 (200 hours * $150/hour).

* **Patient Charges:** The hospital charges $200 per hour and sees patients for 200 hours, bringing in $40,000 (200 hours * $200/hour).

* **Profit:**  The hospital's profit is the difference between patient charges and doctor's earnings, which is $10,000 ($40,000 - $30,000).

We know there are 700 bees in total.  There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens.  

Let's think about it step-by-step:

* If we let 'q' represent the number of queen bees, then there are 2q baby bees.
* Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, there are 2 * (2q) = 4q worker bees.

* Now we can set up an equation: q + 2q + 4q = 700

* Combining like terms, we get 7q = 700

* Dividing both sides by 7, we find that q = 100.

*  That means there are 2 * 100 = 200 baby bees.

* And finally, there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.




So the answer is 400.

If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price goes up by 20% every two months, we need to see how much it costs after 36 months.  

Think of it like this:

* **Month 2:** The price increases by 20% of $20, which is $4. So it costs $24.
* **Month 4:**  Another 20% increase on $24 is $4.80, making it $28.80.

We keep doing this every two months.  It's a bit tedious to calculate by hand, but we can use a little math trick!

Since the price goes up by a factor of 1.20 (100% + 20%) every two months, after 36 months (18 two-month periods) the price will be:

*  To roll two even numbers in a row, he'd need to roll an even number first, then another even number. There are three even numbers, so the chance of that is 3/6 or 1/2.  But, since he has to do it twice, we multiply those probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Let's say the small pool had *x* gallons of water four minutes ago.  That means the big pool had 2*x* gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons per minute, the small pool now has *x* - 16 gallons, and the big pool has 2*x* - 16 gallons.

We know the big pool now has four times the amount of water as the small pool, so:

2*x* - 16 = 4(*x* - 16)

Let's solve for *x*:

2*x* - 16 = 4*x* - 64

* **Cera's age six years ago:** Cera is 46 now, so six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
* **Noah's age six years ago:**  Noah was half Cera's age then, meaning he was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
* **Population of Chile six years ago:** We know the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.
* **Population of Chile now:** The population is now double what it was six years ago, so the current population is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

If there are twice as many players on offense as defense, we can call the number of defense players ""d"".  That means there are 2*d* players on offense.

Special teams has half the number of players as defense, so they have *d*/2 players.

The total number of players is 105, so:

d + 2d + d/2 = 105

To solve for *d*, let's combine like terms:

(5/2)d = 105

Now, multiply both sides by 2/5:

d = 42 



There are **42** players on the defense.

First, we need to find out how many junior programmers there are.  Since they make up 2/5 of the total employees, there are (2/5) * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Next, we can find the number of senior programmers: 100 total employees - 40 junior programmers = 60 senior programmers.

Senior programmers earn $400 more than junior programmers, so they make $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

Now we can calculate the total salary paid to junior programmers: 40 junior programmers * $2000/programmer = $80,000.

And the total salary paid to senior programmers: 60 senior programmers * $2400/programmer = $144,000.

Finally, to find the total amount paid to all programmers, we add those two amounts together: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"Hello! Let's figure this out.  Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and twice as many chickens as cows.  

First, let's think about how to find the number of each animal. If we let 'c' represent the number of cows, we know there are 2c chickens.  Since the total number of animals is 60, we can write the equation: c + 2c = 60.  

Combining like terms, we get 3c = 60.  Dividing both sides by 3, we find that c = 20 cows.  That means there are 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, let's count the legs! Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

Adding those together, we find the total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

"Okay, let's figure this out! Tyson needs to make enough muffaletta sandwiches for 20 people.  Since each sandwich serves 4, he'll need 5 sandwiches (20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches).

Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.  That means he'll need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese in total.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds will cost $35.00 (5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00).

The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds will cost $15.00 (5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00).

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and cheese: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

* **Sister's Tallest Trees:** Joanne's sister picked twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, meaning she picked 30 * 2 = 60 apples.

* **Sister's Shortest Trees:** The sister picked three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she picked 15 * 3 = 45 apples.

* **Sister's Total:**  The sister gathered a total of 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

* **Joanne's Total (Excluding Average):** Joanne picked 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

"Hello! Let's figure this out.  

We know there are 180 heads in total and 304 bumps.  Camels have two humps, and dromedaries have one.  

Let's use a little algebra:

* Let 'c' be the number of camels
* Let 'd' be the number of dromedaries

We can set up two equations:

* c + d = 180  (one head per animal)
* 2c + d = 304 (two humps per camel)

To solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries), we can use substitution.  Let's solve the first equation for 'c':

c = 180 - d

Now, substitute that value of 'c' into the second equation:

2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':

360 - 2d + d = 304
-d = -56
d = 56




There are **56** dromedaries.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to remember that there are 3 feet in every yard. So Billie's room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet long.

Next, we know the area of a rectangle is length times width.  We have the area (360 square feet) and the length (9 feet), so we can find the width: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Finally, the perimeter of a rectangle is twice the length plus twice the width: 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

*  After baking, the temperature is 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.
*  The open window cools the house 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the cooling is 30 minutes / 10 minutes/cooling * 2 degrees/cooling = 6 degrees.

* **Bike:** James took 5 minutes longer than Jon's 80 minutes on the bike, meaning his bike time was 85 minutes.

Now we know James' total time was 10 minutes longer than Jon's.  Since Jon took 170 minutes total, James took 180 minutes.

Finally, we can subtract his swim and bike times from James' total time to find his run time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

Now, we know the horse eats half a bale of hay for every mile, so it eats 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is 8 bales * $3/bale = $24.

Let's say Bodhi found 'B' insects.  Since David found half of Bodhi's amount, David found 'B/2' insects.  And Lily found 7 more than David, so she found 'B/2 + 7' insects.

Now we can set up an equation:

B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

Combining like terms:

B + 7 = 43

B = 36

So Bodhi found 36 insects.  

David found half of Bodhi's amount, so he found 36 / 2 = 18 insects.

Next, let's find out how many sheep the farm has: 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now we can add up the animals on the farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.

And the animals at the zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

In a month with four weeks, he sells 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses.

Since Ford only grows 40 roses a week, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses each month.

We know there are 4500 jelly beans total, and the colors have this special relationship:

* Red jelly beans are 1% *fewer* than blue jelly beans.
* Green jelly beans are 1% *more* than blue jelly beans.

Let's use 'b' to represent the number of blue jelly beans.  This means:

* Red jelly beans:  b - 0.01b = 0.99b
* Green jelly beans: b + 0.01b = 1.01b

Now we can set up an equation:

4500 = 0.99b + b + 1.01b

Combining like terms:

4500 = 2.99b

Solving for 'b':

b = 4500 / 2.99 
b ≈ 1505

So there are about 1505 blue jelly beans.  Now we can find the others:

* Red: 0.99 * 1505 ≈ 1490
* Green: 1.01 * 1505 ≈ 1520

"Let's break this down! Ashley's internet speed is 20 kilobits per second (kb/s).  We need to figure out how many megabits per hour (Mb/h) that is.

First, remember that 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb). So, we can convert her speed:

20 kb/s / 1000 kb/Mb = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, to get her speed in Mb/hour, we multiply by the number of seconds in an hour:

0.02 Mb/s * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 7.2 Mb/h




Ashley's internet connection speed is 7.2 Mb/h.

"Let's figure this out!  

The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days, so that's 10 * 3 = 30 cars.

Then, it pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the rest of the week, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, that means it pulled 6 cars a day for 4 more days, for a total of 6 * 4 = 24 cars.

Adding those together, the tow truck pulled 30 + 24 = 54 cars that week.

James made $25,000 per car, and he sold 10 cars, so his total sales were $25,000 * 10 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the car prices to acquire them, which is $250,000 * 0.30 = $75,000.

His profit was the total sales minus the acquisition cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, James earned a 10% commission on the profit, so he made $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500.

"Let's figure this out!

Rong saves 20 coins each month, and Neil saves 2/5 more than Rong.  That means Neil saves (2/5) * 20 = 8 more coins each month, for a total of 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Over a year, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins. Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year = 336 coins per year.

After ten years, Rong will have saved 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins. Neil will have saved 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they'll have saved 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, the vaccines cost $20 each, and John needs two, so that's $20 * 2 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which we can call 'x'.  So, 0.60x = heartworm check cost.

The total bill is the cost of the vaccines plus the heartworm check: $40 + 0.60x = x

Let's solve for x:

* Subtract $40 from both sides: 0.60x = x - $40
* Subtract 0.60x from both sides: 0 = 0.40x - $40
* Add $40 to both sides: $40 = 0.40x
* Divide both sides by 0.40: x = $100

Finally, John brought $125 and his bill was $100, so he has $125 - $100 = $25 left.

"Let's break down the cost of this fruit crate!

First, bananas cost twice as much as an apple, which is $0.50. So, a banana costs $1.00.

Oranges are the priciest at three times the cost of a banana, making them $3.00 each.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

* **Small stickers to large buttons:** Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers, which is 27 small stickers.  Since each large button is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

* **Large stickers to large buttons:** She trades half her 40 large stickers, which is 20 large stickers. This gives her another 20 large buttons.

* **Remaining large stickers to small stickers:**  Lorraine has 20 large stickers left, which she trades for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

* **Total Buttons:**  She started with 27 small buttons and gained 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons.  

* **Final Count:** Lorraine has a total of 27 + 29 = 56 buttons.

"Let's break this problem down!

First, figure out how long the friends who are worse than Jack play for: 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter.

Then, calculate how long the friend who's better than Jack plays: 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

Next, convert 4 hours into minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's see how many quarters each friend uses:

* Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters
* Worse friends: 2 friends * (240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter) = 48 quarters
* Better friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters

Finally, add up the total number of quarters used: 12 quarters + 48 quarters + 8 quarters = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, they spent a total of 68 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17.00.

"Let's break this problem down!

Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar.  She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.  

*  Let's say 'x' represents the number of ounces of citrus zest (and fragrance).
*  Since salt and sugar are equal, they also use 'x' ounces.
*  Oil is twice the amount of salt, so oil is 2x ounces.

Now we know:

* Citrus zest: x ounces
* Fragrance: x ounces
* Salt: x ounces
* Sugar: x ounces
* Oil: 2x ounces

The total ounces in the jar must equal 10: x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combining like terms: 5x = 10

Dividing both sides by 5: x = 2

Since oil is 2x, Tanya uses 2 * 2 = 4 ounces of oil.

*  Let's say PJ has 'x' Magic Cards.
*  Smendrick has 3 times the amount PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Now, let's solve for x:

* Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329
* Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

Finally, to find how many cards Becca has, substitute the value of x back into the expression for Becca's cards:

"Let's figure out how much money Kelly has left!

First, the chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4.  

Then, the total cost of the chicken is 6 packs * $4/pack = $24.

The apples cost half the price of strawberries, so each pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2.

The total cost of the apples is 7 packs * $2/pack = $14.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

* Pa = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
* P = Pa + J (Peter's age is Paul's and John's combined age)

Let's use substitution to find Peter's age:

1. Since Pa = J + 10, we can say P = (J + 10) + J  which simplifies to P = 2J + 10

2. Now, substitute both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3.  Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100

4.  Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80

5.  Divide both sides by 4: J = 20

6.  Now that we know J = 20, substitute it back into P = 2J + 10:

9W = 360

Dividing both sides by 9:

W = 40

Now we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon.

*  They pay $25 to rent the studio each session, plus $1.50 per student for each session.  Since they have 10 students, that's $15 extra per session for students.
*  So, each session costs $25 + $15 = $40.
*  They have sessions 3 days a week.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

*  Let 'x' represent the power bank's initial charge when Maria left for the park.

*  The power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours, totaling a loss of 9 * 5 = 45%.

*  After those 5 hours, the remaining charge was x - 0.45x = 0.55x

*  Then, it lost another 7% per hour for 3 hours, for a total loss of 7 * 3 = 21%.

*  This means the final charge, 28%, can be represented as 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x

*  Setting up the equation: 0.34x = 0.28

*  Solving for x: x = 0.28 / 0.34 
*  x ≈ 0.82 or 82%




The power bank's charge when Maria went to the park was approximately **82%**.

* Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
* Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
* Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Adding those up, he spent $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

First, we need to find out how many tiles you'll need. Since your floor is 200 square feet and each tile is 1 foot by 1 foot, you'll need 200 tiles.

* Then, the speedy velociraptors snatched half of *that* amount, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4 kilograms.

*  That means the Allosaurus got to the last 270 kilograms, which was what was left after the velociraptors.  We can write this as: x/2 - x/4 = 270

*  Combining the terms on the left side, we get x/4 = 270

First, we need to find out how many toys the first two workers made. They each make 6 toys an hour, so together they make 12 toys an hour. Over 10 hours, they produce 12 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys.

The next two workers make 4 toys an hour each, for a total of 8 toys an hour.  In 10 hours, they make 8 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys.

Together, the first four workers made 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.

Since they still need 20 more toys to complete the order of 400, the fifth worker needs to make 400 toys - 200 toys = 200 toys.

Over their 10-hour shift, the fifth worker made 200 toys / 10 hours = 20 toys per hour.

Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at a certain speed and 1 mile on the sidewalk at twice that speed.  We know she spends 40 minutes on the beach.  

First, let's figure out her speed on the beach.  Since she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

On the sidewalk, she walks twice as fast, so her speed there is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, to find out how long it takes her to walk the sidewalk mile, we divide the distance by her speed: 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

*  We know the red rope is four times as long as the blue rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
*  All three ropes together measure 37 centimeters.

Let's think about it step-by-step.  If we let the yellow rope be 'y' centimeters long, the blue rope would be 'y - 7' centimeters long. And the red rope would be 4 times the length of the blue rope, so it would be 4 * (y - 7) centimeters long.

Now we can set up an equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Let's solve for 'y':

* y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
* 6y - 35 = 37
* 6y = 72
* y = 12

So the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.  

Now we can find the length of the red rope:

* Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20


The red rope is 20 centimeters long.

-x = -3

In the first half, Team A scored 4 goals and Team B scored 2 fewer than that, so they scored 2 goals.

In the second half, Team B really stepped up their game, scoring 4 times the amount they scored in the first half, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals.  Team A scored 1/4 the number of goals Team B scored in the second half, so they scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Adding up all the goals, Team A scored a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals, and Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

Together, they scored 6 + 10 = 16 goals in the match.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

*  The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday, leaving him with 55%  (100% - 45% = 55%).

*  That means he has 2.75 inches of chalk left (55% of 5 inches is (55/100) * 5 = 2.75).

*  He uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 1 inch (20% of 5 inches is (20/100) * 5 = 1).

*  Therefore, the chalk will last him 2.75 days (2.75 inches / 1 inch per day = 2.75 days).

"Let's break this problem down!

Let Wendy's current age be ""w"" and Colin's current age be ""c"".

*  And in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.  Let's solve the first equation for 'w':

w = 5c + 35

Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for 'c':

3c + 75 = 5c + 35
40 = 2c
c = 20


Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Let's break this down!

Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and that's 3/4 of the number she wrote this year.  To find out how many she wrote this year, we need to figure out what number, when multiplied by 3/4, equals 9.

Think of it like this: if 3/4 represents 9 novels, what does the whole (which is 4/4) represent?  

We can solve this by dividing 9 by 3/4:

9 / (3/4) = 9 * (4/3) = 12


Regina wrote **12** novels this year.

Now we can solve for 's':

* 6s - 4 = 116
* 6s = 120
* s = 20

That means Mary made 20 strawberry cubes.  Now we can find the blueberry cubes:

* Blueberry cubes = 5 * 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

So Mary made 96 blueberry ice cubes.

* **Pennies:** 750 pennies * $0.01/penny = $7.50

Adding it all up: $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00 


31.00

"Let's break it down!

Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $15.00 on movie tickets (since she bought two at $7.50 each), and $8.50 on a bracelet.  That means she spent a total of $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00.

Since her parents gave her $40.00, she has $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00 left.

"Let's break this down!

Josh services 3 cars each day he's open, which is 5 days a week (since he's closed on Sunday and Wednesday).  That means he services 3 cars/day * 5 days/week = 15 cars each week.

Since he makes $4 per car, he earns $4/car * 15 cars/week = $60 per week.

Over two weeks, he'd make $60/week * 2 weeks = $120.

"Let's break this cookie problem down!

* Randy begins with 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies.
* He eats 3 cookies (1 of each kind), leaving him with 18 - 3 = 15 cookies.
* Then he eats 2 oatmeal cookies, so he has 15 - 2 = 13 cookies.
* He gives away 2 sugar cookies, leaving him with 13 - 2 = 11 cookies.
* Finally, he bakes 4 of each kind, so he has 11 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 29 cookies.


Answer: Randy has 29 cookies.

"Matthew has 12 toy soldiers and wants to sell them for a fair price. He finds a buyer who will pay $5 for half the soldiers and $7 for the other half.  Let's figure out how much money Matthew would make!

* First, he'd sell 12 soldiers / 2 = 6 soldiers for $5 each. That's 6 * $5 = $30.
* Then, he'd sell another 6 soldiers for $7 each, earning 6 * $7 = $42.
*  In total, Matthew would make $30 + $42 = $72.

"Let's break this problem down!

First, we need to figure out how many holes the dog digs in total.  It digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so that's 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Then, Nate fills in 9 holes each day, but the dog digs 6 new ones, meaning Nate makes a net progress of 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled per day.

To find out how many days it takes Nate to fill all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by his daily progress: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

Finally, to find out how many weeks that is, we divide the number of days by the number of days in a week: 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.


So the answer is **4 weeks**.

"Let's figure this out!  Butler High School enrolls 3/4 the number of students as Norman High School, which is (3/4) * 4000 students = 3000 students.  

The difference in enrollment is 4000 students - 3000 students = 1000 students. 


**1000**

"Hmm, let's see! They made 7995 cookies total.  

They also made 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies.  

If we subtract those from the total, we can find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made: 7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2325 

So the answer is 2325 chocolate chip cookies!

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Test tubes:** Igor got half the requested amount, so he had 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
* **Petri dishes:** He gathered 2 more than requested, meaning he had 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
* **Total before losing beakers:**  Igor started with 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 items.
* **Beakers lost:**  Since he ended up with 29 items, he must have lost 31 - 29 = 2 beakers.


Igor lost **2** beakers.

"Let's figure this out! James needs 4 screws for each leg, and he has 16 legs in total. That means he needs 4 * 16 = 64 screws.  Since he only has 40 screws, he'll be short 64 - 40 = 24 screws.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.  

If there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many in the second, that means there are 20 eggs in the second basket.  

Together, they have 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

"Let's figure this out! 

Alexandra raised $430, and Kim raised $320 more than that, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $400 + $300 = $700.

Finally, to find the total, we add up everyone's fundraising: $750 + $430 + $700 + $300 = $2180.


**Answer: $2180**

"Let's break this problem down!

*  Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, who ran 2 miles. So Vanessa ran 4 miles.
* Aaron finished his 2 miles in 16 minutes, meaning he ran at a speed of 0.125 miles per minute (2 miles / 16 minutes).
* Vanessa ran at half Aaron's speed, so her speed was 0.0625 miles per minute.
* To find Vanessa's time, we divide her distance by her speed: 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute = 64 minutes.



Vanessa took **64** minutes to complete her part of the race.

"Let's figure this out!  The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and he has 200 feet of dock.  That means he needs 200 * 3 = 600 feet of line in total.  

Since he already has 6 feet, he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 feet more.

"Let's break this down!

Tom's restaurant makes $5 x 2 = $10 from the meals each night, plus another $5 for the wine.  So each reservation brings in $15.

With 6 reservations each night, they make $15 x 6 = $90 per night.

Since they're open 2 nights a week, their total weekly earnings are $90 x 2 = $180.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The vendor made a 25% profit on the 50 watermelons, which means he sold them for 125% of the original price.  

First, we need to find out how much each watermelon cost: $80 / 50 = $1.60

Then, we can calculate the selling price per watermelon: $1.60 * 1.25 = $2.00

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

*  James is 18 years old because he is twice as old as his sister Dora, who is 9.
*  John is 37 years old because he had James when he was 19.
*  John's youngest son is 5 years old because John was 32 when he was born.

In three years, John's youngest son will be 8 years old.

"Well, I peel an orange every 3 minutes and Jane takes 4 minutes.  Since we're peeling for a whole hour, that means I'll get through 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges.  Jane will only manage 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges.  

So, I'll have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than her.

"Let's figure this out!  Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they have a total of 70 legs.  

* Chickens have 2 legs each.
* Cows have 4 legs each.

If we let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows, we can set up a system of equations:

* c + w = 20  
* 2c + 4w = 70

We can solve for 'c' (the number of chickens).  Let me think...  Aha!  

There are **5** chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

They have 7 pizzas with 8 slices each, so that's 7 * 8 = 56 slices in total.  

With Henry and his 3 friends, there are 4 people sharing.

56 slices divided by 4 people means each person gets 56 / 4 = 14 slices.
