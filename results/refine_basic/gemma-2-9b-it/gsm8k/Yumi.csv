"Let's break this down!

Josh spent $80,000 on the house and $50,000 on repairs, for a total investment of $130,000.  The repairs increased the house value by 150% of the original price, which is $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.  

This means the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Finally, his profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

Wendi feeds her 20 chickens 3 cups of food each day, split into three meals. She's already given them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon.  

To find out how much she needs to give them in the last meal, we can subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed:

* Total daily feed: 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups
* Feed needed in the last meal: 60 cups - 15 cups - 25 cups = 20 cups

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

First, John drives 3 hours at 60 mph, covering a distance of 180 miles.  

Then, he spends 2 hours stuck in traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during that time.

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, which takes him 15 miles closer to home.

Finally, he has 1.5 hours left to get home and drives at 80 mph, covering 120 miles.

To find his total distance from home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled on his return trip from the distance he traveled initially: 180 miles - (0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles) = 45 miles.

* She sold a third of them at the green house.
* Then she sold 2 more at the red house.
*  After that, she sold half of what was *left* at the orange house.

We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners left over.  Let's use some algebra to solve this!

Let 'x' represent the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

* Green house: x/3 sold
* Red house: 2 sold
* Remaining: x - x/3 - 2 = (2x/3) - 2
* Orange house: (2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1 sold
* Left over: (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

x/3 - 1 = 5
x/3 = 6
x = 18

The merchant has two options:

* **Option 1:** Jewelry worth $5,000 that's predicted to increase by 2.5%
* **Option 2:** Electronic gadgets worth $8,000 that are predicted to increase by 1.2%

To find the most profitable option, we need to calculate the potential profit for each:

**Option 1 (Jewelry):**

* Increase in value: $5000 * 0.025 = $125
* Total value at the end of the month: $5000 + $125 = $5125
* Profit: $5125 - $5000 = $125

**Option 2 (Electronic Gadgets):**

* Increase in value: $8000 * 0.012 = $96
* Total value at the end of the month: $8000 + $96 = $8096

* **Profit:**  The hospital's profit is the difference between patient charges and doctor's earnings, which is $10,000 ($40,000 - $30,000).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

* We know there are 700 bees total.
* There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens.

Let's think about it step-by-step:

1. **Queens:**  Let's say there are 'q' queen bees.
2. **Babies:** Since there are twice as many babies as queens, there are 2q baby bees.
3. **Workers:**  There are twice as many worker bees as babies, so there are 2 * (2q) = 4q worker bees.

Now we can add up all the bees: q + 2q + 4q = 700

That simplifies to 7q = 700

Divide both sides by 7 to find q: q = 100

So, there are 100 queen bees.

Now we can find the number of worker bees: 4q = 4 * 100 = 400



There are **400** worker bees.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step!

* Dave started with 14 fries, and the seagull ate half of those, which is 7 fries.
* That leaves 14 - 7 = 7 fries.
* The pigeons ate 3 fries each, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
*  That means there were 7 - 9 = -2 fries left.  Hmm, that doesn't make sense! This means the pigeons ate more fries than were left after the seagull. 

Since the problem states there were 5 fries left *after* the ants took one, we know there must have been 5 + 1 = 6 fries before the ants.

Working backwards, before the pigeons ate any, there were 6 + 9 = 15 fries.

And before the seagull swooped in, there were 15 + 7 = 22 fries.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

The price goes up by 20% every two months, so we need to think about how many times that happens in 36 months. That's 36 / 2 = 18 times!

Each time the price goes up, it increases by 20% of the *current* price.  So we can't just add $4 every two months.  

Think of it like this:

* Month 0: $20
* Month 2: $20 + (20% of $20) = $24
* Month 4: $24 + (20% of $24) = $28.80
* Month 6: $28.80 + (20% of $28.80) = $34.56 
* ...and so on

It gets a little tedious to keep doing that, but we can use a shortcut!  

Since the price increases by a factor of 1.20 (100% + 20%) every two months, after 18 times, the price will be:

$20 * (1.20)^18 = $201.25 (approximately)

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

To get a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, you could roll a 4, 5, or 6. That's 3 out of 6 possibilities, or a 50% chance.

Now, for two even numbers in a row, think about it this way: you need to roll an even number first, then another even number.  There are 3 even numbers on a die, so the chance of that happening is 3/6 or 50% for the first roll.  Then, you need to roll another even number, which also has a 50% chance.  To get the total chance, you multiply those together: 50% * 50% = 25%.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago, and now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.  

Let's say the small pool had *x* gallons four minutes ago. That means the big pool had 2*x* gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons per minute, the small pool now has *x* - 16 gallons, and the big pool has 2*x* - 16 gallons.

We know the big pool now has four times the amount of water as the small pool, so:

2*x* - 16 = 4(*x* - 16)

Let's solve for *x*:

2*x* - 16 = 4*x* - 64
48 = 2*x*
*x* = 24

First, we need to find out how many 10-foot sections are in the whole redwood tree.  Since the tree is 200 feet tall, there are 200 feet / 10 feet/section = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the whole tree weighed 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

The termites ate 30% of the tree, which is 8000 pounds * 0.30 = 2400 pounds.

That means the redwood now weighs 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

Next, the transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which is $42,000.

Adding those fees to the original price, the total cost of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Shannon's iced coffee gets weaker in two ways: from the ice cubes and from the cream.  

* **Ice cubes:** Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, and she uses 5 ice cubes to cool it 65 degrees. So that's 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.
* **Cream:** She adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

"Let's break this problem down step by step!

First, we need to find out how many junior programmers there are.  Since they make up 2/5 of the total employees, there are (2/5) * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Next, we can find the number of senior programmers: 100 total employees - 40 junior programmers = 60 senior programmers.

Senior programmers earn $400 more than junior programmers, so they make $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

Now we can calculate the total salary paid to junior programmers: 40 junior programmers * $2000/programmer = $80,000.

And the total salary paid to senior programmers: 60 senior programmers * $2400/programmer = $144,000.

Finally, to find the total amount paid to all programmers, we add those two amounts together: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

*  With a 20% tax rate, he'll pay $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000 in taxes.
*  His net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

**Job B:**

* Job B pays a flat $42,000 per year.
*  After paying $6,000 in property tax, his net income is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
*  He'll pay 10% tax on this remaining income, which is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600.

"Let's figure this out! Tyson needs to make enough muffaletta sandwiches for 20 people.  Since each sandwich serves 4, he'll need 5 sandwiches (20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches).

Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.  That means he'll need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese in total.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds will cost $35.00 (5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00).

The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds will cost $15.00 (5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00).

1% of the candles explode, which is the same as 0.01.

5% of those exploding candles smell bad, which is 0.05.

So, 0.01 * 0.05 = 0.0005

First, remember that there are 3 feet in every yard. So Billie's room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet long.

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet.  To find the width, we can use the formula:

Area = length * width

360 square feet = 9 feet * width

width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet

Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads, which is a total of 3 packs.  Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads, for a total of 7 packs.

Since each pack has 20 beads, Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads.

Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

Margareth has 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

*  Marcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees.
*  Baking for 3 hours raises the temperature by 5 degrees each hour, so the total increase is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.
*  After baking, the temperature is 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.
*  The open window cools the house 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the cooling is 30 minutes / 10 minutes/cooling * 2 degrees/cooling = 6 degrees.
*  Finally, the house temperature after cooling is 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half the number Bodhi did.  

To find out how many insects Lily found, let's think about it step-by-step:

* **Let's say Bodhi found 'B' insects.**

* **David found half of Bodhi's amount, so David found B/2 insects.**

* **Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (B/2) + 7 insects.**

* **Together, they found 43 insects, so B + (B/2) + 7 = 43**

Now we can solve for B:

1. **Combine like terms:** (3/2)B + 7 = 43
2. **Subtract 7 from both sides:** (3/2)B = 36
3. **Multiply both sides by 2/3:** B = 24

So Bodhi found 24 insects.  Now we can find how many David found:

* David found B/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects.

Finally, let's find how many Lily found:

Since the weekly pass costs $20.00, she'd save $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00.

"Let's figure this out! 

The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.  

First, let's find out how many cows the zoo has: 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows.

Next, let's find out how many sheep the farm has: 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now we can add up the animals on the farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.

And the animals at the zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Finally, let's add the animals from both places: 40 animals + 80 animals = 120 animals.


So the answer is 120.

"Hey there! Let's help Andy crush his New Year's resolution.  

First, we need to figure out how many days Andy has to reach his goal.  That's 31 days in January + 28 days in February + 31 days in March + 30 days in April + 31 days in May + 30 days in June + 19 days in July = 190 days.

Next, we know he needs to burn 3500 calories for every pound he wants to lose, and he wants to lose 30 pounds. So, that's 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories.

Finally, to reach his goal, Andy needs to burn 105,000 calories / 190 days = 552.63 calories each day.

Katina takes out $100 each month, so in a year she'll take out $100 * 12 = $1200.  

Over two years, that's $1200 * 2 = $2400.

If she started with $3000 and takes out $2400, she'll have $3000 - $2400 = $600 left.

"Hey there! Let's break down this food truck's profit.

First, each sandwich costs $0.30 for the bread.  

Then, they spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for every 10 sandwiches.  

So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese & condiments) = $33.00

They sell those 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, bringing in $70.00.

Finally, their profit is $70.00 (revenue) - $33.00 (cost) = $37.00

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step!

Diane starts with 20.  Then she adds half the number to that, which is like adding x/2 (since we don't know the actual number).  

That gives us 20 + x/2.  Next, she divides that whole thing by 5.

Then, she multiplies the result by the starting value (20) minus 12.  

So, the final expression is:

[(20 + x/2) / 5] * 8 

We can simplify this a bit:

(160 + 4x) / 5

"Let's break this problem down!

*  Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.

*  Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, there are 0.99b red jelly beans.

*  And because there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, there are 1.01b green jelly beans.

*  The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so:  0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500

*  Combining like terms, we get 2.99b = 4500

*  Dividing both sides by 2.99, we find b ≈ 1505 blue jelly beans.

*  Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
    * Red: 0.99 * 1505 ≈ 1490
    * Green: 1.01 * 1505 ≈ 1520

"Hey there!  Let's break this triangle problem down.

Let's combine those 'x's: 6x = 180

To find out how big our seed (x) is, we divide both sides by 6: x = 30 degrees.

"Let's break this problem down!

*  If the second house needs 'x' cases of shingles, the first house needs half that, or x/2.

* The third house needs double the shingles of the first house, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

*  Together, all three houses need 250 cases: (x/2) + x + x = 250

*  Combining like terms, we get 2.5x = 250

*  Solving for x, we find x = 100.

*  Since the third house needs the same number of cases as the second house, it needs 100 cases of shingles.

"Let's figure this out!  

First, we need to find out how fast the Llesis family hiked. They hiked 5 miles per hour slower than half their driving speed, which is 50 mph. Half of 50 mph is 25 mph, and 5 mph less than that is 20 mph.

Next, we know they hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 mph, so they covered 1.5 hours * 20 mph = 30 miles while hiking.

They drove for 6 hours total minus their 1.5 hours of hiking, which means they drove for 6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours.

Since they drove at 50 mph, they covered 4.5 hours * 50 mph = 225 miles while driving.

Finally, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

* Ava gets 5 points for each berry she collects, Emma gets 5 points for each berry she collects.
* Ava gets 30 points for each second left on the timer, Emma gets 30 points for each second left on the timer.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava gets 80 extra points from enemies. Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so Ava gets 15 extra points from berries.  Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so Ava gets 120 fewer points from the timer.

*  If he bought 'w' white fish, he must have bought '2w' orange fish (since he has twice as many orange).
*  The total number of fish he bought is 'w + 2w = 17'

Combining those 'w's, we get '3w = 17'.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that 'w = 5.67'.  

Since Bob can't buy parts of fish, he must have bought **5** white fish.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

*  Let's say PJ has 'x' Magic Cards.
*  Smendrick has 3 times the amount PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
*  Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

Together, they have 341 cards:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Let's simplify that:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Now, divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

So PJ has 47 cards.  

Becca has 3x + 12 cards, which is (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.



Becca has 153 Magic Cards!

"Let's figure this out!

* Boris makes 8,000 chocolate bars in the first week.

* The third week, he makes three times the amount from the first week: 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how many bars he makes in the fourth week, we need to see how many he makes in total over the four weeks.  He makes 50,000 bars each month.

So far, he's made 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we find out how many indoor plants there are: 100 plants * (1/4) = 25 plants.

Then, we see how many plants are left outside: 100 plants - 25 plants = 75 plants.

Next, we calculate the number of outdoor plants: 75 plants * (2/3) = 50 plants.

Finally, we determine the number of flowering plants: 75 plants - 50 plants = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100%: 25 plants / 100 plants * 100% = 25%.


So the answer is 25%.

Now, how many times can he staple 30 reports in 900 minutes?  He staples every 15 minutes, so he can staple 900 minutes / 15 minutes/set = 60 times.

Finally, if he staples 30 reports each time, he'll staple a total of 60 sets * 30 reports/set = 1800 reports.

"Ahoy there, matey! Let's figure this out.

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 the second, and 8 the third.  That's a total of 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes.

They filled in 2 holes they kept fallin' into, so that leaves 31 - 2 = 29 holes.

The map says there were four times as many holes at the end of the first day as there were at the end of the first day.  That means there were 29 holes at the end of the first day.

To find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day, we need to know how many holes were there at the end of the first day.  But the problem says there were four times as many holes at the end of the first day as there were at the end of the first day.  That doesn't make sense!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

*  Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'W' Pokemon.
*  Stan caught 4 times that amount minus 13, so Stan caught (4W - 13) Pokemon.
*  Alex caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan, so Alex caught (4W - 13) + 5 = (4W - 8) Pokemon.

Together they caught 339 Pokemon, so:

W + (4W - 13) + (4W - 8) = 339

Combining like terms:

9W - 21 = 339

Adding 21 to both sides:

9W = 360

Dividing both sides by 9:

W = 40

Now we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon.  

Stan caught 4 times that amount minus 13:

(4 * 40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147

So Stan caught 147 Pokemon!

*  Then, it lost another 7% per hour for 3 hours, totaling 7 * 3 = 21% lost.

*  So, the final charge was 55% - 21% = 34% of the original amount.

*  We know this final 34% is equal to 28%, so we can set up an equation: 0.34x = 0.28

*  Solving for x (the original charge), we get x = 0.28 / 0.34 = 0.82 or 82%.



The power bank had an initial charge of **82%**.

First, we need to find out how much Jamaar spent on the fruit he already bought:

* Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
* Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
* Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
* Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Adding those up, he spent $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

The price of carrots goes up by 5% each year.  So, we need to calculate the increase each year and add it to the original price.

* **Year 1:** 5% of $120 is $6.  The price becomes $126.
* **Year 2:** 5% of $126 is $6.30. The price becomes $132.30.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Marcus has a 50% chance of having a substitute teacher who won't collect homework.  If his regular teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. Even if no one gets an extension, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing her his dog ate his homework.

So, what's the chance he *has* to turn it in?  Let's think about the opposite: when would he *not* have to turn it in?

*  He'd be free if he has a substitute.
*  He'd be free if his teacher gives an extension.
*  He'd be free if he convinces his teacher about the dog.

We need to figure out the chances of *none* of those things happening.

*  Chance of NO substitute: 100% - 50% = 50%
*  Chance of NO extension from the regular teacher: 100% - 40% = 60%
*  Chance of NOT convincing the teacher about the dog: 100% - 20% = 80%

Now, multiply those chances together: 50% * 60% * 80% = 24%

That means there's a 24% chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.

Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter total.  Since he gets half off on every pound he buys, he'll need to buy 6 pounds.  That means he'll pay full price for 3 pounds and half price for 3 pounds.

* Full price butter: 3 pounds * $4.00/pound = $12.00
* Half price butter: 3 pounds * $4.00/pound / 2 = $6.00

Adding those together, the total cost is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

"Let's figure this out!

*  Each monkey eats bananas for a whole week, so we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats each day.
*  The first monkey eats 10 bananas a day.
*  The second monkey eats 4 more than the first, so it eats 14 bananas a day.
*  That means the first two monkeys eat a total of 24 bananas each day (10 + 14 = 24).
*  Since there are 315 bananas total for the week, the third monkey eats the rest. 
*  To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total bananas by the number of days in a week and then divide that by 3.

Let me do the math: 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day. Then, 45 bananas / 3 monkeys = 15 bananas per day for each monkey.

If 40% of the school is made up of 240 boys, we can find the total number of students first.  

Think of it like this: 40% represents a portion of the whole school.  We know that portion is 240 boys.  To find the whole, we can set up a proportion:

40/100 = 240/total students

Cross-multiplying gives us:

40 * total students = 100 * 240

40 * total students = 24000

Divide both sides by 40 to find the total number of students:

total students = 600

"Let's break this problem down!

Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at a certain speed and 1 mile on the sidewalk at twice that speed.  We know she spends 40 minutes on the beach.

First, let's figure out her speed on the beach.  Since she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

On the sidewalk, she walks twice as fast, so her speed there is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, to find out how long it takes her to walk the mile on the sidewalk, we divide the distance by her speed: 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

Finally, add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk to find her total walk time: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.

"Let's help Phineas get home! 

First, we need to figure out how long it takes him to travel each half of the distance.  He hops 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards on land.  Since he hops at 20 yards per minute, that takes him 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

Then he swims 100 yards at 10 yards per minute, which takes him 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

Finally, we add his land and water travel times: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.


It will take Phineas **15** minutes to get home.

"Let's break down how many popcorn kernels Garrett gets to munch on!

*  He starts with 20 kernels popping in the first 30 seconds.
*  Then, three times that amount pop in the next 30 seconds: 20 * 3 = 60 kernels.
*  The popping rate increases to four times the initial amount for the next 30 seconds: 20 * 4 = 80 kernels.
*  In the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds: 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
*  And finally, a quarter of the kernels from the last 30 seconds pop from residual heat: 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

"Let's break this down!

Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.  Since he's making 5 gallons total (4 for the party + 1 for Allen), he'll need 5 cups of lemon juice.

He gets 1 cup of juice from 6 lemons, so he'll need 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.

Allen wants his lemonade to be twice as tart, so Tim needs to use double the lemon juice for that gallon. That means he'll need an extra 6 lemons for Allen's batch.

In total, Tim needs 30 lemons + 6 lemons = 36 lemons.

* **Year 2:** $6300 * 0.30 = $1890
* **Year 3:** $4410 * 0.20 = $882

Now, let's subtract the depreciation from the original price each year:

* **After Year 1:** $9000 - $2700 = $6300
* **After Year 2:** $6300 - $1890 = $4410
* **After Year 3:** $4410 - $882 = $3528
