"Here's how to determine Josh's profit:

First, we need to calculate the house's value after the renovations. A 150% increase on the original $80,000 means the value went up by $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.  

Adding this increase to the original price, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh's total investment was the purchase price plus the renovation costs: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

Finally, his profit is the difference between the selling price and his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.  

Let 'x' represent the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie possessed.

* At the green house, she sold x/3.
* At the red house, she sold 2 more, bringing the total sold to x/3 + 2.
*  This leaves her with x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners.
*  At the orange house, she sold half of the remaining stock:  ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.
*  We know she has 5 left, so (2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5
*  Simplifying, we get x/3 - 1 = 5
*  Adding 1 to both sides, we have x/3 = 6
*  Finally, multiplying both sides by 3, we find x = 18.



Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"Here's how to determine the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:

First, we calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20 students * 0.20 = 4 students.

This leaves 20 students - 4 students = 16 students who are not enrolled in contemporary dance.

Next, we find the number of students enrolled in jazz dance: 16 students * 0.25 = 4 students.

Finally, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 students - 4 students = 12 students.

Therefore, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%.

"To determine the most profitable purchase, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

**Jewelry:**

The jewelry's value is projected to increase by 2.5% of its initial price: $5000 * 0.025 = $125.  This means the jewelry's value at the end of the month would be $5000 + $125 = $5125.  The profit would then be $5125 - $5000 = $125.

**Electronic Gadgets:**

Similarly, the electronic gadgets are expected to increase in value by 1.2% of their initial price: $8000 * 0.012 = $96.  This brings their value to $8000 + $96 = $8096. The profit would be $8096 - $8000 = $96.


Therefore, the merchant would maximize their profit by purchasing the jewelry, resulting in a profit of $125.

"To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail, Marissa needs to consider the time already spent and the remaining distance. 

She's already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, which means her average speed so far is 3 mph (6 miles / 2 hours).  To reach an average of 4 mph, she needs to cover the remaining 6 miles at a faster pace.

Let's denote the speed she needs for the remaining distance as 'x' mph.  We can set up the following equation:

(6 miles / 3 mph) + (6 miles / x mph) = 12 miles / 4 mph

Simplifying the equation:

2 + (6/x) = 3

(6/x) = 1

x = 6

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

* **Define variables:** Let 'd' represent the number of dogs and 'c' represent the number of cats.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know c = 2d (two cats for every dog)
    * We know d + c - 12 = r (the number of rabbits is 12 less than the total dogs and cats)

* **Substitute to solve for the number of rabbits:**
    * Since c = 2d, we can substitute '2d' for 'c' in the second equation: d + 2d - 12 = r
    * This simplifies to 3d - 12 = r

* **Use the given information about dogs to find the number of rabbits:**
    * We know d = 60 (there are 60 dogs)
    * Substitute 60 for 'd' in the equation: 3 * 60 - 12 = r
    * This gives us 180 - 12 = r, so r = 168 rabbits

* **Calculate the total number of pets:**
    * Total pets = dogs + cats + rabbits
    * Total pets = 60 + (2 * 60) + 168

"Let's break down Sasha's lumber profit:

First, we need to determine the new prices for the lumber after the 50% price increase.  

* 2x4 boards: $10 * 1.50 = $15 per board
* 4x4 boards: $16 * 1.50 = $24 per board

Now, calculate the total revenue from selling each type of board:

* 2x4 boards: 10 boards * $15/board = $150
* 4x4 boards: 5 boards * $24/board = $120

Finally, add the revenue from both types of boards to find the total revenue:

"Let's break down this beehive problem step-by-step.

We're told there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees.  Let's use variables to represent each type of bee:

*  Let 'q' represent the number of queen bees.
*  Let 'b' represent the number of baby bees.
*  Let 'w' represent the number of worker bees.

We can express the relationships between these variables as equations:

* b = 2q  
* w = 2b

We also know the total number of bees is 700:

* q + b + w = 700

Now we can use substitution to solve for the number of worker bees (w).  

1. Substitute '2q' for 'b' in the second equation: w = 2(2q) = 4q

2. Substitute '2q' for 'b' and '4q' for 'w' in the third equation: q + 2q + 4q = 700

3. Combine like terms: 7q = 700

4. Solve for 'q': q = 100

5.  Substitute the value of 'q' back into the equation for 'b': b = 2 * 100 = 200

6. Substitute the value of 'b' into the equation for 'w': w = 2 * 200 = 400

"Let's break down this word problem step-by-step.

Let Seth's current age be represented by the variable 's' and Brooke's current age by 'b'.  We are given two key pieces of information:

1. **Seth is twice as old as Brooke:** This translates to the equation s = 2b.

2. **In two years, the sum of their ages will be 28:** This gives us the equation (s + 2) + (b + 2) = 28.

Now we can solve for 's', Seth's current age.  Substitute the first equation (s = 2b) into the second equation:

(2b + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Simplify and solve for 'b':

3b + 4 = 28
3b = 24
b = 8

Now that we know Brooke is 8 years old, we can find Seth's age using s = 2b:

s = 2 * 8
s = 16


Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"Let's break down this probability problem.

First, we need to determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a standard six-sided die. There are three favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of a total of six possible outcomes.  Therefore, the probability is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 50%.

Next, consider the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.  There are three even numbers on a die (2, 4, and 6).  The probability of rolling one even number is 3/6 or 1/2.  Since the die rolls are independent events, the probability of rolling another even number after the first is also 1/2.  To get the probability of both events happening, we multiply: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Finally, to find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50% - 25% = 25%.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let 's' represent the current amount of water in the small pool.  Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, the big pool has 4s gallons.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the amount of water the small pool had.  We know the rate of leakage is 4 gallons per minute, so both pools have lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons since then.

2. **Adrian's Age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

3. **Ages in Three Years:**  In three years:
   * Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
   * Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.
   * Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.

4. **Average Age:** The average age of the three in three years is (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 45 years old.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's represent the unknown:**  Let 'x' be the number of points Jojo scored.

* **Set up the equation:** We know the total score is 251 points.  We can express this as an equation: Naomi's score + Yuri's score + Brianna's score + Jojo's score = Total score.

* **Substitute known values:**
    * Naomi: 68 points
    * Yuri: (1/2 * Naomi's score) + 10 = (1/2 * 68) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 points
    * Brianna: Naomi's score + 17 = 68 + 17 = 85 points

* **Solve for x:** 68 + 44 + 85 + x = 251
                                  197 + x = 251
                                       x = 251 - 197
                                       x = 54


**Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the new number of water-type cards James has after losing some. He starts with 40 and loses 8, leaving him with 32 water-type cards.

Next, we need to account for the new grass-type cards he buys. He begins with 20 and adds 14, giving him a total of 34 grass-type cards.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cards James has: 30 fire + 34 grass + 32 water = 96 cards.

Finally, to find the percentage chance of picking a water-type card, we divide the number of water-type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100%: (32 / 96) * 100% = 33.33%.

Rounding to the nearest integer, the probability of picking a water-type card is **33%**.

*  *b* represent the number of bananas Jamal has

We are given the following information:

* Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal:  *a* = *a* - 8
* Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: *b* = *b* / 2
* Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: *b* = *a* + 4

We know Andrea has 52 apples, so we can substitute that into the first equation:

* 52 = *a* - 8

Solving for *a*, we find:

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Collar:** The collar requires 1/10 the stitches of the body, so it takes 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches.
* **Rosette:** The rosette requires twice the stitches of the collar, meaning it takes 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches.
* **Body, Collar, and Rosette Total:**  The total stitches for these parts are 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.
* **Sleeve Total:**  Since the entire sweater has 1800 stitches, the sleeves together account for 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.
* **Stitches per Sleeve:**  Finally, each sleeve requires 630 stitches / 2 = 315 stitches. 



Therefore, each sleeve takes **315** stitches.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.  

Let Ruby's current age be represented by 'R' and Sam's current age be 'S'. We are given two key pieces of information:

1. **Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:** This translates to the equation R = 6S.

2. **In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:** This can be expressed as R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now we have a system of two equations:

* R = 6S
* R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can solve for 'S' (Sam's current age) using substitution.  Substitute the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Simplify and solve for 'S':

6S + 9 = 3S + 27
3S = 18
S = 6



Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the number of spots on a single mamba. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 spots / 2 = 35 spots.

Next, we calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras: 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots.

Similarly, we find the total number of spots on all the mambas: 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots.

The total number of spots on all the snakes is the sum of the spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots.

Finally, half the total number of spots is 4900 spots / 2 = 2450 spots.

* **Senior Programmer Salary:** Senior programmers earn $400 more than junior programmers, who make $2000 per month.  Therefore, senior programmers earn $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

* **Total Junior Programmer Salary:** The total salary paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

* **Total Senior Programmer Salary:** The total salary paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

* **Total Programmer Salary:**  The company pays a total of $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000 to all programmers each month.

"Let's break down Oscar's lollipop journey step-by-step:

* **Initial amount:** Oscar begins with 24 lollipops.
* **School trip:** He eats 2, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
* **Sharing with friends:** He gives away 14, reducing his stash to 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
* **Shopping spree:**  He buys twice the number he gave away, acquiring 14 * 2 = 28 more lollipops.
* **Total after shopping:**  His collection now stands at 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
* **Evening snack:** He eats 3, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
* **Morning munchies:** He eats another 2, resulting in a final count of 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"Let's break down the problem:

* The customer earns $1 in rewards for every $20 spent.  Since they spent $80 on their last trip, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards.

* Each reward is worth $1, so they have a total of 4 * $1 = $4 in rewards.

* The coupon doubles the value of the rewards, meaning the discount is 2 * $4 = $8.

*  Subtracting the rewards and coupon discount from the original $43 purchase price, we get $43 - $4 - $8 = $31.



**Therefore, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.**

"Let's analyze each job's earnings to determine which offers a higher net pay.

**Job A:**

*  Gross income: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
*  Taxes: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
*  Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**

*  Gross income: $42,000
*  Property tax: $6,000
*  Net income before taxes: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
*  Taxes: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
*  Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net incomes, Job B offers a higher net pay of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000.  

Therefore, Nick will make $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the two larger groups.  Since the smallest group has 10 fewer students than the larger groups, it has 'x - 10' students.  

The total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms, we get:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

We know the ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  We also know their total popsicles amount to 165.

To find out how many popsicles each person has, we can think of the ratio as representing parts of a whole.  The total ratio parts are 5 + 6 = 11.  

Each ""part"" of the ratio is worth 165 popsicles / 11 parts = 15 popsicles.

Therefore, Betty has 5 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 75 popsicles.

And Sam has 6 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 90 popsicles.

Finally, to find the difference, we subtract Betty's popsicles from Sam's: 90 popsicles - 75 popsicles = 15 popsicles.




**Answer:** Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Here's how to calculate the total amount the company paid its employees:

First, we need to determine the number of employees working in June. Since 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, 10 employees left (40 employees * 0.25 = 10 employees). This leaves 30 employees working in June (40 employees - 10 employees = 30 employees).

Next, we calculate the total weekly earnings for each employee: $15 per hour * 40 hours per week = $600 per week.

Now we can calculate the total monthly earnings for each month:

* **May:** $600 per week * 4 weeks = $2400 per employee.  Total May earnings: $2400 * 40 employees = $96,000

* **June:** $600 per week * 4 weeks = $2400 per employee. Total June earnings: $2400 * 30 employees = $72,000

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries. We're given two key pieces of information:

* **Heads:** Each animal has one head, so c + d = 180 
* **Humps:** Camels have two humps, dromedaries have one, giving us the equation 2c + d = 304

We can solve this system of equations.  One way is using substitution:

1. Solve the first equation for 'c':  c = 180 - d

2. Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation: 2(180 - d) + d = 304

3. Simplify and solve for 'd': 360 - 2d + d = 304  =>  -d = -56  =>  d = 56



Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries in the herd.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

* **Define variables:** Let 'c' represent the number of candy bars George bought.

* **Set up the equation:** We know the following:
    * Each bag of chips costs $0.40, and he bought 3 bags, for a total of 0.40 * 3 = $1.20.
    * Each candy bar costs $0.75.
    * He spent $5.00 total and had 1% of his money left, meaning he spent 99% of his money.
    * We can express this mathematically as: 0.75c + 1.20 = 0.99 * 5.00

* **Solve for 'c':**
    * 0.75c + 1.20 = 4.95
    * 0.75c = 3.75
    * c = 5

Therefore, George bought **5** candy bars.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet.  Since there are 3 feet in a yard, a 3-yard length is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Next, we can use the area to find the width.  The area of a rectangle is length times width, so we have 360 square feet = 9 feet * width.  Dividing both sides by 9 feet, we find the width is 40 feet.

Finally, the perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and width: 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Initial Temperature:** 40 degrees
* **Temperature Increase:** The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour for 3 hours, resulting in a total increase of 15 degrees (5 * 3 = 15).
* **Temperature After Baking:**  The initial temperature plus the increase from baking is 55 degrees (40 + 15 = 55).
* **Temperature Decrease:** The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the house cools by 6 degrees (2 * 3 = 6).
* **Final Temperature:**  Subtracting the cooling effect from the temperature after baking gives us the final temperature of 49 degrees (55 - 6 = 49). 



**Therefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees.**

"Let's break down this triathlon problem step-by-step.

First, we need to figure out James' swim time. Since he's 10% faster than Jon, we can calculate that as 0.10 * 40 minutes = 4 minutes.  Therefore, James' swim time is 40 minutes - 4 minutes = 36 minutes.

Next, James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, meaning it takes him 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

Now we know Jon's total time is 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.  Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time was 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes.

Finally, we can determine James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time: 180 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 59 minutes.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

First, we need to determine the distance the horse covers.  Knowing the speed is 32 miles per hour and the time is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Next, we know the horse consumes half a bale of hay for every mile run.  Therefore, over 16 miles, it consumes:

Hay Consumption = 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales

Each bale of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:

Total Cost = 8 bales * $3/bale = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, giving him a total of:

Michael's Money = 6 bills * $5/bill = $30

Finally, we can calculate the change Michael receives:

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the volume of soil required for each raised bed.  Since each bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall, the volume is calculated as:

Volume = width x length x height = 2 ft x 8 ft x 2 ft = 32 cubic feet.

Next, we find the total volume of soil needed for all ten beds:

Total volume = volume per bed x number of beds = 32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Knowing that each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, we can calculate the number of bags required:

Number of bags = total volume / volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Finally, with each bag costing $12, the total cost of the potting soil is:

Total cost = number of bags x price per bag = 160 bags x $12/bag = $1920.

"To determine the number of guests that would make the two venues equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. 

Let 'x' represent the number of guests.

* **Venue 1:** The cost is a fixed $200 plus $5 per guest for food, so the total cost is $200 + $5x.
* **Venue 2:** The cost is $25 per guest, including food, so the total cost is $25x.

Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Subtracting $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Dividing both sides by $20:

x = 10


Therefore, **10 guests** would make the two venues equal in cost.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.  

Let  'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found, 'D' represent the number David found, and 'L' represent the number Lily found. We know:

*  L + D + B = 43 (The total number of insects)
*  L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
*  D = B / 2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)

We can use substitution to solve for L.  Since we know L = D + 7 and D = B/2, we can substitute these values into the first equation:

(D + 7) + D + B = 43

Now, substitute B/2 for D:

(B/2 + 7) + (B/2) + B = 43

Simplify the equation:

B + 7 + B = 43

Combine like terms:

2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find David's total:

D = B / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

Finally, we can find Lily's total:

L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16



**Answer:** Lily found 16 insects.

"To determine Andy's required daily calorie deficit, we first need to calculate the number of days between December 31st and July 19th.  This involves accounting for the days in each month:

* December: 31 days
* January: 31 days
* February: 28 days
* March: 31 days
* April: 30 days
* May: 31 days
* June: 30 days
* July: 19 days

"Here's how to solve this problem:

The oven consistently overshoots the set temperature by a fixed percentage.  Let's denote this percentage as 'p'.  We know that when set to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees.  This means:

450 * (1 + p/100) = 468

Solving for 'p':

1 + p/100 = 468/450 = 1.04
p/100 = 0.04
p = 4%

Now, for a recipe calling for 520 degrees, Maggie needs to adjust the setting to account for this 4% overshoot.  Let 'x' be the temperature she should set the oven to.  We have:

x * (1 + 0.04) = 520

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine Ruiz's hourly chocolate production rate. Since he makes 120 pounds in two hours, his hourly rate is 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.

Next, we find Marissa's hourly production rate. She makes 3/4 the amount Ruiz makes in two hours, which is (3/4) * 120 pounds = 90 pounds in two hours.  Therefore, her hourly rate is 90 pounds / 2 hours = 45 pounds per hour.

Now we can calculate their daily production. Ruiz makes 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds in a day. Marissa makes 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds in a day.

Finally, their combined daily production is 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds.

"Here's how to determine the tire lifespan:

First, we need to find the total rotations the tires undergo per year.  Since the car makes 725 rotations per 2 miles driven, over 400 miles, the tires rotate 400 miles * (725 rotations / 2 miles) = 145,000 rotations.

Therefore, the tires complete 145,000 rotations per month * 12 months per year = 1,740,000 rotations per year.

To find out how many years the tires last, we divide the total lifespan of the tires (10,440,000 rotations) by their annual rotation count: 10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years.

"Here's how to figure out the total cost of John's research:

First, we need to understand the funding pattern.  

*  The first 5 months are funded at a flat rate of $100,000 per month. That's a total of $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.

*  For the remaining 45 months, the funding increases by 50% each month. This means we're dealing with a geometric sequence.  

To calculate the total cost for those 45 months, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Where:

* S = the sum of the series (the total cost for the remaining months)
* a = the first term in the series (the funding for month 6, which is $150,000)
* r = the common ratio (the growth factor, which is 1.50 or 150%)
* n = the number of terms (45 months)

Plugging in the values:

S = $150,000 (1 - 1.50^45) / (1 - 1.50)

This calculation will give you a large number.  Add that result to the $500,000 from the first 5 months to get the total cost of John's research.

*  In the second month, sales were 3/4 of the first month's total, so they were (3/4) * $1.5x = $1.125x.

*  The total sales over two months are $1.5x + $1.125x = $2.625x.

*  We know red hat sales in the first month were $400, which is half the green hat sales, so $x = $400 * 2 = $800.

*  Therefore, the total sales over two months are $2.625 * $800 = $2100.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

*  s + g = 20  (The total number of heads)
*  4s + 2g = 70 (The total number of legs)

To solve for 's', we can use the substitution method.  Solving the first equation for 'g', we get:

g = 20 - s

Substituting this value of 'g' into the second equation:

4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Simplifying and solving for 's':

4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Subtracting 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Dividing both sides by 5:

t = 6

Now that we know one triplet is 6 years old, we can find the age of one twin:

t + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13

"Here's how to determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil will have saved after ten years:

First, we need to figure out how many coins Neil saves each month. He saves 2/5 times more than Rong's 20 coins, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8 coins.  Therefore, Neil saves a total of 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Next, we calculate their annual savings: Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins per year, and Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year = 336 coins per year.

Finally, we determine their total savings after ten years: Rong will have saved 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins, and Neil will have saved 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Adding their individual savings, they will have a combined total of 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

Now, we can solve for x:

* Subtract $40 from both sides: 0.60x = x - $40
* Subtract 0.60x from both sides: 0 = 0.40x - $40
* Add $40 to both sides: $40 = 0.40x

To reach their goal, they'll need to fundraise for an additional $4200 / $1400 per hour = 3 hours. 

Therefore, the total fundraising time will be 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

Colorado City uses 40% of the Colorado River's water.  If 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by following these steps:

1. **Calculate the water used for industrial purposes:** 40% * 80% = 32%

2. **Calculate the water used for non-industrial purposes:** 40% - 32% = 8%


Therefore, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

"Here's how to determine the total ice cream production:

First, we need to find the hourly production rate for each flavor. The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours, so the hourly rate for chocolate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

Similarly, they produce 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours, giving us a vanilla production rate of 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

To find the total hourly production, we add the rates for both flavors: 50 quarts/hour + 12.5 quarts/hour = 62.5 quarts per hour.

Finally, we multiply the total hourly production by the desired time frame: 62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts.



**Therefore, the factory would make a total of 3000 quarts of ice cream in 48 hours.**

"Let 'P' represent the total number of Pomeranians and 'T' represent the total number of puppies Jana has. We know:

* P/3 = 6 (One-third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 girls)
* P = 18 (Multiplying both sides of the equation by 3)
* P = (2/3)T (Two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians)

Substituting the value of P into the second equation:

18 = (2/3)T

Multiplying both sides by (3/2):

T = 27 



Therefore, Jana has **27** puppies.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let  'x' represent the number of shingle cases needed for the second house.  The first house requires half the amount of the second, so it needs x/2 cases. The third house needs double the amount of the first, meaning it needs 2*(x/2) = x cases.

The total number of shingle cases for all three houses is 250, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 + x + x = 250

Combining like terms, we get: 2.5x = 250

Dividing both sides by 2.5, we find x = 100.

Since the third house needs the same number of cases as the second house, it requires 100 cases of shingles.

"Let's break down the problem to calculate the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection:

* **Series Movies:**  Since a third of his movies are in series, he has 600 movies / 3 = 200 series movies.  He can purchase these series at a discounted rate of $6 per movie, so they cost him 200 movies * ($10 / 6) = $333.33.

* **Non-Series Movies:** This leaves him with 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 non-series movies.

* **Older Movies:**  Forty percent of these are older movies, meaning he has 400 movies * 0.40 = 160 older movies. These cost $5 each, totaling 160 movies * $5 = $800.

* **Remaining Movies:**  The remaining non-series movies are 400 movies - 160 movies = 240 movies.  These cost $10 each, for a total of 240 movies * $10 = $2400.

* **Total Cost:** Adding up the cost of all the movies, we get $333.33 + $800 + $2400 = $3533.33.



Therefore, replacing Mike's movie collection will cost him $3533.33.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step to determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma.

First, we need to define variables to represent the unknown quantities:

* Let 'x' represent the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
* Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies.
* Let 'y' represent the number of berries Emma collects.
* Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

Now, we can express each player's score based on the given point system:

* Emma's score: 10x + 5y + 30(timer) 
* Ava's score: 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(timer - 4)

To find the difference in their scores, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's score:

[10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(timer - 4)] - [10x + 5y + 30(timer)]

Simplifying the expression:

10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30timer - 120 - 10x - 5y - 30timer = -25


Therefore, the difference between their scores is **-25**.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

Let 'z' represent the number of ounces of citrus zest (and fragrance, since they are used in equal amounts).  Since the salt and sugar quantities are also equal, let 's' represent the number of ounces of both.  Finally, the oil amount is twice the salt amount, so oil is 2s ounces.

We know the total weight of the scrub in the jar is 10 ounces.  This gives us the equation:

z + z + s + s + 2s = 10

Simplifying the equation:

2z + 4s = 10

Since z = s, we can substitute:

2s + 4s = 10

Combining like terms:

6s = 10

Solving for s:

s = 10/6 = 5/3 ounces

Now, we can find the oil amount:

Oil = 2s = 2 * (5/3) = 10/3 ounces.




**Answer:** 10/3 ounces

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

* **Joe's initial car count:** Since Joe has twice the number of cars Robert has (20 cars), Joe begins with 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

* **Cars sold:** Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is calculated as 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.

* **Cars given away:** Joe donates twice the number of cars he sold, meaning he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

* **Total cars disposed of:**  Joe disposed of a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

* **Remaining cars:**  After selling and giving away cars, Joe has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.



**Therefore, Joe has 16 cars remaining.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let  'x' represent the number of cards PJ possesses.  Smendrick has three times the amount PJ has, meaning Smendrick has 3x cards.  Becca's collection is 12 cards larger than Smendrick's, so she has 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards across all three collections is 341.  This can be expressed as the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get: 7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides, we have: 7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7, we find: x = 47.

Therefore, PJ has 47 cards.  To determine Becca's collection, we substitute this value back into our expression for Becca's cards: 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153.



Becca has 153 cards.

    *  Substitute 'y' from the first equation: 4b + (b - 3) + s = 88
    *  Simplify: 5b + s = 91
    *  Substitute 'y' from the second equation: 5b + (y - 2) = 91
    *  Simplify: 5b + y = 93
    *  Solve for 'b':  5b = 93 - y  => b = (93 - y) / 5

* **Substitute the value of 'b' back into the equation y = b - 3:**

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

Let  'F' represent the number of books Fawn has, 'A' represent the number of books Anne has, and 'S' represent the number of books Sofie has. We are given the following information:

*  S + A + F = 85  
*  S = A + 25
*  A = F - 12

We can use substitution to solve for F.  Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

(A + 25) + A + F = 85

Simplifying, we have:

2A + F + 25 = 85

Further simplification:

2A + F = 60

Now, substitute the third equation into the above equation:

2(F - 12) + F = 60

Expanding:

2F - 24 + F = 60

Combining like terms:

3F - 24 = 60

Adding 24 to both sides:

3F = 84

Finally, divide both sides by 3 to isolate F:

F = 28



Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

"Let's analyze Kelly's grocery spending:

* **Bacon:**  The cost of 5 packs of bacon at $10 total is $2 per pack.
* **Chicken:** Each pack of chicken costs twice the price of a pack of bacon, so it costs $2 * 2 = $4.  The total cost of 6 packs of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.
* **Strawberries:**  3 packs of strawberries at $4 each cost 3 * $4 = $12.
* **Apples:** Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, or $4 / 2 = $2.  7 packs of apples cost 7 * $2 = $14.

Kelly's total spending is $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Therefore, she has $65 (budget) - $60 (spending) = $5 left in her budget.

"Here's how to calculate the total calories in Andrew's pastries:

First, we need to determine the calorie count for each type of mini pastry:

* **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:** A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini version has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

* **Mini Blueberry Muffins:** Similarly, a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal muffin, which is 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories for each type of pastry:

* **Total Cinnamon Roll Calories:** 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories
* **Total Blueberry Muffin Calories:** 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories

Finally, add the calories from both types of pastries to find the total:

* **Total Pastry Calories:** 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories

"Let's analyze the problem systematically.  

We're given that Peter, Paul, and Jean's combined age is 100 years.  We also know Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's ages.

Let's use variables to represent their ages:

*  Let Peter's age be represented by 'P'
*  Let Paul's age be represented by 'Pa'
*  Let John's age be represented by 'J'

Now we can formulate a system of equations based on the given information:

1. P + Pa + J = 100 
2. Pa = J + 10
3. P = Pa + J

To solve for Peter's age (P), we can use substitution.  

First, substitute equation 2 into equation 3:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Next, substitute both equation 2 (Pa = J + 10) and the modified equation 3 (P = 2J + 10) into equation 1:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Simplify and solve for J:

4J + 20 = 100
4J = 80
J = 20

Now, substitute the value of J (20) back into the equation P = 2J + 10 to find Peter's age:

P = (2 * 20) + 10
P = 40 + 10
P = 50



Therefore, Peter is 50 years old.

"Let's break down Fern's widget-making dilemma.  

First, we need to calculate the daily earnings for each machine. The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour at $6 each, so it makes 60 * 24 * 6 = $8640 per day. The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour, resulting in 45 * 24 * 6 = $6480 per day.

Next, we'll determine the monthly earnings.  Assuming a 30-day month, the Widgeteer 3000 earns 8640 * 30 = $259,200, while the WidgetMaster 9000 earns 6480 * 30 = $194,400 per month.

Finally, the difference in monthly earnings is $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.

"Let's break down Cameron's hotel stay to determine his savings.

He arrives at 5 pm and departs at 10 am the next day, making his stay a total of 17 hours.  The hotel offers a 12-hour rate of 1000 pesos or a 24-hour rate of 1600 pesos.  Since Cameron's stay exceeds 12 hours, he'll be charged the 1000 peso base rate plus an additional fee for the extra hours.

Each hour beyond the initial 12 costs 70 pesos.  He spends 17 hours - 12 hours = 5 extra hours.  This adds 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos to his bill.

Therefore, Cameron's total cost is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.  

He saves 1600 pesos (the 24-hour rate) - 1350 pesos (his actual cost) = 250 pesos.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine how much hay each sheep needs. We know a goat needs 5 pounds of hay, and a sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice that amount.  Twice the amount a goat needs is 5 pounds * 2 = 10 pounds.  Subtracting 3 pounds, we find that each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.

Then, we calculate the total hay needed for the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for both goats and sheep to find the total: 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.



Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay.

"Let's break down James's journey across the lake step-by-step.

First, he swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles.  At a speed of 2 miles per hour, this takes him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

Afterward, he rests for half the time he spent swimming, meaning he rests for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

He then swims the remaining 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.  However, he swims at half his usual speed, so his speed is now 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.  This takes him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

Finally, to find the total time, we add up the swimming time, resting time, and remaining swimming time: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.



**Therefore, it takes James 17 hours to cross the lake.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let 'x' represent the number of points Azibo scored.  Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati scored 'x + 20' points.  Dinar scored 10 fewer points than Bahati, so Dinar scored 'x - 10' points.

The total points scored by the team is 45, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 20) + (x - 10) = 45

Combining like terms, we get:

3x + 10 = 45

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

3x = 35

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 11.67 (approximately)



Therefore, Azibo scored approximately 11.67 points.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.  To find the total number of reports stapled over a period of time, we need to figure out how many 15-minute intervals are within that time.

First, we need to calculate the total time in minutes. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours, which is equal to 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Next, we divide the total time in minutes by the length of each interval: 900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

Finally, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports stapled per interval: 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.



**Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports.**

"Let's analyze this Pokemon-catching scenario.  We'll use variables to represent the number of Pokemon each person caught:

*  Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
*  Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
*  Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

We're given the following information, which we can translate into equations:

*  A + S + W = 339  (The total number of Pokemon caught)
*  A = S + 5         (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4W - 13       (Stan caught 13 less than four times Adelwolfe's catch)

To find Stan's catch (S), we can use substitution.  First, substitute the expressions for 'A' and 'W' from the second and third equations into the first equation:

(S + 5) + S + (S - 13)/4 = 339

Now, solve for 'S'.  Multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

4S + 20 + S + (S - 13) = 1356

Combine like terms:

6S + 7 = 1356

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6S = 1349

Finally, divide both sides by 6:

S = 224.83

Since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, we'll round to the nearest whole number. 



**Stan caught 225 Pokemon.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Define variables:** Let 'R' represent the number of cherries Robert has, 'J' represent the number of cherries Jerry has, and 'I' represent the number of cherries Richard has.

* **Set up equations:** We know the following:
    * R + J + I = 60 (The total number of cherries)
    * R = I + 10 (Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard)
    * R = 30 (Robert has 30 cherries)

* **Solve for J:**  Since we know R = 30, we can substitute that into the second equation to find I: 30 = I + 10.  Therefore, I = 20.  Now we can plug both R and I into the first equation: 30 + J + 20 = 60.  This simplifies to J + 50 = 60, so J = 10.

* **Find the difference:** Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, so Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"Here's how to determine the total cost:

Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we first need to calculate the discount amount.  A 40% discount on a $100 car is (40/100) * $100 = $40.  

This means the red car costs $100 - $40 = $60.

Finally, the total cost of both cars is $100 + $60 = $160.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let  *d* represent Emil's dad's current age and *b* represent his brother's current age.

We know:

* Emil is currently 19 years old.
* In 5 years, Emil will be 24.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

*  d - 5 = 2(24)  (Dad's age in 5 years will be twice Emil's age in 5 years)
*  b - 5 = 24 / 2 (Brother's age in 5 years will be half Emil's age in 5 years)

Simplifying these equations:

* d - 5 = 48
* b - 5 = 12

Solving for *d* and *b*:

* d = 53
* b = 17

Finally, the sum of their ages is d + b = 53 + 17 = 70.




**Therefore, the sum of Emil's dad and brother's ages now is 70.**

"Let's break down Pat's flower bed dilemma:

First, we need to determine the total space available for planting.  The flower bed is 111 feet long, which translates to 1332 inches (111 feet * 12 inches/foot).  However, Pat needs 1.5 feet (18 inches) of space between each plant, so we subtract that from the total length: 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

This means Pat can fit 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants. Since Pat can't buy half a plant, she'll need to purchase 110 plants.

She already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 more plants.

Finally, each plant costs $6, so Pat will spend 93 plants * $6/plant = $558 at the store.

Simplifying:

4x + 4x = 6
8x = 6
x = 0.75

Therefore, each adult receives 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 slices.

The percentage of watermelon each adult gets is (1.5 slices / 6 total slices) * 100% = 25%.

The revenue from the small stuffed animals is 2x * $4 = $8x.  The revenue from the large stuffed animals is x * $12 = $12x.  

Her total revenue is the sum of these two amounts: $8x + $12x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get $20x = $120.  Dividing both sides by $20, we find x = 6.

Therefore, Teresa sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Iron Pickaxe Output:** A dwarf mines twice as much with an iron pickaxe compared to their bare hands, so they produce 12 pounds * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day.

* **Steel Pickaxe Output:**  A steel pickaxe increases output by 50% compared to the iron pickaxe, meaning an additional 24 pounds * 0.50 = 12 pounds of ore per day.  Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 24 pounds + 12 pounds = 36 pounds of ore per day.

* **Collective Output:** With 40 dwarves each mining 36 pounds of ore per day, their total daily output is 40 dwarves * 36 pounds/dwarf = 1440 pounds.

* **Monthly Output:** Over a 30-day month, they mine a total of 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = 43,200 pounds of ore.




**Answer:** 43,200 pounds

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

First, we need to determine Jim's total debt.  He took out $50,000 in loans each year for four years, so his total loan amount is $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Next, we need to factor in the income he forgoes by attending college.  He was making $25,000 per year before college, so over four years, he loses out on $25,000 * 4 = $100,000 in potential earnings.

Therefore, Jim needs to earn back a total of $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

After graduating, his income triples to $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

Finally, to determine how long it takes to repay his debt and lost income, we divide the total amount owed by his new annual income: $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

"Here's how to calculate the car's price in 2010:

The car depreciates by 21% each year.  This means we can model the car's value over time using the following formula:

*  Value in year t = Value in year 0 * (1 - depreciation rate)^t

Where:

* Value in year 0 is the initial price of $20000
* Depreciation rate is 0.21 (21%)
* t is the number of years passed

To find the value in 2010, we need to calculate for t = 3 (since 2010 is 3 years after 2007):

* Value in 2010 = $20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3 
* Value in 2010 = $20000 * (0.79)^3

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

First, determine the cost of the roses. Since a dozen roses costs $15, and Jenny bought 15 roses, she purchased 1.25 dozens (15 roses / 12 roses per dozen = 1.25 dozens).  Multiplying that by the price per dozen gives us a total cost of $18.75 (1.25 dozens * $15 per dozen = $18.75).

Next, calculate Jenny's change. She paid with five $5 bills, totaling $25 ($5 * $5 = $25), and the roses cost $18.75.  Subtracting the cost of the roses from the amount paid gives us her change: $6.25 ($25 - $18.75 = $6.25).

"Here's how to determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received:

First, we need to find the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch: 75% of $2000 is (0.75) * $2000 = $1500.

Then, calculate the selling price: 120% of $1500 is (1.20) * $1500 = $1800.

Finally,  the discount is the original price minus the selling price: $2000 - $1800 = $200.

To express this as a percentage of the original price, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%.



**Therefore, Mr. Rogers' friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price.**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

Let 'x' represent the length of fence Sam receives.  Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry receives 'x + 60' feet.  

The total length of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combining like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 20

Therefore, Sam receives 20 feet of fence.

"Let's break down Marcel's bicycle sales to calculate his total earnings.

First, we know a BMX bike costs half the price of an MTB, which is $500.  Therefore, a BMX bike costs $250.

Next, we can determine the number of each bike type sold:

* Trekking bikes: Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so he sold 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.
* BMX bikes: 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, meaning he sold 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.
* MTB bikes:  The remaining bikes must be MTBs, so he sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, we can calculate the earnings from each type:

* Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
* BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
* MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

Finally, we add up the earnings from each type to find Marcel's total earnings: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

* **Extra classes:** He takes 2 extra classes of 40 minutes each, adding another 80 minutes per day (2 * 40 = 80).  Weekly, this is 400 minutes (80 * 5 = 400).
* **Total class time:**  His total weekly class time is 1600 minutes (1200 + 400 = 1600).
* **Weekend learning:** He dedicates 1/16 of his total weekly class time to extra learning on weekends, which is 100 minutes per day (1600 / 16 = 100).
* **Total weekend learning:** Over two days, this amounts to 200 minutes (100 * 2 = 200).
* **Grand total:**  His total weekly learning time is 1800 minutes (1600 + 200 = 1800).

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area to be painted.  

The north and south walls each have an area of 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.  The east and west walls each have an area of 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.  

Therefore, the total area of all four walls is (80 sq ft * 2) + (40 sq ft * 2) = 160 sq ft + 80 sq ft = 240 square feet.

Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, Tony will need 240 sq ft / 20 sq ft/gallon = 12 gallons of paint.

At a cost of $12 per gallon, the total cost to paint the room will be 12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

First, we need to determine the usable length of the tree.  Since John can make logs from 80% of the tree, he has 0.80 * 80 feet = 64 feet of usable wood.

Next, we calculate the number of logs he can create.  Dividing the usable wood length by the length of each log, we get 64 feet / 4 feet/log = 16 logs.

Each log yields 5 planks, so he'll have a total of 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks.

Finally, his earnings are calculated by multiplying the number of planks by the price per plank: 80 planks * $1.20/plank = $96.00.



Therefore, John makes $96.00 from selling the planks.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine Grandma's speed on the beach. We know she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, so her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed there is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk: 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

Finally, the total time for her 3-mile walk is 40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes.

"Let's break down this problem:

Donny needs his water to be at least 40 degrees.  He mixes water from two mugs: one at 33 degrees and another of unknown temperature (let's call it 'x').  After adding 4 ounces of the 33-degree water and 1 ounce of the unknown water, he can finally drink it.  This means the mixture must have a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

We can express this mathematically:

(4 ounces * 33 degrees) + (1 ounce * x degrees) >= (5 ounces * 40 degrees)

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x >= 68


Therefore, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

"Here's how to calculate the total number of animals on the farm:

First, we need to determine the increase in the number of cows and chickens over the three weeks.

* **Cows:** Milkie Cows Limited delivers 20 cows per day for 21 days (3 weeks * 7 days/week), resulting in a total increase of 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.  Adding this to the initial 50 cows, the farm will have 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows.

* **Chickens:** Broilers Limited delivers 10 chickens per day for 21 days, resulting in a total increase of 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens. Adding this to the initial 20 chickens, the farm will have 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens.

Finally, to find the total number of animals, we add the number of cows and chickens: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.



**Therefore, there will be a total of 700 animals on the farm after three weeks.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let  'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so its length is 'y - 7'.  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, making its length '4(y - 7)'.

We know the total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  This can be expressed as the equation:

"Here's how to determine the percentage of James' teeth the dentist fixes:

First, we need to find the total number of teeth the dentist works on.  He drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, meaning he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.  

In total, the dentist fixes 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

To express this as a percentage of his total teeth, we divide the number of fixed teeth by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100%: (15 / 30) * 100% = 50%

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Define Variables:**

* Let Wendy's current age be represented by the variable 'w'.
* Let Colin's current age be represented by the variable 'c'.

**Formulate Equations:**

We can translate the given information into two equations:

*  ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now"":  w = 5(c + 7)
*  ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now"": c + 25 = (1/3)w

**Solve the System of Equations:**

We now have two equations with two unknowns, which we can solve simultaneously.  One approach is to use substitution.  

1. Solve the first equation for 'w':
   w = 5c + 35

2. Substitute this expression for 'w' into the second equation:
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

3. Simplify and solve for 'c':
   3c + 75 = 5c + 35
   40 = 2c
   c = 20

**Answer:** Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Here's how to determine the time it takes Jay to make 60 snowballs:

First, we need to account for the snowballs that melt.  Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, he loses 8 snowballs per hour (2 snowballs/15 minutes * 4 sets of 15 minutes per hour = 8 snowballs/hour).

This means Jay effectively makes a net of 12 snowballs per hour (20 snowballs made - 8 snowballs lost = 12 snowballs/hour).

To reach 60 snowballs, it will take him 5 hours (60 snowballs / 12 snowballs/hour = 5 hours).

"Let's break down this word problem:

We know John is currently 28 years old.  We also know that when Digimon first came out, John was twice as old as Jim.  This means we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between their ages.

Let Jim's current age be represented by the variable 'j'.  Since John was twice Jim's age when Digimon premiered, we can say:

John's age at Digimon's release = 2 * Jim's age at Digimon's release

We know John is 28 now, so his age at Digimon's release was 28 - 20 = 8 years younger.  

Therefore:

8 = 2 * j

Solving for j, we get:

j = 4


**Answer:** Jim is currently 4 years old.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

First, we need to determine the jar's volume: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Next, we account for packing efficiency.  Since the jelly beans aren't perfectly arranged, we multiply the jar's volume by 80%: 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

This gives us the volume the jelly beans actually occupy.  We can then find the maximum number of jelly beans that could fit by dividing the occupied volume by the volume of a single jelly bean: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

Finally, we estimate the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by the percentage given: 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

The difference between Tim's estimate and the actual number of red jelly beans is 864 - 900 = -36.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.  A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower, meaning it has 0.50 * 36 = 18 additional seeds.  Therefore, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.  

The total number of sunflower seeds is 36 + 54 = 90. 



90

"Let's analyze Jake's shopping trip step-by-step.

First, the buy-one-get-one-half-off deal on the T-shirts means Jake effectively pays $8 for one T-shirt and $4 for the second.  This brings the total cost of the T-shirts to $12.

Next, the shoes are 40% off their original price of $40.  This discount amounts to $16, leaving a final price of $24 for the shoes.

Finally, to find the total amount Jake spends, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

"Let's break down Tim's honey and jam business to determine his profit.

First, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients per jar:

* Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
* Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
* Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20
* Total cost per jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Next, we find the profit per jar:

* Profit per jar: $50 (selling price) - $44 (cost) = $6

Finally, we calculate the total profit for 10 jars:

* Total profit: $6/jar * 10 jars = $60




Therefore, Tim makes a profit of $60 selling 10 jars.

* His total earnings are $30 + $42 = $72. 



"
"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

First, we need to determine the total number of holes dug by the dog: 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

Next, we calculate Nate's net progress each day: he fills 9 holes while the dog digs 6, resulting in a net gain of 3 holes filled per day.

To find the total days it takes Nate to fill all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by his daily progress: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

Finally, we convert the number of days to weeks: 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.



Therefore, it takes Nate **4** weeks to fill in all the holes.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let  'x' represent Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.  Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, his speed is 2x.

We know Aaron runs 2 miles (half the distance Vanessa runs) in 16 minutes.  Therefore:

2 / (2x) = 16

Simplifying the equation:

1 / x = 8

This means Vanessa's speed (x) is 1/8 miles per minute.

To find Vanessa's total time, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Vanessa runs 4 miles at a speed of 1/8 miles per minute:

Time = 4 / (1/8) = 32 minutes.



**Answer:** Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her part.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Dora's age:** Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
* **James's age:** James is twice Dora's age, meaning he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* **John's youngest son's age:** John had James when he was 19, and James is currently 18. This means John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.  John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.
* **John's youngest son's age in 3 years:** In three years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Here's how to determine the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm:

Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows. We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

*  c + w = 20  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

To solve for 'c', we can use the substitution method.  Solving the first equation for 'w', we get:

w = 20 - c

Substituting this value of 'w' into the second equation:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplifying and solving for 'c':

2c + 80 - 4c = 70
-2c = -10
c = 5


Therefore, there are **5** chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.
