"As-salamu alaykum! Let's break this problem down together.

Let's say Melanie started with 'x' vacuum cleaners.

* At the green house, she sold x/3.
* At the red house, she sold 2 more.
*  That leaves her with (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners.
* At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.

Now we know she has 5 left, so:

(2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

Simplifying:

x/3 - 1 = 5

Adding 1 to both sides:

x/3 = 6

Multiplying both sides by 3:

x = 18

The merchant has two choices:

* **Option 1:** Jewelry worth $5,000 expected to increase by 2.5%
* **Option 2:** Electronic gadgets worth $8,000 expected to increase by 1.2%

To figure out the most profitable choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

**Option 1 (Jewelry):**

* Increase in value: $5000 * 0.025 = $125
* Total value at the end of the month: $5000 + $125 = $5125
* Profit: $5125 - $5000 = $125

**Option 2 (Electronic Gadgets):**

* Increase in value: $8000 * 0.012 = $96
* Total value at the end of the month: $8000 + $96 = $8096
* Profit: $8096 - $8000 = $96

"As-salamu alaykum! Let's break this problem down.

Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11, meaning for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11.  Their total age is 162.  

Let's say Darrell's age is 7*x* and Allen's age is 11*x*.  We know:

Dividing both sides by 2: s = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

* Julia started with some spoons, then bought more.
* Her husband gave her 5 more.
* She used 3 spoons.
* In the end, she had 12 spoons.

2. Before her husband gave her spoons, she had 9 - 5 = 4 spoons.

So, Julia bought a package of **4** spoons.

We know there are 700 bees in total.  There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens.  

Let's think about it step-by-step:

* **Queens:**  Let's say there are 'q' queen bees.
* **Babies:** Since there are twice as many babies as queens, there are 2q baby bees.
* **Workers:**  And since there are twice as many worker bees as babies, there are 2 * (2q) = 4q worker bees.

Now we can add up all the bees: q + 2q + 4q = 700

That simplifies to 7q = 700

To find 'q', we divide both sides by 7: q = 100

So, there are 100 queen bees.

Now we can find the number of worker bees: 4q = 4 * 100 = 400


There are **400** worker bees.

* **Rolling two even numbers in a row:**  There are three even numbers (2, 4, and 6). The chance of rolling one even number is 3 out of 6, or 1/2.  Since the rolls are separate, we multiply those chances together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

* **The difference:**  We subtract the smaller chance from the bigger chance: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

* **Percentage:**  To express 1/4 as a percentage, we multiply by 100%: (1/4) * 100% = 25%




So the answer is **25%**.

* Let 'f' represent the number of fish in each aquarium.  Since there are two aquariums, there are 2*f fish in total.

*  So, we have the equation: 28 = 2 * (2*f)

* Simplifying the equation: 28 = 4*f

*  Dividing both sides by 4: 28 / 4 = f

*  Therefore, there are f = 7 fish in each aquarium.

"Let's figure this out!

* The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and it takes 6 hours a day, so that's $250 * 6 = $1500 per day.

*  She does makeup 4 days a week, so that's $1500 * 4 = $6000 per week.

* Over the 5 weeks of filming, that's $6000 * 5 = $30000.

*  Since Jean gets a 10% discount, she saves $30000 * 0.10 = $3000.

*  So, Jean pays $30000 - $3000 = $27000 in total.

First, let's figure out how many cookies Sue ate. On Monday, she ate 4 times the number her sister ate, who had 5 cookies. So Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

Then, on Tuesday, Sue ate twice the number her sister ate, who had 13 cookies. So Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies in total.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.

Her sister ate 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

Farmer Brown has 60 animals, which are either chickens or cows.  He has twice as many chickens as cows.  To find the total number of legs, we need to figure out how many of each animal he has and then multiply that by the number of legs each animal has.

Let's say 'c' represents the number of cows. Since he has twice as many chickens, he has 2c chickens.  

We know the total number of animals is 60: c + 2c = 60

"Let's break this down.  Erin scored 14 points and now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8.  

First, find out how many points Erin has in total: 14 + 8 = 22 points.

Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, we know that three times Sara's score (8) is equal to Erin's original score plus her 14 points.  

So, 3 * 8 = x + 14

This simplifies to 24 = x + 14.

To find Erin's original score (x), subtract 14 from both sides: 24 - 14 = x

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before.

For the bike, Jon took 80 minutes, and James took 5 minutes longer, so James biked for 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know Jon finished in 170 minutes (40 + 80 + 50) and James finished 10 minutes later. This means James' total time was 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

* With the buy one get one free deal, she effectively pays for one pack, which is $4.00.
* She also has a $2.00 coupon, so she saves another $2.00.
* That means she pays $2.00 for 8 razors.

First, we need to find the total height of the pyramid.

* The next layer has 3 cheerleaders at 64 inches each, for a total of 3 * 64 = 192 inches.
* The layer above that has 2 cheerleaders at 64 inches each, making 2 * 64 = 128 inches.
* Finally, the top cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

Adding all these heights together: 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches.

Now, to convert inches to feet, we divide by 12: 636 inches / 12 inches/foot = 53 feet.

B + (B/2) + 7 = 43

Now, let's solve for B:

* (3/2)B + 7 = 43

* B = 24 

Since Lily found (B/2) + 7 insects, she found (24/2) + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.

First, we know John's research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so it lasted a total of 5 * 10 = 50 months.

After the first 5 months, his funding increased by 50% each month.  This means each month's funding was 1.5 times the previous month's.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the funding for each of those 50 months and add them up. That's a bit tedious to do by hand, but we can use a formula to make it easier. 

Let me know if you'd like me to walk through the formula and calculate the final cost for you.

Finally, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate: 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.


**Answer:** 12 days

* James starts with 4 dogs and needs one toy per dog, so he has enough for them.
* Then 8 more dogs arrive, making a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
*  He needs to buy toys for all 12 dogs.
* When he comes back, there are twice as many dogs, meaning there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
*  He needs to buy enough toys for 24 dogs.
* Finally, 3 dogs leave, leaving him with 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

So James needs 21 toys in total.

*  Let 'x' represent the original length of the dress.

*  Extending the dress by 50% means adding 0.50x to its length.

*  The total length after the extension is x + 0.50x = 1.50x

*  Adding the lace trim makes the dress 1.50x + 20cm long.

*  We know this final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 1.50x + 20 = 140

*  Subtracting 20cm from both sides gives us: 1.50x = 120cm

*  Finally, dividing both sides by 1.50, we find the original length: x = 80cm




**Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm.**

"Let's break this problem down:

* The vaccines cost $20 each, and John needs two, so that's $20 * 2 = $40.

* The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.  Let's say the total bill is 'x'.  This means 0.60x = cost of the heartworm check.

* The total bill is the cost of the vaccines plus the heartworm check: $40 + 0.60x = x

*  To solve for x, let's subtract $40 from both sides: 0.60x = x - $40

*  Now, subtract 0.60x from both sides: 0 = 0.40x - $40

*  Add $40 to both sides: $40 = 0.40x

*  Finally, divide both sides by 0.40: x = $100

*  John brought $125 and the bill was $100, so he has $125 - $100 = $25 left.

* **Billy's Raises:** Billy got a raise of $0.50 per hour after two months and another $1.00 per hour on his anniversary.

* **Billy's Final Hourly Rate:**  His final hourly rate is $10 + $0.50 + $1.00 = $11.50

* **Sally's Starting Rate:** Sally starts at $0.50 more than Billy's original rate, so she makes $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

* **Earnings:**
    * Billy earns $11.50/hour * 20 hours = $230
    * Sally earns $10.50/hour * 20 hours = $210

* **The Difference:** Billy earns $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Jack's playtime:** Jack plays for 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes. Since he plays for 20 minutes per quarter, he uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

* **Weaker friends' playtime:** Each of the weaker friends plays for half as long as Jack, meaning they play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They play for a total of 2 friends * (240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter) = 48 quarters.

* **Better friend's playtime:** The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. They use 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

* **Total quarters:**  Adding up the quarters used by everyone, we get 12 quarters + 48 quarters + 8 quarters = 68 quarters.

"Let's break this problem down.  Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar.  She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

*  Let's say 'x' represents the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance).
*  Since salt and sugar are equal, they also use 'x' ounces.
*  Oil is twice the amount of salt, so oil is 2x ounces.

"Mr. Jackson needs to buy enough glue sticks for 27 students, and each student needs 2 glue sticks.  That means he needs 27 * 2 = 54 glue sticks.

Since each pack has 8 glue sticks, he'll need to buy 54 / 8 = 6.75 packs.  

Because he can't buy parts of packs, he'll need to buy 7 packs to make sure all the students have enough glue sticks.

If 10 people are infected and each infects 6 others each day, we can calculate the total infected after three days like this:

* **Day 1:** 10 people
* **Day 2:** 10 * 6 = 60 new infections, for a total of 10 + 60 = 70 people
* **Day 3:** 70 * 6 = 420 new infections, for a total of 70 + 420 = 490 people

So, there will be 490 people infected after three days.

"Let's break this problem down:

* Claire earns 1 badge per month.
* Amber takes twice as long as Claire, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months.

"Let's figure this out!

* Let F be the number of books Fawn has.
* Let A be the number of books Anne has.
* Let S be the number of books Sofie has.

We know:

* S + A + F = 85 (Total books)
* S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more than Anne)
* A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer than Fawn)

Let's substitute to solve for F:

1. Since S = A + 25, we can write: (A + 25) + A + F = 85

2.  Simplifying: 2A + F + 25 = 85

3.  We also know A = F - 12, so substitute that in: 2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85

4.  Expanding: 2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85

5.  Combining like terms: 3F + 1 = 85

6.  Subtracting 1 from both sides: 3F = 84

7.  Finally, dividing both sides by 3: F = 28



Fawn has 28 books.

"As-salamu alaykum! Let's figure this out together.

We know Peter, Paul, and Jean's combined age is 100 years.  Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages.

Let's use some variables:

* Peter's age: P
* Paul's age: Pa
* John's age: J

We can write these facts as equations:

* P + Pa + J = 100
* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

Now, let's use substitution to solve for Peter's age (P):

1. Since Pa = J + 10, we can substitute that into the equation P = Pa + J:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. Now substitute both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. Simplify and solve for J:
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4. Finally, substitute the value of J (20) back into the equation P = 2J + 10:
   P = (2 * 20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10
   P = 50

First, we need to see how many widgets each machine makes in a day:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day

*  Emil is 19 now and will be 24 in 5 years.
*  When Emil is 24, he'll be half his dad's age, so his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
*  His dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.
*  When Emil is 24, his brother will be half his age, meaning 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

First, we need to figure out how many plants Pat needs.  Her flower bed is 111 feet long, and each plant needs 12 inches of space, plus 1.5 feet between each plant.  

Let's convert everything to inches:

* 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches
* 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches

So, the total space needed for plants is 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

Now, divide the total space by the space each plant needs: 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants. Since Pat can't have half a plant, she needs 110 plants.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants.

Each plant costs $6, so she'll spend 93 plants * $6/plant = $558.


Pat will spend $558 at the store.

"Let's break this problem down:

*  The air conditioner cools 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high.
*  The room warms up 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.

First, the air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.

Then, it switches to high for 4 hours, cooling it an additional 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.

That's a total of 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees of cooling.

However, while the air conditioner is off for 2 hours, the room warms up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

*  Over the next 3 hours, it lost another 7% per hour, for a total loss of 7 * 3 = 21%.

*  The final charge was 28%, so we can set up the equation: 55% - 21% = 28%

"Alright, let's break this down. Jim took out $200,000 in loans over 4 years of college.  He also missed out on making $25,000 per year for those 4 years, which adds up to another $100,000.  So, he needs to make back a total of $300,000.

After college, his salary tripled to $75,000 per year.  To figure out how long it takes to pay back the loans and lost income, we divide the total amount owed by his new salary:

$300,000 / $75,000 per year = 4 years.

If one train travels 60 miles per hour and the other travels half that speed, the slower train travels 30 miles per hour.  

In three hours, the faster train will have traveled 60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

*  Let's say Arnold and Madeline each painted 'a' eggs.
*  Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's say Sarah painted 's' eggs, so Camden painted 's + 12' eggs.

Now we can set up some equations:

* Arnold and Madeline together painted 2a eggs.
* Camden and Sarah together painted s + (s + 12) = 2s + 12 eggs.
*  The total number of eggs painted is 2a + 2s + 12 = 56

We can simplify the last equation:

* 2a + 2s = 44
* a + s = 22

Since we know Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, we can substitute 's + 12' for Camden's eggs in the equation:

* a + s = 22
* a + (s + 12) = 22 + 12
* a + (s + 12) = 34

Now we know that Camden painted 34 eggs.  To find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, subtract Arnold's eggs:

* 34 - a = ? 

We need to find the value of 'a' (Arnold's eggs) to solve this.  We can use the equation a + s = 22.  Since we know s = 9 (from the problem), we can substitute:

* a + 9 = 22
* a = 13

Let's break it down:

*  We know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
*  All three ropes together are 37 centimeters long.

Let's use 'y' to represent the length of the yellow rope.  This means the blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long, and the red rope is 4 * (y - 7) centimeters long.

Now we can set up an equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

So the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.  

Now we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20

Therefore, the red rope is 20 centimeters long.

We know Rissa had $15 - x left, and that's equal to 4/5 of her original amount.  So:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides:

-x = -3

Multiplying both sides by -1:

x = $3

"As-salamu alaykum! Let me help you with this problem.

First, we need to find the total volume of the jar: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans aren't perfectly packed, we need to account for that 80% efficiency: 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, let's figure out how many jelly beans could fit in that space: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

Tim thinks 30% of those are red, so he'd estimate 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

Finally, the actual number is 900, so the difference is 900 - 864 = 36.
