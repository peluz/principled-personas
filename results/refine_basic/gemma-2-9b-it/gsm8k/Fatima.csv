"Okay, let's break this down!

Josh spent $80,000 on the house and $50,000 on repairs, for a total investment of $130,000.  The repairs increased the house value by 150% of the original price, which is $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.  

So the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

His profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Let's break this problem down.  

*  Melanie started with some number of vacuum cleaners, let's call that number 'x'.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3 of her vacuum cleaners.

*  Then she sold 2 more at the red house.

*  After the green and red houses, she had some left over. She sold half of *that* amount at the orange house.

*  We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners left in the end.

Let's use that information to work backwards:

*  Before the orange house, she had 5 + (half of what she sold at the orange house) vacuum cleaners.

*  Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, that means before the orange house she had 5 + (half of what she sold at the orange house) = 5 + (x/3 - 1) = (x/3) + 4 vacuum cleaners.

*  Before the red house, she had (x/3) + 4 + 2 = (x/3) + 6 vacuum cleaners.

*  Before the green house, she had (x/3) + 6 + (x/3) = (2x/3) + 6 vacuum cleaners.

*  And since she started with 'x' vacuum cleaners, we know (2x/3) + 6 = x

Now we can solve for x:

*  Subtract (2x/3) from both sides: 6 = x/3
*  Multiply both sides by 3: 18 = x



**Answer:** Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

* **Option 1:** Jewelry worth $5,000 that's predicted to increase by 2.5%
* **Option 2:** Electronic gadgets worth $8,000 that are predicted to increase by 1.2%

To find the most profitable option, we need to calculate the potential profit for each:

**Option 1 (Jewelry):**

If Kyle got a 25% discount on a book that cost $19.50, we can think of that $19.50 as 75% of the original price (because 100% - 25% = 75%).

We can use substitution to solve for 'g'. Since we know g = s + 30, we can substitute that into the first equation:

Now we can simplify and solve for 's':

2s + 30 = 110
2s = 80
s = 40

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

g = s + 30

"Hi!  Let's figure this out.  

If the team lost some games and won 8 more than they lost, we can use algebra to find the answer.  Let's say they lost 'L' games.  That means they won 'L + 8' games.

Since they played a total of 22 games, we can write the equation:

L + (L + 8) = 22

Combining like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Dividing both sides by 2:

L = 7

So they lost 7 games.  To find out how many they won, we add 8:

7 + 8 = 15

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

There are three numbers on a die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6).  That means there's a 3 out of 6 chance, or 50%, of rolling a number bigger than 3.

Now, for rolling two even numbers in a row, think about it this way:

*  You have to roll an even number first (2, 4, or 6 - that's a 50% chance).
*  Then, you have to roll another even number (again, 50% chance).

To get the chance of both happening, we multiply those probabilities together: 50% * 50% = 25%.

So, it's 25% more likely to roll a number bigger than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

* Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
* Perimeter = 2 * (6 miles + 1.5 miles)
* Perimeter = 2 * 7.5 miles
* Perimeter = 15 miles

* There are 200 cows in the stalls at the start (10 stalls * 20 cows/stall).
* Mr. Sylas adds 40 more cows, so there are 240 cows total (200 + 40).
*  He divides the new cows equally among the 20 stalls, meaning each stall gets 2 more cows (40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 cows/stall).
*  Now each stall has 22 cows (20 cows + 2 cows).
*  So, 8 stalls would have 176 cows (8 stalls * 22 cows/stall).

Next, the transfer fee is 12% of $350,000, which is $42,000.

Adding those fees to the original price, the total cost of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

*  With a 20% tax rate, he'll pay $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000 in taxes.
*  His net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

**Job B:**

* Job B pays a flat $42,000 per year.
*  After paying $6,000 in property tax, his net income is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
*  He'll pay 10% tax on this remaining income, which is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600.

* $90 (total budget) - ($5 times the number of people) - $20 (go-karts) = $5 (arcade tokens per person) times the number of people

We know she wants to spend $5 on arcade tokens for each person, so we can simplify the equation:

If Mr. Ruther had 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, we can think of it like this:

*  The 12.8 hectares represent 2/5 of his original land (because he sold 3/5).

To find the whole amount, we can set up a simple equation:

* (2/5) * x = 12.8 

Where 'x' is the original amount of land.

Now, let's solve for x:

* x = 12.8 / (2/5)
* x = 12.8 * (5/2)
* x = 32 hectares 



**Answer:** Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Let's figure this out!

First, we need to find out how far the horse runs.  It runs at 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour.  So, the horse runs 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats half a bale of hay for every mile, it eats 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so 8 bales cost 8 bales * $3/bale = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is 6 bills * $5/bill = $30.

After buying the hay, Michael will have $30 - $24 = $6 left.

"Let's figure this out!

The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.  

First, let's find out how many cows the zoo has: 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows.

Next, let's find out how many sheep the farm has: 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now we can find the total number of animals on each place:

* Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
* Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Finally, let's add up the animals from both places: 40 animals + 80 animals = 120 animals.

"Let's figure this out!

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, which is four times the amount Sophia bought.  

To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we divide Rose's onion amount by 4: 12 onions / 4 = 3 onions.

To find out how many potatoes Sophia bought, we do the same with the potatoes: 4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato.

So Sophia bought a total of 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items.

"Let's break this problem down!

* Let 'x' represent the cost of the lot.
* The house costs three times the lot, so it costs 3x.
* Together, the lot and house cost $120,000,  which can be written as x + 3x = $120,000.
* Combining like terms, we get 4x = $120,000.
*  To find the cost of the lot (x), we divide both sides by 4: x = $30,000.
*  Finally, the house costs 3 times the lot price, so it costs 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.

"Hey there! Let's break down this food truck's profit.

First, each sandwich costs $0.30 for the bread.  

Then, they spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for every 10 sandwiches.  

So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese & condiments) = $33.00

They sell those 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, bringing in $70.00.

Finally, their profit is $70.00 (revenue) - $33.00 (cost) = $37.00

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step!

Diane starts with 20.  Then she adds half the number to that, which is (20 + x/2).  Next, she divides that sum by 5: (20 + x/2) / 5.  Finally, she multiplies that result by the starting value minus 12, which is (20 - 12) or 8.  

So the final expression is:  [(20 + x/2) / 5] * 8

To get a numerical answer, we'd need to know what the original number (x) is.

*  Imagine the smallest angle in the triangle is 'x' degrees.
*  The second angle is twice as big, so it's 2x degrees.
*  The largest angle is three times the smallest, making it 3x degrees.

We know that all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  So we can write an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get: 6x = 180

To find x, we divide both sides by 6: x = 30

Now we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees.  The largest angle is 3 times that, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

* A gold jewel costs 4/5 the price of a diamond, so it costs (4/5) * $2000 = $1600.
* A silver jewel costs $400 less than a gold jewel, meaning it costs $1600 - $400 = $1200.

Finally, to find the total price of all three jewels, we add them up: $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800.

* Tom has 30 fewer points than Betty, meaning he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
* Marta has 3 times the points Tom has, so she has 35 * 3 = 105 points.

Adding up everyone's points, we get 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

To reach their goal of 400 points, they need 400 - 255 = 145 more points.

*  If the second house needs 'x' cases of shingles, the first house needs half that amount, or x/2.

* The third house needs double the amount the first house needs, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

*  Together, all three houses need 250 cases: (x/2) + x + x = 250

*  Combining like terms, we get 2.5x = 250

*  Solving for x, we find x = 100.

*  Since the third house needs the same number of cases as the second house, it needs 100 cases.

"Let's break this problem down step by step!

First, we need to figure out how fast the Llesis family hiked. They hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, which is 50 mph.  Half their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 mph.  So, they hiked at 25 - 5 = 20 mph.

Next, we can calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 mph, covering 1.5 * 20 = 30 miles.

Now, let's figure out how long they drove. Their total trip was 6 hours, and they hiked for 1.5 hours, so they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Finally, we can calculate the distance they drove. They drove at 50 mph for 4.5 hours, covering 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

To find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

* **Berries:** Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma. If Emma collects 'y' berries, Ava collects 'y + 3'.
* **Timer:** Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Now let's calculate their scores:

* **Emma's score:** (x * 10) + (y * 5) + (timer * 30)
* **Ava's score:** (x + 8) * 10 + (y + 3) * 5 + (timer - 4) * 30

To find the difference in their scores, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's score:

[(x + 8) * 10 + (y + 3) * 5 + (timer - 4) * 30] - [(x * 10) + (y * 5) + (timer * 30)]

* **Weaker friends' playtime:** Each of the weaker friends plays for half as long as Jack, so they play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They play for a total of 2 friends * (240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter) = 48 quarters.

* **Better friend's playtime:** The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, meaning they play for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. They use 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

* John earns $1.20 for each task.
* He completes 5 tasks per cycle.
*  He does 30 cycles a day, so he does 30 * 5 = 150 tasks a day.
*  That means he makes 150 * $1.20 = $180 per day.
*  Over a 7-day week, he earns $180 * 7 = $1260. 


So the answer is $1260.

"Let's figure this out!

* In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points and Julie scored 4 fewer than that, so Julie scored 10 points.

* For the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie scored in the first game, which means Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

*  Adding up Sasha's points from both games, we get 14 + 4 = 18 points.


Sasha scored a total of 18 points in both games.

"Let's figure this out!

*  Let's say PJ has 'x' Magic Cards.
*  Smendrick has 3 times the amount PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
*  Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341, so:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms: 7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7: x = 47

Now we know PJ has 47 cards.  Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.



Becca has 153 Magic Cards.

"Let's figure this out!  

* Elaina's final concert was twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore. 
* If the final concert was 65 minutes long, we can set up an equation: 2 * (usual concert length) + 15 = 65
* Let's say her usual concert length is 'x'.  So the equation becomes: 2x + 15 = 65
* Subtract 15 from both sides: 2x = 50
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 25


Elaina's usual concerts are **25** minutes long.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Let's say Peter is P years old, Paul is Pa years old, and John is J years old.

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100 
* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

Since Paul is 10 years older than John, we can say Paul's age (Pa) is J + 10.  We also know Peter's age (P) is the sum of Paul and John's ages, so P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10.

Now we can plug these values into the first equation:

P + Pa + J = 100
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Let's simplify:

2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:

J = 20

Now that we know John is 20 years old, we can find Peter's age:

P = 2J + 10
P = (2 * 20) + 10
P = 40 + 10
P = 50

"Let's break this problem down:

*  Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points.

*  Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, so Bahati scored 'x + 20' points.

*  Dinar scored 10 fewer points than Bahati, so Dinar scored 'x + 20 - 10' or 'x + 10' points.

*  Together, their scores add up to 45 points: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

*  Combining like terms: 3x + 30 = 45

*  Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

*  Dividing both sides by 3: x = 5


Azibo scored 5 points.

"A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map. They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. The island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?

"Let's figure this out! 

* Let A be the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
* Let S be the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
* Let W be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

We know:

* A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

Let's use substitution to solve for S:

1. Since A = S + 5, we can substitute (S + 5) for A in the first equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. Simplify:
   2S + W = 334

3.  We also know S = 4W - 13. Substitute that into the simplified equation:
   2S + W = 334
   2(4W - 13) + W = 334

4. Simplify and solve for W:
   8W - 26 + W = 334
   9W = 360
   W = 40

5. Now that we know W = 40, substitute it back into the equation S = 4W - 13:
   S = 4(40) - 13
   S = 160 - 13
   S = 147



Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

*  One-fourth of those over 16 are male, meaning 1500 / 4 = 375 students are male over 16.
*  That leaves 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16.
*  The other half of the students are under 16, so there are also 1500 students under 16.
*  Half of those under 16 are male, meaning 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.
*  This leaves 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16.
*  Finally, the total number of female students is 1125 + 750 = 1875.

**Day 1:**

* Wanda pumped 1/4 of the tank, which is (1/4) * 18000 gallons = 4500 gallons.
* Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda pumped, so she pumped (3/4) * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.
* Together, they pumped 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons on day 1.

**Day 2:**

* Wanda pumped 2/3 of what she pumped on day 1: (2/3) * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons.
* Ms. B pumped 1/3 of what she pumped on day 1: (1/3) * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons.
* Together, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons on day 2.

**Total:**

* Over the two days, they pumped a total of 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

*  Therefore, 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons remain to fill the tank.

"Let's break this problem down:

*  The power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours, which is a total of 9 * 5 = 45% lost.

*  This means 55% of the original charge remained after those 5 hours (100% - 45% = 55%).

*  Then, it lost another 7% per hour for 3 hours, totaling 7 * 3 = 21% lost.

*  So, the final charge was 55% - 21% = 34% of the original amount.

*  We know this final 34% is equal to 28%, so we can set up a proportion: 34% / 100% = 28% / x

*  Solving for x, we get x = (28% * 100%) / 34% = 82%




**The power bank had an initial charge of 82%.**

*  She made twice as much from small stuffed animals as large ones.
*  Let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Now we can set up an equation:

* Earnings from large stuffed animals: x * $12 = $12x
* Total earnings: $8x + $12x = $120

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find the area of each wall:

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at a certain speed and takes 40 minutes to do so.  To find her speed on the beach, we divide the distance by the time: 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed there is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at this faster speed.  To find the time it takes, we divide the distance by the speed: 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

Finally, to get the total time for her 3-mile walk, we add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.
