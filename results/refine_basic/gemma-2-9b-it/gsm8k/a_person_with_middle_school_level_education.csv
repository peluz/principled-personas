"Okay, so Janet has 16 eggs and uses 7 of them. That means she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.  She sells each egg for $2, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 at the market. 


"
"Okay, so it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.  White fiber is half of that, which is 1 bolt.  

If you add the blue and white fiber together, you get 2 + 1 = 3 bolts total.

"Okay, so Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 fixing it up.  That means he put a total of $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000 into the house.

The repairs made the house worth 150% of what it was originally, so it's now worth 150/100 * $80,000 = $120,000 more.

That means the house is worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000 now.

To find out how much profit Josh made, we subtract what he put into the house from what it's worth now: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.


**70000** 
"
"Okay, so James runs 3 sprints every time, and each sprint is 60 meters long. That means he runs 3 * 60 = 180 meters each time he runs.

He does this 3 times a week, so he runs a total of 180 * 3 = 540 meters a week. 


"
"Okay, so Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of food a day, and she has 20 chickens. That means she needs 3 * 20 = 60 cups of food total.

She already gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so that's 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how much more she needs to give, we subtract: 60 - 40 = 20 cups. 


**Answer: 20** 
"
"Okay, so Kylar buys glasses for $5 each, but every other one is 60% off.  That means every other glass costs $3.

He wants 16 glasses, so let's think about it like this:

* He'll pay $5 for the first glass.
* Then $3 for the second.
* $5 for the third, and so on.

It goes back and forth between $5 and $3.  

Since he's buying 16 glasses, he'll have 8 pairs of glasses that cost $5 and $3 each.

So, each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8.

And since he has 8 pairs, he'll pay 8 * $8 = $64 in total. 




"
"Okay, so Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has four times as many as Seattle, so Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep.  Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep. 


"
"Okay, so Carla is downloading a really big file, 200 GB!  She usually downloads at 2 GB every minute.  

First, let's figure out how long it would take to download the whole thing normally: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

But then, her computer restarts!  That takes 20 minutes.  And she has to start the download all over again.  

So, she downloads for 40 minutes (halfway through) before the restart. That means she downloaded 80 GB (40 minutes * 2 GB/minute).

Now she has to download the other 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).  That will take another 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB/minute).

Adding it all up: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.


**Answer: 120** 
"
"Okay, so John drives 3 hours at 60 mph, which is 180 miles.  Then he has to go back.  He's stuck in traffic for 2 hours, so he doesn't go anywhere those two hours.  Then he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, which is 15 miles.  He has the rest of the 4 hours to get home, so that's 2 hours left.  He drives 80 mph those 2 hours, so he goes 160 miles.  

To find out how far he is from home, we need to see how far he went in total on the way back.  That's 15 miles + 160 miles = 175 miles.

So, he drove 180 miles away and then 175 miles back, so he's 180 - 175 = 5 miles from home. 



**Answer:** 5 miles 
"
"Okay, so Eliza makes $10 an hour for the first 40 hours she works.  That means she made $400 this week for those 40 hours (40 hours * $10/hour = $400).

She worked 5 extra hours of overtime, and she gets paid 1.2 times her normal rate for overtime, so she makes $12 an hour for overtime ($10 * 1.2 = $12).  

That means she made $60 in overtime (5 hours * $12/hour = $60).

To find her total pay, we add her regular pay and her overtime pay: $400 + $60 = $460.





"
"Okay, so the program had 60 downloads the first month.  

The second month it tripled, so that's 60 times 3 which is 180 downloads.

Then the third month it went down by 30%, so we need to figure out what 30% of 180 is.  That's 180 times 0.30 which is 54.

So, 180 minus 54 is 126 downloads in the third month.

Finally, we add up all the downloads: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads total! 




"
"Okay, so Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 each, which is 3 * $68 = $204.  

Then she got 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 each, so that's 2 * $80 = $160.

And finally, she bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 each, which is 6 * $55 = $330.

To find the total, we add all that up: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694 



"
"Okay, so the lemon tree costs $90 to plant.  Each year it makes $1.50 per lemon, and it grows 7 lemons. That means it makes $1.50 * 7 = $10.50 each year.  But it also costs $3 to take care of it. So, it makes $10.50 - $3.00 = $7.50 profit each year.

To make back the $90, it will take $90 / $7.50 = 12 years.


**Answer: 12 years** 
"
"Okay, so Melanie had some vacuum cleaners, and she sold some at different houses.  

* She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
* Then she sold 2 more at the red house.
* After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house.

Now she has 5 vacuum cleaners left.  

Let's think about it backwards:

* Before the orange house, she must have had 5 + 2 = 7 vacuum cleaners.
* Before the red house, she must have had 7 x 2 = 14 vacuum cleaners. 


So Melanie started with 14 vacuum cleaners. 




"
"Okay, so there are 20 kids in the class.  

* 20% of them like contemporary dance, which is 4 kids (because 20 times 0.20 is 4).

* That leaves 16 kids who don't like contemporary.

* 25% of those 16 kids like jazz, so that's 4 kids (because 16 times 0.25 is 4).

*  That means 12 kids like hip-hop!

*  So, 12 out of 20 like hip-hop, which is 60%! 



**60%** 
"
"Okay, so the merchant can buy jewelry for $5,000 or gadgets for $8,000.  The jewelry might go up in value by 2.5% and the gadgets by 1.2%.  

Let's see... if the jewelry goes up 2.5%, that's like adding $125 to the price. So the jewelry would be worth $5,125.

The gadgets going up 1.2% is like adding $96 to the price, so they'd be worth $8,096.

The merchant wants to make the most money, so they should buy the jewelry!  


"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Day 1:** Each train travels 80 miles west.
* **Day 2:** Each train travels 150 miles north.

* **Total:**  80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles 


So the answer is 230 miles. 
"
"Okay, so Jill makes $20 an hour teaching and $30 an hour coaching.  

She teaches for 35 hours a week and coaches for 15 hours a week. That means she makes $20 * 35 = $700 a week teaching and $30 * 15 = $450 a week coaching.

So in a week, she makes $700 + $450 = $1150.

Over 50 weeks, that's $1150 * 50 = $57,500!

"
"Okay, so Claire eats 3 eggs every day for breakfast.  That means she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs each week.

Over 4 weeks, she'd eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

To figure out how many dozens that is, we divide: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens. 


"
"Okay, so Marissa needs to hike 6 more miles.  She wants to average 4 miles per hour for the whole trip, which is 12 miles long.  That means she has 1 hour left to hike those 6 miles.  To find out how fast she needs to go, we divide the distance by the time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour. 


**6**"
"Okay, so we have 10 liters of orange drink that's mostly water, and 15 liters of pineapple drink that's also mostly water.  

First, we need to figure out how much water is in each drink. The orange drink has two-thirds water, so that's (2/3) * 10 liters = 6.67 liters of water. The pineapple drink has three-fifths water, so that's (3/5) * 15 liters = 9 liters of water.

Oops! We spilled some orange drink, so we lose 1 liter of water from the orange drink. That leaves us with 6.67 liters - 1 liter = 5.67 liters of water from the orange drink.

Now, let's add up all the water: 5.67 liters + 9 liters = 14.67 liters of water in total! 




"
"Okay, so Samantha is 31 and Raymond is 6 years older, which means he's 37.  Raymond had his son when he was 23, so his son is 37 - 23 = 14 years old.  That means the son was born 14 years ago.

**Answer:** 8 
"
"Okay, so the book cost $19.50 after a 25% discount.  That means the price before the discount was higher.  

To find the original price, we can think of it like this: if $19.50 is 75% of the original price (because 100% - 25% = 75%), then we need to figure out what 100% is.

We can set up a little proportion:

75% / 100% = $19.50 / x  (where 'x' is the original price)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

75% * x = 100% * $19.50

75x = 1950

Now, divide both sides by 75 to isolate x:

x = $26.00 





"
"Okay, so Marie spent $12 on chicken, $15 on milk (because 5 packs times $3 each is $15), and $6 on apples (4 apples times $1.50 each is $6).  That means she spent a total of $33 on those things.

If she paid $50 in total, that means she spent $17 on pizza ($50 - $33 = $17).

Since each pizza box costs $8.50, she must have bought 2 boxes ($17 / $8.50 = 2). 


**Answer: 2** 
"
"Okay, so Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 each, which is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.

Then she bought 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each, so that's 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

And finally, she bought 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each, which is 3 * $42 = $126.

To find out how much she spent in total, we add all that up: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.00 



"
"Okay, so Cynthia eats ice cream every night for 60 nights.  Each carton has 15 servings, and she needs 60 servings total. That means she needs 60 / 15 = 4 cartons of ice cream.  

Each carton costs $4.00, so 4 cartons will cost 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.


**Answer:** $16.00 
"
"Okay, so Henry biked 60 miles total.  He stopped after 20 miles, which means he had 40 miles left to go (60 - 20 = 40).  

He stopped 15 miles before the end, so he biked 25 miles between his first and second stops (40 - 15 = 25). 


25 
"
"Okay, so the two pairs of heels cost $5 less than the boots.  

One pair of heels is $33 and the other is twice that price, so it costs $33 * 2 = $66.

Together, the heels cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the heels are $5 less than the boots, the boots must cost $99 + $5 = $104. 


**Answer: $104**"
"Okay, so Darrell and Allen's ages are like parts of a pie, with Darrell's age being 7 slices and Allen's being 11 slices.  

If the whole pie (their total age) is 162, we can figure out how big one slice is.  

To do that, we add the number of slices: 7 + 11 = 18 slices.

Then we divide the total age by the number of slices: 162 / 18 = 9. So each slice is 9 years old.

Allen's age is 11 slices, so he's 11 * 9 = 99 years old right now.

In 10 years, he'll be 99 + 10 = 109 years old. 


"
"Okay, so the first friend says there are 80 jelly beans.  

The second friend says there are 20 more than half of 80, so that's 20 more than 40, which is 60 jelly beans.

The third friend says there are 25% more than 80 jelly beans.  25% of 80 is 20, so they think there are 100 jelly beans.

To find the average, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240

Then we divide that by the number of friends: 240 / 3 = 80


80 
"
"Okay, so John spends half an hour on each dog every day.  

With 10 dogs, that's 10 * 0.5 = 5 hours a day.

Then, over a week, that's 5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours. 


35 
"
"Okay, so Gretchen has 110 coins total.  She has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  

Let's think about it: if she has 30 more gold coins, that means for every silver coin, there's one gold coin plus 30.  

To find out how many silver coins she has, we can try different numbers. If she had 40 silver coins, that would mean she has 70 gold coins (40 + 30 = 70).  

That works! 110 coins total (40 + 70 = 110). 


So Gretchen has 70 gold coins. 
"
"Okay, so Raymond has 40 jewels.  Half of that is 20 jewels. Aaron has 5 more than that, so he has 25 jewels. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so she has 23 jewels. 


"
"Okay, so Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes.  Then he scored 25% more in the next 20 minutes.  That means he scored 0.25 times 4 points, which is 1 more point.  So in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.  

In total, he scored 4 + 5 = 9 points. 


"
"Okay, so Terry eats 2 yogurts every day.  That means he eats 2 yogurts/day * 7 days/week = 14 yogurts a week.

Over 30 days, that's like 30 days / 7 days/week = about 4 weeks.

He eats 14 yogurts a week for 4 weeks, so he eats 14 yogurts/week * 4 weeks = 56 yogurts.

Since each pack has 4 yogurts, he needs 56 yogurts / 4 yogurts/pack = 14 packs.

And each pack costs $5, so he spends 14 packs * $5.00/pack = $70.00 on yogurt.



**Answer:** $70.00 
"
"Okay, so John sold all his Lego sets to buy video games.  He had 13 sets and each one sold for $15, so he made 13 times 15 which is $195.  

He bought 8 video games at $20 each, so that cost him 8 times 20 which is $160.  He had $5 left over after buying the games.

That means he spent a total of $160 plus $5, which is $165.

If he made $195 and spent $165, he has $30 left over.  But the question asks how many Lego sets he has *left*. Since he sold all of them, he has **0** Lego sets. 



"
"Okay, so John runs 60 miles in a week and he runs 3 days.  He runs for 3 hours the first day, and half that time the other two days.  

Let's figure out how long he runs in total:

* The other two days he runs for 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.
* That's 1.5 hours/day * 2 days = 3 hours total.
* So he runs for 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours all together.

To find his speed, we divide the total miles by the total time: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour. 



**Answer: 10**"
"Okay, so Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half as fast as she runs.  That means she runs at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

She runs four times faster than she walks, so she walks at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends 2 hours running (1/3 of 6 hours) and 4 hours walking (2/3 of 6 hours).

That means she runs 2 hours * 6 miles/hour = 12 miles.

And she walks 4 hours * 1.5 miles/hour = 6 miles.

In total, she travels 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.




**Answer:** 18 
"
"Okay, so Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's, so Ben's is 1 * 2 = 2 years old.  Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, so Brandon's is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.

"
"Okay, so the dragon breathes fire for 1000 feet. Polly can normally throw the javelin 400 feet, but with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther!  

That means with the gemstone, she can throw it 400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet.

So, to be safe, she needs to be farther than 1000 feet away.  She can stand 1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet away from the dragon. 



"
"Okay, so Grandma Jones made 5 pies with 8 slices each, which is 5 times 8, so that's 40 slices in total.  Then there were 14 slices left over.  To find out how many slices were eaten, we subtract the leftovers from the total: 40 - 14 = 26 slices. 


26 
"
"Okay, so there are 250 calories in each serving of chips, and the bag has 5 servings.  That means the whole bag has 250 x 5 = 1250 calories.

You can only have 200 calories left from your 2000 calorie goal, and you've already eaten 1800.

If each serving is 250 calories, you can only have a little less than one serving.  Since the bag has 300 grams and 5 servings, one serving is 300 / 5 = 60 grams.

So you can eat a little less than 60 grams of chips. 



"
"Okay, so Charlie makes 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, and each pound of beeswax costs $10 with the wicks.  

If he makes 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). That means his supplies cost $20 (2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20).

He sells each candle for $2, so he makes $40 from selling 20 candles (20 candles * $2 per candle = $40).

His profit is $20 because he made $40 and spent $20 on supplies ($40 - $20 = $20).

"
"Okay, so Meredith writes 5 blog posts on Monday.  On Tuesday, she writes 2/5 more than Monday, so that's like adding 2 more posts to her Monday total. That means she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 posts on Tuesday.

Then on Wednesday, she writes twice as many as Tuesday, so that's 7 * 2 = 14 posts.

In total, she wrote 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 blog posts.

Since each post takes 4 hours, she spent 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing. 



"
"Okay, so Candice started with 80 Post-it notes and used 220 at work. That means she needed more!  She had 23 left over, so she must have bought 220 (the ones she used) - 80 (the ones she started with) + 23 (the ones she had left) = 117 more Post-it notes. 


**Answer:** 117 
"
"Okay, so John bought 5 blue ties because he spent $200 and each tie cost $40.  

He bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he bought 5 * 2 = 10 red ties.

Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so they cost $40 * 1.50 = $60 each.

That means the red ties cost 10 * $60 = $600.

In total, he spent $600 + $200 = $800 on ties. 



"
"Okay, so Tracy had 4 feet of wire, and she cut it into pieces that were 6 inches long.  

First, let's figure out how many inches of wire she had. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Then, we can see how many 6-inch pieces she could make: 48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces. 


**Answer:** 8 
"
"Okay, so there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 apartments. That means there are 15 * 8 = 120 apartments in total.  

Three-fourths of the building is full, so we need to figure out what 3/4 of 120 is.  That's (3/4) * 120 = 90 apartments.

If 90 apartments are full, then 120 - 90 = 30 apartments are empty. 


**Answer: 30** 
"
"Okay, so Lloyd's chickens lay 252 eggs every day.  There are 7 days in a week, so that means they lay 252 * 7 = 1764 eggs in a week.

Each dozen has 12 eggs, so they lay 1764 / 12 = 147 dozens of eggs.

If he sells each dozen for $2, he makes 147 * 2 = $294 a week. 


"
"Okay, so Tom sails for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, which means he travels 30 miles.  Then he has to go back 30 miles at 6 miles per hour.  To figure out how long that takes, we divide the distance by his speed: 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours. 


**Answer:** 5 hours 
"
"Okay, so Uriah needs to take out 15 pounds. His comic books weigh 0.25 pounds each, and he's taking out 30, so that's 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds.  

That means he still needs to take out 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds more.  

Since his toys weigh 0.5 pounds each, he needs to take out 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys. 


**Answer: 15** 
"
"Okay, so the mechanic makes $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. 

On Thursday, he fixed 6 truck tires, so that's 6 * $60 = $360.  He also fixed 4 car tires, so that's 4 * $40 = $160.  That means he made a total of $360 + $160 = $520 on Thursday.

On Friday, he only fixed 12 car tires, so he made 12 * $40 = $480.

To find out how much more he made on the better day, we subtract: $520 - $480 = $40.


**Answer:** $40 
"
"Okay, so the Doubtfire sisters brought home 7 kittens. Then their cats had more kittens! Patchy had three times as many kittens as the sisters adopted, so she had 7 * 3 = 21 kittens. Trixie had 12 kittens.  

That means Patchy and Trixie had a total of 21 + 12 = 33 kittens.

Adding the 7 kittens the sisters brought home, the Doubtfire family has 33 + 7 = 40 kittens!

"
"Okay, so Stephen's groceries cost $40.00.  Then they added a 25% fee, which is like taking 25 out of every 100 dollars, so that's $10.00 more.  Then they charged him $3.00 for delivery and $4.00 for a tip.  If you add all that up, it's $40.00 + $10.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

"
"Okay, so there are 6 clusters of raspberries, and each cluster has 20 raspberries. That's 6 times 20, which is 120 raspberries.  Then there are 67 more raspberries just hanging out on the bush.  If you add those together, you get 120 + 67 = 187 raspberries! 


187 
"
"Okay, so there are 25 oranges total.  

* One is bad, and 20% of them are unripe, which is 5 oranges (because 25 times 0.20 equals 5). 
* That means there are 5 + 1 + 2 = 8 oranges that aren't good.

*  So, there are 25 - 8 = 17 good oranges!

"Okay, so Janet spent $500 on stuff to make the brooch and $800 to have it put together.  That's $500 + $800 = $1300.

Then she paid 10% of that for insurance, which is the same as $1300 * 0.10 = $130.

So, in total, she paid $1300 + $130 = $1430 for the brooch.

"Okay, so Aleena pays $140 every month for the streaming service.  

For six months, that's $140 times 6, which is $840.

Then, the price goes down by 10%, which is $14 less each month. So she pays $126 for the next six months.

That means she pays $126 times 6, which is $756 for the second half of the year.

Adding the two halves together, she pays $840 plus $756, which is $1596 for the whole year. 



**Answer: $1596**
"
"Okay, so Sophia drove 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill up her 12-gallon tank.  That means her car gets 25 miles per gallon (100 miles / 4 gallons = 25).

Since her tank holds 12 gallons, she can drive 300 miles on a full tank (25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles). 


"
"Okay, so Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then reads for half that time, which is 1 hour.  That means he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading each time.

He does this 3 times a week, so he spends 3 hours/time * 3 times/week = 9 hours a week on TV and reading.

Over 4 weeks, he spends 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours. 



"
"Okay, so there are four schools with two teams each, and each team has 5 players. That means there are 4 * 2 * 5 = 40 players.  

Plus, each school has two coaches, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 coaches.

In total, there are 40 + 8 = 48 people. 


"
"Okay, so there are 175 diamonds.  There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so there are 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.  

Then there are twice as many emeralds as rubies, so that's 140 * 2 = 280 emeralds.

Finally, to find the total, we add them all up: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 gems! 


"
"Okay, so there are 60 girls and twice as many boys, which means there are 60 * 2 = 120 boys.  

That makes a total of 60 + 120 = 180 students.

Since there are 5 students for every teacher, there are 180 / 5 = 36 teachers. 


"
"Okay, so Bailey gets $5 every week for 8 weeks. That means she gets a total of $5 x 8 = $40 from her allowance.  

If she has $100 in the end, she must have started with $100 - $40 = $60. 


60 
"
"Okay, so she teaches 5 classes each day for 5 days, which is 25 classes. Then she teaches 8 classes on Saturday. That's a total of 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so she teaches 33 * 15 = 495 students.

If she charges $15 for each student, she makes 495 * $15 = $7425.00  


"
"Okay, so the first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many, so that's 20 times 2, which is 40 instructions.  

To find the total, we add them together: 20 + 40 = 60 instructions. 


**60** 
"
"Okay, so Tommy sells brownies for $3 each and cheesecakes for $4 each.  

He sells 43 brownies, so that's 43 times $3, which is $129.

He also sells 23 cheesecakes, so that's 23 times $4, which is $92.

To find out how much money he made in total, we add those two amounts together: $129 + $92 = $221. 


"
"Okay, so Shiela bought 5 phones at $150 each, which is 5 times $150, so that's $750.  

Then they add 2% interest, which is like finding 2% of $750.  That's $15 more.

So the total cost is $750 plus $15, which is $765.

If she pays for it over 3 months, she pays $765 divided by 3, which is $255 each month. 


**Answer:** $255 
"
"Okay, so Artie sells marigolds for about $3 each, petunias for $2 each, and begonias for $2 each.  

He sells 12 marigolds, so that's 12 times $3, which is $36.

He sells 9 petunias, so that's 9 times $2, which is $18.

And he sells 17 begonias, so that's 17 times $2, which is $34.

If you add all that up, $36 + $18 + $34 = $88! 



"
"Okay, so each level is half the size of the one below it.  

* The top level is 16 square feet.
* The level below that must be 16 * 2 = 32 square feet.
* The level below that is 32 * 2 = 64 square feet.
* And the bottom level is 64 * 2 = 128 square feet.

To find the average, we add all the sizes together: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

Then we divide that by the number of levels: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.


**Answer:** 60 square feet 
"
"Okay, so the puppy needs 1 cup of food a day for 180 days, which is 180 cups total.  Then it needs 2 cups a day for the rest of the year, which is 185 days. That's 370 more cups!

So, in the whole year, Cecilia needs 180 + 370 = 550 cups of food.

Since each bag has 110 cups, she'll need 550 / 110 = 5 bags. 


"
"Okay, so Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  Raymond does half as much as Sarah, which is 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.  David does way less, just 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.

Raymond does 200 - 100 = 100 more pounds of laundry than David. 


100 
"
"Okay, so Vincent can get flowers in packs of 3 for $2.50 or packs of 2 for $1.  He wants 18 flowers.

Let's see... if he buys the packs of 2, he'd need 9 packs because 18 divided by 2 is 9. That's 9 times $1, which is $9.

If he buys the packs of 3, he'd need 6 packs because 18 divided by 3 is 6. That's 6 times $2.50, which is $15.

He saves $15 - $9 = $6 by buying the packs of 2! 


**Answer:** 6.00 
"
"Okay, so the groomer costs $100 but John gets 30% off because he's new.  

Thirty percent of $100 is $30 (because 30/100 times 100 is 30).  

That means the grooming only costs $100 - $30 = $70! 


70 
"
"Okay, so two girls each got 1/6 of 24 liters of water.  That means each girl got 24 / 6 = 4 liters.

Together they drank 4 liters/girl * 2 girls = 8 liters.

Then the boy drank 6 liters.

So, 24 liters - 8 liters - 6 liters = 10 liters are left. 


**10** 
"
"Okay, so Charlie had 10 stickers and bought 21 more, so that's 10 + 21 = 31 stickers. Then he got 23 for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.  He gave 9 to his sister, so he has 54 - 9 = 45 left.  After decorating a card with 28, he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left. 


**Answer:** 17 
"
"Okay, so Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than four times Grace's weight.  

First, let's figure out what four times Grace's weight is: 125 pounds * 4 = 500 pounds.

Then, subtract 2 pounds: 500 pounds - 2 pounds = 498 pounds. That's how much Alex weighs.

Finally, add their weights together: 125 pounds + 498 pounds = 623 pounds. 


"
"Okay, so there are 3 rose bushes and each bush has 25 roses. That means there are 3 * 25 = 75 roses in total.  

Then, each rose has 8 thorns, so there are 75 * 8 = 600 thorns altogether! 


600 
"
"Okay, so they played 22 games total and won 8 more than they lost.  

If they lost 'x' games, they won 'x + 8' games.  

That means x + (x + 8) = 22

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Then, dividing both sides by 2: x = 7

So they lost 7 games.  

They won 7 + 8 = 15 games. 



15 
"
"Okay, so Gene goes on four vacations every year.  He's been going on vacations for 34 - 23 = 11 years.  

That means he's been on 11 * 4 = 44 vacations!

Since he has a quilt block for each vacation, he has 44 quilt blocks. 


"
"Okay, so the alarm rings four times the first time.  Then it rings three times longer the second time, which is like 4 times 3, which is 12 times.  The third time it rings half as long as the second time, so that's 12 divided by 2, which is 6 times.  

If you add all the times up, it rings 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times. 


22 
"
"Sylvie's salary goes up by 10% every year after she's been at the company for 5 years.  So after 5 years, she makes $600 * 1.10 = $660.

The next year, her salary is $660 * 1.10 = $726.

The year after that, it's $726 * 1.10 = $800.60

And the year after that, it's $800.60 * 1.10 = $880.66



**880.66** 
"
"Okay, so Harald sold some records, and Marilyn sold 10 times more than him.  If they sold 88,000 records together, we can figure out how many Harald sold.

Let's say Harald sold 'x' records.  Marilyn sold 10 times that, so she sold 10x records.  

Together, they sold x + 10x = 88,000 records.

That means 11x = 88,000.  

To find out how many records Harald sold (x), we divide both sides by 11:

x = 88,000 / 11

x = 8,000


Harald sold 8,000 records. 
"
"Okay, so Christina needs 0.75 gift bags for each friend, but some friends won't come.  Since 1/4 of them don't show, that means 3/4 of them will be there.

She invited 16 friends, so 16 * (3/4) = 12 friends will come.

She needs 0.75 gift bags per friend, so she'll need 12 * 0.75 = 9 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2, so she'll spend 9 * $2 = $18. 



**Answer: $18**"
"Okay, so each adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad and the kids eat half of that.  

The kids eat 10 pounds / 2 = 5 pounds each.

The adults eat a total of 20 adults * 10 pounds/adult = 200 pounds.

The kids eat a total of 5 kids * 5 pounds/kid = 25 pounds.

So Ted needs to bring 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds of potato salad. 



"
"Okay, so Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.  Jan has three times the number of pets Marcia has, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.  

To find the total, we add up the number of pets each person has: 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets. 


"
"Okay, so James is 10 and Corey is a year older than him, which means Corey is 11. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 9.  Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson must be 4. 


"
"Okay, so Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and that's 2 seconds faster than Gerald used to.  That means Gerald used to run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now Gerald's diet got better and he's 10% faster.  That's like 10% of 40 seconds, which is 4 seconds faster.

So now Gerald can run it in 40 - 4 = 36 seconds! 


**Answer:** 36 
"
"Okay, so there are 60 dogs and for every dog there are 2 cats, so there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats.  That means there are 60 + 120 = 180 dogs and cats together.

The problem says there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Finally, to find the total number of pets, we add up all the animals: 168 rabbits + 180 dogs and cats = 348 pets! 


"
"Okay, so there are 200 students and 2/5 of them are boys. That means there are 200 * (2/5) = 80 boys.  

That leaves 200 - 80 = 120 girls.

Two-thirds of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, so that's 120 * (2/3) = 80 girls.

If 80 girls are in the Girl Scouts, then 120 - 80 = 40 girls aren't in the Girl Scouts. 



**Answer:** 40 
"
"Harry slept 9 hours, and James slept 2/3 of that.  So James slept (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.  

Harry slept 9 - 6 = 3 more hours than James.

"
"Okay, so Freda's sauce is half the size of the tomatoes she starts with.  That means she used 32 ounces of sauce * 2 = 64 ounces of tomatoes.

Since each can has 16 ounces, she used 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.

And each can has 3 tomatoes, so she used 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes. 


12 
"
"Okay, so there were 30 cars, and 5 left before the jam even started. That means 25 cars were stuck in the traffic.

We know 20 cars went through in the last 15 minutes.  So, to find out how many went through in the first 15 minutes, we just subtract: 25 - 20 = 5 


**Answer:** 5 
"
"Okay, so Mary starts with 80 plants from her window ledges and gets 18 more. That's 80 + 18 = 98 plants.  Then she gives away 40 plants.  So she has 98 - 40 = 58 plants left. 


58 
"
"Okay, so the first friend rang the doorbell 20 times. The second friend rang it 5 more times than that, which is 25 times. The third friend rang it 10 more times than the fourth friend, who rang it 60 times.  So the third friend rang it 70 times.  

Adding all the times up, we get 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 times.

"Okay, so Solo has to read a bunch of pages!  

* Science: 4 pages
* Social Studies: 20 pages
* History: 7 pages
* Geography: 8 pages

That's a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.

He already read 15 pages, so he has 39 - 15 = 24 pages left.

If he has 4 more days to read, he needs to read 24 / 4 = 6 pages each day.

"
"Okay, so the fog covers 3 miles every 10 minutes.  The city is 42 miles wide.  

To figure out how long it takes to cover the whole city, we can think:

* How many times does 3 miles fit into 42 miles?  That's 42 divided by 3, which is 14.

* Since it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles, and it takes 14 sets of 3 miles to cover the whole city, it'll take 14 times 10 minutes.

* So, 14 times 10 is 140 minutes! 



**Answer: 140 minutes** 
"
"Okay, so Poppy puts down 250 pieces because a quarter of 1000 is 250.  Then there are 750 pieces left. Her mom puts down another 250 pieces because a third of 750 is 250.  That means there are 500 pieces left to put on the puzzle. 


"
"Okay, so Amir eats 5 cookies and Cody eats three times that amount.  

That means Cody eats 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.

Together they eat 15 + 5 = 20 cookies. 


20 
"
"Okay, so each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick.  That means the inside of each box is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

To find the volume of one box, we multiply those numbers: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are three boxes, the total volume is 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches. 


**Answer:** 72  
"
"Okay, so Frankie watched TV for 7 hours total.  

* Monday and Tuesday he watched 1 hour each night, so that's 2 hours.
* On Thursday he watched 1 hour plus a half hour, which is 1.5 hours.
* Friday he watched 2 hours.

That's 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

So on Wednesday he watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is half an hour long, he watched 1.5 / 0.5 = 3 episodes on Wednesday. 



**Answer: 3**
"
"Okay, so Henry baked twice as many cookies this year as last year.  He made 15 extra cookies, but then dropped 5, leaving him with 110.  

Let's think about it:

* He had 115 cookies before dropping any (110 + 5).
* Before making the extra 15, he had 100 cookies (115 - 15).
*  Since he baked twice as many this year, let's say he baked 'x' cookies last year. This year he baked 2*x cookies.

So, 2*x = 100

To find out how many he baked last year (x), we divide both sides by 2:

x = 50 




**Answer:** 50 
"
"Okay, so the gas costs $3.00 per gallon and they're buying 10 gallons. That's $3.00 x 10 = $30.00

Then they get $0.20 back for each gallon, so they get $0.20 x 10 = $2.00 back.

If you take away the $2.00 from the $30.00, the gas will cost $28.00. 


28.00 
"
"Okay, so Beatrice had a roll-up that was 2 wide and 24 long.  That means she had 2 times 24 which is 48 roll-ups. Marcell had a roll-up that was 3 wide and 14 long, so he had 3 times 14 which is 42 roll-ups.  

Together they had 48 plus 42 which is 90 roll-ups.  If they split them evenly, they each ate 90 divided by 2 which is 45 roll-ups. 


45

"Okay, so Julia's boat is leaking two liters of water for every ten feet she rows.  She rows for 64 seconds and the shore is that far away.  

First, we need to figure out how far she rows in total.  She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so in 64 seconds she rows 64 seconds / 16 seconds * 20 feet = 80 feet.

Since she takes on 2 liters for every 10 feet, she takes on 80 feet / 10 feet * 2 liters = 16 liters.

"Okay, so Jamal's phone holds 1800 pictures, and that's 6 times more than Brittany's phone.  Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 pictures.

We know Brittany's phone can hold 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's picture of ducks.  So, there must be 300 pictures / 50 = 6 birds in Jamal's picture. 


**Answer:** 6 
"
"Okay, so Sasha bought some lumber and now it's more expensive.  She has ten 2x4 boards that cost her $10 each, and five 4x4 boards that cost $16 each.  

First, let's see how much she spent in total:

* 2x4s: 10 boards * $10/board = $100
* 4x4s: 5 boards * $16/board = $80
* Total cost: $100 + $80 = $180

Now, the prices went up by 50%, so we need to figure out the new prices:

* 2x4s: $10 * 1.50 = $15/board
* 4x4s: $16 * 1.50 = $24/board

Now let's see how much she can make selling them:

* 2x4s: 10 boards * $15/board = $150
* 4x4s: 5 boards * $24/board = $120
* Total selling price: $150 + $120 = $270

Finally, to find her profit, we subtract her total cost from her selling price:

* $270 - $180 = $90


**Answer:** $90 
"
"Okay, so Katy uses 7 teaspoons of sugar for every 13 cups of water.  That means she uses a total of 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

If she used 120 teaspoons and cups altogether, each part is worth 120 / 20 = 6.

Since sugar is 7 parts, she used 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"
"Okay, so John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 kids.  That means he buys 2 times 3 which is 6 pairs of shoes in total.  If each pair costs $60, he pays 6 times $60, which is $360. 


"
"Okay, so there were 10 cars at the port on the first day because 2 containers times 5 cars each equals 10 cars.  Then there were 30 cars total, so there must have been 20 more cars brought in on the second day (30 total cars - 10 cars = 20 cars).  If each container has 5 cars, then 20 cars divided by 5 cars per container equals 4 containers. 


**Answer:** 4 
"
"Okay, so Adrien made $40,000 four years ago, and his salary went up by 40%. That means he made $40,000 + ($40,000 * 0.40) = $56,000 now.

We know Adrien made 30% more than Lylah four years ago.  Let's say Lylah made $x$ dollars four years ago. That means Adrien made $1.30x.

But we don't know how much Lylah's salary went up!  We need more information to figure out her salary now and then add it to Adrien's to find their total. 



"
"He uses 2 pads of paper each week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So in a week, he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets of paper.

240 
"
"Okay, so Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, which is a total of 13 fruits.  Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, so he brought 10 apples. He also brought half as many oranges, which is 4 oranges. That means Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits. Together, they brought 13 + 14 = 27 fruits. 


27 
"
"Okay, so Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. Then she slept 2 hours less each night for Tuesday and Wednesday, which is 6 hours each night.  That's 12 hours total for those two days.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept 7 hours each night. That's 35 hours for Thursday through Sunday.

If you add up all the hours, she slept 8 + 12 + 35 = 55 hours for the whole week. 



"
"Okay, so Rosie runs fast for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour. That means she runs 10 times 3, which is 30 miles.  

Then she slows down to 5 miles per hour for the rest of the time, which is 7 hours minus 3 hours, so 4 hours.  

At 5 miles per hour for 4 hours, she runs 5 times 4, which is 20 miles.

If you add the miles from both parts, she runs a total of 30 plus 20, which is 50 miles.

"Okay, so Julia had 12 spoons in the end. Her husband gave her 5, so before that she had 12 - 5 = 7 spoons.  She used 3 to taste her stew, so she must have started with 7 + 3 = 10 spoons. 


"
"Okay, so Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages.  He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.  

To find the total, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82 sausages. 


82

"
"Okay, so a watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper, and a pepper costs $15. That means a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so it costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Dillon buys 4 watermelons at $45 each, so that's 4 * $45 = $180.

He also buys 20 peppers at $15 each, which is 20 * $15 = $300.

And he gets 10 oranges at $40 each, so that's 10 * $40 = $400.

Finally, to find the total, we add it all up: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880. 




"
"Okay, so the hospital sees 500 people a day, and each person is there for 24 minutes.  That means they spend a total of 12,000 minutes with patients (500 times 24).

If there are 60 minutes in an hour, that's 200 hours total (12,000 minutes divided by 60).

The doctors get paid $150 per hour, so they make $30,000 for their work (200 hours times $150).

The hospital charges patients $200 per hour, so they make $40,000 from all the visits (200 hours times $200).

To find the profit, we subtract the doctors' pay from what the hospital makes: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

"Okay, so Nissa starts with 60 elves. Then, a third of them quit, which is like dividing 60 by 3, and that's 20 elves.  

That leaves her with 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 more elves quit, so she has 40 - 10 = 30 elves left. 


**Answer:** 30 
"
"Okay, so Joseph spent $500 in May.  In June, he spent $60 less than that, so he spent $500 - $60 = $440 in June.  

To find his total spending, we add the two amounts: $500 + $440 = $940.


**Answer:** $940 
"
"Okay, so Pam rode the roller coaster twice and Fred rode it four times.  That's 2 times 6 tickets = 12 tickets for Pam and 4 times 6 tickets = 24 tickets for Fred.  

Then they both rode the luge twice, which is 2 times 6 tickets = 12 tickets each. So Pam used 12 + 12 = 24 tickets and Fred used 24 + 12 = 36 tickets.

All together they used 24 + 36 = 60 tickets! 



"
"Okay, so Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.  Tuesday he walked 6 times that amount, so he walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles.  

That means he walked 4 + 24 = 28 miles on Monday and Tuesday together.

Since his total for Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, he must have walked 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday. 


13 
"
"Okay, so Tom gets his car washed 4 times every month and each wash costs $15.  

To find out how much he pays in a year, we need to figure out how much he spends in a month first. That's 4 washes times $15 each, which is $60.

Then, since there are 12 months in a year, he spends $60 a month times 12 months, which equals $720 a year. 


720 
"
"Okay, so Brian had 20 video games but lost 5, so he has 15 now.  Bobby has 5 fewer than three times the number of games Brian has.  

Three times the number of Brian's games is 15 * 3 = 45.

Five less than that is 45 - 5 = 40.


Bobby has 40 video games. 
"
"Okay, so there are 27 unicorns total.  

One third of them are in Scotland, so we do 27 / 3 = 9 unicorns in Scotland.

Two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, so we do 9 x 2/3 = 6 female unicorns.


**Answer: 6** 
"
"Okay, so Rory gets two subs at $7.50 each, which is $15.  Then she gets two bags of chips at $1.50 each, so that's $3.  And two cookies at $1.00 each, which is another $2.  

That means the food costs $15 + $3 + $2 = $20.

The delivery fee is 20% of $20, so that's $4.

Then she adds a $5 tip.

So the total is $20 + $4 + $5 = $29. 



**Answer:** $29.00 
"
"Okay, so Mark did a test with 75 questions and another with 100 questions.  

For the first test, he did 8 hours times 5 questions per hour, which is 40 questions. That means he didn't finish 75 - 40 = 35 questions on the first test.

For the second test, he did 6 hours times 5 questions per hour, which is 30 questions.  He didn't finish 100 - 30 = 70 questions on the second test.

In total, he didn't finish 35 + 70 = 105 questions. 


**Answer:** 105 
"
"Okay, so there are 12 blue gumballs.  The candy machine has 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs.  

Let's do the math: four times the blue gumballs is 4 * 12 = 48.

Then, add 22 more: 48 + 22 = 70.


There are 70 pink gumballs. 
"
"There are 20 cars total. 12 are automatic and 4 are manual, so that's 16 cars that aren't semi-automatic.  

That means 20 - 16 = 4 cars are semi-automatic.

To find the percentage, we do 4 divided by 20, which is 0.2.  Then we multiply by 100% to get 20%. 


20% 
"
"Okay, so there are 700 bees total.  We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens.  

Let's think about it like this:

* If there were only one queen, there would be two babies, and then four worker bees.
*  But we have 700 bees!  

It might take a little trial and error to figure out how many queens there are.  Let's try a few numbers...  

Hmm, if there are 100 queens, that means there are 200 babies, and 400 worker bees. That adds up to 700! 



**Answer:** 400 
"
"He plays video games for 2 hours each day, so in a week that's 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours.  If he worked those 14 hours at $10 an hour, he'd make 14 hours * $10/hour = $140. 


"
"Okay, so John spent $2 on milk and $3 on eggs.  That's $5 so far.  Then he got light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4.  That's $10 for those things.  

Wait, there's a 10% tax on the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps!  That means he paid an extra dollar on those.  So the non-food stuff cost $11 in total.

Finally, we add up everything: $5 + $11 = $16.


**Answer: $16**
"
"Okay, so Kim has 8 clients in total.  

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each, so that's 2 * $2 = $4 for bleach.

Plus, each client needs a pack of cloths for $5.

That means each client costs Kim $4 + $5 = $9 to clean.

For all 8 clients, that's $9 * 8 = $72.

Kim makes $92 each week, so his profit is $92 - $72 = $20. 


"
"John has a pineapple field that's 10 hectares big.  That means he has 100 pineapples growing in each hectare, so he has a total of 10 * 100 = 1000 pineapples.

He harvests his pineapples every 3 months, and there are 4 times a year he can harvest (like four seasons). So, he gets to pick 1000 pineapples * 4 times = 4000 pineapples in a whole year! 



"
"Okay, so Johnny has three boxes of Legos. 

* The first box has 500 pieces.
* The second box has three times as many pieces as the first box, so it has 500 * 3 = 1500 pieces.
* The third box has a quarter of the pieces in the first box, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

To find the total number of Legos, we add up the pieces from all three boxes: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 pieces. 


2125 
"
"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

* First, 1/2 of the bees that left the hive the first time is 30 bees / 2 = 15 bees.
* Then, twice the number of bees that left the first time is 30 bees * 2 = 60 bees.
*  That means a total of 30 bees + 60 bees = 90 bees left the hive before the last 6 hours.
* Since all the bees that left before the last 6 hours came back, 90 bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours.




**Answer:** 90 
"
"Okay, so the adult ticket is $12 and the kid's ticket is $10.  That means together they cost $12 + $10 = $22.  

Since she got $8 in change, she must have paid $22 + $8 = $30. 


"
"Okay, so Charlie has 12 Facebook friends and that's three times more than Dorothy.  To find out how many friends Dorothy has, we divide Charlie's friends by 3: 12 / 3 = 4 friends.

Then James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we multiply Dorothy's friends by 4: 4 * 4 = 16 friends. 


Answer: James has 16 Facebook friends. 
"
"Okay, so Steve bikes home and Tim skateboards.  Steve lives farther away, 3 miles, and Tim lives 2 miles away.

First, let's figure out how long it takes each of them to get home.

* Steve bikes 440 feet every minute, and he has to go 3 miles, which is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet.  So, it takes him 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.

* Tim skateboards 264 feet every minute and has to go 2 miles, which is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.  So, it takes him 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

Since Steve gets home faster, he'll be waiting for Tim.  He'll be waiting for 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.



**Answer: 4**
"
"Okay, so Shawnda charged 25 cents for each tire she inflated.  

* She inflated 10 tires for the people with bikes (5 people * 2 tires each).
* She inflated 9 tires for the people with tricycles (3 people * 3 tires each).
* And she inflated 1 tire for the person on a unicycle.

That means she inflated a total of 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

If each tire was 25 cents, she made 20 * $0.25 = $5.00 


"
"Okay, so Carl buys ten packs of cookies and each pack has six cookies. That means he has 10 * 6 = 60 cookies.  

Each cookie costs $0.10, so 60 cookies cost 60 * $0.10 = $6.00.

If he pays with a $10 bill, his change is $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00 


4.00 
"
"Okay, so Dave ate 14 fries, and then a seagull ate half of those, which is 7.  That means there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.

Then three pigeons came and each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.  That means there were 7 - 9 = -2 fries left.  Wait, that doesn't make sense!  

This problem is kinda messed up because the pigeons ate more fries than were left!  


"
"Okay, so Kimo has 3 classes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and each class is an hour long. That's 3 hours a day times 3 days is 9 hours.

Then he has 2 classes on Tuesday and Thursday, and each class is 2 hours long. That's 2 hours a day times 2 days is 4 hours.

So, he spends 9 hours + 4 hours = 13 hours in class each week.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, he spends 13 hours/week * 16 weeks = 208 hours in class for the whole semester. 



**208**"
"Okay, so Bill bakes a lot of stuff!  

* Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
* Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
* Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now we gotta add all that up, but remember, the rolls and croissants are in inches, and the baguettes are in feet.  Let's change the rolls and croissants to feet:

* 1200 inches / 12 inches/foot = 100 feet
* 720 inches / 12 inches/foot = 60 feet

Finally, add it all up: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet!




**Answer: 280**

"Okay, so the zookeeper needs bananas for the monkeys, gorillas, and baboons.  

* The monkeys eat 200 bananas a month.
* The gorillas eat 400 bananas a month.
* The baboons eat 100 bananas a month.

That means they eat a total of 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas every month.

Since he orders enough for two months, he needs 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas! 


"
"Okay, so Blake runs back and forth across the whole football field 15 times.  That's 100 yards each way, so that's 200 yards per trip.  He does that 15 times, so he runs 200 * 15 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once across the whole field, which is 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. That's 40 yards each way, so that's 80 yards per trip. She does that 34 times, so she runs 80 * 34 = 2720 yards.

To find out how much farther Blake runs, we subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance: 3000 - 2720 = 280 yards.


**Answer:** Blake runs 280 yards farther than Kelly. 
"
"Okay, so Raphael bought 4 pens at $1.50 each, which is 4 times $1.50, so that's $6.  

He also got 2 notebooks at $4 each, so that's 2 times $4, which is $8.

And then he bought a ream of paper for $20.

If you add all that up, $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

"
"Okay, so there were 11 tadpoles to start. Then 6 more came out, so that's 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles.  Then 2 hid, so 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles.

"
"Okay, so on Monday the tank had 17 feet of water.  Then on Tuesday, it got 7 feet more, so it had 17 + 7 = 24 feet of water.  

On Wednesday, the water level was two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so we do 24 feet * (2/3) = 16 feet. 


The tank had 16 feet of water on Wednesday. 
"
"Okay, so Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. That's a total of 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish for Anakin.

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.  He also caught 3 fewer seahorses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 seahorses.  And he caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

That means Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

Together, they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish. 



"
"Okay, so the marbles start at $20.  Every two months, the price goes up by 20%.  

That means after two months, they cost $20 plus 20% of $20, which is $4 more. So they cost $24.

Then, after another two months, the price goes up another $4.80 (20% of $24).

We gotta keep doing this for 18 sets of two months (because 36 months / 2 months = 18).  

It's a lot of adding, but if you keep going, you'll find out how much they cost after 36 months! 



"
"Okay, so there are 5 red cars at $4 each, so they cost 5 * $4 = $20.  

There are 3 action figures at $5 each, so they cost 3 * $5 = $15.

The doll costs the same as 3 action figures, which is $15.

Adding it all up, the toys cost $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"Jackie would lose $105 if she did her taxes herself because she'd miss out on 3 hours of work at $35 an hour.  The accountant costs $90.  So, Jackie would have $105 - $90 = $15 more if she hired the accountant.

"Elvira spent €1090 on the computer, €157 on a scanner, €74 on a CD burner, and €102 on a printer.  

Let's add those up: €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

She had €1500 to spend, so she has €1500 - €1423 = €77 left for clothes.

"Okay, so Seth is twice as old as Brooke.  That means if Brooke is 5, Seth is 10.  

In two years, they'll both be older.  Let's say Brooke is 8 now. In two years she'll be 10. Seth would be twice her age, so he'd be 20.

If we add their ages in two years, 10 + 20 = 30. That's too big!  

Let's try Brooke being 6. In two years she'd be 8, and Seth would be 16. 

16 + 8 = 24.  Still too big!

Let's try Brooke being 4. In two years she'd be 6, and Seth would be 12.

12 + 6 = 18.  Getting closer!

Let's try Brooke being 2. In two years she'd be 4, and Seth would be 8.

8 + 4 = 12.  Nope, too small!

Let's try Brooke being 3. In two years she'd be 5, and Seth would be 10.

"Okay, so Ethel has $8.  Jimmy has $2 more than twice that amount.  

Twice the amount Ethel has is 8 times 2, which is $16.

Then Jimmy has $16 plus $2 more, so he has $18.

"He walks 20 miles each day for five days, so that's 20 * 5 = 100 miles.  Then he walks 10 miles each day on the weekend, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 miles.  

In total, he walks 100 + 20 = 120 miles in a week. 


"
"Okay, so each uniform has a hat that costs $25. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so it costs $25 x 3 = $75.  

The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket, so they cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

To find the total cost of the uniform, we add up the price of each piece: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150. 


"
"Okay, so there are 80 spiders with 8 legs each, which is 80 times 8, which is 640 legs.  Then there are 90 insects with 6 legs each, so that's 90 times 6, which is 540 legs.  And there are 3 mutant things with 10 legs each, so that's 3 times 10, which is 30 legs.  If you add all those up, you get 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs! 


"
"Okay, so we know Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and she's the same age as Sally Four.  That means Sally Four is also 8.

Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so she's 8 * 2 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so she's 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Finally, to find the total age, we add them all up: 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51

"Okay, so Jessica has to pay $300 for her student loans, $200 for her credit card, and $500 for her mortgage. That's a total of $1000 each month.

She wants to pay 50% more than that, so she needs to figure out 50% of $1000.  Half of 1000 is 500, so 50% is $500 more.

That means she pays $1000 + $500 = $1500 each month.

In a year, she pays $1500 x 12 months = $18,000. 



"
"Okay, so Billy needs to peel and cut 60 potatoes.  

Peeling takes 1.5 minutes per potato, and cutting takes 5 seconds, which is the same as 5/60 of a minute.

So, for each potato, it takes 1.5 minutes + 5/60 minutes = 1.583 minutes.

Multiply that by 60 potatoes, and it takes him 1.583 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 95 minutes. 


**Answer:** 95 minutes 
"
"Okay, so Juan and Carlos make lemonade and sell it for $0.50 a glass. They make 20 glasses from each gallon.  It costs them $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar for each gallon.  If they made $25 in profit, how much did they spend on lemons?

Let's think:

* Each gallon costs $3 for lemons + $2 for sugar = $5 total.
* They make $10 from each gallon ($0.50 x 20 glasses).
* That means they make $5 profit from each gallon ($10 - $5).
* To make $25 in profit, they must have made 5 gallons ($25 / $5).
* So they spent $15 on lemons ($3 x 5 gallons).

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Zaid spends $6000 / 4 = $1500 on rent.
* He spends $6000 / 3 = $2000 on gas.
* That means he spends a total of $1500 + $2000 = $3500 on rent and gas.
* He has $6000 - $3500 = $2500 left.
* He donates half of that, so he gives away $2500 / 2 = $1250.
* Now he has $2500 - $1250 = $1250 left.
* He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, for a total of $200 + $700 = $900.
* Finally, he has $1250 - $900 = $350 left.

"Okay, so Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer than Bo, so she has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.  Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so she has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs!

"Okay, so the winner got 3/4 of the votes, which is the same as 75%.  If 80 students voted, that means the winner got 75% of 80, which is 60 votes.  

To find out how many votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total votes: 80 - 60 = 20 votes. 


**20**

"Okay, so Sandra ordered way more red roses than white carnations.  She got 200 pink calla lilies, and those were five times the number of white carnations.  That means there were 200 / 5 = 40 white carnations.

Since she got four times as many red roses as white carnations, she must have ordered 40 * 4 = 160 red roses!

"
"Okay, so Jan is 30 years old.  Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.  Half of Jan's age is 30 / 2 = 15.  So Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old two years ago.  That means Mark is 20 + 2 = 22 years old now.  Since Jean is two years older than Mark, she is 22 + 2 = 24 years old.

"
"Okay, so the first team is super fast! They all run their 400 meters in 55 seconds each. That means their total time is 55 seconds times 4 runners, which is 220 seconds.

The second team is a little slower. Their first runner takes 60 seconds, but each runner after that is 3 seconds faster. So the second runner takes 57 seconds, the third takes 54 seconds, and the last runner takes 51 seconds.  If you add all those times up, you get 222 seconds.

That means the first team wins by 2 seconds! 


"
"Okay, so Jerry's rolling a die.  

There are three numbers bigger than 3 (4, 5, and 6), and there are six total numbers. So, there's a 3 out of 6 chance, which is like a 50% chance, of rolling a number bigger than 3.

To roll two even numbers in a row, you gotta roll an even number first, then another even number. There are three even numbers (2, 4, and 6), so there's a 3 out of 6 chance of rolling an even number.  Then, you gotta do it again! So, it's like 3 out of 6 times 3 out of 6, which is 9 out of 36. That's a pretty small chance, like 25%.

So, it's way more likely to roll a number bigger than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row! 



"
"Okay, so Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Jenna picked half as many as her mom, which is 20 divided by 2, which is 10 apples.  

To find out how many apples they picked together, we add the number of apples each person picked: 20 + 10 = 30 apples. 


"
"Okay, so there are 10 hamster cages with 5 pieces of straw each, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw.  Then there are 20 pieces for the rabbits. That means there are 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw for the rats.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, there are 90 / 6 = 15 rats in total.

They're in 3 cages, so there are 15 / 3 = 5 rats in each cage.

"Okay, so Mandy owes Benedict $100.  Every month, she has to pay 2% extra on top of what she already owes.  

After one month, she owes a little more than $100 because of the interest.  Then, the next month, she owes a little more than that because the interest is calculated on the new, bigger amount.  

Let's see...

* Month 1: $100 + ($100 * 0.02) = $102
* Month 2: $102 + ($102 * 0.02) = $104.04
* Month 3: $104.04 + ($104.04 * 0.02) = $106.12


So after three months, Mandy owes Benedict $106.12. 


"
"Okay, so the trader buys each bag of wheat for $20 and it costs $2 to get it to the warehouse. That means each bag costs $22 in total.  He sells each bag for $30, so he makes $8 profit on each bag.  

If he made a total profit of $400, he must have sold $400 / $8 = 50 bags.

"Okay, so they spent $20.25 on tickets, $4.50 less on food than that, and $66 on two rides.  

First, let's figure out how much they spent on food: $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

Then, let's add up all their spending: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.00

Finally, to see how much each friend paid, we divide the total cost by 3: $102.00 / 3 = $34.00

"Okay, so each duck eats 3.5 pounds of bugs every week.  If there are 10 ducks, that means they eat 3.5 times 10, which is 35 pounds of bugs all together each week.  

To find out how many pounds they eat each day, we divide 35 pounds by 7 days, which equals 5 pounds per day. 


**Answer: 5**

"Okay, so Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 more each year for 10 years. That's 100 more trees!  

Then he chops down 2 trees each year, so he chops down 20 trees over 10 years.

That means he has 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.

But then 30% of them die, which is like taking out 3 out of every 10.  So, 30% of 130 is 39 trees.

Finally, he has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left. 



"
"Okay, so here's how to figure this out:

*  They started with 18 pink flamingos.
*  They took away 6, so there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.
*  They painted 6 white, so there were 6 white flamingos.
*  Then they added 18 more pink flamingos, making a total of 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

*  So, there were 30 - 6 = 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos.

"Okay, so a pen costs the same as a pencil and eraser together.  A pencil is $1.20 and an eraser is $0.30, so together they cost $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

If 8 pens cost $1.50 each, they'd cost $1.50 x 8 = $12.00  




"
"Okay, so they have 200 pounds of carrots and want to give 2 pounds to each of 40 restaurants.  

First, let's see how many pounds they'll use in total: 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds.

Then, to find out how many pounds are leftover, we subtract: 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds.

"Okay, so there are 23,786 people in Soda.  

There are 8,417 men and 9,092 women.  

To find out how many kids there are, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total number of people:

23,786 - 8,417 - 9,092 = 6,277


There are **6277** kids in Soda. 
"
"Okay, so Elaine starts with 20 cards.  Then she gets three times that amount, which is 60 more cards.  

After that, she gets 20 fewer than the 60 she got before, so she gets 40 cards.

Finally, she gets twice the amount of cards she got in the first two months, which is 100 cards total.  So she got 100 * 2 = 200 cards.

Adding all the cards together, she has 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards. 




"
"Okay, so Mark edits 1000 sentences total, and he edits the same amount for each publisher. That means he edits 500 sentences for each one.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so he makes 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, so they pay 5 cents * 2 = 10 cents per sentence.

That means he makes 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

In total, he makes 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents each week. 




"
"Okay, so Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and each pail has 5 liters. That's 5 times 5 which is 25 liters.  Then he gets 6 pails in the afternoon, so that's 6 times 5 which is 30 liters.  If you add the morning and afternoon water, he gets 25 plus 30 which is 55 liters of water every day!

"Okay, so John gets a one-time bonus of $5000 and his pay goes up by 5%.  

His pay goes up by $2000 * 0.05 = $100 each week.

That means he makes $2000 + $100 = $2100 every week.

In a year, he works 52 weeks, so he makes $2100 * 52 = $109,200

Adding his bonus, he makes a total of $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200

"Okay, so Carl ate 2 slices of cheese on each of his 7 sandwiches, which is 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

For breakfast, he used 3 slices of cheese per omelet, and he made 3 omelets, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 slices.

Then he used 8 slices for his macaroni and cheese.

Adding it all up, he used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.

"Okay, so Janet starts with 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, that's 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Then she gets 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag has 9 pens, so that's 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also gets 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Finally, to find the total, we add up all the colors: 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens! 


**98** 
"
"Okay, so Brinley needs a 93 average on 5 tests.  That means she needs a total of 93 times 5, which is 465 points.  

She already has 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 points.

To get to 465, she needs to score 465 - 438 = 27 on her last test. 


**Answer:** 27 
"
"Okay, so Michael biked 25 kilometers five times a week for four weeks. That's 25 times 5, which is 125 kilometers each week.  Then he biked 125 kilometers a week for four weeks, so he biked a total of 125 times 4, which is 500 kilometers.

After that, he biked 60 kilometers twice a week for three weeks. That's 60 times 2, which is 120 kilometers each week.  So over three weeks, he biked 120 times 3, which is 360 kilometers.

Finally, to find the total, we add the kilometers from both parts: 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers. 


"
"Okay, so each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and there are 25 of them. That's 40 times 25, which is 1000 grams.

Each candied apple weighs half as much as a chocolate bar, so it weighs 40 grams divided by 2, which is 20 grams.

There are 80 candied apples, so they weigh 20 grams times 80, which is 1600 grams.

To find the total weight, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples: 1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams.


**2600** 
"
"Okay, so Rose bought 4 cakes on Monday. Then she bought three times that amount on Tuesday, which is 4 times 3 equals 12 cakes.  On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the amount from Tuesday, so that's 12 times 5, which is 60 cakes.  

To find the total, we add up all the cakes: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes. 


76 
"
"Okay, so half a dozen plates is 6 plates, and they cost $6000 each. That means half a dozen plates cost 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than that, so they cost $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since there are 20 dozen cups, and a dozen has 12 cups, there are 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of one cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups: $34800 / 240 cups = $145 per cup. 



**Answer:** $145 
"
"Okay, so Sara wants a jacket that costs $30 and two pairs of shoes at $20 each. That means the shoes cost $40 in total.  

She needs $30 + $40 = $70 for everything.

Sara already has $10 saved and made $20 babysitting. That's $10 + $20 = $30.

She still needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

If she makes $4 each time she mows the lawn, she needs to mow $40 / $4 = 10 times. 


"
"Okay, so Jerry has red chickens that lay 3 eggs each and white chickens that lay 5 eggs each.  He gets 42 eggs every day in total.  He also has 2 more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's think about this: if he had only red chickens, he'd get 3 times the number of red chickens in eggs.  But he gets more than that, so he must have some white chickens too!

To figure out how many red chickens he has, we can use a little trial and error.  Let's start by guessing.  What if he has 4 red chickens? That means he has 6 white chickens (4 + 2).

* Red chickens: 4 chickens * 3 eggs/chicken = 12 eggs
* White chickens: 6 chickens * 5 eggs/chicken = 30 eggs
* Total: 12 eggs + 30 eggs = 42 eggs

That works! 


**Answer:** Jerry has 4 red chickens. 
"
"Okay, so the park is a rectangle, and to find out how long it takes Gary to walk around it, we need to find the total distance.  

The distance around a rectangle is called the perimeter.  We find it by adding up all the sides: 6 miles + 1.5 miles + 6 miles + 1.5 miles = 15 miles.

Now we know Gary walks 3 miles every hour, so to walk 15 miles it will take him 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours. 


**Answer:** 5 hours 
"
"Okay, so on the first day Sloane saw 100 customers.  The next day she saw 50 more than that, so she saw 100 + 50 = 150 customers.  

Then, over the three days, she saw a total of 500 customers.  To find out how many she saw on the third day, we can subtract the number she saw on the first two days: 500 - 100 - 150 = 250 customers. 


"
"Okay, so the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago.  That means if the small pool had *x* amount of water, the big pool had 2*x* amount of water.

Since both pools leak 4 gallons every minute, in four minutes they both lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.  So, the big pool has 4 times the amount of water the small pool has *now*.

Let's write that out:

* Small pool now: *x* - 16 gallons
* Big pool now: 2*x* - 16 gallons

We know the big pool is four times the small pool now:

* 2*x* - 16 = 4(*x* - 16)

Let's solve for *x*:

* 2*x* - 16 = 4*x* - 64
* 48 = 2*x*
* *x* = 24

So the small pool had 24 gallons four minutes ago.  

Now, after losing 16 gallons, the small pool has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.



**Answer:** 8 
"
"Okay, so Lori wants to buy shoes that cost $320 and a belt that costs $32.  

First, we need to find out how much money she needs in total.  That's $320 + $32 = $352.

Then we need to figure out how many hours she has to work to make $352.  Since she makes $8 an hour, she needs to work $352 / $8 = 44 hours. 


**Answer:** 44 hours 
"
"Okay, so Janeth owes $2000 and has to pay back 10% extra, which is $200. That means she needs to pay back a total of $2200.

If she pays $165 each month for 12 months, she'll pay back $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find out how much she still owes, we subtract that from the total: $2200 - $1980 = $220.


**Answer:** $220 
"
"Okay, so there are 4 roses.  Dahlias are more than the roses, 7 more to be exact.  That means there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.  

To find the total, we add the roses and dahlias: 4 + 11 = 15 flowers! 


"
"Okay, so Harriet is 21 now.  Zack is twice as old as Harriet, so Zack is 21 times 2, which is 42. Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so Adrian is 21 times 3, which is 63.

In three years, Harriet will be 21 plus 3, which is 24. Zack will be 42 plus 3, which is 45. And Adrian will be 63 plus 3, which is 66.

To find the average age, we add all their ages together: 24 + 45 + 66 = 135. Then we divide that by 3 because there are three of them: 135 divided by 3 is 45.


So the average age in three years will be 45. 
"
"Okay, so Naomi got 68 points. Yuri got 10 more than half of Naomi's points, so first we find half of Naomi's points, which is 68 / 2 = 34. Then we add 10 to that: 34 + 10 = 44 points for Yuri.  

Brianna got 17 more points than Naomi, so she got 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now let's add up Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna's points: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Finally, to find out how many points Jojo got, we subtract that from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54 points.



**Answer:** Jojo scored 54 points. 
"
"Carmen spent 30 minutes doing crosswords (3 puzzles x 10 minutes each) and 40 minutes doing sudoku (8 puzzles x 5 minutes each).  

So she spent a total of 70 minutes playing games. 


"
"Okay, so there's 120 liters in the tank at first. Celine takes out 90 liters, which leaves 120 - 90 = 30 liters.  Then she gets 30 * 2 = 60 liters of rainwater.  Adding that to what was left, there's 30 + 60 = 90 liters in the tank now. 


"
"Okay, so Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than that.  That means he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.  

To find the total, we add the geraniums and petunias: 90 + 50 = 140 flowers. 


140 
"
"Okay, so they spent $15,000 the first year.  Then they spent a third of that the second year, which is $15,000 divided by 3, which is $5,000.  

To find the total, we add those two amounts together: $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000 


20000 
"
"Okay, so Carlos pays $30 every hour for the canoe and he uses it for 3 hours. That means he pays $30 * 3 = $90.

Benji pays $18 every hour for the banana boat and uses it for 5 hours, so he pays $18 * 5 = $90.

Together, they pay $90 + $90 = $180. 


"
"Okay, so Andrew takes 6 days to get to Rochester by bus.  He goes back by car, and that takes half as long, which is 6 days / 2 = 3 days.  

To find the total time, we add those together: 6 days + 3 days = 9 days. 


**Answer:** 9 days 
"
"Okay, so James starts with 30 fire, 20 grass, and 40 water cards.  That's a total of 90 cards.

He loses 8 water cards, so he has 40 - 8 = 32 water cards left.

Then he buys 14 more grass cards, making his grass total 20 + 14 = 34 cards.

Now he has 32 water + 34 grass + 30 fire = 96 cards.

To find the chance of picking a water card, we do: (32 water cards / 96 total cards) * 100% = 33.33%

Rounding that to the nearest whole number, it's about 33%. 




"
"Okay, so Chad's burrito starts at $6.50.  Then he adds meat for $2.00, cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and two sauces at $0.25 each, which is $0.50.  That's a lot of toppings!  

He also gets the upgrade with chips and a drink for $3.00.  

So, the burrito costs $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

But wait, he has a $5.00 gift card!  That means he still owes $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00 




"
"Okay, so Kalinda puts 4 puzzle pieces together every minute, and her mom puts in half as many, which is 2 pieces a minute.  

Together, they put 4 + 2 = 6 pieces together every minute.

To do a 360 piece puzzle, it'll take them 360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes.

That's the same as 1 hour! 


"
"Okay, so there were 120 baby watermelons.  Ashlyn picked 30% of them the first time, which is the same as (30/100) * 120 = 36 watermelons.

That leaves 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Then, two weeks later, she picked 3/4 of the remaining watermelons, which is (3/4) * 84 = 63 watermelons.

So, there were 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons left that weren't ready. 


**21** 
"
"Okay, so Mark buys 12 cars at $20,000 each. That's 12 times 20,000 which is 240,000 dollars.  

Then he has to pay 10% tax on that, so he pays 0.10 times 240,000 which is 24,000 dollars in tax.

And then he pays 1,000 dollars to register each car, so that's 12 times 1,000 which is 12,000 dollars.

Finally, to find the total, we add it all up: 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 dollars!




**276,000** 
"
"Okay, so Robert found 20 shells on Monday. Kylie found 5 more than him, so she found 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

On Tuesday, Kylie found twice as many as Monday, so she found 25 * 2 = 50 shells. 


"
"Okay, so there are 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs.  That means there are 50 / 2 = 25 bugs.  

To find the total number of insects, we add the ants and bugs: 50 + 25 = 75 insects! 


"
"Okay, so first we need to figure out how many penguins went swimming.  One-third of 36 is 36 divided by 3, which is 12 penguins.

Then, another 12 penguins went into the cave.

That means 36 total penguins - 12 swimming - 12 in the cave = 12 penguins left sunbathing. 


12 
"
"Okay, so Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes every day and his girlfriend eats half that amount.  

That means his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes a day.

Together they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes each day.

If they eat 9 tomatoes a day, that means they eat 9 * 7 = 63 tomatoes a week.

Since each vine makes 3 tomatoes a week, they need 63 / 3 = 21 vines. 


**Answer: 21** 
"
"Okay, so John needs to feed 20 friends and each friend wants 4 slices. That means he needs 20 times 4, which is 80 slices of pizza in total.  

Each pizza has 8 slices, so he needs to order 80 divided by 8, which is 10 pizzas.

"
"Okay, so Jessa is 20 years old. Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.  

To find the sum of their ages, we add them up: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 years old. 


"
"Okay, so there were 1000 students in the hall.  

* First, 30% of them left through exit A, which is 1000 * 0.30 = 300 students.

* That means 1000 - 300 = 700 students were left.

* Then, 3/5 of those students left through exit B.  That's 700 * (3/5) = 420 students.

*  So, 700 - 420 = 280 students were left to go out through exit C.




**Answer: 280** 
"
"Okay, so John has 54 candies and that's twice the amount Robert has.  So Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.  James has 6 more candies than Robert, which means he has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.  

John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James.

"
"Okay, so Mike had 5 pen pals but then lost touch with 2. That means he has 3 pen pals left.

Each pen pal sends him 2 letters a week, so he gets 3 pen pals * 2 letters/pen pal = 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he gets 6 letters * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages a week.

He writes back a page every 6 minutes, so it takes him 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes to write.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.


**Answer: 3** 
"
"Okay, so Jason uses 15 minutes every day to talk to his boss, and there are 30 days this month. That means he uses 15 * 30 = 450 minutes for his boss calls.  

Then he uses an extra 300 minutes for other calls.  So in total, he uses 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

If his plan is for 1000 minutes, he has 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes left. 


250 
"
"Okay, so Griffin had 24 fries and Kyle took 5.  That means Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.  Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 5 * 2 = 10 fries.  That means Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.  Colby took 3 fewer than Kyle, so he took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.  Griffin then had 9 - 2 = 7 fries.  Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, Ginger must have given him 27 - 7 = 20 fries. 



**Answer:** 20 
"
"Okay, so there are 4 snails in one tank and 32 in the other. That means there are 32 - 4 = 28 more snails in the bigger tank.  

The problem says that difference in snails (28) is twice the number of fish in *both* tanks.  Since the tanks have the same number of fish, let's say there are 'f' fish in each tank.  

So, 28 = 2 * f  

To find out how many fish are in each tank, we divide both sides by 2: 28 / 2 = f

That means there are 14 fish in each tank! 



"
"Okay, so the makeup artist charges $250 an hour and it takes 6 hours each day, so that's $250 * 6 = $1500 per day.

She does makeup 4 days a week, so that's $1500 * 4 = $6000 per week.

The movie takes 5 weeks, so that's $6000 * 5 = $30000 in total.

But then she gets a 10% discount, which is $30000 * 0.10 = $3000 off.

So Jean ends up paying $30000 - $3000 = $27000. 




"
"Okay, so Isabelle spent $12 on cake stuff, $43 on presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invites, and $22 on goodie bags.  That's a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96.

Since she split the cost with her two parents, that means they each paid $96 / 3 = $32. 


"
"Okay, so the chef bought 4 bags of onions and each bag has 50 pounds of onions. That means they bought 4 times 50, which is 200 pounds of onions in total.  

If one pound of onions costs $1.50, then 200 pounds would cost 200 times $1.50, which is $300.00! 


"
"Okay, so Sue ate way more cookies than her sister! 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times the number of cookies her sister ate, who had 5. So Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Then on Tuesday, Sue ate twice the number of cookies her sister ate, who had 13. So Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.

Her sister ate 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

That means Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister. 




"
"Okay, so there are 60 students in total because there are 3 classes with 20 students each.  

We know there are 27 girls in the first two classes. Since there are 60 students total and 50% are girls, there are 33 boys.

The first two classes have 27 girls, so the third class must have 6 boys. 


**Answer: 6** 
"
"Okay, so Travis started with 61 apps.  He deleted 9, so that's 61 - 9 = 52 apps left. Then he got 18 more, so 52 + 18 = 70 apps!

"
"Okay, so Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars yesterday.  Today he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, which is 12 cougars times 3, so that's 36 wolves.  He also killed 3 fewer cougars than yesterday, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

That means he killed a total of 10 + 36 = 46 wolves and 15 + 12 = 27 cougars.

All together, Rick killed 46 + 27 = 73 animals. 



"
"Okay, so Bill starts on the 3rd floor.  He goes up to a floor that's 4 times the 3rd floor plus 6.  

Let's do the math:

* 4 times the 3rd floor is 4 * 3 = 12
* Then you add 6: 12 + 6 = 18


Bill is now on the 18th floor! 
"
"Okay, so Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, so we need to figure out what 30% of 30 is. That's like taking 30 and cutting it into 100 pieces, then taking 30 of those pieces.  30% of 30 is 9 slides. So Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down 4 times as many as Anne, so he went down 21 * 4 = 84 times. 


**Answer:** 84 
"
"Okay, so there are 20 stalls with 20 cows each, which is a lot of cows!  That's 200 cows in total.

Then Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and puts them evenly into all the stalls.  That means each stall gets 2 more cows.

If each stall has 2 more cows, then 8 stalls would have 8 * 2 = 16 cows. 


**16** 
"
"Okay, so Brady has 100 pennies, which is like a dollar.  Then he has 40 nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents, so that's 40 times 5, which is 200 cents. That's two dollars!  He also has 20 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents, so that's 20 times 10, which is 200 cents, or two dollars.  And finally, he has 40 dollar bills, which is just 40 dollars!

If you add all that up, he has $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45. 



"
"Okay, so the redwood tree is 200 feet tall and each part is 10 feet long. That means there are 20 parts of the tree.  

Each part weighs 400 pounds, so the whole tree weighs 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

But, termites ate 30% of the tree!  That's like eating 3 out of every 10 parts.  

So, 30% of 8000 pounds is (30/100) * 8000 = 2400 pounds.

If 2400 pounds were eaten, the tree now weighs 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds. 


**5600** 
"
"Okay, so she owes $0.50 for each of her 8 books, which is $0.50 x 8 = $4.00.  Then she has to pay an extra $2.00 because one book was late.  So, $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00 total. 


6.00"
"Okay, so Andrea has 52 apples and 8 more than Jamal. That means Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.  

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Andrea has 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.

Jamal has 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits.

Together they have 76 + 92 = 168 fruits. 




"
"Okay, so she's making 36 cookies today and 30 tomorrow, which is a total of 66 cookies.  

If 2 cups of flour make a dozen cookies, and there are 12 cookies in a dozen, then she needs 66 / 12 = 5.5 dozens of flour.

Since each dozen needs 2 cups, she'll need 5.5 dozens * 2 cups/dozen = 11 cups of flour. 



"
"Okay, so there are 9300 pennies in a cup.  Two-thirds of that is... let's see...  

*  9300 divided by 3 is 3100.
*  Two times 3100 is 6200 pennies.

Since there are 100 pennies in a dollar, 6200 pennies is equal to $62.00 


**$62.00**
"
"Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles each, so she has 5 * 50 = 250 marbles.  Then she gets 20 more, so she has 250 + 20 = 270 marbles.

"
"Okay, so Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half as many as Chris, which is 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Harry has twice the number of trees Ferdinand has, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 trees.  But Harry also has 5 more than that, so he has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

That means Harry has 11 - 3 = 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 



**8**"
"Okay, so Carmen has $100. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so she has $100 + $25 = $125.  Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so she has $125 + $50 = $175.  

To find out how much they have altogether, we add it all up: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400. 


"
"Okay, so the house costs $350,000.  

There's a 5% fee for the person helping sell the house, which is $350,000 times 0.05, which is $17,500.

Then there's a 12% fee for transferring the house, which is $350,000 times 0.12, which is $42,000.

So the total extra fees are $17,500 plus $42,000, which is $59,500.

Adding that to the house price, the total cost is $350,000 plus $59,500, which is $409,500.

Mrs. Cruz only has $400,000, so the house costs $409,500 minus $400,000, which is $9,500 more than she can afford. 


**Answer: $9,500** 
"
"Okay, so Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000.  He had to pay some fees.  

* Transfer fees were 3% of the selling price, so that's 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.
* Brokerage fees were 5%, so that's 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

He also had to pay $250,000 for his remaining loan.  

To find out how much money he actually got, we need to subtract all those costs from the selling price:

$400,000 - $12,000 - $20,000 - $250,000 = $118,000


**Answer:** Mr. Tan got $118,000 from selling his house. 
"
"Okay, so the oil takes 20 minutes to get to 300 degrees. Then it takes 40% longer to get to 400 degrees.  That means it takes 8 more minutes (40% of 20 is 8).

So heating the oil takes 28 minutes in total (20 + 8).

Then it cooks for 5 minutes less than that, which is 23 minutes.

Adding those together, it takes 51 minutes from start to finish. 



"
"Okay, so he spent $5 on each newspaper ad and he bought 50 of them. That's $5 * 50 = $250.  

Then he spent $75 on each TV ad and bought 15 of them, so that's $75 * 15 = $1125.

To find the total, we add those together: $250 + $1125 = $1375 


"
"Okay, so there are 16 balls total. Half of them are golf balls, which is 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls.  Then, half of those golf balls are blue, so there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls. 


4 
"
"Okay, so Mary has three bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. The third bag has half the M&Ms of the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms. 



"
"Okay, so there are 2 houses and each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each. That's 3 times 2 which is 6 windows per house from the bedrooms.

Then there are 4 extra windows in each house.

So, each house has 6 plus 4 which is 10 windows.

And since there are 2 houses, there are 10 times 2 which is 20 windows in total! 


20 
"
"Okay, so the mom spent $4.20 on cocoa, $9.45 on laundry, and $1.35 on pasta.  

Let's add those up: $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

She paid with $20.00, so the cashier gives her $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00 back. 


5.00 
"
"Okay, so the sweater has 900 stitches for the body, and the collar is a tenth of that, which is 90 stitches. The rosette has twice as many stitches as the collar, so that's 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

Adding those up, the body, collar, and rosette have 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

That means the two sleeves together have 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve has 630 / 2 = 315 stitches. 


"
"Okay, so Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 each, which is 20 * 40 = $800.  

She also bought 80 packets of celery seeds at $30 each, so that's 80 * 30 = $2400.

To find the total cost, we add those together: $800 + $2400 = $3200.


3200 
"
"Okay, so Sean has to learn his lines for two scenes and a song. 

* The song has 54 lines.
* The first scene has twice as many lines as the song, but only a third of them are his. So, that's 54 * 2 = 108 lines, and then 108 / 3 = 36 lines for Sean.
* The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, so that's 54 + 6 = 60 lines.  Four-fifths of those lines are his, so that's 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines.

To find the total, we add up all the lines: 36 + 48 + 54 = 138 lines.


**Answer:** Sean has to memorize 138 lines. 
"
"Okay, so Carly had 80 cards.  

* First, we find out how many cards have an A: (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

* That leaves 80 - 32 = 48 cards.

* Then, half of those have a B: (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

* Now we have 48 - 24 = 24 cards left.

*  5/8 of those have a C: (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

*  Finally, the rest must have a D: 24 - 15 = 9 cards.




**Answer:** 9 
"
"Okay, so Matthew digs small holes for 3 minutes each and big holes for 10 minutes each.  

He needs to dig 30 small holes, so that's 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.

Then he needs to dig 15 big holes, so that's 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

In total, that's 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To turn that into hours, we know there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours. 


**Answer:** 4 hours 
"
"Here's how to solve this:

*  Since Mico and Marco's ages add up to 20 now, in 10 years they'll each be 10 years older.
*  Adding 10 years to each of their ages means their total age will increase by 20 (10 + 10 = 20).

So the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40 (20 + 20 = 40). 


"
"Okay, so Ruby is way older than Sam. Like, 6 times older!  

In nine years, Ruby will be three times as old as Sam.  That means if Sam is S years old now, Ruby is 6S years old.  

In nine years, Sam will be S + 9 years old, and Ruby will be 6S + 9 years old.  We know that in nine years, Ruby will be three times as old as Sam, so:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Let's solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27
3S = 18
S = 6


Sam is 6 years old! 
"
"Okay, so Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, which is 20 times 0.25, so that's $5.00.  Then he bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so that's 4 times 0.50, which is $2.00.  

If you add $5.00 and $2.00 together, he spent $7.00 in total. 


"
"Okay, so there are 70 spots on a cobra and a mamba has half the spots, which is 35.  

There are 40 cobras, so they have a total of 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

There are 60 mambas, so they have a total of 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

All together, there are 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Half of that is 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots. 



**Answer: 2450**
"
"Okay, so Maddy needs to feed 12 soccer players, 3 coaches, and each player brings 2 guests.  That means there are 12 x 2 = 24 guests!

So in total, there are 12 + 3 + 24 = 39 people.

If one pizza feeds 3 people, Maddy needs 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so she'll spend 13 x $15 = $195. 


"
"Okay, so each topaz is 1 inch long and there are 8 of them, so that's 8 inches total.  The necklace is 25 inches long, so there are 25 - 8 = 17 inches left for the silver beads.  Each silver bead is 1/4 inch long, so Katerina uses 17 / 0.25 = 68 silver beads. 


**68** 
"
"Okay, so Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40, and Margot wrote 60. That's a total of 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories in the first week.

Then they doubled their stories in the second week!  

* Alani: 20 * 2 = 40 stories
* Braylen: 40 * 2 = 80 stories
* Margot: 60 * 2 = 120 stories

So in the second week, they wrote 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories.

Adding that to the first week, they wrote a total of 120 + 240 = 360 stories altogether. 


"
"Ann's brother is twice her age, so he's 9 * 2 = 18 years old.  In three years, he'll be 18 + 3 = 21 years old. 


21 
"
"Okay, so Kelly has 5 quarters, which is worth 125 cents (because each quarter is 25 cents).  She also has 2 dimes, which is worth 20 cents (since each dime is 10 cents).

That means she has a total of 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, she'll have 145 - 55 = 90 cents left. 


"
"Okay, so there are 3 rows of 8 stars, which is 24 stars. Then there are 2 rows of 6 stars, which is another 12 stars. That means there are 24 + 12 = 36 stars in the first five rows.

The whole flag has 76 stars, so there are 76 - 36 = 40 stars left.  

Since each of those rows has 5 stars, there are 40 / 5 = 8 rows of 5 stars. 


**Answer: 8** 
"
"Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds and they need to move 80 flagstones.  So that's 75 times 80, which is 6000 pounds!  

Each truck can hold 2000 pounds, so they'll need 6000 divided by 2000, which is 3 trucks. 


"
"Okay, so the fast car goes 60 miles per hour and the slow car goes half as fast.  That means the slow car goes 30 miles per hour.

If the fast car drives 480 miles, we need to figure out how long it takes the slow car to do the same.  We can do that by dividing the distance by the speed:

480 miles / 30 miles per hour = 16 hours 


**Answer: 16 hours** 
"
"Okay, so Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less than that, which is 17 medals.  Together they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.  

The problem says they have 10 times *less* medals than the total given out, so we need to multiply 39 by 10 to find the total.  That means there have been 39 * 10 = 390 medals given out for counting! 



"
"Okay, so there are 8 packets of chocolate with 5 bars in each packet, which means there are 8 * 5 = 40 chocolate bars total.

The adults get 6 bars each, and there are 4 adults, so they get 6 * 4 = 24 chocolate bars.

That leaves 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars for the kids.

Since there are 8 kids, each kid gets 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars. 


**2** 
"
"Okay, so Susan makes $5 every 10 minutes.  She works for 3 hours, which is 180 minutes.  But she takes a 30 minute break, so she really works for 150 minutes.  

If she makes $5 every 10 minutes, she makes $75 for working 150 minutes. 


**Answer:** $75 
"
"Okay, so Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 less than Mike, so he has 18 points. Tony has twice as many points as Mike, which is 42 points.

After the fourth round, Mike gets an extra point because he has more than 20.  Tony also gets an extra point because he has more than 20.  

So now Mike has 22 points, Jim still has 18, and Tony has 43.

Adding those up, they have a total of 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points. 



"
"Okay, so Will has 15 oranges. His oldest son is 8, and his youngest is half that age, which is 4.  

That means the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

If they washed 12, then there are 15 - 12 = 3 oranges left. 


**3** 
"
"Okay, so Darren did 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses on the first day. That's a total of 100 + 50 + 20 = 170 exercises.

On the second day, he did 20 more pushups, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups.  He did 10 fewer squats, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats. And he doubled his dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

That means on the second day he did 120 + 40 + 40 = 200 exercises.

In total, he did 170 + 200 = 370 exercises over the two days. 



"
"Okay, so each person eats 0.2 kg of rice at each meal.  That means 5 people eat 0.2 * 5 = 1 kg of rice per meal.

Since they eat rice twice a day, they eat 1 kg * 2 = 2 kg of rice each day.

Over a whole week, they eat 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg of rice.

If their bag of rice is 42 kg, it will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks. 


**Answer: 3 weeks** 
"
"Okay, so Sam wanted to sell 120 crates of bread.  He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he had fewer days to sell.  

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.  Let's add those up: 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

That means he sold 120 - 65 = 55 fewer crates than his goal. 


**Answer:** 55 
"
"Okay, so Carmen starts by bidding $200. Then three other people each bid $50 more than the last. That means the price goes up by $150 in total.  

So, Carmen's final bid to win the desk is $200 plus $150, which is $350! 


"
"Okay, so John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home, which is 60 miles a day.  

He does that 5 days a week, so that's 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles a week.

Over a year, he drives 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles.

He pays $2 per mile, so that's 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000 for driving.

Plus, he gives his driver a $150 bonus each month, which is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800 a year.

So, in total, he pays $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800 a year for driving. 


"
"Okay, so Peter exercised for 23 minutes on Sunday and 16 minutes on Monday.  That's a total of 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.

To exercise twice as long on Tuesday, he needs to exercise 39 * 2 = 78 minutes.

"You only need one piece of paper to make a 32-page tabloid!  You just fold it in half and print on both sides. 


"
"Okay, so Annika had $50 and spent half of it on food, which is $25. Then she spent another $10 on rides.  That means she spent a total of $25 + $10 = $35.  

If she started with $50 and spent $35, she has $50 - $35 = $15 left. 


"
"Okay, so Elise sold twice as many books the first year as she did this year.  She sold 45 books this year, so she sold 45 * 2 = 90 books the first year.

That means she sold a total of 90 + 45 = 135 books in the first two years.

Since she started with 250 books and has 50 left, she sold 250 - 50 = 200 books total.

That means she sold 200 - 135 = 65 books in the third year.

She made $20 for each book she sold this year, so she made 45 * $20 = $900 in the second year. 


"
"Okay, so Watson makes $10 an hour and works 10 hours a day, that's $100 a day.  

He works 5 days a week, so he makes $100 x 5 = $500 each week.

Plus, he gets a $300 bonus every week if the company does well. So he makes $500 + $300 = $800 each week.

April has four weeks, so he makes $800 x 4 = $3200 in April. 


"
"If John won 80% of his arm wrestling matches, and he wrestled 20 people, that means he won 16 matches (20 x 0.80 = 16).  

To find out how many he lost, we subtract his wins from the total number of matches: 20 - 16 = 4.


He lost to 4 people. 
"
"Okay, so the bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day.  They sell two-thirds of them in the morning, which is like 40 loaves.  That leaves 20 loaves. Then, they sell half of the remaining loaves in the afternoon and half in the evening. So, they sell 10 loaves in the afternoon. 


"
"Okay, so Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, which means he loses 2 pounds each week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).  

Sandy wants to lose the same amount, so if she loses 2 pounds each week, it will take her 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds (8 pounds / 2 pounds/week = 4 weeks). 


"
"Okay, so the ice cream used to be $13 but now it's $11, which means you save $2 per tub.  Since you're buying two tubs, that's $2 x 2 = $4 saved on ice cream.

Each packet of milk was discounted by $0.50, and you're buying four packets, so that's $0.50 x 4 = $2 saved on milk.

In total, you save $4 + $2 = $6! 



"
"Okay, so the serum grows an arm every three days and a leg every five days.  

Let's see, in fifteen days there are five sets of three days (15 / 3 = 5) so that means five new arms!

And there are three sets of five days in fifteen days (15 / 5 = 3) so that means three new legs!

Five arms plus three legs equals eight new limbs in total! 


8 
"
"Okay, so Theo has $6000 for his trip. He spends $600 on suits, $150 on suitcases, and $1200 on a plane ticket.  

To figure out how much he spends in total, we add those up: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

He wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left.

That means he has $4000 - $1950 = $2050 left to spend on gifts. 


"
"Okay, so three people eat three eggs each day, which is 9 eggs total.  The other two people eat two eggs each, so that's 4 eggs.  That means they eat 9 + 4 = 13 eggs every day.  

In a week, there are 7 days, so they eat 13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs. 


"
"Okay, so Quinn is 30. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.  Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old. 


"
"Okay, so Cera is 46 now, which means six years ago she was 40.  Noah was half Cera's age then, so he was 20.

Six years ago, Chile's population was 3000 times Noah's age, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60,000 people.

Now, the population is double what it was then, so it's 60,000 * 2 = 120,000 people. 


"
"Okay, so there are 105 players total.  Let's say there are *d* players on defense.  

Since there are twice as many players on offense as defense, there are 2*d* players on offense.

And there are half as many players on special teams as defense, so there are *d*/2 players on special teams.

If you add all the players together, you get: *d* + 2*d* + *d*/2 = 105

To solve for *d*, we can combine the *d* terms: (5/2)*d* = 105

Then, we multiply both sides by 2/5 to get *d* by itself: *d* = 42


**Answer:** 42 
"
"Okay, so Martha invited 12 people from two families and 12 people from three other families. That's a total of 24 people!  But then 8 people got sick and 2 people had other plans.  So, 24 - 8 - 2 = 14 people came to the party. 


"
"Okay, so Solomon got 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to the 50 he already had, which is 20 + 50 = 70 marbles.  

His dad gave him 2/5 of the 20 marbles Johanna gave him, so that's (2/5) * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now Solomon has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles in total.

Since each marble weighs 2 kgs, all the marbles together weigh 78 * 2 = 156 kgs. 



"
"Okay, so the pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep.  To find out how much water it holds, we multiply those numbers: 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet.

It costs $0.10 for every cubic foot, so to find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the price: 120 x $0.10 = $12.00 


**Answer:** $12.00 
"
"Okay, so there are 30 boys.  Since there are three times as many girls as boys, there are 30 * 3 = 90 girls.

There are also 3 kids who don't identify as a boy or a girl, which is 30 boys * (1/10).

Adding all the kids together, we have 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 kids in the classroom! 


"
"Okay, so there are 45 electric wires needed.  The ratio of poles to wires is 1 to 3, meaning for every 3 wires, there's 1 pole.

To find out how many poles we need, we can divide the total wires by 3: 45 wires / 3 = 15 poles. 


**15** 
"
"Okay, so there were 25 guys and 15 girls at the party.  That means there were 40 people in total.

After an hour, 1/4 of the people left, which is 40 / 4 = 10 people.

We know 22 guys stayed, so that means 10 - 22 = -12.  Wait, that doesn't make sense!  It means more guys left than people who left in total.  

Hmm, that's weird.  Let's think about it this way: if 10 people left, and 22 guys stayed, that means 10 - 22 = -12.  That means more guys left than people who left in total.  

Let me know if you want to try another problem! 




"
"Okay, so a book costs $4.  A magazine costs half as much as a book, which is $4 / 2 = $2.  A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so it costs $2 - $1 = $1. 


**1**"
"Okay, so Jam has 26 pencils total, and 2 of them are loose. That means she has 24 pencils in boxes.  Since she has 3 boxes, each box has 8 pencils (24 / 3 = 8).

Jam and Meg have a total of 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  If each box holds 8 pencils, they need 9 boxes (72 / 8 = 9). 


"
"Okay, so Shannon cools her coffee 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools it 13 degrees. That means she used 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Plus, she adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also makes it weaker.  

So, the total weakening is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters. 


**75** 
"
"Okay, so each new record needs 2 old records to be traded.  If they got 7 new records, that means they traded 7 * 2 = 14 old records.

"
"Okay, so there are 100 people working at the company.  

Two-fifths of them are junior programmers, so that's (2/5) * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Senior programmers make $400 more than junior programmers, who make $2000 a month. So senior programmers make $2000 + $400 = $2400 a month.

The company pays all the junior programmers $2000 each, so that's 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

And they pay all the senior programmers $2400 each, so that's 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

To find the total amount the company pays all the programmers, we add those two amounts together: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.




**Answer:** $224,000 
"
"Okay, so there were 20 people at the third stop.  Then 7 got off at the second stop, so there were 20 + 7 = 27 people before that. Then 8 got on at the second stop, so there were 27 - 8 = 19 people.  And finally, 5 got on at the first stop, so there were 19 - 5 = 14 people at the terminal.

"Okay, so Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.  He eats 2, so he has 22 left. Then he gives 14 to his friends, leaving him with 8.  On the way home, he buys twice as many as he gave away, so that's 14 times 2, which is 28 lollipops.  Now he has 8 plus 28, which is 36.  He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 minus 3, which is 33.  In the morning, he eats 2 more, leaving him with 33 minus 2, which is 31 lollipops. 



**Answer:** 31 
"
"Okay, so the phone gains 1% charge every 3 minutes.  It needs to go from 60% to 100%, which is another 40%.  

That means it needs to charge for 40 times 3 minutes, which is 120 minutes.

120 minutes is equal to 2 hours.

"
"Okay, so Erin begins with 7 lollipops. Then her mom gives her 10 more, so she has 17 lollipops.  After giving 3 to Ella, she has 14 lollipops left. 


"
"Okay, so the customer got $1 off for every $20 they spend.  They spent $80 last time, so they got 4 rewards ($80 / $20 = 4).  

This time they spent $43 and used all their rewards, which is $4. Then they had a coupon that took off twice the amount of their rewards, so that's $4 x 2 = $8 off.

That means they saved a total of $4 + $8 = $12.

So, they paid $43 - $12 = $31.

"
"Okay, so Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours, which is $30,000 a year.  They take out 20% for taxes, so that's $6,000.  That means Nick gets to keep $24,000 from Job A.

Job B pays $42,000 a year, but then they take out $6,000 for property tax.  That leaves $36,000.  Then they take out 10% of that for taxes, which is $3,600.  So Nick keeps $32,400 from Job B.

Job B pays more, so Nick would make $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400 more. 


**Answer:** 8400 
"
"Okay, so there are 220 castles in Scotland, and 40% of them are ruins. That means 40 out of every 100 castles are ruins.  

To find out how many ruins there are, we can do some math: 220 castles * 40/100 = 88 ruined castles.

Half of those ruined castles are unmanned, so we divide that number in half: 88 ruined castles / 2 = 44 unmanned ruined castles. 


**Answer:** 44 
"
"Okay, so Furniture United wants $1350 upfront and then $350 every month for 6 months. That's $2100 for the monthly payments, so the total is $1350 + $2100 = $3450.

Cozy Homes wants $1100 upfront and then $250 every month for 9 months. That's $2250 for the monthly payments, so the total is $1100 + $2250 = $3350.

If you subtract Cozy Homes' price from Furniture United's price, you get $3450 - $3350 = $100.  


**Answer:** $100 
"
"Okay, so DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10, RJ has 1, and Richard has 5.  If they split them up evenly,  we need to add up all the guns first: 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns.

Then we divide the total guns by the number of people: 24 guns / 4 people = 6 guns each. 


"
"Okay, so he needs 30 ounces of sugar for each batch of suckers and he's making 8 batches, so that's 30 times 8 which is 240 ounces.  Then he needs 70 ounces for the fudge.  If you add those together, 240 plus 70 is 310 ounces.

"
"Okay, so Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, which means she spends 8 * $8 = $64.

The first year, the price goes up by 50%, so each share is worth $8 + ($8 * 0.50) = $12.

The next year, the price goes down by 25%, so each share is worth $12 - ($12 * 0.25) = $9.

Finally, all her shares are worth $9 * 8 = $72. 


**Answer:** $72 
"
"Okay, so Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more than Luke, which is 2 times 3 = 6 hot dogs.  John ate half of what Thomas ate, so he ate 6 divided by 2 = 3 hot dogs.  

John ate 3 hot dogs and Luke ate 2, so John ate 3 - 2 = 1 more hot dog. 


"
"Okay, so there are 200 students and they're split into 3 groups.  Two of the groups have the same number of kids, and the smallest group has 10 fewer kids than those two.

Let's say the bigger groups each have 'x' students.  That means the smallest group has 'x - 10' students.

Since all the groups together have 200 students, we can write an equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

That simplifies to 3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: x = 70

So, the bigger groups each have 70 students.  

The smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students. 



**Answer:** 60 
"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and twice as many chickens as cows.  

Let's say there are 'c' cows. That means there are '2c' chickens.  

Since there are 60 animals total, we have the equation: c + 2c = 60

Combining like terms, we get 3c = 60.  

Dividing both sides by 3, we find out there are 20 cows (c = 20).

That means there are 20 * 2 = 40 chickens.

Cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs.

So, the cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.

And the chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

Adding those together, all the animals have 80 + 80 = 160 legs! 



"
"Okay, so Josh starts with 3 balls and adds one each week for four weeks. That means he's juggling 7 balls!  Then he drops 3, but 2 people catch them.  So he has 7 - 3 + 2 = 6 balls left to juggle. 


"
"Okay, so we know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.  

* The blue beetle weighs the same as the frog, so it's also 50 pounds.
* The green toad weighs the same as the frog, so it's 50 pounds too.
* The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds *more* than the frog, so it weighs 60 pounds.
* The red bird weighs 20 pounds *less* than the frog, so it weighs 30 pounds.

Now we add up the weight of all the animals and the container: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds. 


"
"Okay, so Laurel got 24 outfits from her friend.  Then she got twice that amount at her baby shower, which is 24 * 2 = 48 outfits.  

Adding her mom's 15 outfits, she has a total of 24 + 48 + 15 = 87 baby outfits. 


"
"Okay, so Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 more than that.  

First, let's figure out how much more he runs: 5000 meters / 5 = 1000 meters.

Now add that extra distance to his original run: 5000 meters + 1000 meters = 6000 meters.

So, he runs 6000 meters each day.  In a month, there are 30 days, so he runs 6000 meters * 30 days = 180,000 meters. 


180000 
"
"Okay, so Juice Box A is $4.  Juice Box B is $5 more than A, so B is $9. Juice Box C is $7 more than A, so C is $11.  

To find out how much more C is than B, we subtract: $11 - $9 = $2 


**Answer:** $2 
"
"Okay, so there are 40 tables with 4 legs each, and that's 40 times 4 which is 160 legs.  Then there are 50 tables with 3 legs each, so that's 50 times 3 which is 150 legs.  If you add those together, 160 plus 150 is 310 legs!

"
"Okay, so Jenny gets 36 cookies every week. Her son eats 4 cookies each day for 5 days, which is 20 cookies. Her husband eats 1 cookie every day for 7 days, so that's 7 cookies.  

Together, they eat 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

That means Jenny eats 36 - 27 = 9 cookies. 


**Answer:** 9 
"
"Okay, so Davos got two shirts that normally cost $30 each.  That's $60 in total.  But he got 40% off, which means he saved $12 on each shirt.  

So each shirt cost $18, and two shirts cost $36. 


"
"Okay, so they used to make $1000 a day selling tractors. Now they make $1100 a day selling silos.  

To find out how much more they're making, we subtract: $1100 - $1000 = $100

That means they're making $100 more each day.  To find the percentage, we divide the extra money by the old amount and multiply by 100%:

($100 / $1000) * 100% = 10% 


**Answer:** 10% 
"
"Okay, so Madeline spends $25 on food every week for her dog.  Since there are 4 weeks in a month, that's $25 x 4 = $100 a month on food.

She also spends $20 a month on treats and $100 on medicine.  

So, in total, she spends $100 + $20 + $100 = $220 a month on her dog.

If there are 12 months in a year, she spends $220 x 12 = $2640 a year on her dog. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Monday: Yoga for 1 hour
* Tuesday: Cooking class is 3 times longer than yoga, so that's 1 hour * 3 = 3 hours
* Wednesday: Cheese tasting for half an hour, or 0.5 hours
* Thursday: Museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so that's 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours
* Friday: Errands for 2 hours

Now, let's add it all up: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours 


**Answer: 8**"
"Okay, so April needs 30 pots for daisies and twice that for roses, which is 30 times 2, so 60 pots.  

That means she needs a total of 30 + 60 = 90 pots.

Since she already has 100 pots, she has 100 - 90 = 10 pots left over. 


"
"Okay, so Andrea had $36 to start.  She spent $11 on a sweater, so she had $36 - $11 = $25 left. Then she gave $4 to her brother, so she saved $25 - $4 = $21. 


"
"Okay, so John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours.  He also watched 3 shows that were 2 hours each, so that's 6 hours total.

We know 30% of his vacation time was spent watching shows, and that's 6 hours.  

If 30% is 6 hours, then 100% is 6 hours / 0.30 = 20 hours.

Since 40% of his time was spent sightseeing, he spent 20 hours * 0.40 = 8 hours sightseeing.



**8**
"
"Okay, so Annabelle needs $400 for the phone. She already has $80 saved.  

She makes $10 an hour at her first job and works 20 hours, so she earns $10 * 20 = $200 there.

At her second job, she makes $5 an hour and works 15 hours, so she earns $5 * 15 = $75.

That means she earned a total of $200 + $75 = $275 from her jobs.

Adding her savings, she has $80 + $275 = $355 in total.

To find out how much more she needs, we subtract that from the phone price: $400 - $355 = $45.




**Answer: $45** 
"
"Okay, so the shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet taller than that, so it's 11 feet tall.  

Together, the two shorter trees are 6 + 11 = 17 feet tall.

The tallest tree is twice as tall as the other two, so it's 17 * 2 = 34 feet tall! 


"
"Okay, so Dean had $28 to start.  He spent $12 on cars ($2 each times 6 cars) and $5 on teddy bears ($1 each times 5 bears). That means he spent a total of $17.

After buying toys, he had $28 - $17 = $11 left. Then his mom gave him $10 more, so now he has $11 + $10 = $21. 


"
"Okay, so Morgan has $90 for her party.  Mini-golf is $5 per person, and she wants to go with her friends.  Go-karts are $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice.  She also wants $5 in arcade tokens for each person.

Let's figure out how much money she spends on each thing:

* **Mini-golf:** $5 per person times the number of people (Morgan + friends)
* **Go-karts:** $10 per ride times 2 rides = $20
* **Arcade tokens:** $5 per person times the number of people (Morgan + friends)

Now, let's add up all the costs and see how much money she has left:

* $5(Morgan + friends) + $20 + $5(Morgan + friends) = $90

We can simplify that:

* $10(Morgan + friends) + $20 = $90

Subtract $20 from both sides:

* $10(Morgan + friends) = $70

Divide both sides by $10:

* Morgan + friends = 7

Since Morgan is one person, that means she can invite 6 friends. 



**Answer:** 6

"Marisa gets $5 every day, and she spends $1 on lollipops.  That means she saves $4 each day.  

If she saves for 5 days, she'll have $20 in her piggy bank. 


"
"Okay, so Billy had $10 and the candy costs $1.50 per pound.  After buying candy, he had some change and spent half of it on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs, and each gumball cost $0.05.  

First, let's figure out how much he spent on gumballs: 40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.00

That means he had $2.00 before buying the gumballs. Since he spent half his change on gumballs, he must have had $2.00 * 2 = $4.00 in change.

So, he spent $10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00 on candy.

Finally, to find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount he spent by the price per pound: $6.00 / $1.50/pound = 4 pounds.




**Answer: 4 pounds** 
"
"Okay, so Carver is 45 and his son is 5 years younger than twice his son's age.  

Let's say the son is 'x' years old.  Twice his age would be 2x.  Five years less than that is 2x - 5.  We know that 2x - 5 equals Carver's age, which is 45.

So, 2x - 5 = 45

Add 5 to both sides: 2x = 50

Divide both sides by 2: x = 25


The son is 25 years old. 
"
"Okay, so the train goes 75 miles, then 100 miles, and then 50 miles less than that last part to get back to the first city.  

*  The second and third leg together are 75 + 100 = 175 miles.
*  The third leg is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.
*  The whole trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since it does that trip 3 times a day, it goes 300 * 3 = 900 miles each day.

If it needs service every 18,000 miles, it goes 18,000 / 900 = 20 days between services.

"
"Okay, so a Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing, a chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds, and a collie bed needs the average of those two.  

The average is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds of stuffing.

For the chihuahua beds, that's 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds of stuffing.

For the collie beds, that's 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing. 



**Answer: 23**"
"Okay, so John drives 200 miles to his friend's house, but then he has to go 10 miles out of the way. That means the trip to his friend's is 210 miles long.  

He drives 70 miles per hour, so it takes him 210 miles / 70 miles per hour = 3 hours to get there.

Then he drives 240 miles back home at 80 miles per hour, which takes him 240 miles / 80 miles per hour = 3 hours.

The whole trip takes 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

**Answer:** 10 
"
"Okay, so each picture frame costs $20 and they need to get one for each of the 44 seniors, so that's $20 times 44 which is $880.  

Then they have to add 20% to each frame for the etching, so that's $880 times 0.20 which is $176.  

That means the frames with etching cost $880 plus $176, which is $1056.

Two seniors get pins that cost $5 each, so that's 2 times $5 which is $10.

And 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so that's 44 divided by 4 which is 11 officers. Each officer gets a cord that costs $12, so that's 11 times $12 which is $132.

Finally, we add up all the costs: $1056 for the frames, $132 for the cords, and $10 for the pins. That makes a total of $1056 + $132 + $10 = $1198.




"
"Okay, so the wallpaper costs $400 at the store, but Ethan made his own and saved 20%.  That means he saved $400 times 0.20 which is $80.

**Answer: $320**"
"Okay, so on Friday they sold 14 pairs of shoes.  Then on Saturday they sold double that, which is 14 times 2, so 28 pairs. On Sunday they sold half of what they sold on Saturday, so 28 divided by 2 is 14 pairs.  

Adding up all the days, they sold 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 pairs.  But then 6 people returned shoes, so they actually sold 56 - 6 = 50 pairs in the end.

"Okay, so Hallie practices for 1 hour on Tuesdays.  On Thursdays, she practices for 2 hours.  On Saturdays, she practices twice as long as Tuesdays, so that's 1 hour * 2 = 2 hours.  

If you add up all the hours, she practices 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 hours a week. 


"
"Okay, so they bought $400,000 worth of stuff, and 40% of it was broken.  That means 40% of $400,000 is $160,000 worth of broken stuff.

"
"Okay, so Mary has 30 sheep.  Half of them give her 1 kg of milk each, and the other half give her 2 kg each.  

Let's see... 15 sheep give her 1 kg each, so that's 15 kg of milk.  

And the other 15 sheep give her 2 kg each, so that's 30 kg of milk.

If you add those together, she gets 15 + 30 = 45 kg of milk every day! 


"
"Okay, so Mrs. Sherman had 12 rolls and gave 6 to her kids, which leaves her with 6 rolls.  Then she cut each of those rolls into 8 pieces, so she fed the chickens 6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces.

"Okay, so half the class likes blue, which is 40 / 2 = 20 kids.  

That means 40 - 20 = 20 kids don't like blue.

Then, one fourth of those kids like green, so that's 20 / 4 = 5 kids.

Finally, the rest of them must like yellow, so 20 - 5 = 15 kids like yellow. 


"
"Okay, so Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday because she made $56 and each apple costs $4.  

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

"Okay, so Lindsay needs to wash 50 socks.  She washed 10 pairs, which is 10 times 2, so that's 20 socks. Then she washed 15 more socks.  That means she washed a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks.  

To find out how many she missed, we subtract: 50 - 35 = 15.


Lindsay missed 15 socks.

"Okay, so Karan borrowed $3650 and has to pay it back over five months with a 10% interest rate.  

First, we need to figure out how much interest she'll pay.  That's like finding 10% of $3650, which is $365.

Then, we add the interest to the original amount she borrowed: $3650 + $365 = $4015.

Finally, we divide the total amount she needs to pay ($4015) by the number of months (5) to find out how much she pays each month: $4015 / 5 = $803.

"Cho hiked for 8 hours at 14 kilometers per hour, so she hiked a total of 112 kilometers (8 * 14 = 112). Chloe hiked for 5 hours at 9 kilometers per hour, so she hiked 45 kilometers (5 * 9 = 45).  

Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe. 


"
"Okay, so Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos, which is a total of 130 pesos.  Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos.  She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos. That means Anna has 100 + 120 = 220 pesos.  

Together, they have 130 + 220 = 350 pesos. 


"
"Okay, so Millie makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher has 12 cups, so she makes a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups.  She sells each cup for $1, so she makes $36 in total.  She spent $18 on supplies, so her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.  

Since she sells 4 cups every hour, she makes $18 of profit every hour. 


"
"Okay, so Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares left after selling some of his land.  We know he sold 3/5 of his land, which means he has 2/5 of his land left.  

If 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares, we can figure out the whole amount!  

Think of it like this: if 2 out of 5 parts is 12.8 hectares, then 1 part would be 12.8 / 2 = 6.4 hectares.

Since there are 5 parts in total, his whole land was 6.4 * 5 = 32 hectares. 



**Answer: 32 hectares** 
"
"Okay, so there are 52 people in the choir, and half are girls. That means there are 26 girls.  

Half of them couldn't make it because their bus broke down, so 26 / 2 = 13 girls couldn't go.

That leaves 26 - 13 = 13 girls who could sing.

Plus, there are 3 teachers singing too, so in total there were 13 + 3 = 16 people singing.

"Monica has 6 gifts for her family, 4 for her friends, and 2 for her teachers. That's a total of 12 gifts!  If she wants to use 144 inches of ribbon for bows, she can use 144 / 12 = 12 inches of ribbon for each bow. 


"
"Okay, so Betty and Sam have popsicles in the ratio 5:6.  That means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  

If they have a total of 165 popsicles, we can think of it like this: they have 11 parts in total (5 + 6).  

To find out how many popsicles are in one part, we divide the total popsicles by the number of parts: 165 popsicles / 11 parts = 15 popsicles per part.

Now we can find out how many popsicles each person has:

* Betty: 5 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 75 popsicles
* Sam: 6 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 90 popsicles

Finally, to see how many more popsicles Sam has, we subtract Betty's amount from Sam's amount: 90 popsicles - 75 popsicles = 15 popsicles.


**Answer:** Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. 
"
"Okay, so Tim's cable is $60 a month.  

Netflix is $10, and Hulu and Disney+ together are $20, but he gets 20% off for having them both, which is $4. So Hulu and Disney+ cost $16.

That means his streaming stuff costs $10 + $16 = $26 a month.

He saves $60 - $26 = $34 by ditching cable!

"Okay, so Carol spent 4 hours writing, 2 hours recording (because that's half the writing time), and 90 minutes editing.  

First, we gotta change the editing time to hours: 90 minutes is equal to 1.5 hours.

Now add up all the time: 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours total.

To find the percentage of time spent editing, divide the editing time by the total time and multiply by 100%: (1.5 / 7.5) * 100% = 20% 


20%

"Okay, so there are 6 rows and 6 columns, which means there are 6 times 6, or 36 spaces for books.  

Wendy wants to put double that number of books in, so she needs 36 times 2, which is 72 books.

But wait, she wants to put 20 *more* than that! So she needs 72 plus 20, which is 92 books. 


92 
"
"Okay, so Erica started with 20 cards and got 30 more from her dad. That's 20 + 30 = 50 cards.  

She gave out 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave out 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Then she got 17 more cards.  So, she has 50 - 29 + 17 = 38 cards now. 


"
"Okay, so Jenny has 12 slices of pizza. Bill gets 1/3 of the pizza, which is 12 / 3 = 4 slices.  Mark gets 1/4 of the pizza, so he gets 12 / 4 = 3 slices.  Jenny eats 2 slices.  

That means they ate a total of 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 slices.

If they ate 9 slices, there are 12 - 9 = 3 slices left.

"
"Okay, so Mark needs $300 for the bike and he already has $50.  That means he needs to save another $250.  If he makes $10 each day, it will take him 25 days to save enough. 


"
"Okay, so Nancy found 90 spiders.  She saw a third as many millipedes as spiders, so that's 90 / 3 = 30 millipedes.  

Then she saw twice the number of millipedes minus 12 stink bugs, so that's (30 * 2) - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

Finally, to find the total, add up all the bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 bugs! 


"
"Okay, so Erica is 30. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth is 35.  Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 42.  

The difference between Alice and Erica's ages is 42 - 30 = 12 years. 


"
"Okay, so he drinks 2 glasses of milk and each glass has 8 ounces. That means he drinks 2 times 8 which is 16 ounces of milk.  

If each ounce has 3 calories, then 16 ounces would have 16 times 3, which is 48 calories. 


48 
"
"Okay, so he works 4 weeks a month and 6 days a week, which means he works 4 * 6 = 24 days each month.

In a year, that's 24 days/month * 12 months = 288 days.

If he makes $50 a day, he earns 288 days * $50/day = $14,400 a year. 


"
"Okay, so Mark needs four times the normal amount of stuff for his brownies.  

That means he needs 3 cups of flour times 4 = 12 cups of flour.

Flour comes in 2-cup bags, so he needs 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour.

He also needs 1 cup of milk times 4 = 4 cups of milk.

Milk comes in 2-cup bottles, so he needs 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

If he needs 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk, that means he needs 6 - 2 = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk. 


**4** 
"
"Okay, so the air conditioner uses 900 watts for 8 hours, which is 900 times 8, which equals 7200 watts.  

If he uses it for 3 hours less, that's 900 watts times 3 hours, which is 2700 watts.

So he saves 7200 watts - 2700 watts, which is 4500 watts every day.

Over 30 days, that's 4500 watts times 30 days, which is 135,000 watts.

To change that to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000, so 135,000 watts divided by 1000 is 135 kilowatt-hours.




**Answer: 135** 
"
"Okay, so there are two zebras with 17 stripes each, which is 17 * 2 = 34 stripes.  Then there's one with 36 stripes and another with half of that, so 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.  

Adding all the stripes together, we get 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

Finally, to find the average, we divide the total stripes by the number of zebras: 88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra. 


22 
"
"Okay, so Tyson needs to make enough sandwiches for 20 people.  Each sandwich feeds 4 people, so he needs to make 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. That means he needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

Meat costs $7 a pound, so 5 pounds costs $35. Cheese costs $3 a pound, so 5 pounds costs $15.

If he spends $35 on meat and $15 on cheese, that's a total of $50. 


**Answer:** $50.00 
"
"Okay, so Allan has twice as many corns as cannolis, and he starts with 40 cannolis. That means he has 40 * 2 = 80 corns.

Then he buys 60 more cannolis, so he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

But he also buys 40 *fewer* corns than cannolis, so he has 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Finally, to find the total, we add the corns and cannolis: 60 + 100 = 160.


160 
"
"Okay, so Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps.  He did half his steps going to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. Then he walked 1,000 more with his friend. That means he had 10,000 - 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000 steps left.  

He took 2,000 steps during his jog. 



**Answer:** 2,000 
"
"Okay, so Toby has to read a 45-page book with 200 words per page. That's a lot of words!  

He reads 300 words every minute, so it'll take him 9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes to read the whole thing.

Then he has to travel to the airport for 10 minutes.  

That means he'll be at the airport in 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes.

Since he has to be there in 60 minutes, he'll be 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes early! 


**Answer:** 20 
"
"Okay, so Carolyn's company hired 40 workers in May and they each made $15 an hour for 40 hours a week.  That means they made $15 * 40 = $600 each week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, each worker made $600 * 4 = $2400 in May.

In total, the company paid all 40 workers $2400 * 40 = $96,000 in May.

Then, in June, 1/4 of the workers left, which is 40 / 4 = 10 workers.

So, there were 40 - 10 = 30 workers left in June.

Each worker still made $2400 that month, so the company paid them $2400 * 30 = $72,000 in June.

Adding May and June together, the company paid a total of $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000. 



**Answer: 168000**
"
"Okay, so Sally had $10.  She spent $3 on the first pound of taffy and then $1.50 on the second pound 'cause it was half off. That's $3 + $1.50 = $4.50 for the taffy.

Then she spent $1.50 on seashells and $1.00 on the magnets.  

So, she spent a total of $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

If she started with $10.00, she has $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00 left. 




"
"Okay, so Tim spent $400 on one pack of fireworks and twice that on another pack, so that's $400 times 2 which is $800.  

That means he spent a total of $400 + $800 = $1200 on the packs of fireworks.

He got 20% off, which is like getting $1200 times 0.20 = $240 back.

So the packs of fireworks only cost $1200 - $240 = $960.

Then he bought a special firework for $150.

Adding that all up, he spent $960 + $150 = $1110 in total. 



"
"Okay, so Shannon eats 2 cookies every night for 30 nights, which means she needs 2 times 30 = 60 cookies.  Her recipe makes 12 cookies at a time, so she needs to make 60 divided by 12, which is 5 batches. 


"
"Okay, so Marcy makes 50,000 candles and says they're almost never gonna explode, only 1% of them will.  

But, 5% of the ones that *do* explode also smell like wet dog.  

To find out how many smell like wet dog AND explode, we gotta do a little bit of math.  

Think of it like this: 1% of the candles explode, and out of those, 5% smell like wet dog.  So, we take 1% and times it by 5%... that's like taking a tiny piece of a tiny piece!

1% times 5% is 0.0005.  

Now we multiply that by the total number of candles: 0.0005 times 50,000 = 25 candles. 



**Answer:** 25 
"
"Okay, so each blouse is 30% off, which means each one is $6 cheaper.  

If a blouse normally costs $20, that means they cost $14 each now.

Since Misha buys 4 blouses, the total cost is $14 x 4 = $56. 


"
"Okay, so Joanne got 30 apples from the tall trees and half that from the short trees, which is 15.  Her sister got twice as many from the tall trees (60) and three times as many from the short trees (45).

That means Joanne got 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tall and short trees.

Together, they got 500 apples, so Joanne got 500 - 60 - 45 = 395 apples from the average trees. 



**Answer: 395** 
"
"Okay, so we have 180 heads and 304 bumps.  

* Each camel has 2 bumps, and each dromedary has 1 bump.

Let's think about it this way:

* If all the animals were camels, we'd have 180 heads * 2 bumps each = 360 bumps. 
* But we only have 304 bumps, so there must be some dromedaries.

To figure out how many dromedaries there are, we can subtract the bumps from the camels: 360 bumps - 304 bumps = 56 bumps.

Since each dromedary has 1 bump, there must be **56** dromedaries. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for the first four days, so that's 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.
*  The next two days he traveled 30% of the distance from the first four days, which is 800 * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.
*  In total, he traveled 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers in the first six days.
*  Then he traveled 300 kilometers each day for the rest of the two weeks, which is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.
*  Adding that to the first six days, his total trip was 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.


**Answer:** 3140 kilometers 
"
"Okay, so Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and that's 1/4 the size of Zack's locker.  That means Zack's locker is 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.

Timothy's locker is twice as big as Zack's, so it's 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches. 


40 
"
"Okay, so Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from where he was standing.  He was at 10,000 feet, so the comb is at 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet.  Oliver is at 3,000 feet.  To get to the comb, he has to climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet. 


**Answer:** 3,000 feet 
"
"Okay, so Mr. Josue got $4000 from the first bank and twice that from the second bank, which is $4000 * 2 = $8000.  

That means he got a total of $4000 + $8000 = $12000 from the banks.

If he started with $5000, now he has $5000 + $12000 = $17000. 


17000 
"
"Okay, so there were 50 cats on a rock.  Four boats came and took 5 cats each, which is 20 cats total. That leaves 30 cats on the rock. Then, 3/5 of those cats ran after a mouse, which is 18 cats.  So, there are 30 - 18 = 12 cats left on the rock. 


"
"Okay, so the first six months are $8 each, so that's 6 times 8 which is $48.  Then it goes up to $12 for eight months, so that's 8 times 12 which is $96.  After that, it's $14 for a whole year, which is 12 times 14, so $168.  If you add all that up, it's $48 plus $96 plus $168, which is $312! 


"
"Okay, so Cole bought two pairs of jeans, tattered ones for $28 and jogger ones that were $6 cheaper.  That means the jogger jeans cost $22.

He saved a total of $6, and  1/3 of his savings on the jogger jeans was part of that. So he saved $6 / 3 = $2 on the jogger jeans. That means he saved $6 - $2 = $4 on the tattered jeans.

To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, we need to add back the $2 he saved: $22 + $2 = $24.

So the jogger jeans originally cost $24, and the tattered jeans cost $28. That means the jogger jeans originally cost $28 - $24 = $4 less than the tattered jeans. 



**Answer:**  The jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans. 
"
"Okay, so they have 4 buses that hold 60 people each, which is 4 times 60, so that's 240 people.  

Then they have 6 minibuses that hold 30 people each, so that's 6 times 30, which is 180 people.

And they have 10 minivans that hold 15 people each, so that's 10 times 15, which is 150 people.

If you add all those up, 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 people can go on the trip! 


570 
"
"Okay, so Lillian made 3 bird feeders and bought 3 more.  The ones she made attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, which attract 20 birds each.

The homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

That means her homemade feeders attract 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

And her store-bought feeders attract 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

In total, she can expect to see 90 + 60 = 150 birds in her garden each day. 



"
"Okay, so the bagel cost $4. The soup was 25% more than the bagel, so it cost $4 plus 25% of $4, which is $1 more.  That means the soup cost $5. The cake was half the price of the bagel, so it cost $4 divided by 2, which is $2.  

To find the total cost, we add up the price of everything: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11. 


"
"Okay, so Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and wants $50 for spending money. That means he made $100 + $50 = $150 from selling his cards.

If each card sells for $1.50, he sold $150 / $1.50 = 100 cards.

Since he kept one-third of his cards, he must have started with 100 cards * 3 = 300 cards! 


**Answer: 300** 
"
"Okay, so the caterer made enough hot dogs for half the people to have two. That's 36 people divided by 2, which is 18 people.  

Since 18 people got two hot dogs, that means 40 total people - 18 people = 22 people didn't get a second hot dog. 


**22** 
"
"Okay, so Indras' name has 6 letters.  Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half the letters in Indras' name.  

First, half of Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Then, her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Together, their names have 6 + 7 = 13 letters. 


13 
"
"Okay, so Charlotte wants pots and pans for $120, mixing bowls for $20, and 5 utensils at $5 each.  That's $25 for the utensils.

Adding it all up, that's $120 + $20 + $25 = $165.

But wait, everything is 20% off!  That means she saves $165 * 0.20 = $33.

So her total is $165 - $33 = $132. 


**Answer: $132.00**
"
"Okay, so Dora wants to buy a skipping rope for $6, a board game for $11, and a ball for $2.  That's a total of $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

She has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mom, which is $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more she needs, we subtract her savings from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.


**Answer:** $1 
"
"Okay, so Prince Thaddeus killed 100 dragons. Arthur killed three-quarters as many as Thaddeus, so he killed 100 * (3/4) = 75 dragons.  

Walter killed twice as many dragons as Arthur, so he killed 75 * 2 = 150 dragons.

Bruce killed one-fifth as many dragons as Walter, so he killed 150 / 5 = 30 dragons. 


**Answer: 30** 
"
"Okay, so there are 15 gallons of gas split into 5 containers. That means each container has 3 gallons of gas (15 / 5 = 3).

Josey needs 1/4 of a container, so she needs 3 gallons * (1/4) = 0.75 gallons.

There are 8 pints in a gallon, so she needs 0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints. 


**Answer: 6 pints** 
"
"Okay, so George spent $5 and got 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each. That's $1.20.  

He had some money left over, and we know it was 1% of his $5.00, which is $0.05.

So he spent $5.00 - $0.05 = $4.95

He spent $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 on candy bars.

Since each candy bar costs $0.75, he bought $3.75 / $0.75 = 5 candy bars.

"Okay, so Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces and she cuts it into 8 pieces.  That means each piece is 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces. 

Rory and her mom each eat one piece, so they eat a total of 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces of cake.

If they ate 5 ounces, that means there are 20 - 5 = 15 ounces of cake left. 


15 
"
"Okay, so Sitti and Juris have 34 + 22 = 56 oranges together.  

If they share with 6 friends, that's 6 + 2 = 8 people in total.

Then each person gets 56 / 8 = 7 oranges. 


"
"Okay, so Antoine needs 4 pounds of onions because he doubles the recipe. Onions cost $2 a pound, so that's 4 times $2, which is $8.  

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock at $2 a box, so that's 2 times $2, which is $4.

In total, his soup costs $8 plus $4, which is $12.

Since his soup serves 6 people, each serving costs $12 divided by 6, which is $2. 


**Answer: 2**"
"Okay, so Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater. Bernadette takes four times longer, which is 4 times 4 minutes, or 16 minutes.  Since Bernadette wants to be there 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 16 minutes + 5 minutes = 21 minutes earlier. 


"
"Okay, so Billie's room is 360 square feet.  We know it's a rectangle and the length is 3 yards, but we need to figure out the perimeter in feet.

First, let's change the length to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so the length is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now we can use the area to find the width.  Area is length times width, so 360 square feet = 9 feet * width.  

That means the width is 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Finally, the perimeter is found by adding up all the sides.  It's 2 times the length plus 2 times the width: 2 * 9 feet + 2 * 40 feet = 18 feet + 80 feet = 98 feet.




**Answer:** 98 feet 
"
"Okay, so Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads, which is a total of 3 packs. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red, so she bought 7 packs of beads.

Since each pack has 20 beads, Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads.

Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

That means Margareth has 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 more beads than Elizabeth. 


**80** 
"
"Okay, so the house starts at 40 degrees.  The oven makes it warmer by 5 degrees every hour for 3 hours, so that's 5 times 3 which is 15 degrees warmer.  

That means the house is now 40 plus 15, which is 55 degrees.

Then Marcus opens a window and the house cools down 2 degrees every 10 minutes.  The window is open for 30 minutes, so that's 3 times cooling.

So the house cools down 2 times 3 which is 6 degrees.

Finally, 55 degrees minus 6 degrees is 49 degrees. 


**49** 
"
"Okay, so Jon took 40 minutes to swim, 1 hour and 20 minutes (which is 80 minutes) to bike, and 50 minutes to run. That's a total of 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

James was 10 minutes faster than Jon, so he finished in 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.

James swam 10% faster than Jon, so he swam 40 * 0.10 = 4 minutes faster. That means he swam in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James also took 5 minutes longer on the bike, so he biked for 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

To find out how long James took to run, we subtract his swim and bike times from his total time: 160 - 36 - 85 = 39 minutes.



**Answer: 39** 
"
"Okay, so Movie B was 1.25 hours long, but that's the same as 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie C was 1 hour and 10 minutes long.  Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so we need to figure out how long that is.  

Movie B is 80 minutes long, and one-fourth of that is 20 minutes. 



**20**"
"Okay, so Michael's horse eats half a bale of hay for every mile it runs.  

First, we need to figure out how many miles the horse runs. It runs for 30 minutes, which is half an hour.  Since it runs at 32 miles per hour, it runs 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

That means the horse eats 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so the hay costs 8 bales * $3/bale = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is 6 * $5 = $30.

If he spends $24 on hay, he'll have $30 - $24 = $6 left.




**Answer:** $6 
"
"Okay, so Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs, which is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.  Then she adds 2 more eggs, so she has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so she can make 50 / 5 = 10 glasses of eggnog.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, she can put out 10 / 5 = 2 trays. 


"
"Okay, so Joey starts with 214 points and gets 26 more, so he has 214 + 26 = 240 points.  Marcy has 225 points and gets 10 more, so she has 225 + 10 = 235 points.  

To find out how many more points Joey has, we subtract Marcy's score from Joey's score: 240 - 235 = 5.


Joey is winning by 5 points. 
"
"Okay, so the salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576.  That means each sneaker cost him $576 / 48 = $12.

He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so he made 17 * $20 = $340 from that.

He had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.

He sold those for $25 each, so he made 31 * $25 = $775 from those.

In total, he made $340 + $775 = $1115.

Since he spent $576, his profit was $1115 - $576 = $539. 



"
"Okay, so Beatrice got 6 packs of crayons with 8 crayons in each, which is 6 times 8, or 48 crayons.  Then she got 4 packs with 16 crayons each, so that's 4 times 16, which is 64 crayons.  If you add those together, she has 48 + 64 = 112 crayons! 


112 
"
"Okay, so the super ticket is $20 and gets you a movie and popcorn and soda for $1 extra.  That means the super ticket with everything is $21.

If you get a regular ticket for $12 and buy popcorn and soda separately, it costs $12 plus the price of popcorn plus $3 for the soda.  

You saved $2 by not getting the super ticket, so the regular ticket and popcorn and soda cost $21 - $2 = $19.

That means the popcorn costs $19 - $12 - $3 = $4.




**Answer: $4**
"
"Okay, so each balloon cost $45 to fill the first time, and then the price went up by $20.  That means each balloon costs $65 now.

To find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons, we multiply the new price per balloon by the number of balloons: $65 * 170 = $11,050 


**Answer:** $11,050 
"
"Okay, so the car goes 60 miles per hour for two hours, which is 60 times 2, which is 120 miles. Then it goes 30 miles per hour for one hour, so that's 30 times 1, which is 30 miles.  

To find the total distance, we add those together: 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

The car drove for a total of 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

Finally, to find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"Okay, so Jenna starts with 8 sapphires worth $800 each, so that's 8 * $800 = $6400.  Then she trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies.  Those rubies are worth $1200 each, so the 2 rubies are worth 2 * $1200 = $2400.  

Now she has 5 sapphires left, worth 5 * $800 = $4000.  

Adding that to the value of the rubies, her jewels are worth $4000 + $2400 = $6400!

"
"Okay, so Bob needs to fill 10 raised beds. Each bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.  

To find out how much soil he needs, we need to figure out the volume of one bed first.  We do that by multiplying the width, length, and height: 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.

Since he has 10 beds, he needs 32 cubic feet per bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet of soil in total.

Each bag of soil holds 2 cubic feet, so he'll need 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag = 160 bags.

If each bag costs $12, the total cost will be 160 bags * $12 per bag = $1920. 


"
"Okay, so there are 15 red cards.  Green cards are 60% more than that, which means there are 15 times 0.60 = 9 more green cards. That makes 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Yellow cards are the same number as red and green cards together, so there are 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

Finally, to find the total, we add up all the colors: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards! 


"
"Okay, so Katelyn saw 50 fairies. Then 25 more came from the east, so there were 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.  After some flew away, there were 75 - 30 = 45 fairies left. 


**45** 
"
"Okay, so Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies and 3 have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies and 4 have spots.  

First, we need to find the total number of puppies: 8 + 12 = 20 puppies

Then, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots: 3 + 4 = 7 puppies

To find the percentage, we divide the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100%: (7 / 20) * 100% = 35% 


35% 
"
"Okay, so the farmer has sugar cubes, carrots, hay, and oats.  

* The sugar cubes weigh 2 pounds (2 boxes x 1 pound each).
* The carrots weigh 48 pounds (4 bags x 12 pounds each).
* The hay weighs 3150 pounds (42 bales x 75 pounds each).
* The oats weigh 1300 pounds (20 sacks x 65 pounds each).

To find the total weight, we add it all up: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

His truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, so he needs to make 2 trips (4500 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 2 trips). 




"
"Okay, so Grayson gets 2 cents for each aluminum can and 3 cents for each plastic bottle.  

She recycles 3 cans a week, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She also recycles 5 bottles a week, so that's 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

That means she makes 6 + 15 = 21 cents each week.

In a month with 4 weeks, she makes 21 * 4 = 84 cents. 



"
"Okay, so Frederick has 10 plants. Toni has 60% more than that, which is like adding 60% of 10 to 10.  60% of 10 is 6, so Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants.

Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so she has 16 - 7 = 9 plants. 


"
"Okay, so Ali had $21 and Leila gave him half of her $100.  Half of $100 is $50 because you divide by 2.  Then you add that to Ali's money: $21 + $50 = $71. 


71 
"
"Okay, so Ashley's pizza cost $15 and she wants to tip 1/5 of that.  

To find the tip, we do $15 divided by 5, which is $3.

Then we add the tip to the price of the pizza: $15 + $3 = $18. 


**18**
"
"Okay, so Finley starts in first place. Then she falls back 5 spots, which means she's in 6th.  She moves up 2 spots, so she's in 4th. Then she falls back 3 spots, putting her in 7th.  Finally, she jumps ahead 1 spot to finish in 6th place! 


**Answer:** 6 
"
"Okay, so Miss Maria has 150 basketball cards 'cause she has 6 decks with 25 cards each.  And she has 200 baseball cards 'cause she has 5 boxes with 40 cards each.

That means she has a total of 150 + 200 = 350 cards.

She keeps 50 for herself, so she gives 350 - 50 = 300 cards to her students.

If each student gets 10 cards, she has 300 / 10 = 30 students. 



**Answer: 30** 
"
"Okay, so Becky bought 20 apples for $0.45 each, which is 20 times $0.45, so that's $9.00.  She got a dollar off, so she paid $8.00.

Kelly bought 20 apples for $0.50 each, which is 20 times $0.50, so that's $10.00.  She got 10% off, which is $1.00. So she paid $9.00.

Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky. 


**Answer:** $1.00 
"
"Okay, so each room has 2 sheets and 1 comforter, that's 3 things right there.  Then there are 2 times the number of sheets in pillowcases, so that's 2 times 2, which is 4 pillowcases.  

And then there are twice as many towels as pillowcases, so that's 4 times 2, which is 8 towels.

So in each room, there are 3 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry.

If there are 80 rooms, that means there are 15 times 80, which is 1200 pieces of laundry in total. 


1200 
"
"Okay, so Frank starts with 200 shoes.  

* He gets 5 pairs on Monday, which is 5 * 2 = 10 more shoes.
* Then he gets 15 pairs on Wednesday, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 more shoes.
* On Friday, he gets 30 more pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 more shoes.

So far, he has 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

* But then he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.

That means he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes left on Sunday. 



**Answer:** 120 
"
"Okay, so Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles and each jar does 8 cupcakes. That means she has 6 times 8, which is 48 cupcakes worth of sprinkles.  If each pan holds 12 cupcakes, she needs to bake 48 divided by 12, which is 4 pans. 


"
"Okay, so Theo bought a pen for $2 and some paper. The paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen.  

First, three times the price of the pen is 3 * $2 = $6.

Then, the paper cost $6 - $1 = $5.

The total cost was $2 + $5 = $7.

If Theo paid with $10, she got $10 - $7 = $3 in change. 


**Answer:** $3 
"
"Okay, so there are 30 students and they each start with 10 pencils, which is a total of 300 pencils.

After two months, they use up 1/5 of the pencils, so they use 300 / 5 = 60 pencils.

That leaves them with 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

At the end of the year, they only have 1/3 of those left, so they have 240 / 3 = 80 pencils left. 


**Answer: 80** 
"
"Okay, so Matt wants 5 cookies total.  He gets two extra for cleaning his room, so that means he wants to eat 5 - 2 = 3 cookies from the carrot sticks.  

Since he gets half the number of cookies as carrot sticks, he needs to eat 3 * 2 = 6 carrot sticks. 


**Answer:** 6 
"
"Okay, so the shark is 10 feet long, and that's the same as 120 inches because there are 12 inches in a foot.  The remoras are each 6 inches long, and there are two of them, so they're a total of 12 inches long.  

To find the percentage, we divide the remora length (12 inches) by the shark's length (120 inches) and then multiply by 100%.  That gives us 10%. 


"
"Okay, so if 3 out of 4 students have a desktop computer, that means 1 out of 4 students don't.  

We know 20 students don't have desktops, and that's 1/4 of the whole class.  To find the total number of students, we can think:

* If 20 students are 1/4 of the class, then the whole class must be 4 times bigger.

So, 20 x 4 = 80 students! 




"
"Okay, so Jason has three weeks to break in his shoes, and he's gonna walk for four days each week.  That means he has 3 weeks * 4 days = 12 days to walk.

To figure out how long he needs to walk each day, we divide the total time by the number of days: 240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes per day. 


20 
"
"Okay, so Sarah bought 20 books because she spent $300 and each book cost $15.  Then she gave the same number of books to her 4 kids.  To find out how many books each kid got, you divide the total books by the number of kids: 20 books / 4 kids = 5 books per kid. 


"
"Okay, so there are 9 kids allergic to dairy and 6 allergic to peanuts.  But we have to be careful not to count the kids who are allergic to BOTH!  There are 3 of those.  

So, let's see: 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts.

That means 32 - 12 = 20 kids aren't allergic to anything. 


20 
"
"Okay, so there are 3 groups of employees, and each group has 200 people. That means there are 3 * 200 = 600 employees going.  

Then, each group has 7 tour guides, so there are 3 * 7 = 21 tour guides.

In total, there are 600 + 21 = 621 people going on the tour! 


"
"Okay, so the plane tickets cost $5000 each, and they're going for two people, so that's $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

The hotel is more expensive because it's a busy weekend. It's 20% more than the normal $1500 per day, so that's $1500 * 0.20 = $300 extra each day.

So each day at the hotel costs $1500 + $300 = $1800.

For three days, that's $1800 * 3 = $5400.

Finally, add the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.


**Answer: $15,400** 
"
"Okay, so Ben has 4 blue tubes and 3 yellow tubes.  That means he has a total of 4 + 3 = 7 tubes.

Jasper has half as many blue tubes as Ben, so he has 4 / 2 = 2 blue tubes.

Jasper has three times as many yellow tubes as Ben, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 yellow tubes.

In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint. 


"
"Okay, so the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains and the 2010 penny is three-quarters of that.  

Three-quarters of 48 is (3/4) * 48 = 36 grains.

To find the total weight, we add them together: 48 grains + 36 grains = 84 grains. 


84 
"
"Okay, so Keegan made $83 and Tasha made $91.  

Together they made $83 + $91 = $174.

They needed $200 total, so they still need $200 - $174 = $26 more. 


**Answer:** $26 
"
"Okay, so Gabriel has 20 songs and Luri has three times that amount, which is 60 songs.  

To find out how many more songs Gabriel can add, we subtract the number of songs he already has from the maximum amount his player can hold: 100 - 20 = 80 songs.

Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs.

That means Gabriel can add 80 - 40 = 40 more songs than Luri. 


40 
"
"Okay, so Stetson ate 2/5 of the 60 oranges they picked.  To find out how many oranges he ate, we do (2/5) * 60, which equals 24 oranges.

Since he gives up $10 for each orange, he gave up 24 * $10 = $240. 


"
"Okay, so her shoes cost $80.  Three times the price of her shoes is $240 (because 3 times 80 is 240).  Her bag cost $20 less than that, so it cost $220. 


"
"He runs 12 miles each day for 5 days, so that's 12 * 5 = 60 miles a week.  

If he runs 10 miles per hour, it takes him 60 miles / 10 miles per hour = 6 hours. 


**6**"
"Okay, so Uncle Ben has 4 horses and each horse eats 5 pounds of oats twice a day. That means each horse eats 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats every day.

Since he has 4 horses, they eat a total of 10 * 4 = 40 pounds of oats each day.

Over five days, they'll eat 40 * 5 = 200 pounds of oats.

If each bag has 50 pounds of oats, he'll need 200 / 50 = 4 bags. 


**Answer: 4** 
"
"Okay, so Jana has 27 puppies and two-thirds of them are Pomeranians.  That means there are 18 Pomeranians.  Then, one-third of those Pomeranians are girls, so there are 6 girl Pomeranians. 


"
"Okay, so we need to find the average of the highest temps in each country. 

* Southlandia: -48 degrees
* Northlandia: 21 degrees
* Midlandia: -3 degrees

Let's add them all up: -48 + 21 + (-3) = -20

Then, we divide the total by 3: -20 / 3 = -6.666...

The average highest temperature is about -6.67 degrees Fahrenheit.

"He needs to save $8 more.  If he saves $2 each day, it will take him 4 days. 
"
"Okay, so Jaime has 64 eggs and his trays each hold 24 eggs.  If he has 2 trays, that means he can fit 24 * 2 = 48 eggs.  

Since he has 64 eggs, he won't be able to fit all of them.  He'll have 64 - 48 = 16 eggs left over. 


16 
"
"Okay, so the small pizza costs $8. The family pizza costs three times that, so it costs $8 x 3 = $24.  

To find out how much Sally spent in total, we add the price of both pizzas: $8 + $24 = $32. 


32 
"
"Okay, so Heather gets 4 razors in each pack and they cost $4.00 a pack.  She's buying 2 packs, so that's $4.00 x 2 = $8.00.  But wait, there's a sale!  She gets one pack free, so she only pays for one pack, which is $4.00.  

Then she uses a $2.00 coupon, so she pays $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00 for all the razors.

That means each razor costs $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 each.

And $0.25 is the same as 25 cents!


**25**"
"Okay, so the pyramid has 4 girls on the bottom, then 3, then 2, and the shortest one on top.  

* The bottom layer is 4 girls * 64 inches each = 256 inches tall.
* The next layer is 3 girls * 64 inches each = 192 inches tall.
* The layer after that is 2 girls * 64 inches each = 128 inches tall.
* And the top is just 60 inches tall.

Adding it all up: 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches

Now, there are 12 inches in a foot, so 636 inches / 12 inches/foot = 53 feet! 


**Answer: 53 feet** 
"
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour at work, and she works 8 hours a day. So she walks 5 * 8 = 40 minutes each day.  

Over 5 days, she walks 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

"
"Okay, so Brett is 14 now and in four years he'll be 18.  Angela will be three times Brett's age *now* in four years, so that means she'll be 14 * 3 = 42 years old.  But since that's in four years, she's 42 - 4 = 38 years old right now. 


"
"Okay, so Paul drives his car twice a day, morning and afternoon.  

That means he drives 14 days * 2 times a day = 28 times in total.

Each drive costs $6 in the morning and $2 in the afternoon, so each day it costs him $6 + $2 = $8.

Over 14 days, he spends $8 a day * 14 days = $112. 


112 
"
"Ashley brought 5 boxes of oranges with 10 oranges in each box, so she brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.  

Together they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since each pie needs 3 oranges, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies. 


40 
"
"Okay, so the first place costs $200 no matter how many people come, but then you have to pay $5 for each person's food.  The other place costs $25 per person, and that includes food.

To figure out when they cost the same, we need to see when  $200 + $5 times the number of people is the same as $25 times the number of people.  

Let's say there are 10 people.

* The first place would cost $200 + $5 * 10 = $250
* The second place would cost $25 * 10 = $250

So, 10 people is when they cost the same! 



"
"Okay, so Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 bugs. Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half the amount Bodhi did.  

Let's think about it: if David found half of Bodhi's bugs, that means Bodhi must have found a pretty big number!  

To figure out how many Lily found, let's start with David.  Since Lily found 7 more than him, David couldn't have found too many bugs.  Maybe around 5 or 6?  

If David found 6 bugs, that means Bodhi found 6 * 2 = 12 bugs.  

And if Bodhi found 12, and David found 6, then Lily found 6 + 7 = 13 bugs. 


Let me know if that makes sense! 

"
"Okay, so Mariah used 1/4 of a skein and her grandma used 1/2, which is the same as 2/4 of a skein.  Together they used 3/4 of a skein.

Since there are 364 yards in a whole skein, they used 3/4 * 364 yards = 273 yards. 


"
"Okay, so Cherrie buys 2 friends 5 gifts each, which is 2 times 5, so that's 10 gifts. Then she buys 3 friends 2 gifts each, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 gifts.  

That means she bought 10 + 6 = 16 gifts for her friends.

Then she gets 10 more gifts to surprise them! So she bought a total of 16 + 10 = 26 gifts. 


"
"Okay, so the chair is 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so it's 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.  

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 8 * 2 = 16 feet.

So the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long. 


**18** 
"
"Okay, so Suzie bought four packs of gum.  She spent $2 on a pack of grape gum and half that on a pack of green apple gum, which was $1. That means she spent $2 + $1 = $3 on those two packs.

Since she paid $7 total, the strawberry gum must have cost $7 - $3 = $4.  

She bought two packs of strawberry gum, so each pack cost $4 / 2 = $2.

"
"Okay, so Frederick wants to make the most popsicle sticks with his $24.  

A 2x4 costs $4 and makes 200 sticks, so he could buy 6 of those (24 / 4 = 6). That's 1200 sticks (6 * 200 = 1200).

A 2x8 costs $6 and makes 400 sticks, so he could buy 4 of those (24 / 6 = 4). That's 1600 sticks (4 * 400 = 1600).

He'd get more sticks buying the 2x8s!


**Answer:** 1600 
"
"Okay, so Mario has 6 dogs and each dog has 4 legs. That means he has 6 times 4 which is 24 legs.  He needs a pair of snowshoes for each pair of legs, so he needs 24 / 2 = 12 pairs of snowshoes.  If each pair costs $12, then 12 pairs will cost 12 times 12 which is $144.00! 


**Answer:** $144.00 
"
"Janet takes the bus twice a day, five days a week.  Each trip costs $2.20, so that's $2.20 x 2 = $4.40 per day.

Over a whole week, that's $4.40 x 5 = $22.00!  But she can get a weekly pass for just $20.00.

So she saves $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00  


"
"Okay, so the farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep.  The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, which means they have 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows!  The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so they have 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.  

That means the farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.  And the zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Together, they have 40 animals + 80 animals = 120 animals! 



"
"Okay, so Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  That means she bought 4 times more than Sophia.  

To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we divide Rose's onions by 4: 12 onions / 4 = 3 onions.

To find out how many potatoes Sophia bought, we do the same thing with the potatoes: 4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato.

So Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 things in total. 


"
"Okay, so Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by July 19th.  That means he has a few months to do it!

He needs to burn 3500 calories for every pound he wants to lose.  So, to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To figure out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days he has: 105,000 calories / 190 days = about 552 calories per day.


**Answer:** Andy needs to burn about 552 calories each day. 
"
"Gerald makes $30 each day and worked for a whole week, which is 7 days. So he earned $30 * 7 = $210.  He spent $100, so he has $210 - $100 = $110 left. 


"
"Okay, so Hannah needs 60 ml of water for every kilometer she runs.  If she runs 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, first we need to figure out how many kilometers she's running in total.

8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Then we can multiply that by how much water she needs per kilometer:

2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml


Answer: 120 ml 
"
"Okay, so Julie started with $500.  She spent $100 on clothes because 20% of $500 is $100.  

That means she had $400 left. Then she spent $100 on CDs, which is 25% of $400.

So, Julie has $300 left. 


"
"Here's how to solve this:

* Let's say the lot costs $x.
* The house costs three times the lot, so it costs 3*$x$ which is $3x.
* Together, the lot and house cost $120,000, so  $x + 3x = $120,000
* That means $4x = $120,000
* To find out what $x$ is, we divide both sides by 4: $x = $30,000
*  The house costs 3 times the lot, so it costs 3 * $30,000 = $90,000




90000 
"
"Okay, so Tara bought 8 packs of bags, and each pack has 5 bags. That means she bought 8 * 5 = 40 bags.  Each bag cost $4, so she spent 40 * $4 = $160 in total.

She sold each bag for $8, so she made 40 * $8 = $320.

To find her profit, we subtract what she spent from what she made: $320 - $160 = $160.


**Answer: $160** 
"
"Okay, so Joe throws 25 punches every minute.  The fight is 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long.  

First, let's figure out how long the whole fight is: 5 rounds * 3 minutes/round = 15 minutes.

Then, we can figure out how many punches he throws in the whole fight: 15 minutes * 25 punches/minute = 375 punches! 


375 
"
"Okay, so Suzanne made 36 cookies.  Josh made one-fourth of that, so he made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies.  Kelsie made twice as many as Josh, so she made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies. 


"
"Okay, so Ali has four ten-dollar bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40.  He also has six twenty-dollar bills, so that's 6 * $20 = $120.  

That means he has a total of $40 + $120 = $160.

He gives half of that to his sister, so he gives away $160 / 2 = $80.

Now he has $160 - $80 = $80 left.

He spends 3/5 of that on dinner, which is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

Finally, he has $80 - $48 = $32 left. 



**Answer: 32**
"
"Okay, so Rob takes 2 hours to shingle the house, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.  Royce takes 40 minutes longer than double that, so he takes 120 * 2 + 40 = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes. 


**280**"
"Okay, so Martha needs to make 5 things for each of her 3 grandkids.  

* Hats: 2 skeins each * 3 grandkids = 6 skeins
* Scarves: 4 skeins each * 3 grandkids = 12 skeins
* Sweaters: 12 skeins each * 3 grandkids = 36 skeins
* Mittens: 1 skein each * 3 grandkids = 3 skeins
* Socks: 2 skeins each * 3 grandkids = 6 skeins

Now let's add it all up: 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63 skeins

"Okay, so Chris has 100 problems. He does 12 on Monday. Then he does three times that on Tuesday, so he does 12 * 3 = 36 problems. That means he did a total of 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

He started with 100 and did 48, so he has 100 - 48 = 52 left.

On Wednesday, he does a quarter of the rest, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

That means he has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left. 



**Answer: 39**"
"Okay, so Tony picks 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. Bobby picks one less than Tony, so he picks 5 quarts. Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, which is 10 quarts. Ricky picks 2 less than Kathy, so he picks 8 quarts.  

To find the total, we add up everyone's picking: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts.

"
"Okay, so they baked 200 loaves.  Then they sold 93 in the morning, which leaves them with 200 - 93 = 107 loaves.  

After selling 39 more in the afternoon, they have 107 - 39 = 68 loaves.  

Finally, the grocery store brought back 6 loaves, so they have 68 + 6 = 74 loaves left. 


**Answer:** 74 
"
"Okay, so Jackson has 36 red tulips and they fit 6 in a row.  That means he can make 36 / 6 = 6 rows of red tulips.

He also has 24 blue tulips and they fit 8 in a row, so he can make 24 / 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.

In total, he can plant 6 + 3 = 9 rows of flowers. 


"
"Okay, so Heather has 27 cups of raisins and wants to use them for cookies, granola, and snack mix.  That means she'll have 27 cups / 3 = 9 cups of raisins for each treat.

Each batch of cookies needs 3/4 cup of raisins.  To find out how many batches she can make, we can divide the raisins for cookies by the raisins per batch: 9 cups / (3/4 cup/batch) = 12 batches. 


**Answer: 12**"
"Okay, so Ada uses 12 kilowatts of electricity each day, and that costs $1.50 per kilowatt.  That means her daily bill is 12 * $1.50 = $18.00.

She's adding a device that uses 2 more kilowatts, so now she uses 14 kilowatts a day.  That means her new daily bill is 14 * $1.50 = $21.00.

The difference is $21.00 - $18.00 = $3.00 more per day.

Over a week, that's $3.00 * 7 days = $21.00 more.




**Answer:** $21.00 
"
"Okay, so if one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means it takes 10 days for one person to paint the whole house, right?

If you have 5 people, they could each paint half a house in 5 days.  Since they're all working together, they could paint the whole house in just 2 days!

And if they work an 8-hour day, that means it would take them 2 days * 8 hours/day = 16 hours. 




"
"Okay, so Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 22 * 3 = 66 chairs.  That means Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Together, they have 20 + 64 = 84 sofas and 22 + 66 = 88 chairs.

So the total number of sofas and chairs is 84 + 88 = 172. 




"
"If Tom didn't buy the headphones, he could have bought 11 more CDs. 
"
"Okay, so Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for most of the 8 weeks, which is 4 hours/week * 7 weeks = 28 hours.

Then he had two weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each, so that's 5 hours/week * 2 weeks = 10 hours.

And he had one week where he worked out for 6 hours.

Adding it all up: 28 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 44 hours! 


**44**"
"Okay, so there are 48 people on the bus at first.  8 get off, which leaves 40 people. Then, 5 times the number who got off get on, so that's 8 times 5, which is 40 more people.  That means there are 40 + 40 = 80 people on the bus.

Then, 21 people get off at the next stop.  That leaves 80 - 21 = 59 people.  Then 3 times fewer people get on, so that's 21 divided by 3, which is 7 people.

So, there are 59 + 7 = 66 people on the bus after the second stop. 



"
"Okay, so Jame will be 27 in 5 years, which means he's 22 now (27 - 5 = 22).

His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years.  So, in 8 years, Jame will be 30 (22 + 8 = 30). Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 60 (30 x 2 = 60).  Five years younger than that is 55 (60 - 5 = 55).

That means his cousin will be 55 years old in 8 years.  To find his current age, we subtract 8 (55 - 8 = 47).

The age difference between them is 47 - 22 = 25 years.




**Answer:** 25 
"
"Okay, so the computer cost $1100, and the printer cost $400 less than that, which is $700.  

That means the computer and printer together cost $1100 + $700 = $1800.

Since the whole thing cost $2400, the two monitors together cost $2400 - $1800 = $600.

So, one monitor costs $600 / 2 = $300. 



**300**"
"Okay, so there are 20 kids and they split into two groups of boys and girls.  Each boy found 60 seashells.  The girls found the same amount as the boys plus four times that amount.  

First, let's figure out how many shells the boys found in total: 10 boys * 60 shells/boy = 600 shells.

Then, the girls found 600 shells + (4 * 600 shells) = 600 shells + 2400 shells = 3000 shells.

Finally, to find out how many shells each girl found, we divide the total shells the girls found by the number of girls: 3000 shells / 10 girls = 300 shells/girl.




**Answer:** 300 
"
"Okay, so George had 3 candies left after eating some.  That means he had 3 + 5 = 8 candies before.  Nick had twice as many as George, so Nick had 8 * 2 = 16 candies.

"
"Okay, so the first book is 31 mm thick. The second book is 50 mm thick.  The third book is 5 mm thinner than the second book, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 31 * 2 = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness, we add them all up: 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm.

"Emma wants to make 72 vlogs this month.  She made 18 the first week, 21 the second week, and 15 the third week.  

To find out how many more she needs to make, we add up the vlogs she's already made: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs.

Then we subtract that number from her goal: 72 - 54 = 18 vlogs.


**Answer:** Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs. 
"
"Okay, so the dinner cost $50.  

A 20% tip on $50 is the same as $10.

If you add the tip to the dinner price, that's $50 + $10 = $60. 


"
"Okay, so the eldest boy gets $6 at first. Then he adds $5 and another $10, so he has $6 + $5 + $10 = $21.  

He spends $8, which leaves him with $21 - $8 = $13.  

After that, he triples his money, so he has $13 * 3 = $39.


**Answer:** $39 
"
"Okay, so Elvis wants to save $1125 this month.  He wants to save twice as much in the second half of April as he does in the first half.  

April has 30 days, so that's 15 days in each half.  Let's say he saves $x each day in the first half.  That means he saves $2x each day in the second half.

In the first half, he saves a total of 15 * $x = $15x.

In the second half, he saves a total of 15 * $2x = $30x.

Together, that's $15x + $30x = $1125.

Combining like terms, we get $45x = $1125.

To find out how much he saves each day in the first half ($x$), we divide both sides by 45:

$x = $1125 / 45 = $25

So, he saves $25 each day in the first half.  

In the second half, he saves twice that amount, so he saves $25 * 2 = $50 each day. 




"
"Okay, so Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each, which is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50.  

Then she got 5 oranges at $0.80 each, so that's 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.

And she bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each, which is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

Adding all that up, her fruit cost $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

If she paid with $20.00, her change would be $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00. 


"
"Okay, so Jairus makes $0.80 for each task and Jenny makes $0.50 for each task.  

If they both do 20 tasks, Jairus would make 20 * $0.80 = $16.00

And Jenny would make 20 * $0.50 = $10.00

To find out how much more Jairus makes, we subtract: $16.00 - $10.00 = $6.00 


**Answer:** $6.00 
"
"Okay, so Jeff gets four times more than Brad.  That means if Brad gets $1, Jeff gets $4.  

Let's think about it like this:  If we split the $100 evenly, each of them would get $50. But Jeff gets four times more, so he gets way more than that!

To figure out how much Brad gets, we can think about it like this:  If Jeff gets $4 for every $1 Brad gets, how many times do we need to multiply Brad's share by 4 to get to $100?

Hmm... let's try it out. If Brad gets $20, then Jeff gets $80. That works! 



**Answer:** Jeff gets $80. 
"
"He walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day, so that's 6 miles total every day.  Since he works 5 days a week, he walks 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles a week.

"
"Okay, so Elise writes the whole alphabet twice, which is 26 letters each time, so that's 26 * 2 = 52 letters.  Then she writes half the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.  Finally, she writes everything again, so she doubles that 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

"
"Okay, so Ali starts by calling 3 families. Then each of those families calls 3 more families, and so on.  

* Round 1: 3 families
* Round 2: 3 * 3 = 9 families
* Round 3: 9 * 3 = 27 families
* Round 4: 27 * 3 = 81 families 


So the answer is 81 families.

"
"Okay, so James has 80 toys and Jonathan wants a set five times bigger. That means Jonathan wants 80 * 5 = 400 toys.  He needs 2 more to get there, so he must have 400 - 2 = 400 toys right now. 


"
"Okay, so Daniel wants to buy 5 notebooks at $1.50 each, that's 5 times $1.50 which is $7.50.  

Then he wants 2 pens at $0.25 each, so that's 2 times $0.25 which is $0.50.

He also needs one calculator for $12 and one geometry set for $10.

Let's add all that up: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

But wait, there's a 10% discount!  That means he saves 10% of $30, which is $3.

So, the final price is $30 - $3 = $27. 


"
"Okay, so Carly spends $20 on hamburgers, $3 on fries, and $10 on drinks.  That means she spends a total of $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.  

If she pays with a $50 bill, she gets $50 - $33 = $17 back. 


"
"Okay, so Antonella sold $2500 worth of stuff.  She gets 30% of the first $1000, which is $300. Then she gets an extra 10% on the amount over $1000, so that's 10% of $1500, which is $150.  

If you add those together, she made $300 + $150 = $450! 


"
"Okay, so Bill has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles, so he has 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.  He needs 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, which is 70 * 2 = 140 bottles.  To find out how many more he needs, we subtract the bottles he already has: 140 - 48 = 92 bottles. 


**Answer: 92**"
"Okay, so Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when it's cold. When it's warm, he takes twice as long plus 2 more minutes.  That means he swims a mile in 34 minutes when it's warm (32 minutes + 2 minutes).

To swim 3 miles when it's cold, he takes 48 minutes (16 minutes/mile * 3 miles).

To swim 3 miles when it's warm, he takes 102 minutes (34 minutes/mile * 3 miles).

The difference is 54 minutes (102 minutes - 48 minutes). 



**Answer:** 54 
"
"Okay, so John makes $2 an hour and works 5 hours a day, which means he makes $2 * 5 = $10 each day.  

Since he works 4 days a week, he makes $10 * 4 = $40 each week.

To save $80, it will take him $80 / $40 = 2 weeks. 


"
"Okay, so the foot-long fish sub costs $40.  The cold-cut sub costs three times that, so it costs $40 x 3 = $120.

"Okay, so Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half the size, which means it's 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.  Then Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's, so it's 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches. 


**Answer:** 3  
"
"Okay, so Octavia drinks half the recommended amount of coffee, which is 4 cups divided by 2, so she drinks 2 cups.  Juan drinks 10 times more than Octavia, so he drinks 2 cups times 10, which is 20 cups.  His doctor wants him to drink only 4 cups, so he needs to cut back by 20 cups minus 4 cups, which is 16 cups. 


**16** 
"
"Okay, so there are 3 cages with hamsters and each cage has 10 hamsters. That's 3 times 10, which is 30 hamsters.  Then there are 3 cages with guinea pigs, and each cage has 5 guinea pigs, so that's 3 times 5, which is 15 guinea pigs.  

If you add the hamsters and guinea pigs together, you get 30 + 15 = 45 rodents.

"
"Okay, so Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so she weighs 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so he weighs 260 pounds.  

To find the average weight, we add up all their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

Then we divide the total weight by 3 because there are 3 friends: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds. 


180

"Okay, so the sun starts at the top of the pyramid, which is already tilted at 32 degrees.  

Then, it goes up 5 degrees every hour for 10 hours. That means it moves up a total of 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

So, if you add the starting angle and how much it moved, you get 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees! 


**Answer:** 82 degrees 
"
"Okay, so James has two sons. One is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, which means he's 8.  They need candles for both of them, so that's 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Each pack has 5 candles, so they need 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Since each pack costs $3, James spends 4 * $3 = $12 on candles. 


"
"Okay, so Judy read for 15 minutes each night for a whole week, which is 15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes.  

Then she read 100 pages the second week.

She reads 2 pages every 1.5 minutes, so in the first week she read 105 minutes / 1.5 minutes/page = 70 pages.

In total, she read 70 pages + 100 pages = 170 pages. 



"
"Okay, so Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches. Cody ate one-third of them, which is 12 divided by 3, which is 4 sandwiches. Trevor ate one-fourth of them, so he ate 12 divided by 4, which is 3 sandwiches.  

Together they ate 4 plus 3, which is 7 sandwiches.  

That means there are 12 minus 7, or 5 sandwiches left. 


"
"Okay, so Shiloh is 44 now and in seven years he'll be three times as old as his nephew.  

That means in seven years Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

Let's say the nephew is 'x' years old now. In seven years, he'll be x + 7.

We know 51 will be three times the nephew's age in seven years, so:

51 = 3(x + 7)

Let's solve for x:

51 = 3x + 21
30 = 3x
x = 10 


So the nephew is 10 years old. 
"
"Okay, so the tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00 for her first tooth. Then she got $1.00 for each of the next three teeth, which is $1.00 x 3 = $3.00.  

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half of a dollar, so that's $0.50 x 2 = $1.00.

Finally, to find out the total, we add it all up: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00 




**Answer:** $9.00 
"
"Okay, so Richie scored 80 goals, and that's 20 more than Mark.  That means Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.

Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna, so Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

To find the total, we add up all their goals: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 goals! 


"
"Mitchell made $84 because he sold 21 lemonades at $4 each.  Liam only made $63.  So Mitchell made $84 - $63 = $21 more than Liam. 


"
"Okay, so Peter spends $5 on wooden figures each day for four days, which is $5 x 4 = $20.  That leaves him with $70 - $20 = $50.

Since each plastic figure costs $2, he can buy $50 / $2 = 25 plastic figures.

In total, he has 4 wooden figures + 25 plastic figures = 29 action figures. 



"
"Okay, so the spaying cost $200.  Then the vaccines were $20 each and she got 3, so that's $20 x 3 = $60.  And the kitten broke 4 vases that cost $12 each, so that's $12 x 4 = $48.  

If you add all that up, it's $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

"Ford grows 40 roses every week and sells them to three flower shops. The first shop buys 20 roses, the second buys 15, and the third buys 30.  

To figure out how many roses Ford doesn't have enough of each month, we need to see how many he *needs* to grow.

* First, let's see how many roses the shops buy each week: 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses
* Now, let's see how many roses the shops buy in a whole month (since there are 4 weeks in a month): 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses
*  Ford only grows 40 roses a week, so in a month he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses
*  To find out how many roses he's short, we subtract: 260 roses - 160 roses = 100 roses

"
"Okay, so Katina starts with $3000.  She takes out $100 every month, and there are 12 months in a year.  

Over two years, that's 2 years * 12 months/year = 24 months.

That means she has $3000 - $2400 = $600 left. 


600 
"
"Okay, so the food truck makes grilled cheese sandwiches.  

* Each loaf of bread costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches, so each sandwich costs $0.30 for bread.
* They spend $30.00 on cheese and stuff for every 10 sandwiches.
* They sell each sandwich for $7.00.

Let's see...

*  Bread cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.00
*  Cheese and stuff cost for 10 sandwiches is $30.00
*  That means the total cost for 10 sandwiches is $33.00
*  They make $70.00 from selling 10 sandwiches.
*  So, their profit is $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

"Okay, so Kate has 3 boxes of crayons with 64 crayons in each box. That's a lot of crayons!  She melts 8 crayons together to make one crayon muffin.  If she makes 24 crayon muffins and sells them for $1.50 each, she can make $36.00. 


"
"Okay, so Michael's room is 18 feet long and 12 feet wide, which means it's 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

* The carpet itself costs $12 per square foot, so that's 216 * $12 = $2592.
* He also needs padding, which is $2 per square foot, so that's 216 * $2 = $432.
* Taking up the old carpet costs $4 per square foot, so that's 216 * $4 = $864.
* Installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so that's 216 * $34 = $7344.

If you add all those costs together: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232



"
"Okay, so Mack saw 50 birds on the first two days, then zero on day three.  He saw 120 birds on days four and five, 20 on day six, and 90 on day seven.  

To find the average, we add up all the birds he saw: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds.

Then we divide that number by the total number of days: 280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds per day. 


40 
"
"Okay, so Diane starts with 20.  Then she adds half of some number to it.  Let's say that number is 'x'. So we have 20 + x/2.

Next, she divides that whole thing by 5. That's (20 + x/2) / 5.

Then she multiplies that by 20 minus 12, which is 8. So we have  [(20 + x/2) / 5] * 8.

To get the final answer, we need to know what 'x' is.  



"
"Okay, so the boy has 5 cards and his brother has 3 fewer.  That means his brother has 2 cards.  

Together they have 5 + 2 = 7 cards.

"Okay, so the oven is like 4% too hot.  That means for every 100 degrees it's set to, it's actually 4 degrees hotter.

If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to figure out what temperature Maggie should set it to so it actually reaches 520.  

Let's think about it like this: if the oven is 4% too hot, we need to turn it down a little bit to make up for that extra heat.  

Hmm...  I'm not sure how to do that math exactly, but I know it's going to be a little less than 520. 



"
"Okay, so the first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is the same as 90 minutes.  The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes, which is 125 minutes.  

If you add those together, 90 + 125 = 215 minutes! 


215 
"
"Okay, so Herb's house cost $76,000. Juan's house is 30% cheaper, which means it's $76,000 times 0.30 less.  

That's $22,800 less, so Juan's house cost $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Together, their houses are worth $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200. 


"
"Okay, so Judy brought a dozen cups, which is 12.  She brought twice as many dishes as cups, so she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes. That means she brought a total of 12 + 24 = 36 utensils.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so they brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.  Her friend brought a total of 40 + 44 = 84 utensils.

Together, they brought 36 + 84 = 120 utensils. 



"
"Okay, so Pete gets 90 contacts in a box and they last him 45 days.  Each box costs $100, but it's 10% off, so it's really $90.  He buys two boxes, which means he has 180 contacts total.  If he spends $180 on 180 contacts, each pair costs $1.00! 


"
"Okay, so Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours.  That means she made 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.  That's $40.  On Sunday, he worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 1 hour * 3 = 3 hours.  That's another $30.

In total, John worked 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours and made 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

So John made $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill.

"Okay, so Hannah burns 500 calories every hour doing aerobics and 600 calories every hour running.  

* First, let's see how many calories she burns in total:
    * Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
    * Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
    * Total: 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

* Now, she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. 

* So, she needs to drink: 1600 calories / 200 calories/100 ml = 800 ml of water. 



**Answer:** 800 ml 
"
"Okay, so there are red, blue, and green jelly beans in a jar.  

* There are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
* There are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

If there are 4500 jelly beans total, how many more green jelly beans are there than red jelly beans?

Let's think about it:

*  If we say there are 'b' blue jelly beans, there are 0.99b red jelly beans (because there are 1% fewer red).
*  There are 1.01b green jelly beans (because there are 1% more green).

The total jelly beans is: 0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500

That means 2.99b = 4500

So, b (the blue jelly beans) is about 1505.

Now we can find the rest:

* Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1505 = about 1490
* Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1505 = about 1520

Finally, 1520 - 1490 = 30

**Answer:** There are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans. 



"
"Okay, so Jared starts at 47 words per minute. Then he gets better and types 52 words per minute.  After that, he gets even faster and types 5 more words per minute, so he's typing 57 words per minute.

To find the average, we add all the numbers together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Then we divide that by 3 because there are three numbers: 156 / 3 = 52


**52** 
"
"Okay, so Martin loses 1.25 pounds each week eating Cheerios and gains 1.75 pounds each week eating donuts.  

Over five weeks, he'd lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds eating Cheerios.

And he'd gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds eating donuts.

That means he'd be 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds heavier eating donuts!


**Answer: 2.5** 
"
"Okay, so Alex invited 100 people, and each of them is bringing two friends, so that's 100 times 2, which is 200 more people.  

That means there are 100 + 200 = 300 people coming from the emails.

Then Alex invited 10 more friends, and 8 of them are bringing their spouses. So that's 10 + 8 = 18 more people.

Finally, we add all the people together: 300 + 18 = 318 people!


**Answer: 318** 
"
"Okay, so the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. The Dachshund weighs twice as much, so it weighs 20 pounds.  The Papillon weighs one-fourth of the Dachshund's weight, which is 5 pounds.  Finally, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the Papillon's weight, so it weighs 5 pounds * 44 = 220 pounds. 


**220** 
"
"Okay, so the boots cost $16 on Amazon plus $4 for shipping, which is $20 total.  On eBay, the boots are $13 but shipping is $8. That means they cost $21 on eBay.  

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay. 


"
"Okay, so the beanstalk starts at 4 feet and grows twice its size every day.  It needs to be taller than 20 feet.

* Day 1: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
* Day 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
* Day 3: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

It takes **3 days** for the beanstalk to be taller than the window! 



"
"Okay, so he eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, and each 100 grams has 3 grams of protein.  

That means he eats 2 times the amount of mushrooms, so he gets 2 times the protein, right?

So, he gets 3 grams * 2 = 6 grams of protein each day.

Then, there are 7 days in a week, so he gets 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week. 



"
"Okay, so Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.  That means if he was 5 years old five years ago, he's 10 now.  

In three years, he'll be 13! 


"
"Okay, so George needs two implants. One costs $2000 and the other costs $2500 because he wants a fancy porcelain crown on it.  

That means the implants together cost $4500. But he already paid $600, so he still needs $3900.

If he makes $15 an hour, he needs to work $3900 / $15 = 260 hours. 


**Answer: 260**"
"Okay, so we know the three angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  

Let's say the smallest angle is 'x'.  The other angles are twice and three times that size, so they are 2x and 3x.

Now we can write an equation:  x + 2x + 3x = 180

That's the same as 6x = 180

To find x, we divide both sides by 6: x = 30

The biggest angle is 3 times the smallest, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees. 


**Answer:** 90 
"
"Okay, so Colby has 8 quarters, 6 dimes, 14 nickels, and 15 pennies.  

* Quarters are worth 25 cents each, so 8 quarters is 8 * 25 = 200 cents.
* Dimes are worth 10 cents each, so 6 dimes is 6 * 10 = 60 cents.
* Nickels are worth 5 cents each, so 14 nickels is 14 * 5 = 70 cents.
* Pennies are worth 1 cent each, so 15 pennies is 15 * 1 = 15 cents.

If you add all that up, Colby has 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, he can buy 345 / 5 = 69 gumballs. 




"
"Okay, so there are 5 dogs, 2 cats, and 10 birds. 

Dogs have 4 legs, cats have 4 legs, and birds have 2 legs.  

Let's see...

* Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
* Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
* Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Adding it all up: 20 + 8 + 20 = 48 legs! 


48 
"
"Okay, so Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight.  He makes it heavier by 50%, which means he adds half of 8 pounds to it. Half of 8 is 4, so now he's using 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.  But that's too heavy, so he takes 2 pounds off.  That means he's using 12 - 2 = 10 pounds now. 


10 
"
"Okay, so Steve starts with 5 games. Then he gets 12 more games in the first year, plus 5 for Christmas, so that's 17 games.

The second year he gets 24 games from buying them and 5 more for Christmas, making 29 games.

The third year he gets 48 games from buying them and 5 more for Christmas, so that's 53 games.

If you add all those up, he has 17 + 29 + 53 = 99 games! 


"
"Okay, so the plane flies 1200 miles in 3 hours.  That means it goes 1200/3 = 400 miles every hour.

If it wants to fly another 2000 miles, it'll take 2000 / 400 = 5 hours. 


**Answer:** 5 hours 
"
"Okay, so Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolate in two hours. That means he makes 60 pounds per hour (120 / 2 = 60).

Marissa makes 3/4 of what Ruiz makes in an hour, so she makes (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

In a day, Ruiz makes 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds.

And Marissa makes 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.

Together, they make 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds. 



"
"Okay, so Howard spent $8 on Monday.  On Tuesday, he spent twice as much, which is $8 times 2, so that's $16.  Then on Wednesday, he spent 4 times what he spent on Tuesday, so that's $16 times 4, which is $64.

To find out how much he spent in total, we add it all up: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

If he started with $100, and spent $88, he has $100 - $88 = $12 left. 



"
"Okay, so Patrick sold lemonade for 6 hours total.  

For the first four hours, he sold 15 cups each hour, so that's 15 * 4 = 60 cups.  He made $0.50 for each cup, so he made 60 * $0.50 = $30.00.

Then, for the next two hours, he sold 10 cups each hour, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 cups.  He made $0.60 for each cup, so he made 20 * $0.60 = $12.00.

To find his total earnings, we add those two amounts together: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00



**Answer:** $42.00 
"
"Okay, so the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles driven.  Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so that means his tires rotate 725 times * 200 = 145,000 times a month.

In a year, that's 145,000 times a month * 12 months = 1,740,000 times.

Each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing a replacement.  So, it'll last 10,440,000 / 1,740,000 = 6 years. 


**Answer:** 6 years 
"
"Okay, so the shampoo costs $24.00 and lasts for 120 washes if you use 2 pumps each time.  

If Jackie only uses 1 pump, that means her shampoo will last twice as long, right? So it'll last for 120 washes * 2 = 240 washes.

Now, to find out how much each pump costs, we divide the total price by the number of pumps: $24.00 / 2 pumps = $12.00 per pump.

But the question wants the answer in cents, so we multiply that by 100: $12.00 * 100 = 1200 cents.




**1200**
"
"Okay, so Joe has $50 and wants to buy a $25 shirt and $35 shorts.  There's a 30% off sale on the shirt, so he saves $7.50 (because $25 x 0.30 = $7.50).  

That means the shirt costs $17.50 now ($25 - $7.50 = $17.50).

The whole outfit costs $52.50 ($17.50 + $35 = $52.50).

Since Joe only has $50, he'll be short $2.50. 


-2.50 
"
"Okay, so he needs 1/4 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.  

If he makes 4 dozen a day, that's 4 * (1/4) = 1 pound of butter per day.

Over a week, that's 1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds of butter. 


**7**"
"Okay, so Monica's street is 150 meters long and costs $194 per meter to repave. That means it costs $194 * 150 = $29,100 to repave her street.

Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so it costs $194 * 490 = $95,060 to repave his street.

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960


**Answer:** $65,960 
"
"Okay, so John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months.  Then his research takes 10 times longer, which is 50 months total.  

After those first 5 months, he needs 50% more money each month.  That means each month after the first 5, he gets $100,000 plus half of $100,000, which is $50,000 more.

To find out how much it all costs, we need to add up all the money he gets for each month. That's a lot of adding!  



"
"Okay, so the first player ate a 6-ounce steak. The second player had 8 beef tips, and each tip was 1 ounce, so they ate 8 ounces. The third player had a one-pound steak, and there are 16 ounces in a pound, so they ate 16 ounces.  The last two players didn't eat meat.  

Adding it all up, they ate 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces of meat. 


"
"Okay, so there are 31 days in March.  If each of the 1000 members posts 3 times a day, that's 1000 times 3, which is 3000 posts every day.  

To find the total for the whole month, we do 3000 posts a day times 31 days, which is 93,000 posts! 


93000 
"
"Okay, so Gary does laundry twice a week and each load uses 20 gallons of water. That means he uses 40 gallons of water every week (2 loads * 20 gallons).

If a gallon of water costs $0.15, then he spends $6.00 on water each week (40 gallons * $0.15/gallon).

In a year, there are 52 weeks, so he spends $312.00 on water for laundry ( $6.00/week * 52 weeks). 



"
"Okay, so Scarlett got the aquarium for $10.  Then she bought two bags of rocks for $2.50 each, which is $5.00.  She also got three pieces of coral for $2.00 each, so that's $6.00.  The fish cost $0.50 each and she bought 20, so that's $10.00.  Finally, the fish food was $2.00.  

If you add all that up, she spent $10 + $5 + $6 + $10 + $2 = $33.00

"
"Okay, so there are 4 rows with 18 seats each, which means there are 72 seats in total.  

If 1/4 of the seats are taken by administrators, that's 72 / 4 = 18 seats.

That leaves 72 - 18 = 54 seats for parents and students.

If 1/3 of the remaining seats are for parents, then 54 / 3 = 18 seats are for parents.

Finally, that means 54 - 18 = 36 seats are for students. 


**Answer:** 36 
"
"Okay, so there are 4 street lights on each pole and 6 poles at each intersection. That means there are 4 * 6 = 24 street lights at each intersection.

Since there are 4 intersections, there are a total of 24 * 4 = 96 street lights.

But, 20 of them aren't working, so we need to subtract those.  96 - 20 = 76 street lights are working.

* **Total:** 644 + 865 = 1509 more times

So the answer is 1509 


"
"Okay, so John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, twice a week for 2 hours each time.  That means he went to 6 weeks * 2 times a week = 12 times.

And each time he was there for 2 hours, so that's 12 times * 2 hours = 24 hours total.

If each hour costs $125, then 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000. 


"
"Okay, so Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.  He eats 4 pieces at school 'cause he chews one every 2 hours and school is 8 hours long. Then he eats one on the way home and one after dinner, so that's 6 pieces total.

That leaves him with 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.  

His sister takes half, which is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces left.

"Okay, so the baseball coach spent 9 times $3, which is $27.  The basketball coach spent 8 times $14, which is $112.  To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we subtract: $112 - $27 = $85. 


"
"Okay, so there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, which means there are 10 times 20, or 200 flowers total.  

If 4 out of every 5 flowers have bloomed, we can figure that out by multiplying 200 by 4/5. That's the same as doing 200 times 0.8, which equals 160 flowers.

"Okay, so Ashley's internet is 20,000 bits per second.  We need to figure out how many megabits that is per hour.

There are 1000 kilobits in a megabit, and there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.  Let's do the math:

* 20,000 bits per second * 60 seconds per minute = 1,200,000 bits per minute
* 1,200,000 bits per minute / 1000 bits per kilobit = 1200 kilobits per minute
* 1200 kilobits per minute * 60 minutes per hour = 72,000 kilobits per hour
* 72,000 kilobits per hour / 1000 kilobits per megabit = 72 megabits per hour

"Okay, so the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days, which is 10 times 3, or 30 cars.  Then it pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the rest of the week, so that's 10 minus 4, which is 6 cars each day.  There are 4 days left in the week, so it pulled 6 times 4, or 24 cars those days.  

Adding those together, it pulled 30 plus 24, which is 54 cars all week!

"Okay, so there are 100 surfers.  Only 25% of them can stay up on a wave that big, which is 100 * 0.25 = 25 surfers.

We know 60% of those 25 are girls, so that's 25 * 0.60 = 15 girls.

That means 25 - 15 = 10 boys can stay up on the wave.

"
"Okay, so a diamond costs $2000.  The gold jewel is more expensive, costing 4/5 of the price of the diamond, which is like saying it costs 80% of the diamond's price.  

So the gold jewel costs (4/5) * $2000 = $1600.

The silver jewel is $400 cheaper than the gold jewel, so it costs $1600 - $400 = $1200.

Finally, to find the total price, we add up the cost of all three jewels: $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800. 



"
"Okay, so Max got 16 snowflake stamps.  He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, which is 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.  Then he got 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so that's 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps! 


"
"Okay, so Bob is way ahead, but Tom is going faster!  To figure out how long it takes Tom to catch up, we need to think about how much ground he closes each hour.  

Tom closes 15 miles each hour because he's driving 15 miles per hour faster than Bob.

Then, to find out how long it takes, we divide the distance Bob is ahead by how much Tom closes the distance each hour: 75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours.

"
"Okay, so four apples cost $5.20, which means one apple costs $1.30 because $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.  

Three oranges cost $3.30, so one orange costs $1.10 because $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Five apples would cost $6.50 because $1.30 x 5 = $6.50.

Five oranges would cost $5.50 because $1.10 x 5 = $5.50.

Finally, five apples and five oranges together cost $12.00 because $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00. 




"
"Okay, so the hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep.  To find out how much dirt is in there, we multiply those numbers: 6 x 4 x 3 = 72 cubic feet.

"Okay, so the truck starts at $30,000.  

* The king cab is an extra $7,500.
* The leather seats cost a third of the king cab, so they're $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
* The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
* The fancy lights cost $1,500.

To find the total, we add all the prices together: $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

"Okay, so Tim gets a $1000 raise 'cause 5% of $20,000 is $1000.  

That means he makes $21,000 a month now.  

His bonus is half of that, so he gets $10,500 extra.

So each month he makes $21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500

In a year, that's $31,500 x 12 months = $378,000 





"
"Okay, so James bought 10 suits at $750 each, which is $750 * 10 = $7500.  

His dress pants cost $150 each because they're 1/5 the price of a suit, so 10 pairs cost $150 * 10 = $1500.

He also bought 30 dress shirts (10 suits * 3 shirts each) for $60 each, so that's $60 * 30 = $1800.

Finally, to find the total cost, we add it all up: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800. 




"
"Okay, so the news website does 20 political and weather stories each day, and the other website does 10 business stories.  That means together they do 20 + 10 = 30 stories every day.

"Okay, so Bill digs 4 feet of soil per hour.  That means it'll take him 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours to dig through all the soil.

He digs clay half as fast, so that's 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet per hour.  

To dig through 8 feet of clay, it'll take him 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

In total, it'll take him 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours to dig the whole well.

"Okay, so Clara bought 20 pomegranates for $20 each on Tuesday, which is $400. She got $2 off with a coupon, so she paid $398.

The next day, pomegranates cost $30 each, so 20 would be $600. But there was a 10% discount, which is $60 off. That means Sheila paid $540.

If you subtract Clara's price from Sheila's price, you get $540 - $398 = $142.

"
"Okay, so Ariadne sells red and green hats.  She made $400 from red hats one month, and that was half of what she made from green hats.  

To find out how much she made from green hats, I double the red hat money: $400 * 2 = $800.

Then, to find her total sales for that month, I add the red and green hat money: $400 + $800 = $1200.

The next month, she made 3/4 of what she made the first month, so I multiply the first month's sales by 3/4: $1200 * (3/4) = $900.

Finally, to find her total sales for both months, I add the money from each month: $1200 + $900 = $2100.




**Answer: $2100** 
"
"Okay, so James rents the carriage for 4 hours but gets one hour free. That means he pays for 3 hours.

The first hour is $15, and each hour after that is double the price.  So the second hour is $15 times 2, which is $30. The third hour is $30 times 2, which is $60.

If you add all that up, $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.


**Answer:** $105 
"
"Sally started the week with $200 in her bank account and now has $420.  She makes $300 each week.  To figure out how much was taken out, we need to see how much more she has now than she should.

She has $420 - $200 = $220 more than she started with.

But she should have $300, so $220 is less than what she was supposed to have.

That means $300 - $220 = $80 was taken out. 


**Answer:** 80 
"
"Okay, so Lori needs 1 egg for every 2 deviled eggs.  If she's making enough for 16 guests and each guest eats 3 deviled eggs, she'll need 16 guests * 3 deviled eggs/guest = 48 deviled eggs.

That means she needs 48 deviled eggs / 2 deviled eggs/egg = 24 eggs.

And since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, she'll need 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens of eggs. 


"
"Here's how to solve it:

* She finished 1/3 of the paper, so she wrote 15 pages * (1/3) = 5 pages.
* She needs to write 15 pages - 5 pages = 10 more pages.

"He'll finish reading in 20 days because he reads 10 pages a day and the book is 200 pages long.  Since he has 30 days to read it, he'll be done 10 days early! 


"
"Okay, so the plane cost $150,000.  

He pays $5,000 a month for the hanger, and twice that for fuel, so that's $5,000 * 2 = $10,000 for fuel.

That means he spends $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000 each month on the plane.

Over a year, that's $15,000 * 12 months = $180,000.

Adding the cost of the plane, it cost him $180,000 + $150,000 = $330,000 for the first year. 


**330000** 
"
"Okay, so Finley cooked rice for 30 minutes. Pork took 20 minutes longer than rice, so it took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.  Beans took half the time it took to cook the rice and pork together.  Rice and pork took 30 + 50 = 80 minutes total.  Half of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.  So beans took 40 minutes.  

To find the total time, add it all up: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes. 


**120** 
"
"Okay, so almonds are $10 a pound and walnuts are $15 a pound.

Let's figure out how much the first mix costs:

* Half a pound of almonds is $5 (because 0.5 * $10 = $5).
* A third of a pound of walnuts is $5 (because 0.33 * $15 = $5).

So the first mix costs $5 + $5 = $10.

Now let's do the second mix:

* A fifth of a pound of almonds is $2 (because 0.2 * $10 = $2).
* A third of a pound of walnuts is still $5.

The second mix costs $2 + $5 = $7.

Finally, to find the difference, we subtract: $10 - $7 = $3.




**Answer:** $3 
"
"Okay, so Lee has sheep and geese.  We know there are 20 heads in total and 70 legs.  

Let's think about it: each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs.  

If we had only sheep, we'd have 70 legs / 4 legs per sheep = 17.5 sheep.  That can't be right since we can't have half a sheep!

So, there must be some geese too.  We need to figure out how many.  Let's try different numbers of sheep and see if it works. 


Let's try 15 sheep. That's 15 sheep * 4 legs per sheep = 60 legs.

That leaves 70 total legs - 60 legs = 10 legs for the geese.

And 10 legs / 2 legs per goose = 5 geese.

That means there are 15 sheep and 5 geese! 





"
"Okay, so Roger had to get a more expensive coffee because his usual one was gone.  The new coffee cost 20% more than the $5 he usually pays, so it cost $5 + ($5 x 0.20) = $6 per pound.

He needs a pound of coffee every day for a week, which is 7 days.  That means he bought 7 pounds of coffee at $6 a pound, so that cost him 7 x $6 = $42.

He also bought a donut for $2.  

Adding that up, everything cost him $42 + $2 = $44. 




"
"Okay, so Gus spent $20.  He got two bags of chips for $2 each, which is $4.  Then he got chicken for $8 and a soda for $1.  That's $4 + $8 + $1 = $13.  

If he spent $20 total, the apple pie must have cost $20 - $13 = $7. 


"
"Okay, so James delivers 600 newspapers total.  He gives 198 to District A and 209 to District C.  To find out how many he delivers to District B, we need to subtract those amounts from the total: 600 - 198 - 209 = 193 


193 
"
"Okay, so the class is 4 days a week for 2 hours each day for 6 weeks.  

That means there are 4 times 2 times 6 = 48 hours of class.

He learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, so he learns 48 divided by 1.5, which is 32 recipes! 


32 
"
"Okay, so there are 150 teachers on the court, and 60% of them are history teachers. That means 60% of 150 is  (60/100) * 150 = 90 history teachers.  

If 90 are history teachers, then 150 - 90 = 60 teachers are math teachers.

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours, the math teachers sleep a total of 60 * 6 = 360 hours. 



"
"Okay, so Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 of that, which is $90.  Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so she has $150.

If they add up all their money, it's $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.

Then, if they share it equally, each person gets $360 / 3 = $120. 



"
"Okay, so the game has four quarters, and each quarter is 12 minutes. That means the game is usually 4 times 12, which is 48 minutes long.  But then they had to play an extra 5 minutes because of the tie! So, if you add those together, the game lasted 48 plus 5, which is 53 minutes. 


"
"Okay, so there are 50 employees total, and 20% of them are managers. That's like 10 people.  

Then, 30% of those managers are in charge of the whole company.  So, we do 30% of 10, which is 3 people!

"
"Okay, so she needs 5 tablespoons of flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 0.25 tablespoons of salt for each muffin.  That's a total of 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons of dry ingredients per muffin.

If she's making 16 muffins, she'll need 8.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients. 


"
"Okay, so Robert had 3 pounds, Cindy had 5 pounds, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy.  That's a total of 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds.

If they share it equally, they each get 12 pounds / 3 people = 4 pounds each.

"
"Okay, so Adam bought 7 candies that cost $0.50 each, so those cost 7 times $0.50 which is $3.50.  Then he bought 10 candies that cost $0.75 each, so those cost 10 times $0.75 which is $7.50.  

To find the total cost, we add those together: $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00.

If he paid with $15.00, we subtract the total cost to find his change: $15.00 - $11.00 = $4.00.


**Answer:** $4.00 
"
"Okay, so she had 12 good days total. Then she had 3 more good days, so that's 12 + 3 = 15 good days! 


"
"Okay, so Janey has 21 books and that's 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has.  

Let's think about it like this: if Sally has 'x' books, then twice that is 2x.  Janey has 3 more than that, so 2x + 3 = 21.

To find out how many books Sally has, we need to solve for 'x'.  First, subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 18.

Then, divide both sides by 2: x = 9.


Sally has 9 books. 
"
"Okay, so the bamboo grows 30 inches every day.  It's 20 feet tall, which is 20 * 12 = 240 inches.  

It needs to grow 600 inches total, so that means it needs to grow 600 - 240 = 360 more inches.

If it grows 30 inches a day, it'll take 360 / 30 = 12 days. 


**Answer:** 12 days 
"
"Okay, so James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs. That means each dog has one toy. Then 8 more dogs come, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.  He needs to buy more toys for all of them!

After he buys some, there are twice as many dogs as before, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.  He needs to buy even more toys!

Then, 3 dogs leave, so there are 24 - 3 = 21 dogs left.  

James needs 21 toys in total. 



"
"Okay, so Dylan put in 2/5 of the money, which is (2/5) * $1200 = $480.  

That leaves $1200 - $480 = $720 for Frances and Skyler.

Frances then put in 2/3 of what was left, so she put in (2/3) * $720 = $480.

That means Skyler put in $720 - $480 = $240. 


**Answer:** $240 
"
"Okay, so Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44.  That means together they have 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

**Answer:** 36 
"
"Okay, so Lorie makes $10 an hour and Karen makes twice as much. That means Karen makes $20 an hour.

If Karen works 3 hours a day, she makes $20 * 3 = $60 each day.

Over two days, she'd make $60 * 2 = $120. 


"
"If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, that means each potato makes 6 hash browns (36 / 6 = 6).  

So, with 96 potatoes, you could make 576 hash browns (96 * 6 = 576). 


576 
"
"Okay, so there are 9 people in the elevator, and each adult weighs 80 kg. That means the adults together weigh 8 * 80 = 640 kg.  

Then you add Jack, who weighs 80 kg too, so that's 640 + 80 = 720 kg total.

The elevator can only hold 700 kg, so they're over by 720 - 700 = 20 kg. 



"
"Okay, so Katarina has 5 fewer cookies than Max.  Since Katarina has 68 cookies, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, so he has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so she has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Finally, to find the total, we add up everyone's cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies. 



"
"Okay, so the dress got longer by 50% of its original size, and then they added 20cm of lace.  That means the original size plus 50% of the original size plus 20cm equals 140cm.

Let's say the original size was 'x'.  So we have:

x + 0.50x + 20 = 140

Combining like terms:

1.50x + 20 = 140

Subtracting 20 from both sides:

1.50x = 120

Dividing both sides by 1.50:

x = 80


The original dress was **80cm** long. 
"
"Okay, so Chris mows the whole lawn in an hour when he's slow, which is 60 minutes.  When he's fast, it takes him 40 minutes.

If he does half the lawn slow and half fast, let's figure out how long each half takes:

* Slow half: 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes
* Fast half: 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

Now add those times together: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes


**Answer: 50 minutes** 
"
"They walked 6 minutes to the library and 13 minutes to the fire station, so that's 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

"
"Okay, so she buys apples for $4.  Bananas cost $2 per kilo and she buys 2 kilos, so that's $2 x 2 = $4. Oranges are $3 per kilo and she buys 2 kilos, so that's $3 x 2 = $6.  

To find the total, we add it all up: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14 


"
"Okay, so Greta baked 30 cookies and Celinda baked twice as many, which is 60 cookies.  

Together they baked 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

80 
"
"Okay, so there's a twin and a triplet. The twin is 7 years older than the triplet.  Together they are 44 years old.  

Let's say the triplet is 't' years old. The twin would be 't + 7' years old.

Adding up all their ages, we get: t + t + t + (t + 7) + (t + 7) = 44

That simplifies to: 5t + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides: 5t = 30

Dividing both sides by 5: t = 6

So the triplet is 6 years old.  The twin is 7 years older, so the twin is 13 years old. 




"
"Okay, so John has 20 minutes of math, 40 minutes of reading, and 20 minutes of history. That's 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes of homework.

He has 3 hours until dinner, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

If he has 180 minutes until dinner and 80 minutes of homework, he has 180 - 80 = 100 minutes to nap. 


**Answer: 100**"
"Okay, so Manolo bought 5 lollipops for $0.40 each, which is $2.00.  That means the 4 candies cost $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.  

Each candy costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Ten lollipops would cost $0.40 x 10 = $4.00.

Ten candies would cost $0.30 x 10 = $3.00.

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies would cost $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00  




"
"Okay, so Rong saves 20 coins each month, and Neil saves 2/5 more than Rong.  That means Neil saves 2/5 * 20 coins = 8 more coins each month.

So Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins each month.

Over a year, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months = 240 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months = 336 coins each year.

After ten years, Rong will have saved 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

And Neil will have saved 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they'll have saved 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.




"
"Okay, so John's dog needs two vaccines at $20 each, so that's $40 right there.  The heartworm check is 60% of the whole bill, which means it costs 60 out of every 100 dollars.  

If the whole bill is $x$, the heartworm check costs 0.60x.  So, the total bill is $40 + 0.60x = x$.  

Let's solve for x!  

First, subtract $40 from both sides: 0.60x = x - $40

Then, subtract 0.60x from both sides: 0 = 0.40x - $40

Add $40 to both sides: $40 = 0.40x

Finally, divide both sides by 0.40: x = $100

John brought $125 and the bill was $100, so he has $125 - $100 = $25 left. 



**Answer:** $25 
"
"Okay, so a crate has 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.  

* Bananas cost twice as much as an apple, and an apple costs $0.50, so a banana costs $1.00.
* Oranges cost three times as much as a banana, so an orange costs $3.00.

Now let's add up the cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

Finally, add up the cost of all the fruits: $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00


**So the crate of fruit costs $32.00** 
"
"Okay, so Brittany's comforter has squares that are 1 foot by 1 foot.  

* She has 14 red squares.
* She has 4 more blue squares than red, so she has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
* She has 6 more green squares than blue, so she has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
* She has 12 fewer white squares than green, so she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

To find the total area, we add up all the squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the comforter is 68 square feet big! 


"
"Okay, so there are 8 high chairs and Mia has 5 times as many regular chairs, so she has 8 * 5 = 40 regular chairs.  

That means she has a total of 40 + 8 = 48 chairs.

So she needs to get 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs. 


**9**

"Okay, so there are 50 deer and half of them are bucks, which is 25 bucks.  Then, 20% of those bucks have 8 points.  That means 25 bucks * 0.20 = 5 bucks have 8 points. 


"
"Okay, so Adam has 50 points. Betty did better than him and got 30% more points, so she got 50 times 0.30 which is 15 more points. That means Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 fewer points than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta got 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 35 times 3 = 105 points.

Adding up all their points, we get 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

To go on the trip, they need 400 points, so they are missing 400 - 255 = 145 points.

"Okay, so Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than that, so it can haul 4,800 pounds.  

Together, Gissela and Gordy can haul 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

Since all three trucks together can haul 11,600 pounds, Gary's truck must haul 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds. 


**Answer: Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.**

"Okay, so there are 8 guys and 6 girls, and each guy ate one more dumpling than each girl.  The girls each ate 3 dumplings, so the guys each ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

The girls ate a total of 6 girls * 3 dumplings/girl = 18 dumplings.

The guys ate a total of 8 guys * 4 dumplings/guy = 32 dumplings.

That means Larry cooked 18 + 32 = 50 dumplings in all!

"Okay, so Marcus bought 5 croissants at $3 each, which is $15. Then he got 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, so that's $10.  He also got 3 mini quiches at $4 each, which is $12. And finally, he bought 13 blueberry muffins at $1 each, so that's $13.

To find the total before the discount, we add all that up: $15 + $10 + $12 + $13 = $50.

His discount is 10% of $50, which is $5.

So, his final bill is $50 - $5 = $45.

"
"Okay, so James paid $20 to go pick blueberries and then $1.50 for each pound of the 30 pounds he picked. That means he spent $20 + ($1.50 x 30) = $20 + $45 = $65.

If he bought them at the store for $2.50 a pound, that would be $2.50 x 30 = $75.

He saved $75 - $65 = $10! 


**Answer:** 10 
"
"Okay, so they wanted to buy 500 computers at $700 each, which is 500 * 700 = $350,000.

But then the computers got more expensive!  They went up by 10% of $700, which is $70 more.  So each computer cost $770 now.

To find the total cost, we multiply the new price by the number of computers: $770 * 500 = $385,000. 


**Answer: $385,000** 
"
"Okay, so the omelet has 6 eggs, and each egg has 75 calories, so that's 6 * 75 = 450 calories from the eggs.

The cheese has 120 calories per ounce, and there are 2 ounces, so that's 120 * 2 = 240 calories.

The ham also has 2 ounces, and each ounce has 40 calories, so that's 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

Finally, we add all the calories together: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories! 



**770**
"
"Okay, so a pencil costs $0.50 and an eraser costs $0.25.  

If you buy 6 pencils, that's 6 times $0.50, which is $3.00.

And 8 erasers cost 8 times $0.25, which is $2.00.

So, the total cost is $3.00 plus $2.00, which is $5.00.

If you paid $10.00, your change would be $10.00 minus $5.00, which is $5.00. 


5.00

"Okay, so 100 people want the job, and only 30 get to interview.  Then, out of those 30, 20% get offered the job. That's 6 people.  And finally, a third of those 6 people take the job.  That means 2 people accept the job offer. 


"
"Goldy gave away 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, so she gave away a total of 7 sacks.  Since each sack has 25 kilograms of rice, she gave away 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms of rice.

"
"Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops this week, so that's 3 + 5 = 8 boxes. Last week she bought 4 boxes.  

To find out how many more boxes she bought this week, we subtract: 8 - 4 = 4

"
"Okay, so Helga taps really fast!  

When her arms are down, she taps 300 times with her right foot and 250 times with her left foot, which is a total of 550 taps per minute.

When her arms are up, she slows down to 200 taps per foot, so that's 400 taps per minute.

She dances for 5 minutes, and her arms are up for 2 of those minutes.  

So, she taps 550 times a minute for 3 minutes: 550 * 3 = 1650 taps

And she taps 400 times a minute for 2 minutes: 400 * 2 = 800 taps

If you add those together, she taps a total of 1650 + 800 = 2450 times! 




"
"Okay, so Ron's car would get messed up for $450 if he doesn't fix the pothole.  But if he fixes it himself, the city will fine him $120 and he'll need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each.  

That means he'll spend $75 on asphalt plus the $120 fine, for a total of $195.

If he fixes it, he saves $450 - $195 = $255! 


"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Start with the total chairs:** 170 normal chairs + 23 baby chairs = 193 chairs
* **Subtract the chairs that need repair:** 193 chairs - 20 normal chairs - 13 baby chairs = 160 chairs


The restaurant has **160** chairs left. 
"
"Okay, so Bryce and his four friends got five pizzas in total.  That's 5 pizzas times 12 slices each, which is 60 slices.

Bryce and two of his friends ate two-thirds of their two pizzas, which is 16 slices. The other two friends ate three-fourths of their two pizzas, which is 18 slices.

If they ate a total of 16 + 18 = 34 slices, then there are 60 - 34 = 26 slices left. 



**26** 
"
"Okay, so the cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog eats the same amount in 2/3 of that time, which is 20 minutes.  

Together, they take 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

To find the average, we divide the total time by the number of animals: 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes. 


**Answer: 25 minutes** 
"
"Okay, so Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long.  That's the same as 96 inches plus 4 inches, which is 100 inches.

We know Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  Let's say Bobby's shoe is 'x' inches long.  

So, we have the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90

Then, divide both sides by 9: x = 10


Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long. 
"
"Okay, so there are 64 student cars and each car has 4 windows. That means there are 64 * 4 = 256 windows on all the student cars. Hannah breaks a quarter of those, so she breaks 256 / 4 = 64 student car windows.

Then there are 32 teacher cars with 2 windows each, so there are 32 * 2 = 64 windows on all the teacher cars. Hannah breaks 3/4 of those, which is 64 * (3/4) = 48 teacher car windows.

In total, she breaks 64 + 48 = 112 windows. 



"
"Okay, so Candy has 60 blue spools (15 light blue + 45 dark blue) and 150 total spools.  To find the percentage of blue spools, we can do 60 divided by 150, which is 0.4.  Then we multiply that by 100 to get 40%. 


40% 
"
"Okay, so 5000 people started lining up.  By lunchtime, 2 out of every 5 people had voted. That's 2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people.

That means 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were still there.

Then, by 4:00, 2 out of every 3 of those people voted. So, that's (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

In total, 2000 + 2000 = 4000 people voted.

That means 5000 - 4000 = 1000 people didn't vote by 4:00.

"Parker chews 4 pieces of gum every day.  If a pack has 15 pieces, he'll need to figure out how many packs he needs for 30 days.  

So, he needs 4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces of gum.

Then, he divides that by how many pieces are in a pack: 120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs.

"
"Okay, so each sleeve makes 8 s'mores and there are 3 sleeves in a box.  

First, we need to figure out how many s'mores everyone wants: 9 kids times 2 s'mores each is 18 s'mores, and 6 adults times 1 s'more each is 6 s'mores. That means they need 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores in total.

Since each sleeve makes 8 s'mores, they'll need 24 / 8 = 3 sleeves.  

And since there are 3 sleeves in a box, they need 3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box of graham crackers. 



**Answer: 1** 
"
"Okay, so Dora is 15. Her dad is eight more than twice her age, so he's (15 * 2) + 8 = 38 years old.  Her mom is four years younger than her dad, so she's 38 - 4 = 34 years old.  

To find their total age, we add them up: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years old.

"Okay, so Cindy has two books that weigh 2 pounds each, which is 2 * 2 = 4 pounds total.  Her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it's 3 * 2 = 6 pounds.  

If you add all the weights together, it's 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds. 


17 
"
"Okay, so Candidate A got 20% of the votes.  Candidate B got 50% more than that, which is like adding half of A's votes to A's votes.  

Half of 20 is 10, so B got 20 + 10 = 30% of the votes.

Together, A and B got 20% + 30% = 50% of the votes.

That means Candidate C got the other 100% - 50% = 50% of the votes.

Since there were 100 voters, Candidate C got 50% of 100, which is 50 votes! 


"
"Okay, so Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer than Boris, which means Beck has 77 apples (100 - 23 = 77).

Then Boris gives Beck 10 apples, so now Beck has 87 apples (77 + 10 = 87).

Boris now has 90 apples (100 - 10 = 90).

That means Boris has 3 more apples than Beck (90 - 87 = 3).

"Okay, so Peter has 32 ounces of water.  

* He uses 12 ounces for the giant cubes (3 cubes * 4 ounces each).
* He uses 14 ounces for the medium cubes (7 cubes * 2 ounces each).
* He uses 4 ounces for the small cubes (8 cubes * 0.5 ounces each).

That means he uses a total of 30 ounces (12 + 14 + 4).

So he has 2 ounces of water left! 


"
"Okay, so Clara has 20 books and that's twice the number Steven has.  That means Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books.  Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so she has 10 + 6 = 16 books.  Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice. 


4 
"
"Okay, so a gallon jar costs $5 and a half-gallon jar costs $3 (because it's $2 less than a gallon).

She bought 10 gallon jars, so that's 10 * $5 = $50.

She also bought 16 half-gallon jars, so that's 16 * $3 = $48.

Adding those together, she spent $50 + $48 = $98 in total. 


"
"Okay, so there are 50 students total.  10 like to bake and 5 like basketball. That means 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 students like either video games or music.

We know twice as many like music as basketball, so 5 * 2 = 10 students like music.

That means 35 - 10 = 25 students like video games. 


**25** 
"
"Okay, so Jeremy saw 12 birds and scared away a third of them. That's 12 divided by 3, which is 4 birds.  

That means 12 minus 4 equals 8 birds were still there.

Then, 20 more birds came, so now there are 8 plus 20, which is 28 birds in the backyard. 


"
"Okay, so there are 80 students total and they're split into two classes. That means each class has 40 students.  

If 40% of the class are girls, that's 40 students * 0.40 = 16 girls.

To find out how many boys are in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total: 40 students - 16 girls = 24 boys.

"Okay, so Mark spent $5400 on the packs of cards.  He got a card worth $4000 and another worth $1000, so that's $5000 right there.  Then he had 30 more cards that were worth $50 each, so those were worth $1500.  That means he had a total of $6500 worth of cards!  If he made $6500 and spent $5400, his profit was $1100.

"Okay, so the first park costs $26 for each grown-up and $12 for each kid.  The second park costs $14 for each grown-up and $10 for each kid.  

Let's see...  

* **Park 1:** 2 grown-ups * $26 = $52  
   and 2 kids * $12 = $24.  That's $52 + $24 = $76 total.

* **Park 2:** 2 grown-ups * $14 = $28
   and 2 kids * $10 = $20. That's $28 + $20 = $48 total.

If they go to Park 2, they'll save $76 - $48 = $28! 


"
"Okay, so he saves $0.10 on each tomato because the new vendor sells them for $0.40 instead of $0.50.  

Since he sells 500 tomatoes a day, he saves $0.10 * 500 = $50 each day.

Over a week, that's $50/day * 7 days/week = $350.

"Okay, so they have 54 students and want to put them into groups of 9.  If they need 12 groups, they need to make more groups.  

Let's see... 12 groups times 9 students each is 108 students.  That means they need 54 more students!

To figure out how many more groups they need, they need to divide 54 students by 9 students per group. That's 6 more groups!

"
"Okay, so Candy rents out 60 chairs each weekday and 100 chairs each weekend day.  

There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week, so that's:

* Weekday rentals: 60 chairs/day * 5 days/week = 300 chairs/week
* Weekend rentals: 100 chairs/day * 2 days/week = 200 chairs/week

That means she rents out a total of 300 + 200 = 500 chairs each week.

In a month with 4 weeks, she rents out 500 chairs/week * 4 weeks/month = 2000 chairs.

Over two months, she rents out 2000 chairs/month * 2 months = 4000 chairs.

"Okay, so Gunther had 48 bananas. Arnold, the sneaky chimp, took half, which is 24 bananas.  That left Gunther with 48 - 24 = 24 bananas.

Then Gunther added 25 more, so he had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.  

Arnold stole another 12, so Gunther had 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

Finally, Gunther added 6 more, making a total of 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.


**Answer:** 43 
"
"Okay, so there are 4 roommates and the bill is $100 each month.  To find out how much each person pays each month, we divide the total bill by the number of roommates: $100 / 5 people = $20.

Then, to find out how much each person pays in a whole year, we multiply that monthly cost by 12 months: $20 * 12 = $240. 


So each roommate pays $240 per year for electricity.

"Okay, so Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 big stickers.  She trades 90% of her small stickers for big buttons, which is 27 small stickers.  Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.  

Then she trades those 27 small buttons for 9 big buttons (because 3 small buttons equal 1 big button).

Next, she trades half of her big stickers for more big buttons, which is 20 big stickers. That means she gets 20 more big buttons.

Finally, she trades the rest of her big stickers for small stickers.  She had 40 big stickers and traded 20, so she has 20 left.  Those 20 big stickers are worth 60 small stickers.

So, she has 27 small buttons + 9 big buttons + 20 big buttons = 56 buttons in total! 



"
"Okay, so Joey played 2 games on Monday, 1 on Friday, and double that on Saturday.  

Double Monday's games is 2 times 2, which is 4 games.

"
"Okay, so there are 33 people on the council and twice as many voted for the new rule as against it.  

If 'x' is the number of votes against it, then there are 2x votes for it.  

That means x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms, we get 3x = 33

Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 11.

So, 2x votes were for the rule, which is 2 * 11 = 22 votes.

"Okay, so Krissa needs to figure out how many shirts to order.  

* There are 11 kids who need extra-small shirts.
* Twice as many need small shirts, so that's 11 times 2, which is 22 kids.
* Four fewer kids need medium shirts than small shirts, so that's 22 - 4 = 18 kids.
* Half as many kids need large shirts as medium shirts, so that's 18 / 2 = 9 kids.
* Six more kids need extra-large shirts than large shirts, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 kids.

To find the total, add up all the sizes: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts.

"Okay, so there's a 5% discount on a bag that costs $140.  To find out how much it costs after the discount, we need to figure out how much the discount is first.  

Five percent of $140 is the same as (5/100) * $140, which is $7.  

Then we subtract that discount from the original price: $140 - $7 = $133.

"Okay, so 20% of the 50 people like horse #2, which is 10 people.  That means 50 - 10 = 40 people like other horses.

60% of those 40 people like horse #7, so that's (60/100) * 40 = 24 people.

That leaves 40 - 24 = 16 people who like horse #12. 


**16** 
"
"Okay, so if two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, that means there are 6 x 3 = 18 Pomeranians in total.  

Since 18 Pomeranians make up two-thirds of all her puppies, we can figure out the total number of puppies.  If two-thirds is 18, then one-third is 18 / 2 = 9.  So, Jana has 9 x 3 = 27 puppies! 



"
"Okay, so Jayden has $70 from selling pictures. His sister Ava gives him half of her $90 allowance, which is $90 / 2 = $45.  

That means Jayden has $70 + $45 = $115 in total.

The camera costs $200, so he still needs $200 - $115 = $85. 


"
"Okay, so the second house needs some number of shingles, let's say 'x'.  The first house needs half as many as the second, which is x/2.  The third house needs twice as many as the first, so that's 2*(x/2) which is just x.

Together, they need 250 cases.  So, x/2 + x + x = 250

That's the same as 2.5x = 250

To find out how many shingles the third house needs, we need to figure out what x is.  If 2.5x = 250, then x = 100.

Since the third house needs the same number of shingles as the second house, the third house needs 100 cases.

If he has 200 bananas, we need to find 45% of that: 200 * 0.45 = 90 pears.

So he has 200 bananas + 90 pears = 290 fruits total.

"Okay, so Tanya makes $15 for every hour she teaches. On Monday, she taught for 5 hours, so she made 5 * $15 = $75.  She also gets an extra $5 because she taught more than 3 classes that day. So Monday she made $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she taught for 2 hours, so she made 2 * $15 = $30.

In total, she made $80 + $30 = $110 for the two days.

"Okay, so Jack drives 150 miles to the museum and then 150 miles back home, right?  That's 300 miles total.  

If he drives 75 miles per hour, it takes him 300 miles / 75 miles per hour = 4 hours to drive there and back.

Then he spends 6 hours at the museum.  

So, he's gone for 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours.

"Okay, so Henry needs wheels for 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.  Cars need 4 wheels each and motorcycles need 2.  

Let's see, that's 57 times 4 equals 228 wheels for the cars.  And 73 times 2 is 146 wheels for the motorcycles.

Adding those together, he needs 228 plus 146, which is 374 wheels in total.

If he starts with 650 wheels, he'll have 650 minus 374, which is 276 wheels left over.

"Okay, so if the laptop costs $1000 and you get 20% off, that means you save 20% of $1000.  

To find out how much you save, you can do: $1000 x 0.20 = $200

Then, you subtract that amount from the original price: $1000 - $200 = $800


You would have to pay $800 for the laptop. 
"
"Okay, so Mike has 600 movies. A third of them are in series, which means 600 / 3 = 200 movies are in series.  He can get those for cheaper, just $6 each instead of $10.

That means he'll spend 200 * $6 = $1200 on the series movies.

The other 600 - 200 = 400 movies aren't in series.  40% of those are old movies, so that's 400 * 0.40 = 160 old movies.

Old movies cost $5 each, so those will cost 160 * $5 = $800.

The rest of the movies are new and cost $10 each, so those will cost 400 - 160 = 240 movies * $10 = $2400.

Finally, add up all the costs: $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.

"Okay, so Winston got 6 pounds of peaches at $2.00 a pound, which is 6 times 2, so that's $12.00.  Then he got 8 pounds of plums at $1.00 a pound, so that's 8 times 1, which is $8.00.  And he got 6 pounds of apricots at $3.00 a pound, so that's 6 times 3, which is $18.00.  

To find out how much he spent in total, we add all that up: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00 




"
"Okay, so the Llesis family drove and hiked to their vacation spot. They drove 50 miles per hour and hiked 5 miles per hour slower than half their driving speed.  

First, let's figure out how fast they hiked. Half their driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.  Then, we subtract 5 miles per hour: 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, so they hiked 1.5 hours * 20 miles per hour = 30 miles.

They drove for 6 hours total minus the 1.5 hours they hiked, which is 6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours.

They drove 4.5 hours at 50 miles per hour, so they drove 4.5 hours * 50 miles per hour = 225 miles.

Finally, to find the total distance, we add the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.



**Answer: 255**"
"Okay, so Ava and Emma are playing a video game.  

* Ava gets 10 points for each enemy she jumps on, 5 points for each berry she picks up, and 30 points for every second left on the timer.
* Emma gets the same points for enemies, berries, and time.

We know Ava jumped on 8 more enemies than Emma and got 3 more berries. But Ava also finished 4 seconds slower.

To figure out the difference in their scores, we need to think about how many more points each thing is worth:

* **Enemies:** Ava gets 80 more points (8 enemies * 10 points/enemy = 80 points)
* **Berries:** Ava gets 15 more points (3 berries * 5 points/berry = 15 points)
* **Timer:** Ava gets 120 *fewer* points (-4 seconds * 30 points/second = -120 points)

So, to find the total difference, we add those up: 80 + 15 - 120 = -25


**Answer:** -25 
"
"Okay, so they got four pizzas for $64 total. Two of them cost $30.  That means the other two pizzas cost $64 - $30 = $34.  Since the two cheaper pizzas cost the same, each one must have cost $34 / 2 = $17. 


**Answer:** $17 
"
"Okay, so they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, which is 3 times 5, which is 15 times.  Then they ride twice as much on two other days, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 times each day.  Over two days, that's 6 times 2, which is 12 times.  

If you add those together, 15 plus 12 is 27 times! 


**27** 
"
"Okay, so Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.  That means he had 7 fish in total.  He bought 17 more fish, and now he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  

Let's think about it: if he bought some white fish, he must have also bought some orange fish.  

To figure out how many white fish he bought, we need to think about how many orange fish he has now.  Since he has twice as many orange fish as white fish, let's say he bought 'w' white fish. That means he bought '2w' orange fish.

We know he bought 17 fish total, so:

w + 2w = 17

That means 3w = 17.  

If we divide both sides by 3, we get w = 5.67.  

Since you can't buy parts of fish, Bob must have bought 5 white fish. 



**Answer:** 5 
"
"Okay, so Andy's car goes 10 miles on one gallon of gas.  

He drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home, so that's 10 miles each day.

Over a week, that's 10 miles a day times 5 days a week, which is 50 miles.

If his car uses 1 gallon for every 10 miles, he uses 5 gallons of gas each week.

Gas costs $3 a gallon, so he spends 5 gallons times $3 a gallon, which is $15 each week. 


**Answer:** $15 
"
"Okay, so Carrie had ten twenties, which is 10 * $20 = $200.  She also had 140 quarters, which is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

She spent 3/5 of her twenties, so that's (3/5) * $200 = $120.

In total, she spent $120 + $35 = $155. 


"
"Okay, so Ricardo has 5 tomato plants that each make 22 tomatoes. That's 5 times 22, which is 110 tomatoes.  

He also has 8 eggplant plants that each make 4 eggplants.  So that's 8 times 4, which is 32 eggplants.

If you add the tomatoes and eggplants together, he'll have 110 + 32 = 142 fruits! 


"
"Okay, so Samwell sold 40 TVs in total.  

*  A quarter of the TVs were smart TVs, so that's 40 / 4 = 10 smart TVs.
*  An eighth of the TVs were analog TVs, so that's 40 / 8 = 5 analog TVs.

*  To find out how many OLED TVs they sold, we add the smart and analog sales together: 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

*  Then we subtract that from the total number of TVs: 40 - 15 = 25 OLED TVs!




**Answer: 25** 
"
"Okay, so the trip costs $300 and the school is paying for half of it. That means they're paying $150.  John already has $50, so he still needs $150 - $50 = $100 more. 


"
"Okay, so the house needs to be at least 32 degrees to keep the pipes from freezing.  It's 45 degrees during the day, but 33 degrees colder at night.  That means it'll be 45 - 33 = 12 degrees at night.

Each log of wood makes the house 5 degrees warmer.  To get to 32 degrees, we need to warm it up by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

So, Carson needs to burn 20 / 5 = 4 logs. 



"
"Okay, so there are 10 groups of 9 people each.  That means 3 out of every 5 groups brought back seashells.  Since 3 out of 5 of the 10 groups is 6 groups, and each group brought back 2 seashells, they brought back a total of 6 times 2, which is 12 seashells! 


"
"Okay, so there are 172 people on the train at first. Then 47 get off, so that's 172 - 47 = 125 people.  

Then 13 more people get on, so now there are 125 + 13 = 138 people.

After that, 38 people get off, so there are 138 - 38 = 100 people left on the train. 


"
"Damien finds 10 bottle caps every day, and each cap is worth $0.25, so he makes $2.50 each day (10 x $0.25 = $2.50).  

If there are 30 days in a month, he makes $75.00 in a month ($2.50 x 30 = $75.00). 


"
"Okay, so Jamie makes $20 an hour for the first 8 hours she works. That means she made $20 * 8 = $160.

Then she worked 3 more hours, and for those she gets paid $20 * 1.50 = $30 an hour.  So she made $30 * 3 = $90 for those extra hours.

In total, she made $160 + $90 = $250. 


"
"Okay, so there are 12 female lions.  The problem says there are half as many male lions, so there are 12 / 2 = 6 male lions.  Then you add the 14 cubs: 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 lions! 


32 
"
"Okay, so the jeans were $40 but they were 25% off.  That means they were $10 cheaper!  

The jeans cost $40 - $10 = $30.

If Mike pays with a $50 bill, he'll have $50 - $30 = $20 left over. 


"
"Okay, so the company starts with 200 workers and gets 20 more each month for three months.  That means they have 200 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 260 workers after three months.

Each worker makes $4000 a month, so they pay 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000  in total. 


"
"Okay, so they sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, and that song is 150 seconds long.  That means they sing it for 150 * 2 = 300 seconds.  

Then they sing ""Jingle Bells"" which is 240 seconds long.

Adding those times together, 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.


540

"Okay, so Billy starts making $10 an hour, then gets a raise to $10.50, and then another to $11.50.  Sally starts at $10.50 an hour.  

If they both work 20 hours, Billy will make $11.50 x 20 = $230.

Sally will make $10.50 x 20 = $210.

Billy makes $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally.

"Okay, so Pierson got 278 points. Nikita got 11 more than half of Pierson's score.  

First, let's find half of Pierson's score: 278 / 2 = 139

Then, add 11 to that to find Nikita's score: 139 + 11 = 150

Finally, add Pierson's score and Nikita's score together: 278 + 150 = 428

"
"Okay, so there are 40 classes with 25 students each, which means there are 40 * 25 = 1000 students.  

There are also 3 teachers per class, so there are 40 * 3 = 120 teachers.

Each student plants one tree, so that's 1000 trees.

Each teacher plants two trees, so that's 120 * 2 = 240 trees.

In total, they'll plant 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees! 



"
"Okay, so Bubbles has 3 puppies + 5 koalas + 2 zebras + 4 frogs = 14 stuffed animals in total.  

She wants 30% of her animals to be goats.  To figure that out, we can do 30/100 times 14, which is 4.2.  

Since you can't have part of a goat, she needs to buy 5 goats! 


**5** 
"
"Okay, so Kris plays for half an hour each day for two weeks. That's 14 days, so she plays for 14 times half an hour, which is 7 hours. Then she plays for 2 hours each day for a whole week, which is 7 days times 2 hours, so that's 14 more hours.  

In total, she's played 7 + 14 = 21 hours.  To get to 30 hours, she needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 more hours. 



"
"Okay, so the first car is going 60 miles per hour and the second car is going 70 miles per hour.  

In two hours, the first car will have driven 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car will have driven 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

That means the second car is 140 - 120 = 20 miles ahead of the first car. 


**20** 
"
"Okay, so the diamond cost $600 and the gold cost $300, so that's $600 + $300 = $900 for the ring itself.  

Then he pays 30% extra, which is like adding 30 cents for every dollar.  So 30% of $900 is $270.

Finally, he pays $900 + $270 = $1170 for the ring. 


"
"Okay, so there are 340 third graders who passed, 40 fourth graders who passed, and we need to figure out the fifth grade passes.  

The fifth graders did twice as good as the fourth graders, so that's 40 * 2 = 80 fifth graders who passed.

Now let's add up all the passes: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460 students passed.

And there are 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 students total.

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the passes by the total students: 460 / 1000 = 0.46.

That means the overall pass rate is 46%. 



"
"Okay, so Milo needs 12 chips for every square inch of his mosaic.  His mosaic is going to be 3 inches tall, so that's 3 inches * 12 chips/inch = 36 chips for the height.

He has two bags of chips, and each bag has 72 chips, so he has 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips total.

That means he has 144 chips - 36 chips = 108 chips left over.

Since he needs 12 chips for every inch, he can make his mosaic 108 chips / 12 chips/inch = 9 inches long! 



"
"Okay, so there were 10 quarts left after the party.  

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so they drank a total of 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Sixteen students drank 2 quarts each, so they drank a total of 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

That means everyone drank 6 + 32 = 38 quarts in total.

If there are 10 quarts left, then there must have been 10 + 38 = 48 quarts at the beginning.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, there were 48 / 4 = 12 gallons at the beginning.

"Okay, so there are 10 students at the start.  Each month, the number doubles.  

* January: 10 * 2 = 20 students
* February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
* March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
* April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
* May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

That means there are 320 students at the end of May.  To find out how many *more* students joined, we subtract the starting number: 320 - 10 = 310

**Answer: 310** 


"
"Okay, so Felix made $105 all week helping kids get stuff out of trees.  He charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs.  To find out how many branches he climbed in total, we can divide his earnings by the price per branch: $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average by dividing the total branches by the number of days: 420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day. 



"
"Okay, so Rose picked a bunch of flowers!  Let's figure out how many petals are left.

* She started with 3 flowers that had 5 petals each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 petals.
* Then she got 4 flowers with 6 petals, so that's 4 * 6 = 24 petals.
* Next, she added 5 flowers with 4 petals, which is 5 * 4 = 20 petals.
* Finally, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals, so that's 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

That means she had a total of 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

But wait! She dropped one of each kind of flower, so she lost 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 petals.

So, she has 101 - 4 = 97 petals left in the vase. 



**Answer: 97**"
"Okay, so they started with 35 marshmallows and used 18 for their s'mores.  Then they lost 3, so that leaves them with 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows.  Since there are two of them, they can each have 14 / 2 = 7 more s'mores. 


"
"Okay, so Jack and his friends play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.  Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter, so he uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

His two worse friends each play for half as long, so they each play for 10 minutes per quarter. They each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters.

His best friend plays for 1.5 times as long, so he plays for 30 minutes per quarter and uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

In total, they use 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, they spend 68 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17.00. 




"
"Okay, so Tanya makes this scrub with salt, oil, stuff that smells good, some citrus peel, and sugar.  She fills a 10-ounce jar each time.  

She uses the same amount of citrus peel and the smell-good stuff, and the same amount of salt and sugar. She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as citrus peel.

Let's think about it:

* If she uses 'x' ounces of citrus peel, she also uses 'x' ounces of the smell-good stuff.
* She uses the same amount of salt and sugar, so that's also 'x' ounces each.
* Oil is twice the amount of salt, so she uses 2 * x = 2x ounces of oil.

Now we know all the amounts together have to equal 10 ounces:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

That's 5x = 10

To find out how much 'x' is, we divide both sides by 5: x = 2

So, she uses 2 ounces of citrus peel, 2 ounces of the smell-good stuff, 2 ounces of salt, 2 ounces of sugar.

And since oil is 2 times the salt, she uses 2 * 2 = 4 ounces of oil!



**Answer:** 4 
"
"Okay, so John bought 3 goats at $500 each, which is 3 * $500 = $1500.  Then he bought 2 cows at $1500 each, so that's 2 * $1500 = $3000.  

To find out how much he spent in total, we add those two amounts together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500. 


4500 
"
"He needs 63 cupcakes in total.  He has 8 chocolate and 40 toffee cupcakes, so that's 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes.  

He needs to buy 63 - 48 = 15 more cupcakes.

"
"Okay, so Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20. That means Joe has 40 cars.

He sells 20% of his cars, which is the same as selling 8 cars (because 20% of 40 is 8).

Then he gives away twice the number of cars he sold, so he gives away 8 times 2, which is 16 cars.

In total, Joe gave away 16 cars and sold 8 cars.  That means he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left. 



**Answer:** 16 
"
"Okay, so the charity made $175,000 total.  They got $50,000 from groups, so the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Then, to find out how much each student raised, we divide the total the students raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 students = $6,250 per student. 


"
"Okay, so Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.  The second day she walked for half that time, which is 8 hours / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time, we add the two days together: 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she walked for 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes. 


"
"Okay, so there were 50 cars when Hunter first got to school. Then, 20 more cars came, so there were 70 cars.  At lunch, half the cars left.  Half of 70 is 35, so 35 cars left. 


**35** 
"
"Okay, so John does 30 cycles of work each day, and each cycle has 5 tasks. That means he does 30 * 5 = 150 tasks every day.  

Since each task pays $1.20, he makes 150 * $1.20 = $180 each day.

If he works 7 days a week, he makes $180 * 7 = $1260 for the whole week. 


"
"Okay, so Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Julie scored 4 fewer than Sasha, so she scored 10 points.  

Then, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie scored in the first game, which is 10 - 6 = 4 points.

Sasha's total score for both games is 14 + 4 = 18 points. 


"
"Okay, so Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and each package has 11 tins, so that's 8 times 11 which is 88 tins of cat food.  

She also bought 6 packages of dog food with 6 tins each, so that's 6 times 6 which is 36 tins of dog food.

To find out how many more cat food tins she has, we subtract: 88 - 36 = 52

She has 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. 


"
"Okay, so Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a bunch of Magic Cards, a total of 341.  Smendrick has three times as many cards as PJ, and Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.  

Let's think about it step-by-step:

* If we let PJ have 'x' cards, Smendrick has 3x cards.
* Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

Together, they have all their cards: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Now we can solve for x:

* Combine the 'x's: 7x + 12 = 341
* Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329
* Divide both sides by 7: x = 47  (So PJ has 47 cards)

Finally, let's find out how many cards Becca has:

* Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.



Becca has 153 cards. 
"
"Okay, so Cindy had 5 green eggs.  She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, which is 5 times 2, or 10 blue eggs.  She had 1 less pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  Then she had 1/3 as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs! 




"
"Okay, so Milly has to pay to ship the book back.  

* Shipping for the weight is 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
* Shipping for the distance is 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
* The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Amazon will give her back 75% of the $32 she paid, which is $32 * 0.75 = $24.00

So, she loses $3.00 (shipping) - $24.00 (refund) = -$21.00

"Okay, so Mulan starts with $40 and gets $100 from her dad, which is $40 + $100 = $140.  

Then she buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's $30 x 2 = $60.  

She also buys a bag for $20, so she spends a total of $60 + $20 = $80.

Finally, she has $140 - $80 = $60 left.

"
"Okay, so Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars each month.  

* He makes 8,000 bars the first week.
* The second week, he makes half as much as the first week, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
* The third week, he makes three times the amount from the first week, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find out how many bars he makes in the fourth week, we need to add up the bars from the first three weeks and subtract that from his total for the month: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Then, 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.


**Answer:** Boris makes 14,000 bars in the fourth week. 
"
"Okay, so Britany makes 18 TikToks each week, and each one is 4 minutes long. That's 18 times 4, which is 72 minutes. 

She also spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is 2 times 60, so 120 minutes.  And she does her makeup for 15 minutes each day for 6 days, so that's 15 times 6, which is 90 minutes.

To find the total time she spends on TikTok each week, we add all that up: 72 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 282 minutes.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 282 times 4, which is 1128 minutes on TikTok each month. 


"
"Okay, so they charge $129 to hang 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.  

Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.  

That means she needs to pay extra for 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures.

* 2 extra mirrors cost 2 * $15 = $30
* 1 extra chandelier costs 1 * $15 = $15
* 10 extra pictures cost 10 * $15 = $150

So the extra cost is $30 + $15 + $150 = $195

Adding that to the original price, it'll cost her $129 + $195 = $324

"Okay, so Eva saved $20.  Anthony saved $10 more than Eva, so he saved $30.  Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, which is like adding 40% of $30 to it.  

40% of $30 is $12, so Roy saved $30 + $12 = $42. 


"
"Okay, so Pompei can lift a 1-inch mountain.  Saskay is way stronger and can lift a mountain 12 times taller than that, so Saskay can lift a 12-inch mountain.  Kagiyami is even stronger than Saskay, lifting a mountain 4 times taller than Saskay's, which is 48 inches.  Naruto is the strongest of them all, lifting a mountain 10 times taller than Kagiyami's, so Naruto can lift a mountain that's 480 inches tall!  

To figure out how tall that is in feet, we know there are 12 inches in a foot, so 480 inches divided by 12 inches per foot equals 40 feet.

"Mason bikes for 4 hours at 8 miles per hour, so he travels 4 * 8 = 32 miles.  Then he bikes another 6 hours and covers 6 * 8 = 48 miles.  In total, he bikes 32 + 48 = 80 miles. 


**80**"
"Okay, so if 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, that means one kangaroo takes 18 hours * 3 = 54 hours.

Since each turtle is half as fast as a kangaroo, it takes a turtle 54 hours * 2 = 108 hours to cross the highway.

If four turtles are traveling, it would take them 108 hours/turtle * 4 turtles = 432 hours.

"Okay, so Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory made 20 more than her, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.  Jada made twice as many as Rory, so she made 40 * 2 = 80 dishes.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes. 


"
"Okay, so Erika's new laptop will cost $400 after she trades in her old one.  She needs $50 more to buy it. She got $150 from her job and $80 from her mom.  

Let's add all that up: $400 + $150 + $80 = $630.

Then we subtract the $50 she still needs: $630 - $50 = $580.

So Erika has $580 in her purse. 


"
"Okay, so Adam has 3 big apples and each big apple has 5 slices, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 slices from the big apples.  

Then he has 5 small apples and each small apple has 3 slices, so that's 5 * 3 = 15 slices from the small apples.

That means he has a total of 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

If he eats 15 slices, he has 30 - 15 = 15 slices left. 



"
"Okay, so the farmer gets 5 liters of milk from each cow, and he has 3 cows. That means he gets 5 times 3, which is 15 liters of milk each day.  

He wants to get 25 liters, so he needs 25 minus 15, which is 10 more liters.  

If each cow gives 5 liters, he needs 10 divided by 5, which is 2 more cows! 


**Answer:** 2 
"
"Okay, so Patrick has three glue sticks.  

* The first one has 1/6 of it left, so that's (1/6) * 12 mm = 2 mm.
* The second one has 2/3 left, so that's (2/3) * 12 mm = 8 mm.
* The third one has 1/2 left, so that's (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm.

If we add all that up, 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm

"
"Okay, so Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800. That means the stuff he wants costs $10,800 in total. 

He has $5,000 from working and his brother gave him $200, so he has $5,200 saved up.

If he needs $10,800 and only has $5,200, he still needs $5,600 more. 


"
"Thea paid $80 because she used four $20 bills.  Since the hat cost $70, she got $10 back in change. 


"
"Okay, so Craig has $40 because he has two twenty dollar bills.  He spends $12 on squirt guns and $9 on water balloons. That means he spent a total of $21.  If he started with $40 and spent $21, he has $19 left. 


"
"Okay, so Jack has 60 dishes and twice as many dishes as socks. That means he has 60 dishes / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so he has 30 socks * 2 = 60 socks.

Peter also has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 60 dishes / 2 = 30 dishes.

Together, they have 30 socks + 60 socks = 90 socks.

And they have 60 dishes + 30 dishes = 90 dishes.

So, in total, they have 90 socks + 90 dishes = 180 socks and dishes. 



"
"Here's how to solve it:

*  There are 5 kids good at math only.
*  Then there are kids good at both math and English, but we don't know how many yet.
*  We know 8 kids are good at English only.

*  To find the total number good at math, we add the kids good at math only and the kids good at both: 5 + (kids good at both) = total kids good at math.

*  Since there are 20 kids total, we can figure out the kids good at both: 20 - 5 - 8 = 7 kids good at both.

*  Finally, add those up: 5 + 7 = 13 kids good at math!

"
"Okay, so the concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes.  

Each group needs 10 minutes (2 to get on, 6 to perform, and 2 to leave).  

If you take out the 10 minute break, that leaves 110 minutes.

Then, 110 minutes divided by 10 minutes per group means there's room for 11 groups! 


"
"Brenda gets $225 in interest each year because that's three-quarters of her $300.  

Over three years, she makes $225 x 3 = $675 in interest.

So, she'll have $300 + $675 = $975 in total. 


"
"Okay, so there are 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.  Half the white shirts have collars, which means 20 white shirts have collars. That leaves 20 white shirts without collars.

Then, 20 of the floral shirts have buttons, so 30 floral shirts don't have buttons.

If we subtract the number of white shirts without collars from the number of floral shirts without buttons, we get 30 - 20 = 10.


**Answer: 10** 
"
"Okay, so the farmer has 900 eggs and each tray holds 30 eggs.  That means he can fit 900 / 30 = 30 trays of eggs.

If he sells each tray for $2.50, he'll make 30 * $2.50 = $75.00 


**75.00** 
"
"Okay, so Mr. Smith has 55 goats on Farm X and 45 on Farm Y.  He sells 10 goats from Farm X, which leaves him with 55 - 10 = 45 goats there.

He sells twice as many from Farm Y, so he sells 45 * 2 = 90 goats from Farm Y.  That leaves him with 45 - 90 = -45 goats on Farm Y.  Wait, that doesn't make sense!  You can't have negative goats!  

Maybe there's a mistake in the problem? 


"
"He buys 2 pairs of shoes every month, so in a whole year he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes.  

If he spends $2640 on all those shoes, then each pair costs $2640 / 24 = $110. 


**110**
"
"Okay, so you buy 3 green baskets at $25 each, that's 3 times 25 which is 75 dollars.  

Then you buy 3 red baskets at $18 each, so that's 3 times 18 which is 54 dollars.  But you get 2 dollars off each red basket, so you save 3 times 2 which is 6 dollars.

That means the red baskets only cost 54 minus 6, which is 48 dollars.

Finally, you add the cost of the green baskets and the red baskets: 75 plus 48 is 123 dollars.




**Answer: 123**
"
"Okay, so there are 90 rooms and it takes 20 minutes to clean each one.  

To clean half the rooms, we first need to figure out how many rooms that is: 90 rooms / 2 = 45 rooms.

Then we multiply that number by the time it takes to clean each room: 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes.

Finally, we need to convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 900 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 15 hours.


**Answer: 15** 
"
"Okay, so they build 12 houses the first year.  Then they build three times that many the second year, which is 12 * 3 = 36 houses.  

That means after two years they've built 12 + 36 = 48 houses.

In the third year, they double the number of houses they've built, so they build 48 * 2 = 96 houses.


**Answer:** 96 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

*  Let's say my brother is 'b' years old.
*  I'm 3 years younger than him, so I'm 'b - 3' years old.
*  I'm 2 years older than my sister, so she's 'b - 3 - 2' or 'b - 5' years old.
*  My mom is one less than three times my brother's age, so she's '3b - 1' years old.

Now, add up everyone's ages:  b + (b - 3) + (b - 5) + (3b - 1) = 87

Combine like terms: 6b - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides: 6b = 96

Divide both sides by 6: b = 16

So my brother is 16.  Since I'm 3 years younger than him, I'm 16 - 3 = 13 years old.




**Answer:** 13 
"
"Okay, so Mr. Jackson needs 54 glue sticks in total (27 students times 2 glue sticks each).  If each pack has 8 glue sticks, he'll need to buy more than 6 packs (because 6 packs times 8 glue sticks is 48).  The only whole number of packs that will give him enough glue sticks is 7. 


"
"Okay, so the river starts with 4000 gallons of water going through it. After the rain, it doubles, which means there's 4000 times 2, or 8000 gallons. Then, on the third day, it goes up by another 6000 gallons.  So, we add that to the 8000 gallons, and we get 14000 gallons! 


**14000** 
"
"Okay, so there are 10 people sick at first.  Each day, they each get 6 more people sick.  

* On day 2, that's 10 people * 6 new people each = 60 new people sick. So now there are 10 + 60 = 70 people sick.
* On day 3, that's 70 people * 6 new people each = 420 new people sick.  So now there are 70 + 420 = 490 people sick.


There are **490** people sick after three days. 
"
"Okay, so Rafaela got $20 from each of the 40 customers, which is 40 times 20, which equals $800.  Julieta got 10% less than Rafaela, so we need to figure out what 10% of $800 is. That's 800 times 0.10, which is $80.  So Julieta made $800 minus $80, which is $720.  Together they made $800 plus $720, which is $1520. 


"
"Okay, so Jennifer had 12 oranges.  She gave 3 daughters 2 oranges each, which is 3 times 2, so that's 6 oranges. Then her son got 3 oranges.  That means she gave away a total of 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.  

If she started with 12 and gave away 9, she has 12 - 9 = 3 oranges left. 


3 
"
"Okay, so Claire gets one badge a month. Amber takes twice as long, so she gets one badge every two months. Wendy gets three badges for every one Claire gets.

In a year, Claire gets 12 badges (12 months x 1 badge/month). Amber gets 6 badges (12 months / 2 months/badge = 6 badges). Wendy gets 36 badges (12 months x 3 badges/month).

Wendy gets 30 more badges than Amber (36 badges - 6 badges = 30 badges). 



"
"Okay, so Paige bakes 2 loaves of banana bread every hour.  Each loaf has 8 slices, so she makes 2 * 8 = 16 slices per hour.

She bakes for 5 hours, so she makes 16 * 5 = 80 slices in total.

If each slice sells for 50 cents, she makes 80 * $0.50 = $40.00 


**$40.00** 
"
"Okay, so Gretchen has 70 gold coins and 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  That means she has 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.  

To find the total, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins: 70 + 40 = 110 coins. 


"
"Okay, so Mr. George bought 600 burritos.  There are 50 kids in the class, and each kid got 10 burritos, which is 500 burritos right there.  Then Mr. George ate 20.  That means they ate a total of 520 burritos.  If they started with 600, that means there are 80 burritos left over. 


80 
"
"Okay, so there are 12 red cars.  They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

Then they have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so that's 10 * 3 = 30 blue cars.

If there are 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 red, green, and blue cars, and there are 75 cars total, then there must be 75 - 52 = 23 yellow cars. 


**Answer: 23** 
"
"Okay, so Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books total.  Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.  

Let's think about it this way: if Anne had 12 more books, she'd have the same as Fawn.  

Since Sofie has 25 more than Anne, that means Fawn must have a lot of books!  

Let's try some numbers. If Fawn has 28 books, then Anne has 16 (28 - 12), and Sofie has 41 (16 + 25).  

That adds up to 85! 


**Answer:** Fawn has 28 books. 
"
"Okay, so Daisy bought 5 pounds of potatoes. The sweet potatoes weighed twice as much, so they weighed 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.  The carrots weighed 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes, so they weighed 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. 


7 
"
"Okay, so Greg needs 120 jello cups 'cause there are 30 kids and each kid gets 4 cups.  

Each box makes 10 cups, so he needs 12 boxes of jello (120 cups / 10 cups per box = 12 boxes).

If each box costs $1.25, he'll spend $15.00 total (12 boxes * $1.25 per box = $15.00). 


"
"Okay, so the seller bought 5 phones at $700 each. That means the phones cost 5 times $700, which is $3500.  

The seller paid with $4000, so to find out how much change they get back, we subtract the cost of the phones from the amount they paid: $4000 - $3500 = $500. 


The seller will get $500 back. 
"
"Okay, so Madeline and Keenan spend $400 on groceries each month.  That means they spend $400 / 4 weeks = $100 each week. Madeline pays 60% of the cost, so she pays $100 * 0.60 = $60 each week.  

That means Keenan pays $100 - $60 = $40 each week. 


**Answer:** $40 
"
"Okay, so Tobias ate 2/5 of the pizza the first day, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 pieces.  

Then he ate 10 more on the second day. That means he ate a total of 24 + 10 = 34 pieces.

After that, he ate 7/13 of the rest of the pizza, which is (7/13) * 36 = 14 pieces.

So, in total, Tobias ate 34 + 14 = 48 pieces. 




"
"Okay, so seven bottles of soda cost $21.00, which means one bottle costs $3.00.  

Four bottles of water cost $8.00, so one bottle of water costs $2.00.

David wants 3 sodas, so that's $3.00 x 3 = $9.00

He also wants 2 waters, so that's $2.00 x 2 = $4.00

All together, that's $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00 




**Answer:** $13.00 
"
"Okay, so David has $12.48 and each bolt costs $0.03.  

To find out how much he spends, we multiply the number of bolts by the price per bolt: 16 bolts * $0.03/bolt = $0.48

Then, we subtract that amount from his starting money: $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00


So David has $12.00 left.

"Okay, so Paul starts with 52 marbles. His friend gives him 28 more, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.  Then he loses 1/4 of his marbles, which is the same as 80 divided by 4, which is 20 marbles.  That means he has 80 - 20 = 60 marbles left. 


**Answer:** 60 
"
"Okay, so Amy gets 80% of the multiple choice right, which is 8 questions out of 10.  

She gets 90% of the true/false right, so that's 18 questions out of 20.

And she gets 60% of the long answer questions right, which is 3 questions out of 5.  Since those are worth 5 points each, that's 15 points.

Adding it all up, she gets 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points!

"
"Okay, so Isaias wants to make $2000 selling chickens.  He's selling each chicken for $50. He has 300 chickens and is selling 3/5 of them. 

First, let's figure out how many chickens he's selling: 300 chickens * (3/5) = 180 chickens.

Then, let's see how much money he'll make selling them all: 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.

But he wants to make a profit of $2000, so we need to figure out how much he spent on the chickens: $9000 - $2000 = $7000.




**Answer:** $7000 
"
"Okay, so Julie sold 14 glasses and the boys sold the rest, which is 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.  Since they split those evenly, Micah sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses.  

Julie sold 14 - 9 = 5 more glasses than Micah. 


5 
"
"Okay, so Iris spent $400 on her hair.  Her manicure cost 1/4 of that, so it was $400 / 4 = $100.  

Then her pedicure cost 3/4 of the price of her manicure, which is $100 * (3/4) = $75.

To find out how much she spent in total, we add it all up: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575 


"
"Okay, so Sarah sells her 20-meter rope for $2 per meter, which means she makes $40.  She uses that money to buy a new rope that costs $1.50 per meter.  Since the new rope is also 20 meters long, it costs her $30.  If she takes the $40 she made and spends $30 on the new rope, she'll have $10 left over. 


"
"Okay, so Melanie will be 18 in 10 years. That means she's 8 years old now.  

We want to know when she'll be three times her age now, which is 8 times 3 = 24 years old.

So, we need to figure out how many years it takes for her to get from 8 to 24.  That's 24 - 8 = 16 years. 


**Answer:** 16 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Bacon cost: $10 total for 5 packs, so each pack is $10 / 5 = $2.
* Chicken cost: Each pack is twice the price of bacon, so it's $2 * 2 = $4.  She has 6 packs of chicken, so that's $4 * 6 = $24.
* Strawberries cost: 3 packs * $4/pack = $12.
* Apples cost: Each pack is half the price of strawberries, so they cost $4 / 2 = $2. She has 7 packs of apples, so that's $2 * 7 = $14.

* Total cost: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

* Money left: $65 (budget) - $60 (spending) = $5.




**Answer: 5**
"
"Okay, so Elaina's last concert was 65 minutes long, and that included a 15-minute encore.  

That means the concert itself was 65 - 15 = 50 minutes long.

Since her last concert was twice as long as her normal concerts, her normal concerts must be 50 / 2 = 25 minutes long.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Start with the total toys:** Argo has 200 toys.
* **Add up the toys he gave away:** 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys
* **Subtract the toys he gave away from the starting amount:** 200 - 150 = 50 toys


Argo has 50 toys left. 
"
"Okay, so they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then twice that many on Friday.  

That means Friday they make 125 * 2 = 250 chimichangas.

Adding it all up: 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 chimichangas! 


"
"Okay, so the singer has 50 microphones and wants to make pairs.  That means he needs to find 25 pairs (50 / 2 = 25).  But, 20% of the microphones can't fit, which is 10 microphones (50 x 0.20 = 10).  

That leaves him with 40 microphones to make pairs with (50 - 10 = 40).  

So he can make 20 pairs (40 / 2 = 20). 


**Answer: 20** 
"
"Okay, so there are 6 birds in the bushes.  Then there are 2/3 of that number flying, which is like saying 2 out of every 3 birds from the bushes are flying.  That's 4 birds.  

Then there are 3 groups of 8 birds eating, so that's 3 times 8, which is 24 birds.

If you add all those birds together, you get 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 birds!

"Okay, so the orchids have 5 petals each and there are 5 orchids, so that's 5 times 5 which is 25 petals.  The daisies have 10 petals each and there are 4 daisies, so that's 10 times 4 which is 40 petals.  

To find out how many more petals the daisies have, we subtract the orchids' petals from the daisies' petals: 40 - 25 = 15.


15 
"
"Okay, so Mrs. Smith has 100 plants.  A quarter of them are inside, which is 25 plants. That leaves 75 plants outside.

Two-thirds of those outside plants are outdoor plants, so that's (2/3) * 75 = 50 plants.

That means 75 - 50 = 25 plants are flowering plants.

To find the percentage, we do 25 out of 100 times 100%, which is 25%! 


**25%** 
"
"Okay, so a whatchamacallit goes 121 meters per second.  That's super fast!  It's 11 times faster than a thingamabob.  

To find out how fast a thingamabob goes, we divide 121 by 11, which is 11 meters per second.

A whirligig is 5 times faster than a thingamabob, so we multiply 11 by 5 to get 55 meters per second.


**Answer: 55** 
"
"Okay, so Ellen spends $6 on salad and $3 on yogurt, right? That's $9 total for those two things.  Since she spends $11 altogether, the carrots must cost $11 - $9 = $2.  

If two carrots cost $2, then one carrot costs $2 / 2 = $1. 


"
"Okay, so Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days, that's 40 hours a week.  

Before his raise, he made $10 an hour, so he made $400 a week (40 hours * $10/hour).

Now he makes $12 an hour, so he makes $480 a week (40 hours * $12/hour). 


480 
"
"Okay, so Tasha made $80 total.  She got paid $6 for each lawn she mowed.  She mowed Joe's lawn some number of times, and then three times that many for Kamala and five times that many for Alba.  

To figure out how much she made from lemonade, we need to figure out how much she made mowing lawns first.  

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times.  That means she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

So, her total mowing money would be:

6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x) = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x

To find out how much she made from lemonade, we subtract her mowing money from her total earnings:

$80 - 54x = Lemonade money 


We don't know how many times she mowed Joe's lawn (x), so we can't figure out exactly how much she made from lemonade. 
"
"Okay, so Martin weighs 55 kg. Carl weighs 16 kg more than Martin, so Carl weighs 55 + 16 = 71 kg.  Christian weighs 8 kg more than Carl, so Christian weighs 71 + 8 = 79 kg.  Harry weighs 5 kg less than Christian, so Harry weighs 79 - 5 = 74 kg. 


74 
"
"Okay, so John rents his car out 10 times a month and each time it's for 3 hours. That means he rents it out for a total of 10 times * 3 hours = 30 hours.

He makes $25 for each hour, so in a month he makes 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

But he has to pay $500 for his car, so his profit is $750 - $500 = $250. 


"
"Okay, so Martha had 2 notebooks and bought 5 more, so now she has 7. Joseph had 3 times as many as Martha, so he had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.  That means Joseph has 6 - 7 = 4 more notebooks than Martha. 


"
"Okay, so Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 more than that, which is the same as 10 more miles.  

To find out how far Anis rowed, we add that extra 10 miles to Dijana's 50 miles: 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Finally, to find the total distance they rowed together, we add their distances: 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles. 


"
"Okay, so Susan had 100 cookies and her husband ate 4. That means there are 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.  

If she wants to give them equally to her 6 nephews, each nephew gets 96 / 6 = 16 cookies. 


"
"Okay, so Denise read 10 pages yesterday and Daniel read 13.  Today, Denise read 5 more than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Daniel didn't read any pages today.

That means Denise read a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Denise read 28 - 13 = 15 more pages than Daniel.

"Okay, so Calvin has enough soup for four grown-ups or eight kids.  His family has two kids and two grown-ups. That means they'll use up all the soup for dinner.  There won't be any left for lunch. 


"
"Okay, so William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each, which is 5 times $1.50, so that's $7.50.  Then he bought one ballpen for $0.50.  If you add those together, $7.50 plus $0.50, he spent $8.00 in all. 


"
"Okay, so Jo needs 2 yards of material for every 4 small masks.  To make 20 small masks, she'll need 20 / 4 = 5 sets of 2 yards. That's 5 * 2 = 10 yards of material for the small masks.

She needs 2.25 yards of material for every 3 large masks. To make 8 large masks, she'll need 8 / 3 = 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards. That's about 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards of material for the large masks.

In total, she needs 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards of material.

"Okay, so she saw 9 movies three times each, which means she saw them a total of 9 times 3 = 27 times.  If she spent $216 in total, then each ticket cost $216 divided by 27 times = $8. 


**8**"
"Okay, so Harold sleeps for 10 hours. He works 2 hours less than that, so he works 8 hours.  Then he walks his dog for an hour.  

That means he spends 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours doing those things.

If there are 24 hours in a day, he has 24 - 19 = 5 hours of free time. 


"
"Okay, so Tim starts with 7 blue boxes and 9 red boxes.  He uses 3 blue boxes and a third of his red boxes, which is 9 divided by 3, which is 3 red boxes.

That means he has 7 - 3 = 4 blue boxes left and 9 - 3 = 6 red boxes left.

In total, he has 4 + 6 = 10 boxes left. 


10 
"
"Okay, so Sarah has 9 books and Joseph had twice as many as her. That means Joseph had 9 * 2 = 18 books.  Then he lost 2, so now he has 18 - 2 = 16 books. 


16 
"
"Okay, so Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives away 1/5 of them to Jamie, which is the same as 6 marbles. Then he gives 10 more to Donald.  

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to subtract the marbles he gave away: 30 - 6 - 10 = 14 marbles. 


**Answer:** 14 
"
"Okay, so Duncan is 60 now, and that means eight years ago he was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.  

The problem says that 52 was twice Adam's age four years ago.  So, Adam's age four years ago was 52 / 2 = 26.

That means Adam is 26 + 4 = 30 years old now.

In eight years, he'll be 30 + 8 = 38 years old. 


38 
"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 200 acres. Farmer Smith has 100 acres *more* than twice the size of Brown's farm.  

Let's figure that out: twice Brown's farm is 200 * 2 = 400 acres.

Then Farmer Smith has 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Together, they have 200 + 500 = 700 acres. 


700 
"
"Okay, so Colby makes $0.20 for each package he does.  He does 10 less than 50 packages each hour, which means he does 40 packages per hour.  

That means he makes $0.20 * 40 = $8.00 each hour.

Since he works an 8 hour day, he makes $8.00 * 8 = $64.00  


**Answer:** $64.00 
"
"Okay, so a normal sudoku takes 45 minutes and an extreme one takes 4 times longer. That means an extreme sudoku takes 45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes.

He drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes, so in 180 minutes he drinks 180 minutes / 30 minutes/bottle = 6 bottles. 


"
"Okay, so Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna total.  He threw 2 pieces at each red balloon, and he had 20 red balloons, so he threw 2 * 20 = 40 pieces at the red balloons.

That means he threw 58 - 40 = 18 pieces at the yellow balloons.

Since he threw 3 pieces at each yellow balloon, he must have had 18 / 3 = 6 yellow balloons. 


**Answer: 6** 
"
"Jon drives 100 miles every day for a whole month, which is 30 days. So he drives 100 * 30 = 3000 miles in a month.  

His car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, so he needs 3000 / 1000 = 3 tune-ups. 


3 
"
"Okay, so Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.  

On Wednesday, he works twice as long, which is 5 hours * 2 = 10 hours.

Then on Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, so he works 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours.

Adding up all the hours, he works 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours in total. 


"
"Okay, so Julia and Nadine got the same amount of allowance and used it to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream for their dad's birthday.  

* The cake cost $11.
* A dozen balloons cost $0.50 for every 2 balloons, so 12 balloons cost $3.
* Two tubs of ice cream cost $7 each, so they cost $14 in total.

If they spent $11 + $3 + $14 = $28 altogether, and they split the cost evenly, then each girl got $28 / 2 = $14.




**Answer: $14.00**
"
"Kira has 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges, so that's 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces of fruit.  Lola ate 2, so there are 14 - 2 = 12 pieces left. 


12 
"
"Okay, so there are 6 kids playing tennis and twice that many playing volleyball, which is 6 times 2 = 12 kids.  Then there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so that's 16 + 22 = 38 kids.  

Adding all the kids together, we get 6 + 12 + 38 = 56 kids in total. 


"
"Okay, so each student sold 10 lollipops for $0.80 each. That means they made 10 * $0.80 = $8.00 per student.  

Since there are 30 students, they made a total of $8.00 * 30 = $240.00 from selling the lollipops.

They bought each lollypop for $0.50, so 300 lollipops cost them 300 * $0.50 = $150.00.

To find out how much money they made, we subtract the cost from the total sales: $240.00 - $150.00 = $90.00


**Answer:** $90.00 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Larry has 3 cats and 3 times as many dogs, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
* He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, meaning he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
* He has 3 times as many fish as rabbits, so he has 7 * 3 = 21 fish.
* Larry has 1/3 the number of gerbils as fish, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Finally, let's add up all his pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets!


47 
"
"Okay, so Abby eats 2 slices of bread a day and Josh eats twice as much, which means he eats 4 slices. Together they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices every day.  If the loaf has 24 slices, it will last 24 / 6 = 4 days.

"
"Martha collects one shell every month, so for her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, she'll collect shells for 5 years.  That's 5 years * 12 months a year = 60 months!  Since she gets one shell each month, she'll have 60 shells. 


"
"Okay, so Lana has 27 cups total and uses 15 for cinnamon tea, which leaves her with 27 - 15 = 12 cups for chamomile and mint.  

Since she puts the same amount of each kind of tea in each row, and there are 3 rows, she has 12 cups / 3 rows = 4 cups per row for chamomile and mint.

That means there are 4 cups / 2 types of tea = 2 cups of mint tea in each row. 


**2** 
"
"Okay, so the sloth takes 4 hours to go down, get berries, and climb back up.  If he wants 24 berries in 8 hours, he can make two trips.  That means he needs 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries each time! 


12 
"
"Okay, so there's 10,000 gallons in the pool. They fill a tank with half of that, which is 5,000 gallons.  

Then they use 500 gallons every day to water their garden for 6 days. That means they use 500 * 6 = 3,000 gallons total.

If they started with 5,000 gallons and used 3,000 gallons, there's 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 gallons left in the tank. 


**2000** 
"
"Okay, so Colby has $150 for the month.  He already spent money on movies and snacks.  

* He spent $50 on Friday and Saturday movies (5 movies * $10 each).
* He spent $56 on movies on other days (8 movies * $7 each).
* He spent $24 on popcorn and candy (2 tubs of popcorn * $8 each + 4 boxes of candy * $2 each).

That means he spent a total of $130 ($50 + $56 + $24).

He has $20 left ($150 - $130).

Since Friday and Saturday movies cost $10 each, he can see 2 more movies ($20 / $10). 



"
"Okay, so a normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, but a mini one has 1/3 of that, which is 200 calories.  Andrew made 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so those have 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini one has 150 calories.  He made 300 mini blueberry muffins, so those have 150 * 300 = 45,000 calories.

All together, the pastries have 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories. 


85000 
"
"Okay, so Rita found 39 Junebugs on Monday.  Then she found twice that many on Tuesday and Wednesday, which is 39 times 2, or 78 Junebugs each day.  

That means she found 78 + 78 + 39 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs in total.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60 Junebugs per day.

"
"The bus traveled 300 miles (60 miles per hour times 5 hours) and the car traveled 240 miles (30 miles per hour times 8 hours).  

The bus traveled 300 - 240 = 60 miles farther than the car. 


60 
"
"Okay, so Sophie had 31 blocks + 8 stuffed animals + 9 rings, which is 48 toys in total.  Then she got a tube of bouncy balls and now she has 62 toys.  That means there are 62 - 48 = 14 bouncy balls. 


14 
"
"Okay, so Peter, Paul, and Jean are a total of 100 years old.  Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter is as old as Paul and John combined.

Let's think about it:

* If Paul is 10 years older than John, that means if John is 10, Paul is 20.

* Peter is the same age as Paul and John together, so if John is 10 and Paul is 20, Peter is 30.

* But wait!  We need to figure out if that works for all three of them.  If Peter is 30, Paul is 20, and John is 10, that adds up to 60.

*  That means we need to find a way to make the ages add up to 100.  

*  Let's try if John is 20. That means Paul is 30, and Peter is 50.

*  50 + 30 + 20 = 100!


**Answer:** Peter is 50 years old. 
"
"Okay, so Maria had 1 balloon and her 4 friends each got 2 balloons, so that's 4 times 2 which is 8 balloons.  That's 8 + 1 = 9 balloons. Then her mom gave everyone 3 more, so that's 3 times 5 people which is 15 balloons.  Adding that to the 9 they already had, they have 15 + 9 = 24 balloons. 


**24** 
"
"Okay, so they got 10 people who each gave 5 boxes, which is 50 boxes total.  Then they had 10 boxes already, so that's 60 boxes in all.  

If each table holds 2 boxes, they need 60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables.

They already have 15 tables, so they need 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 new tables. 


"
"Okay, so Zoey spit 40 seeds that went 10 feet each, so that's 40 times 10 which is 400 feet.  Sydney spit 35 seeds that went 12 feet each, so that's 35 times 12 which is 420 feet.  

To find the average, we add those up: 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

Then we divide by 2 because there are two of them: 820 / 2 = 410 feet. 


**410** 
"
"Okay, so the Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour.  Each widget sells for $6.

If they both run for 24 hours a day for a whole month (30 days), let's see who makes more money!

* **Widgeteer 3000:**

   * It makes 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets a day
   * That's 1440 widgets * $6/widget = $8640 a day
   * Over a month, that's $8640/day * 30 days = $259,200

* **WidgetMaster 9000:**

   * It makes 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets a day
   * That's 1080 widgets * $6/widget = $6480 a day
   * Over a month, that's $6480/day * 30 days = $194,400

So the Widgeteer 3000 makes $259,200 and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes $194,400.  

The difference is $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"
"Okay, so Cameron stays at the hotel for 17 hours.  

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours, and then 70 pesos for each extra hour.  

That means he pays 70 pesos * 5 hours = 350 pesos for the extra hours.

So his total cost is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos. 

If he paid for the whole 24 hours, it would be 1600 pesos.

He saves 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos! 


"
"Okay, so each goat eats 5 pounds of hay.  There are 15 goats, so that's 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay for the goats.

Each sheep eats 3 pounds less than twice the amount a goat eats. Twice the amount a goat eats is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.  So, each sheep eats 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

There are 12 sheep, so they eat a total of 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay.

In total, Nate needs 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay. 


"
"Okay, so John makes $50 an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned $50 * 6 = $300.  

He spent $50 on gas and $50 on pencils, so he has $300 - $50 - $50 = $200 left.

He wants to put $100 in the bank, so he has $200 - $100 = $100 left to spend on pens.

Since each pen costs $25, he can buy $100 / $25 = 4 pens. 


**Answer: 4** 
"
"Okay, so Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, which is 20 times 15, or 300 letters. His brother spelled words with 50 more letters than Craig, so he spelled 300 plus 50, which is 350 letters.  

To find the total, we add the number of letters Craig spelled to the number his brother spelled: 300 + 350 = 650 letters. 


"
"Okay, so there are 5 schools, and each school has 7 rows of kids.  That means there are 5 * 7 = 35 rows of kids total.  

Since each row has 8 kids, there are 35 * 8 = 280 kids in the drill. 


280 
"
"Okay, so the teacher has 9 coupons and each coupon gets her 100 bottles of juice. That means she has 9 * 100 = 900 bottles in total.

Then she gives each of her 29 students 2 bottles, so she gives away 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

If she starts with 900 bottles and gives away 58, she has 900 - 58 = 842 bottles left for herself. 


**842** 
"
"Okay, so Patty charges $40 just to come to your house, then $35 for every hour she works.  She worked for 2.25 hours, so that's 2.25 * $35 = $78.75 for labor.  Then you add the $60 for parts.  

So, the total is $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75 


"
"Okay, so James spent $150 on 10 CDs, but he got 40% off, which is $60. That means he paid $90 for all the CDs.  Then he sold 5 of them for $40 each, making $200.  Since he spent $90 and made $200, he's actually $110 ahead! 


"
"Okay, so Jen has 6 yams at $1.50 each, that's 6 times 1.50 which is $9.00.  

Then she has 10 sweet potatoes at $2.00 each, so that's 10 times 2 which is $20.00.

And she has 4 carrots at $1.25 each, so that's 4 times 1.25 which is $5.00.

If you add all that up, $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00 


34.00 
"
"Okay, so James swims 60% of the lake, which is 12 miles (20 miles * 0.60 = 12 miles).  It takes him 6 hours to swim that far (12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours).

Then he rests for half as long as he swam, so 3 hours (6 hours / 2 = 3 hours).

He has 8 miles left to swim (20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles).  But he swims half as fast, so it takes him 8 hours to swim the rest (8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours).

In total, it takes him 17 hours (6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours). 




"
"Okay, so Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. The bakery has 40 *less* than seven times that amount.  

First, let's find seven times the number of loaves Sam had: 7 * 70 = 490 loaves.

Then, we subtract 40: 490 - 40 = 450 loaves.


The bakery has 450 loaves of bread. 
"
"Okay, so Jasmine starts with 15 stickers. Then she loses 7, so that's 15 - 7 = 8 stickers.

"
"Okay, so Cayley gets 10% of $5 for each New York Times he sells, which is $0.50.  He sells 6 of those, so he makes $0.50 x 6 = $3.00.

For the Wall Street Journal, he gets 8% of $15, which is $1.20 per paper.  Since he sells 10 of those, he makes $1.20 x 10 = $12.00.

In total, he makes $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00. 


**15.00**
"
"Okay, so Deanna is 26 and Marcus is 5 years younger than her. That means Marcus is 21.  

Since Marcus is half Leo's age, Leo must be 21 times 2, which is 42. 


"
"Okay, so Bahati scored the most, which is 20 more than Azibo.  Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati.  

Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points. That means:

* Bahati scored x + 20 points
* Dinar scored x - 10 points

Together, they scored 45 points, so:

x + (x + 20) + (x - 10) = 45

Combining like terms:

3x + 10 = 45

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

3x = 35

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 11.67 


**Azibo scored about 11.67 points.**

"Okay, so Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.  That means he staples 2 reports every minute!

He works for 15 hours, which is 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

**Answer:** 1800 
"
"Okay, so Kim sleeps from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. That's 8 hours.  

Eight hours is 480 minutes because there are 60 minutes in an hour.

She woke up at 5:55 a.m. because she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.

She sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

So, she slept in her bed for 480 minutes - 23 minutes = 457 minutes. 



**457** 
"
"Okay, so Jonathan has 24 measuring cups 'cause two dozen is 2 times 12.  He has 2/3 of that number in spoons, which is like 16 spoons.  After he gives some away, he has 10 spoons left.  

So, he has 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils in total. 


"
"Okay, so the hospital has 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are full. That means 200 beds are taken up.

Then, 50 more people come to the hospital each day for two weeks, which is 14 days.  So, in two weeks, 50 * 14 = 700 more people come.

That means there are now 200 + 700 = 900 beds taken up.

If 900 beds are taken, then 1000 - 900 = 100 beds are empty. 


**Answer: 100** 
"
"Okay, so Robyn sends 16 emails a day.  7 of them are for work, which leaves 9 emails for other stuff.  Two-thirds of those other emails are to her family, so that's 6 emails.  That means 3 emails are left over, and one-third of those are to her boyfriend. So she sends 1 email to her boyfriend each day. 


"
"Okay, so Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times older than her. That means Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.  Shawna's dad is five times older than Shawna, so he's 5 * 9 = 45 years old. 


"
"Okay, so Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert, but Kelly thinks she counted too many. Kelly says Courtney was off by 20%.  

That means Courtney counted 20% more than the real number. To figure out how many people were *really* there, we need to figure out what 20% of 48 is.

20% is the same as 0.20, so 20% of 48 is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6.

So Courtney counted 9.6 extra people.  If we take away those extra people from her count, we get 48 - 9.6 = 38.4.

Since we can't have parts of people, we round down to 38.


**Answer: 38** 
"
"Okay, so Jason carried 2 balls, and he carried twice as many as Jeffrey, who carried 1 ball. Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so he carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

"Okay, so the pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 the second, and 8 the third. That's a total of 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes.  

But they filled in 2 holes, so there were 31 - 2 = 29 holes left.

The problem says there were four times as many holes at the end of the third day as there were at the end of the first day.  

If there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, that means there were 29 / 4 = 7.25 holes at the end of the first day.  

Wait a minute... you can't have part of a hole!  That means something's fishy with this problem. 



"
"Okay, so Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 15 more than them. That means Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.  

To find the total, we add up how many each person got: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 corn chips. 


"
"Okay, so Jen's supplies cost $400.  Travel costs 50% more than that, which means it costs another $200.  

To find the total travel cost, we add the extra cost to the supplies: $400 + $200 = $600. 


**Answer:** $600 
"
"Okay, so Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe caught a bunch of Pokemon!  They caught 339 in total. Alex caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe caught.  

Let's think about it like this:

*  If Adelwolfe caught some Pokemon, let's say 'x', then Stan caught 4x - 13 Pokemon.
*  Alex caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex caught (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8 Pokemon.

Now we know how many each of them caught, we can add them up:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Let's combine like terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 40

So Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon.

Now we can find out how many Stan caught:

Stan caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokemon.



**Answer:** Stan caught 147 Pokemon.
"
"Okay, so each episode is 20 minutes long.  There are half as many episodes as there are minutes in an episode, so there are 20 minutes / 2 = 10 episodes.

If he watches all 10 episodes, that's 10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes. 


"
"Okay, so the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, which is 300 miles. Then it flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so that's 36 miles.  Finally, it flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, which is 110 miles.

To find the total distance south, we add the first and last trips: 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles.

Then we subtract the distance flown north: 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.


**Answer: 374** 
"
"Okay, so Greta got 12 brownies from making them herself. Then she got 6 more from her office. Her friends brought 48 brownies, which is a lot!  

In total, she had 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

But then they ate 1 1/2 dozen, which is 18 brownies.

So, she had 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left over. 


"
"Okay, so Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice as old, which means he's 8 times 2, or 16 years old.  Nani's sister is 25% younger than him.  That's like taking 25 out of every 100 years, so she's 8 minus 2, which is 6 years old.

To find the total age, we add them all up: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years old.

"Okay, so Andy has to restring 12 racquets. 

*  3 racquets take 15 minutes each to restring with synthetic gut, so that's 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.
*  5 racquets take 22 minutes each with polyester, so that's 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.
*  4 racquets take 18 minutes each with hybrid string, so that's 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

To find the total time, we add all that up: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

"
"Okay, so he buys three phones at full price and one at half price.  

The first two phones cost $600 each, so that's $600 * 2 = $1200.

The third phone is half price, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.

Adding it all up, he paid $1200 + $300 = $1500 for all the phones. 


"
"Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more than that, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.  

To find the total number of players, we add the number of players on each team: 13 + 20 = 33 players. 


33 
"
"Okay, so Robert needs to build a fence that's 15 feet long and 10 feet wide.  To find out how many slats he needs, we first need to figure out how long the fence is all the way around.  That's called the perimeter.

The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding up all the sides: 15 feet + 10 feet + 15 feet + 10 feet = 50 feet.

He needs 2 slats for every foot of fence, so he'll need 50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats. 



"
"Okay, so Mrs. Harrington had 12 boxes of oranges, and each box has 20 oranges. That means she had 12 * 20 = 240 oranges in total.

She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away 4 boxes.  That leaves her with 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is (1/4) * 8 * 20 = 40 oranges.

So, she sold 240 - 40 = 200 oranges. 



"
"Okay, so the USA has 50 states.  India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.  

First, half of 50 is 25.

Then, you add 4 to that: 25 + 4 = 29 states in India.

Finally, add the number of states in both countries: 50 + 29 = 79 states total! 


"
"Okay, so Tyler wants to buy a dictionary for $18, a dinosaur book for $13, and a cookbook for $8.  That's a total of $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

He already has $14 saved, so he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more.

If he makes $5 per hour, he needs to work $25 / $5 = 5 hours. 


"
"Okay, so Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard. That means Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.  

Together, Richard and Robert have 20 + 30 = 50 cherries.  

Since there are 60 cherries total, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry. 



20 
"
"Okay, so Sunny sold gingerbread and apple pie.  

* On Saturday, he sold 10 gingerbread and 11 apple pies (because he sold 4 fewer apple pies than on Sunday, and on Sunday he sold 15).
* On Sunday, he sold 15 gingerbread and 15 apple pies.

Let's figure out how much money he made:

* Saturday gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6/box = $60
* Saturday apple pie: 11 boxes * $15/box = $165
* Sunday gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6/box = $90
* Sunday apple pie: 15 boxes * $15/box = $225

Now add it all up: $60 + $165 + $90 + $225 = $540


Sunny made $540 in two days! 
"
"She needs sunscreen for 32 hours total.  Since each bottle has 8 ounces, she'll need 4 bottles. 


"
"Okay, so the blue car costs $100 and the red car is 40% cheaper.  That means the red car is $40 less expensive because 40% of $100 is $40.  

The red car costs $60 because $100 - $40 = $60.

Together, the cars cost $160. 


"
"Okay, so Emil is 19 now and will be 24 in five years.  When he's 24, he'll be twice as old as his brother, and half his dad's age.  

That means his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

And his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

To find their ages *now*, we just have to subtract 5 years from each of those:

* Brother: 12 - 5 = 7 years old
* Dad: 48 - 5 = 43 years old

Finally, add their ages together: 43 + 7 = 50 


**Answer: 50** 
"
"Okay, so Adrianne got 20 beads from her mom. Her sister gave her 10 more than that, which is 20 + 10 = 30 beads.  Her friend gave her twice the amount her mom did, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 beads.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads! 


"
"Okay, so Joe caught 3 pounds on Thursday.  Then he caught 4 times that on Friday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.  On Saturday, he caught half of Friday's amount, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

In total, he caught 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish.  Since each serving is 3 pounds, he has 21 / 3 = 7 servings. 



"
"Okay, so there are 30 students in the class.  20% of them are football players, which is 6 students.  That means 24 students are not football players.

Then, 25% of those 24 students are cheerleaders or in band, which is also 6 students.

So, in total, 6 football players + 6 cheerleaders/band members = 12 students are leaving early. 


"
"Sophie wears a size 5, and Charlie wears a size 25 'cause her boots are five times bigger!  So, to find the average, we add their sizes together (5 + 25 = 30) and then divide by 2 (30 / 2 = 15). 


15 
"
"Okay, so Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long and her flowers are 12 inches wide.  She needs 1.5 feet between each plant.  

First, let's figure out how many inches long the flower bed is: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Then we need to figure out how much space the plants will take up: 1332 inches - (1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot) = 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches.

Now we can see how many plants she needs: 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants.  Since she can't have half a plant, she needs 110 plants.

But she already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants.

Each plant costs $6, so she'll spend 93 plants * $6/plant = $558.




"
"Edgar eats 18 pretzels every day. His brother eats half as many as Edgar.  To find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we need to figure out how many he eats each day first.

Half of 18 pretzels is 9 pretzels.

So his brother eats 9 pretzels a day.

In a week, there are 7 days, so his brother eats 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels. 


**Answer:** 63 pretzels 
"
"Okay, so she needs 3 petunias at $3 each, so that's 3 times 3 which is $9.  Then she needs 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so that's 2 times 2.50 which is $5.  That means each basket costs $9 plus $5, which is $14.  Since she has 5 baskets, she'll spend $14 times 5, which is $70. 


**70.00**"
"Okay, so they have 30 pounds of soil.  Each sunflower needs 3 pounds, and they're planting 4 sunflowers, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.

Carnations need 1.5 pounds each, and they're planting 10, so that's 1.5 * 10 = 15 pounds.

That means they used 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil.

They have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left.

Since each rose needs 1 pound, they can plant 3 roses. 


**Answer: 3** 
"
"Okay, so Jessica makes $2,000 each month and saves 25% of that for shoes. That means she saves $500 each month.  

In a whole year, she saves $500 * 12 months = $6,000.

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000, she can buy $6,000 / $1,000 = 6 pairs of shoes. 


**Answer: 6** 
"
"Okay, so Emily peels 6 shrimp every minute.  To peel 90 shrimp, it'll take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

She cooks 30 shrimp every 10 minutes, so for 90 shrimp it'll take her 90 / 30 * 10 = 30 minutes.

In total, it'll take her 15 + 30 = 45 minutes. 


**45** 
"
"Okay, so the air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high.  

First, it ran on low for 3 hours, so that's 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees cooler.

Then it ran on high for 4 hours, so that's 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees cooler.

That means the room cooled a total of 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees.

But then it warmed up for 2 hours at 2 degrees an hour, so that's 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees warmer.

So, the room ended up 18 degrees cooler - 4 degrees warmer = 14 degrees cooler than it started. 




"
"Okay, so Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30.  Bill saw it again when he was three times his dad's age, which is 3 * 30 = 90 years old.  Since the comet comes back every 75 years, that means Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old the first time he saw it. 


**Answer: 15** 
"
"Okay, so Buford writes 1 check a month for electric and 1 for gas, so that's 12 checks a year for those.  Then he writes 2 checks a month for the church, which is 24 checks a year. And he does the pest and lawn thing 4 times a year.  

Adding it all up, he writes 12 + 24 + 4 = 40 checks a year. 


40 
"
"Okay, so the first plane goes to Greece most of the time, three-quarters to be exact. That means it does 88 flights total - 66 of them are to Greece.  

The rest of the flights are split between France and Germany.  Since there are 88 total flights and 66 to Greece, that leaves 88 - 66 = 22 flights for France and Germany.

Since those are split evenly, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France each day. 



**Answer:** 11 
"
"Okay, so Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls twice as long, so he howls for 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.  

Then Tobias and Chikote howl for a total of 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

Igneous howls for the same amount of time as both of them, so he also howls for 60 seconds.

All together, they howl for 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 120 seconds is equal to 2 minutes. 


**Answer: 2** 
"
"Okay, so Adam's trousers cost $30. His mom gave him $6 and his dad gave him twice that amount, which is $12.  

That means his parents gave him a total of $6 + $12 = $18.

To find out how much Adam paid from his savings, we subtract the amount his parents gave him from the total cost: $30 - $18 = $12.


12 
"
"Okay, so we know Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4.  That means together they are 3 + 4 = 7 years old.

We also know the total age of all four kids is 20.  So, Helene and Wilfred must be 20 - 7 = 13 years old combined.

Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the average age is 20 / 4 = 5 years.  That means Helene is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

Since Helene is 10, Wilfred must be 13 - 10 = 3 years old. 



**Wilfred is 3 years old.** 
"
"Okay, so Walter got $500 from his neighbors and $1500 online, which is a total of $2000. Then his friend gave him $200, making it $2200 in all.  Walter's lawyer is going to give three times that amount, so he'll give $2200 * 3 = $6600! 


"
"Okay, so there were 100 people at the wedding, and each person brought 15 cookies. That means there were a total of 100 times 15, which is 1500 cookies!

The bride gave half of those cookies to the church, so that's 1500 divided by 2, which is 750 cookies.

Since each person at the church got 15 cookies, there must have been 750 divided by 15, which is 50 people at the church. 


"
"Okay, so each adult gets twice the slice of a kid.  If we think of the watermelon as being cut into 6 pieces, the adults get 2 big slices each, and the kids get 1 small slice each.  

That means the adults get 4 big slices total, and the kids get 4 small slices.  

Since the adults have 4 out of the 6 slices, they get 4/6 of the watermelon.

If we simplify that fraction, it's 2/3.

To turn that into a percentage, we can multiply by 100%:

(2/3) * 100% = 66.67%




**Answer:** 66.67% 
"
"Okay, so Doctor Jones works for 9 hours.  He spends 20 minutes on each of his 9 patients, which is 180 minutes total.  Then he has 10 appointments that each take 30 minutes, so that's 300 minutes.  

That means he spends a total of 180 + 300 = 480 minutes at the clinic.  

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 480 / 60 = 8 hours at the clinic.

If he works for 9 hours, he has 9 - 8 = 1 hour left to update his records. 



**1**"
"Okay, so Jordan wants to make a cake that's ready by 5:00 pm.  

* Making the batter takes 20 minutes.
* Baking takes 30 minutes.
* Cooling takes 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.
* Frosting takes 10 minutes.

Let's add all that up: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

That's 180 minutes of work!  

If there are 60 minutes in an hour, that means the cake takes 180 / 60 = 3 hours to make.

So, to have it ready by 5:00 pm, she needs to start making it at 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm. 




"
"Okay, so Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, which means they sold a total of 8 boxes.  They sold 64 chocolate bars altogether.  To find out how many are in each box, we divide the total bars by the total boxes: 64 / 8 = 8.


8 
"
"Okay, so the studio costs $25 to rent each time, and then it costs $1.50 for each of the 10 students.  

That means each time they use the studio, it costs $25 + ($1.50 x 10) = $40.

They use the studio 3 days a week, so that's $40 x 3 = $120 each week.

If there are 4 weeks in a month, they make $120 x 4 = $480 each month. 


"
"Okay, so Peter has 64 chocolate bars split between 4 boxes, which means each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.  Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so each of her boxes has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.

Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. 


**Answer:** 8 
"
"Okay, so there are 50 porcupines total, and 3/5 of them are female. That means there are 30 female porcupines.  

Each female has 4 babies every month, so in a year (12 months) they'd have 4 babies/month * 12 months = 48 babies each.

That means all the females have 30 females * 48 babies = 1440 babies in a year.

Adding those babies to the original 50 porcupines, there would be 50 + 1440 = 1490 porcupines! 



"
"Okay, so the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.  To find out how much water it holds, we multiply those numbers together: 14 x 25 x 4 = 1400 cubic feet.

The pool company says we need to multiply that by 5.9 to get the number of gallons, so 1400 x 5.9 = 8260 gallons.

Finally, it costs $0.10 for each gallon, so 8260 x $0.10 = $826.00 to fill the pool. 


"
"Okay, so there are 9 red sticks.  They have 5 more blue sticks than red, so that's 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.  Then there are 3 fewer yellow sticks than blue, so 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks! 


"
"Matteo drove 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he drove 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy drove 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she drove 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

Shandy drove 450 - 220 = 230 miles farther than Matteo. 


**230** 
"
"Okay, so half the students are over 16, and that's 3000 students / 2 = 1500 students.

Then, one fourth of those are boys, so that's 1500 students / 4 = 375 boys.  

That means 1500 students - 375 students = 1125 girls are over 16.

The other half of the students are under 16, which is also 1500 students.

Half of those are boys, so that's 1500 students / 2 = 750 boys.

That means 1500 students - 750 students = 750 girls are under 16.

Finally, to find the total number of girls, we add them up: 1125 girls + 750 girls = 1875 girls.




**Answer: 1875** 
"
"Okay, so Bethany runs 10 laps in an hour. Trey runs 4 more than Bethany, which is 14 laps. Shaelyn runs half as many laps as Trey, so she runs 7 laps. Quinn runs 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so he runs 5 laps.  

Bethany runs 10 laps and Quinn runs 5 laps, so Bethany runs 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn. 


"
"Okay, so Wanda and Ms. B are filling up a tank that holds 18,000 gallons of water.

* **Day 1:** Wanda put in 1/4 of the tank, which is 18,000 / 4 = 4,500 gallons.  Ms. B put in 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she put in (3/4) * 4,500 = 3,375 gallons. Together they put in 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 gallons.

* **Day 2:** Wanda put in 2/3 of what she put in on day 1, which is (2/3) * 4,500 = 3,000 gallons. Ms. B put in 1/3 of what she put in on day 1, so she put in (1/3) * 3,375 = 1,125 gallons. Together they put in 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons.

* **Total:** Over the two days, they put in 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 gallons.

* **Remaining:**  To find out how much is left, we subtract the amount they put in from the tank's total capacity: 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons.



**Answer:** 6000 gallons 
"
"Okay, so Maria's power bank lost 9% of its charge every hour for 5 hours, which is a total of 45% lost (9 x 5 = 45).  

That means 55% of the power bank was left after those 5 hours (100% - 45% = 55%).

Then, it lost another 7% every hour for 3 hours, so another 21% was lost (7 x 3 = 21).

Now, 55% - 21% = 34% was left.

But we know that 34% is what was left at the end, and that's what the question is asking!


**Answer:** 82% 
"
"Okay, so Janet makes $10 an hour plus $15 an hour in tips, which means she makes $25 an hour in total.  She wants to save up $2000 for a car.  If she works 40 hours a week, she makes $25 * 40 = $1000 each week.  To save $2000, it will take her $2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks.

"Okay, so Jamaar spent $1.50 on peaches, $2.00 on pears, $2.00 on kiwis, and $3.75 on apples. That's a total of $9.25.  

He had $10.00 to start, so he has $0.75 left.

Each plum costs $0.25, so he can buy $0.75 / $0.25 = 3 plums. 


**Answer:** 3 
"
"Okay, so Anne had 15 packs of sweets with 60 pieces in each pack. That means she had a total of 15 * 60 = 900 sweets!  She kept 2 packs for herself, which is 2 * 60 = 120 sweets.  

That leaves her with 900 - 120 = 780 sweets to give to her 10 friends.  

If she divides the sweets equally, each friend gets 780 / 10 = 78 sweets. 


"
"Okay, so the carrots cost $120 to start.  Each year they go up by 5%.  

* **Year 1:**  5% of $120 is $6 more, so they cost $126.
* **Year 2:** 5% of $126 is $6.30 more, so they cost $132.30.
* **Year 3:** 5% of $132.30 is $6.615 more, so they cost about $139.


**Answer:** $139 
"
"Okay, so she put 72 pictures into 8 albums, which means there are 9 pictures in each album.  She had 3 albums of selfies, so that's 3 times 9, which is 27 selfies.  She also had 2 albums of portraits, so that's 2 times 9, which is 18 portraits.  

If you add those together, she has 27 + 18 = 45 selfies and portraits. 


"
"Okay, so James reads 3 pages every 10 minutes.  If he reads 18 pages, that means he reads 6 times 3 pages (18 / 3 = 6).  Since each set of 3 pages takes 10 minutes, he spends 6 times 10 minutes reading (6 * 10 = 60).


60 
"
"Okay, so there were 100 guests at the hotel.  24 left early and 15 left late, so that's 24 + 15 = 39 guests who checked out.

Then, twice as many people checked in as those who left late, so 15 * 2 = 30 new guests.

That means there were 100 - 39 + 30 = 91 guests.

And then 7 more people checked in after dinner, so now there are 91 + 7 = 98 guests. 




"
"Okay, so John got 4 bananas on Wednesday and 6 on Thursday.  That's 4 + 6 = 10 bananas.

On Friday, he got three times the amount from Wednesday, so he got 4 * 3 = 12 bananas.

In total, he has 10 + 12 = 22 bananas. 


"
"Okay, so there are 60 questions, and 40% of them are easy, which is 24 questions.  

That means there are 36 questions that are average or difficult. Since they're split evenly, there are 18 of each.

Aries gets 75% of the easy questions right, so that's 24 * 0.75 = 18 questions.

She gets half of the average and difficult questions right, so that's 18 * 0.5 = 9 questions right for each type.

In total, she gets 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right! 



"
"Okay, so Teresa sells big stuffed animals for three times the price of the small ones.  She made $120 total, and each small one costs $4.  

If she sold twice as many small ones as big ones, let's say she sold 'x' big ones. That means she sold 2x small ones.

The small stuffed animals made her 2x * $4 = $8x.

The big ones made her x * $12 = $12x.

Together, that's $8x + $12x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get $20x = $120.

To find out how many big ones she sold (x), we divide: $120 / $20 = 6 big ones.

Since she sold twice as many small ones, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small ones. 



**Answer:** 12 
"
"Okay, so the man eats 5 sandwiches a day, his wife eats 4, and their son eats 2.  

That means they eat a total of 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches every day.

If there are 7 days in a week, they eat 11 * 7 = 77 sandwiches in a week! 


77 
"
"Okay, so Suzanne made $80 from the cookies and $240 from the cupcakes. That's a total of $320.  She gave her sisters $20, so she has $300 left. 


"
"Okay, so the twins found 30 eggs each, which is 60 eggs total.  If there were 100 eggs to start with and 10 were left over, that means their friends found 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs. 


"
"Okay, so a dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore with their hands. With an iron pickaxe, they mine twice as much, which is 12 times 2, or 24 pounds.  

With a steel pickaxe, they mine 50% more than with the iron pickaxe.  Fifty percent of 24 is 24 divided by 2, which is 12 pounds. So with a steel pickaxe, they mine 24 plus 12, or 36 pounds.

Now, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes would mine 40 times 36, which is 1440 pounds each day.

In a month with 30 days, they'd mine 1440 times 30, which is 43,200 pounds of ore. 



**Answer: 43,200** 
"
"Okay, so they sell sandwiches in packs of 2 for $3 and packs of 4 for $6.  That means each sandwich costs $1.50 because $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 and $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50.

If one sandwich costs $1.50, then 8 sandwiches would cost $12.00! 


"
"Okay, so Tom buys a new bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old one for $1000, which helps him pay for the new one.  That means he still needs to pay $2000.  

If he has to pay 10% interest each month, that means he has to pay $200 each month.

"Okay, so Sally starts with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons.  

*  First, 40% of the red balloons pop, which is 25 times 0.40 = 10 balloons. That leaves her with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

*  Then she lets go of half her yellow balloons, so she has 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons left.

*  She finds 8 blue balloons and adds 75% of them to her bunch, which is 8 times 0.75 = 6 blue balloons.

*  Finally, she has 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 balloons! 




"
"Okay, so there's a 50/50 chance the sub won't even take the homework.  

If the regular teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone extra time. That means there's a 60% chance she won't.

But even if she doesn't give everyone extra time, Marcus has a 20% chance of getting an extra day because his dog ate it.

So, it's kinda tricky, but I think the best way to figure this out is to think about when he *has* to do the homework.  

* He has to do it if there's no sub AND the teacher doesn't give an extension AND he can't convince her about the dog.

Let's see...

* No sub: 50%
* Teacher doesn't give an extension: 60%
* Can't convince her about the dog: 80%

So, to find out when he *has* to do it, we multiply those together: 50% * 60% * 80% = 24%


That means there's a 76% chance he doesn't have to do it! 





"
"Okay, so there are 6000 seats in the Fine Arts Center.  

950 seats are for the graduates and 300 are for teachers, so that's 950 + 300 = 1250 seats taken up.

That leaves 6000 - 1250 = 4750 seats for everyone else.

If all the graduates get the same number of tickets for their friends and family, each graduate gets 4750 / 950 = 5 tickets. 



**Answer: 5** 
"
"Okay, so Grandpa eats 75 large jelly beans to feel full.  He eats twice as many medium jelly beans as large ones, which is 75 * 2 = 150 medium jelly beans.  

Since 3 small jelly beans equal 1 medium jelly bean, Grandpa can eat 150 * 3 = 450 small jelly beans. 


"
"Okay, so Melissa gets $15 each day for jury duty and she goes for 3 days, so that's $15 x 3 = $45.  She also has to pay $3 for parking each day, and she goes for 3 days, so that's $3 x 3 = $9.  

That means she makes $45 - $9 = $36 total.

She spends 6 hours each day for 3 days, so that's 6 x 3 = 18 hours.

Finally, if she makes $36 for 18 hours, she makes $36 / 18 = $2 per hour. 


**Answer:** $2 
"
"Okay, so Ted starts with $200.  He spends $48 on books (3 books times $16 each) and $18 on pencils (3 pencils times $6 each).  

If you add those together, he spent a total of $66. 


"
"Okay, so Richard has a driveway that's 24 feet long and he wants to put a soda bottle every 3 feet.  That means he'll have 24 / 3 = 8 bottles of soda.

He has to walk between each bottle, so he'll do 7 trips (8 bottles - 1).  

If each trip takes 5 seconds, it'll take him 7 * 5 = 35 seconds to do them all. 



"
"Uncle Franky has 80 apples because he has two boxes with 40 apples each.  If he puts 8 apples in each pack, he can make 10 packs of apples. 


"
"Okay, so Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan at $11 per pound, which costs her $22.  Then she buys 3 pounds of mozzarella at $6 per pound, which costs her $18.  

That means she spent a total of $22 + $18 = $40 on cheese.

If she started with $50, she has $50 - $40 = $10 left to buy meat. 



"
"Okay, so Jim got $50,000 in loans each year for 4 years of college, which is $200,000 total.  He also lost out on making $25,000 a year for 4 years, so that's another $100,000.  

That means he needs to make back $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

After college, he makes three times his old salary, so he makes $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 a year.

To make back $300,000, it will take him $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years. 


**Answer: 4** 
"
"Okay, so Jim's bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.  He wants each piece of fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider.

That means each piece will be 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.

To find the area of one piece, we multiply length times width: 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

Since he needs two pieces, he'll need 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet of fabric. 


"
"Okay, so on Monday they delivered 425 letters.  

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's amount.  One-fifth of Monday's letters is 425 divided by 5, which is 85.  So Tuesday they delivered 85 plus 17, which is 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice the amount from Tuesday. Twice Tuesday's amount is 102 times 2, which is 204.  So Wednesday they delivered 204 plus 5, which is 209 letters.

To find the total, we add up all the days: 425 plus 102 plus 209 equals 736 letters. 



**Answer: 736**
"
"Okay, so Molly is getting food for 16 people. 10 of them want chicken salad, and that costs $6.50 per person.  So that's 10 times $6.50, which is $65.00.

Then 6 people want pasta salad, and that costs $6.00 per person.  So that's 6 times $6.00, which is $36.00.

To find the total, we add those two amounts together: $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00 


"
"Okay, so his dad lost $5 on the first race.  Then he won $11 on the second race (twice the amount he lost plus $1).  On the third race, he lost $16.50 (1.5 times the amount he won on the second race).  

To find the average loss, we add up all the money lost: $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.  Then we divide that by the number of races: $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.


**Answer: $7.17** 
"
"Okay, so there are 26 countries and each country has 5 cities with 1,000 people in each city.  

To find the total number of people, we can do this:

*  5 cities * 1,000 people/city = 5,000 people per country
*  5,000 people/country * 26 countries = 130,000 people 


There are **130,000** people in South America. 
"
"Okay, so Xavier was 4 feet tall, and that's 48 inches. He grew 3 inches, so now he's 51 inches tall. Cole was 50 inches and grew 2 inches, making him 52 inches tall.  

To find the difference, we subtract: 52 - 51 = 1 inch. 


**1** 
"
"Okay, so the first person got some money, and the second person got $80 more than that.  The third person got twice as much as the second person.  

Let's say the first person got 'x' dollars.  

* The second person got x + $80.
* The third person got 2(x + $80).

Together, they got $1920, so:

x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920

Let's simplify that:

x + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920
4x + $240 = $1920
4x = $1680
x = $420




So the first person got $420. 
"
"Okay, so they painted for 3/8 of a day each day for 3 weeks.  

First, let's figure out how many days they worked: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Then, we need to see how many total days they painted: 21 days * (3/8 day/day) = 7.875 days

Now, let's change those days into hours.  There are 8 hours in a day, so: 7.875 days * 8 hours/day = 63 hours

Finally, we divide the total hours by the number of painters: 63 hours / 4 painters = 15.75 hours/painter



**Answer: 15.75** 
"
"Okay, so Rory got 19 tennis balls total.  

* Let's say he got 'x' balls in the second set.
* He got 'x + 4' balls in the first set (four more than the second).
* He got 'x / 2' balls in the third set (half the amount from the second).

Adding those all up, we get: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

To solve for x, let's combine like terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15

Now divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6

So, Rory got 6 balls in the second set.  

In the first set, he got 6 + 4 = 10 balls. 



**Answer:** Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set. 
"
"Okay, so the car started at $20,000 and loses 21% of its value each year.  

In 2008, it lost 21% of $20,000, which is $4200.  That means it was worth $20,000 - $4200 = $15,800.

In 2009, it lost 21% of $15,800, which is about $3318. So it was worth $15,800 - $3318 = $12,482.

And in 2010, it lost 21% of $12,482, which is about $2622.  That means it was worth $12,482 - $2622 = $9860.


**Answer:** The car was worth about $9860 in 2010. 
"
"Okay, so half the books are in English, which is 50 / 2 = 25 books.  

Then 10% of the books are in German, so that's 50 * 0.10 = 5 books.

That means there are 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 books in Spanish.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1:** Find the total distance Bernice drove: 325 kilometers/day * 4 days = 1300 kilometers
* **Step 2:** Subtract the distance Bernice drove from the total distance: 1955 kilometers - 1300 kilometers = 655 kilometers

Bernice still needs to drive **655** kilometers. 


"
"Okay, so Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water each day.  There are 16 cups in a gallon, so she drinks 8 / 16 = 0.5 gallons each day.

If she does that for 30 days, she drinks 0.5 gallons/day * 30 days = 15 gallons.

"
"Okay, so Romeo starts with 120 people on the train. Then 20 more get on, so there are 140 people.  

At the next stop, 50 people get off, leaving 90. But then twice that many get on, so 50 times 2 is 100, and 90 plus 100 is 190 people.

Finally, 80 people get off at the last stop.  So 190 minus 80 is 110 people. 


**Answer: 110** 
"
"Okay, so Alison bought a tank top for $10.  Her shorts cost $5 more than the top, so they were $15.  Her shoes were originally $48, but she got them on sale for half price, which is $24.  She also got socks for $8, but she had a $2 coupon, so they only cost $6.  

If you add all that up, she spent $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55 on athletic gear. 


"
"Okay, so you have a 200 square foot floor and you want to use 1 foot by 1 foot tiles.  That means you need 200 tiles!

Each tile costs $12, so 200 tiles would cost 200 times $12, which is $2400. 


"
"Okay, so his insurance normally costs $120 a month.  Because of the accident, it went up by 60% of $120, which is $72 more.  That means he pays $120 + $72 = $192 a month now.

To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply that by 12 months: $192 * 12 = $2304


2304 
"
"Okay, so Greg does laundry for 4 twin beds and 1 king bed every week.  His washing machine can only handle 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time.  

That means he does 4 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets every week, which is a total of 5 loads.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, he does 5 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 260 loads of laundry a year! 


"
"Okay, so they watch 4 movies on Saturday and half that on Sunday, which is 2 movies.  That means they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies each weekend.

If they do that for 4 weeks, they'll watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies. 


"
"Okay, so Leo had 100 stickers two years ago. Then he got 50 more last year, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. This year he got twice as many as last year, which is 50 * 2 = 100 stickers.  

To find his total, we add up all the stickers: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers! 



"
"Imma's cats eat 180 grams of food each day (3 cats * 60 grams each).  

So 720 grams of food will last for 4 days (720 grams / 180 grams per day). 


"
"Okay, so there are 4 pizzas with 8 slices each, which means there are 4 * 8 = 32 slices in total. 

Becky ate 10 slices, and Jake ate 3 less than her, so he ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices. Silvia ate twice as many as Jake, so she ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Adding up all the slices, they ate 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices. 



"
"Okay, so Betsy took longer than Donovan.  Let's say Donovan cooked for 'x' minutes.  Betsy cooked for 'x + 18' minutes because she took 18 minutes longer.  

Together they cooked for 98 minutes, so:

x + (x + 18) = 98

That means 2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So Donovan cooked for 40 minutes. Betsy cooked for 40 + 18 = 58 minutes. 



**Answer: 58**
"
"Okay, so the cast is $200.  The doctor visit is $300 per hour, but it's only for half an hour, so that's $300 / 2 = $150.  The pills cost $4 each and she gets 30, so that's $4 * 30 = $120.  Parking is $6 per hour for two hours, so that's $6 * 2 = $12.  

Adding it all up: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482

"Okay, so James gets 80 emails a day and 20% of them don't need answers. That means 20% of 80 is 16 emails.  

He answers the rest, so he answers 80 - 16 = 64 emails each day.

Over a 5 day week, he answers 64 * 5 = 320 emails. 


"
"Okay, so on Monday, 32 classes went to the Science Center.  Tuesday had twice as many, so that's 32 times 2, which is 64 classes.  

Wednesday had three times as many as Monday, so that's 32 times 3, which is 96 classes.

Then, 30 classes came on Thursday and 25 on Friday.

To find the total, we add all those numbers together: 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247 classes.

"Okay, so Anthony sends out 700 small coupons and twice that many big coupons, which is 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

Small coupons cost 5 cents each, so 700 coupons cost 700 * 5 = 3500 cents.  That's the same as $35.00!

Big coupons cost 15 cents each, so 1400 coupons cost 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.  That's $210.00!

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the small coupons and the big coupons: $35.00 + $210.00 = $245.00 



**Answer: $245.00** 
"
"Okay, so Sidney ordered 7 meatball subs at first because she ordered 3 less than ten.  Then Mark ate 4 of them, which means there were 28 - 16 = 12 meatballs left. Sidney got 3 more subs, so that's another 12 meatballs.  In total, there were 12 + 12 = 24 meatballs left. 



"
"Okay, so Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, and each truck had 20 tons of fertilizer. That means he had a total of 20 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 400 tons of fertilizer to deliver.

Then, a quarter of the trucks broke down, which is 20 trucks / 4 = 5 trucks.  

That means 20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks made it to the farmers.

So, 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons of fertilizer reached the farmers. 


**Answer: 300** 
"
"Okay, so Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter.  He gets half off on every pound he buys, so he'll pay full price for 3 pounds and half price for 3 pounds.

Full price butter costs $4.00 a pound, so 3 pounds is $12.00.

Half price butter is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00 a pound.

So 3 pounds of half-price butter costs $6.00.

In total, it'll cost him $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00 


**18.00**

"Okay, so Kayla's party has 25 classmates + 7 dance friends + 13 family = 45 people coming.  

The theater costs $125 plus $6 for each extra person, and she has 45 - 20 = 25 extra people.

That means the extra people cost 25 * $6 = $150.

So the total cost is $125 + $150 = $275! 


"
"Okay, so Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is the same as 1/4.  A quarter of $60 is $15. That means she has $60 - $15 = $45 left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3. One-third of $60 is $20. So she has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

Together, they have $45 + $40 = $85 left. 


"
"Okay, so each monkey eats bananas for a whole week, right?  

* The first monkey eats 10 bananas a day.
* The second monkey eats 4 more than the first, so 10 + 4 = 14 bananas.
* Together, the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day.

*  Since they have 315 bananas for the whole week, that means they eat 315 / 7 = 45 bananas each day.

*  That means the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas each day.

"Okay, so Jenny buys 15 roses.  A dozen roses is 12, so she buys a little more than one dozen.  A dozen costs $15, so 15 roses cost a little more than $15.  

She pays with five $5 bills, which is $25.  

If she spends $18.75 on roses, that means she gets $6.25 back.  

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, she gets 25 quarters in change. 


"
"Okay, so Terry sells milkshakes for $5.50 each and he sells 6 of them. That's 6 times $5.50 which is $33.00.

Then he sells burger platters for $11 each and he sells 9 of them. So that's 9 times $11 which is $99.00.

Finally, he sells sodas for $1.50 each and he sells 20 of them. That's 20 times $1.50 which is $30.00.

To find out how much money he makes in total, we add all that up: $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00 




"
"Okay, so let's figure this out step-by-step:

* The first train comes in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.
* The second train comes 30 minutes after the first train leaves (so 10 + 20 = 30 minutes later), and it only stays for 5 minutes (because it's a quarter of the first train's time).
* The third train comes an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves, but it only stays for a tiny bit of time, like, zero minutes! It just comes and goes.
* Finally, Paul's train (the fourth one) comes 20 minutes after the third train leaves.

So, Paul has to wait 35 minutes in total.

**Answer:** 8 weeks 
"
"Okay, so the watch originally cost $2000, but Mr. Rogers got it for 75% of that price.  That means he paid $2000 * 0.75 = $1500.

Then he sold it to his friend for 120% of what he paid.  So his friend paid $1500 * 1.20 = $1800.

To find out the discount, we need to see how much less his friend paid than the original price: $2000 - $1800 = $200.

Finally, to find the discount percentage, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%.


**10%** 
"
"Okay, so one spring makes one jellyfish every second.  That means in an hour, it makes 60 seconds * 60 minutes = 3600 jellyfish!

If you have 5 springs, that's 3600 jellyfish/spring * 5 springs = 18,000 jellyfish per hour.

Over 4 hours, they'd make 18,000 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 72,000 jellyfish! 


"
"Okay, so Binkie scored 90 points. Frankie scored 15 more than twice Binkie's score.  

Twice Binkie's score is 90 times 2, which is 180.

Frankie scored 195 points! 


"
"Okay, so James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.  Then he walked back home, another 2 miles.  That means he walked a total of 4 miles.

Since he walks 4 miles per hour, it took him 1 hour to get to the store. 


"
"Okay, so Jenny bought 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas. That means she got 10 * 4 = 40 bananas in total.

If she bought them individually, each banana would cost $0.80, so 40 bananas would cost 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

But she bought them in bunches for $3.00 each, and she got 10 bunches, so that cost her 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

She saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00 by buying them in bunches! 


**Answer:** $2.00 
"
"Okay, so Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.  

Let's think: if Harry gets more, Sam must get less.  

To find out how much Sam gets, we can think of it like this:

*  If Sam gets 'x' feet, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet.
*  Together they have 100 feet, so x + (x + 60) = 100

Now we can solve for x:

* 2x + 60 = 100
* 2x = 40
* x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence!

"Okay, so Marcel sells three kinds of bikes: MTBs for $500, BMXs for half that price ($250), and Trek bikes for $450.  

He sold 300 bikes total. Half were Trek bikes, so that's 300 / 2 = 150 Trek bikes.

He sold 15% BMX bikes, which is 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

That means he sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now let's see how much money he made:

* Trek bikes: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
* BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
* MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

Adding it all up: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250


Marcel made $131,250 selling bikes that month!

"Okay, so the farmer makes 5 bales of hay every hour and the truck takes away 3 bales every hour.  

In a 6 hour day, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

And the truck takes away 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

That means there are 30 - 18 = 12 bales left in the field.

"
"Okay, so John has 6 periods a day, but he has 2 extra classes that are 40 minutes each. That's 80 extra minutes!

So each day he's in class for 6 periods times 40 minutes each, which is 240 minutes. Plus his extra 80 minutes, that's 320 minutes a day.

Over 5 days, that's 320 minutes a day times 5 days, which is 1600 minutes.

Then he spends 1/16 of his total time on Saturday and Sunday, which is 1600 minutes divided by 16, which is 100 minutes each day.

So on the weekend, he spends 100 minutes a day times 2 days, which is 200 minutes.

Adding that to his school time, he spends 1600 minutes + 200 minutes, which is 1800 minutes a week in class.

To change that to hours, we divide by 60 minutes an hour, so 1800 minutes divided by 60 is 30 hours.

"Okay, so the ball starts at 72 feet high because it's on the third floor.  Each bounce it goes down to 2/3 of its height.

* First bounce: 72 feet * (2/3) = 48 feet
* Second bounce: 48 feet * (2/3) = 32 feet 


So the answer is 32 feet. 
"
"Okay, so the first kid is 6 feet tall, which is 72 inches.  

The second kid is 2 inches taller, so they're 74 inches.

The third kid is 5 inches shorter than the second, so they're 69 inches.

The fourth kid is 3 inches taller than the third, so they're 72 inches tall. 


**72** 
"
"Okay, so they sold 2000 apples and each bag has 10 apples.  That means they sold 200 bags of apples (2000 / 10 = 200).  

If each bag costs $5, they made $1000 total (200 * $5 = $1000). 


"
"Okay, so the T-Rex ate half the triceratops, then the raptors ate half of what was *left*.  That means the Allosaurus ate half of *that* amount.  

If the Allosaurus ate 270 kg, that must have been half of what was left after the raptors. So, before the raptors ate, there must have been 270 kg * 2 = 540 kg.

And before the T-Rex ate, there must have been 540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg! 



"
"Okay, so the room has two walls that are 10 feet by 8 feet, and two walls that are 5 feet by 8 feet.  

To find the area of each big wall, we do 10 times 8, which is 80 square feet.  

The smaller walls are 5 times 8, which is 40 square feet each.

So, the total area of all the walls is (80 times 2) plus (40 times 2), which is 160 plus 80, which is 240 square feet.

One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so we need 240 divided by 20, which is 12 gallons of paint.

If each gallon costs $12, then 12 gallons will cost 12 times 12, which is $144. 


**Answer:** $144 
"
"Okay, so there are 2 sodas that are still shaken up.  And there are 8 sodas left in total.  That means there's a 2 out of 8 chance her friend will get sprayed.  

That's the same as 25%! 


"
"Okay, so one train goes 60 miles per hour and the other goes half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.  

They're going in opposite directions, so we add how far each one travels.

The fast train goes 60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles.

The slow train goes 30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles.

Together, they are 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles apart. 


**270** 
"
"Okay, so Billy helps 2 people every hour, and he works for 3 hours a day. That means he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people each day.

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days, so there are 31 + 19 = 50 days total.

He takes 20% of those days off, which is 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

That means he works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

If he helps 6 people each day, he helps 6 * 40 = 240 people in total. 


**Answer: 240** 
"
"We know that 12 buses with 35 people each and 20 cars with 3 people each brought people to the wedding.  

Let's figure out how many people were in the buses: 12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Now let's figure out how many people were in the cars: 20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

So, in total, 420 people + 60 people = 480 people came to the wedding.  



"
"Okay, so Mike is 24 and Martha is 4 years younger than him. That means Martha is 20.  Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so he must be 30. 


"
"Okay, so the big slide is 300 feet long and people go down at 60 feet per minute.  That means it takes 300 / 60 = 5 minutes to slide down.

The smaller slide is 240 feet long and people go down at 80 feet per minute, so it takes 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.

If the big slide takes 5 minutes and the small slide takes 3 minutes, the big slide takes 5 - 3 = 2 minutes longer. 


**Answer: 2** 
"
"Okay, so Bobby takes a 30 minute lunch every day and two 15 minute breaks, which is another 30 minutes.  That means he takes a total of 60 minutes off each day.

Over five days, that's 60 minutes a day times 5 days, which is 300 minutes.  

If there are 60 minutes in an hour, then 300 minutes is equal to 5 hours. 


"
"Okay, so Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times that amount, so Micah ran 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.  

Together, Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles.

That means Ahito ran 52 - 36 = 16 miles. 


"
"Okay, so Sheila started with $85.00 on her credit card.  She returned something for $15.00, so that's $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Then she bought a frying pan that was 20% off $20.00.  That means she saved $4.00 (20% of $20.00).  So the frying pan cost $16.00.

She also bought towels that were 10% off $30.00. That's a discount of $3.00 (10% of $30.00), so the towels cost $27.00.

Adding up everything she bought, that's $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

Finally, we add that to her remaining balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00




**113.00**
"
"Okay, so there are a bunch of jellyfish, and 1/5 of them are big.  

Out of those big jellyfish, 1/3 turn blue when the special light is on. We know 6 jellyfish turned blue.  

That means 6 jellyfish is 1/3 of the big jellyfish.  

To find out how many big jellyfish there are, we can multiply 6 by 3: 6 * 3 = 18 big jellyfish.

Since 18 big jellyfish is 1/5 of the total jellyfish, we can multiply 18 by 5 to find the total: 18 * 5 = 90 jellyfish!

"
"Okay, so Chris is 4 years old. Ben is twice as old as Chris, so Ben is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.  Caroline is three times as old as Ben, so Caroline is 8 * 3 = 24 years old. 


"
"Okay, so Lauren saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, which is $20,000 each year.  She wants to live off 40% of her salary, which is $40,000 each year.  That means she spends $20,000 more than she saves each year.  

She can't save enough money to retire if she keeps spending more than she makes!  


"
"Okay, so Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and wants to cut it into 4 pieces that are all the same size.  That means each of those big pieces will be 100 / 4 = 25 centimeters long.

Then, he cuts each of those 25 centimeter pieces into 5 smaller pieces.  So each tiny piece will be 25 / 5 = 5 centimeters long. 


**Answer: 5 centimeters** 
"
"Okay, so if 40% of the school is 240 boys, that means the whole school has to be bigger than 240 kids.  

To find the total number of kids, we can think:

* If 40% is 240, then 100% is...  bigger!

We can set up a little math problem:

* 40 / 100 = 240 /  total number of kids

To solve for the total number of kids, we can cross-multiply:

* 40 * total number of kids = 100 * 240
* 40 * total number of kids = 24000
* total number of kids = 24000 / 40
* total number of kids = 600

Now we know there are 600 kids in the school total.  To find out how many girls there are, we subtract the number of boys:

* 600 total kids - 240 boys = 360 girls



**Answer:** 360

"
"Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June, which has 30 days.  If she hikes 125 miles twice a day, that's 125 * 2 = 250 miles each day.  

To hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, she needs to hike 9,300 / 30 = 310 miles each day.

She needs to hike 310 - 250 = 60 more miles each day.

"
"Okay, so there are 3 red balls at $9 each, that's 3 times 9 which is 27 dollars.  

Then there are 11 blue balls at $5 each, so that's 11 times 5 which is 55 dollars.

And finally, there are 25 green balls at $3 each, so that's 25 times 3 which is 75 dollars.

If you add all that up, 27 plus 55 plus 75 is 157 dollars! 



"
"Okay, so Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. Peter wants a quarter of that, which is 12 divided by 4, which is 3 kg.  Paul wants a third of the apples, so that's 12 divided by 3, which is 4 kg.

Together, they take 3 + 4 = 7 kg of apples.

That means James gets to have 12 - 7 = 5 kg of apples left. 


"
"Okay, so the temperature started at 2 degrees.  It got colder by 8 degrees, so that's 2 - 8 = -6 degrees.  

Then it warmed up by 3 degrees, so -6 + 3 = -3 degrees. 


The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius. 
"
"Okay, so Raymond had $21 and saved $11 more, so that's $21 + $11 = $32. Then he spent $5 on a comic and $19 on a puzzle, so $32 - $5 - $19 = $8. 

He has $8 left. 


"
"Okay, so Anna had $16 and spent $4 already, leaving her with $12 to spend on books.  She has $2 left, so she must have spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books. Since she bought two books for the same price, each book cost $10 / 2 = $5. 


$5 
"
"Okay, so there were 50 students last year and they increased by 20%.  

To find out how many more students there are, I can multiply 50 by 0.20 (because 20% is the same as 0.20). That gives me 10 more students.

Then I add that to the original number: 50 + 10 = 60 students.

"
"Okay, so the lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.  That means it blinks 51 times every minute (because 255 divided by 5 is 51).

If we want to know how long it takes to blink 459 times, we can divide the total blinks by how many blinks it does per minute: 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes. 


**Answer:** 9 minutes 
"
"Okay, so Tate has 4 male guppies and 7 female guppies, that's 11 guppies total.  Then he has 3 male goldfishes and 5 female goldfishes, that's 8 goldfishes.

He buys 2 more male guppies, 1 more female guppy, 2 more male goldfishes, and 3 more female goldfishes.  

Let's see... that means he has 6 male guppies and 8 female guppies.  And he has 5 male goldfishes and 8 female goldfishes.

So, he has 6 + 5 = 11 male fish total. And he has 8 + 8 = 16 female fish total.

If he has 16 female fish and 11 male fish, that means he has 16 - 11 = 5 more female fish than male fish.

"
"Okay, so Amalia mowed the lawn for 4 hours. Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia, so she walked the dog for 6 hours. Dior did the laundry, and that took her more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's time, so she did laundry for 8 hours.  

To find the total time, we add up all their times: 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours. 


"
"Okay, so John drives 2 hours each way to his parents' house, which is 70 miles per hour.  

That means each way is 2 hours * 70 miles per hour = 140 miles.

Since he goes there and back, the whole trip is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

And he does that twice a month, so he drives 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles a month. 



**Answer:** 560 
"
"Okay, so Sofie walks 10 miles every day for 7 days, which is a total of 70 miles (10 x 7 = 70).  Brian walks half as much as Sofie, so he walks 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles in seven days. 


35 
"
"Okay, so 2 workers make 6 toys each per hour, so together they make 12 toys an hour.  That means in 10 hours they make 12 * 10 = 120 toys.

Then there are 2 other workers who make 4 toys each per hour, so they make 8 toys an hour together. In 10 hours, they make 8 * 10 = 80 toys.

That means all together, they made 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

But they need to make 420 toys (400 + 20 more).

So the fifth worker needs to make 420 - 200 = 220 toys.

Since they work for 10 hours, the fifth worker makes 220 / 10 = 22 toys per hour. 


"
"Okay, so Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.  Elijah's first dog is one-fourth of that, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.  Elijah's second dog is half of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.  

To find the total weight, we add up all the weights: 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds. 


"
"Okay, so Seth gave half his stickers to Luis.  Luis used half of *his* stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Kris kept 9 and gave 7 to Rob.  

To figure out how many Seth started with, we need to work backwards:

* Rob got 7 stickers, so Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.
* Kris got half of Luis's stickers, so Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.
* Luis got half of Seth's stickers, so Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers!



**Answer: 64** 
"
"Okay, so he has 3 bags of M&Ms that each weigh 10 ounces. That means he has a total of 3 * 10 = 30 ounces of M&Ms.

Since each ounce has 30 M&Ms, he has 30 * 30 = 900 M&Ms.

If he puts 10 M&Ms in each small bag, he can make 900 / 10 = 90 small bags.

**Answer: 50 days** 
"
"Okay, so the fastest car was way faster than the second fastest car.  The second fastest car was 5 times faster than a normal car, and a normal car goes 120 miles per hour.  

That means the second fastest car goes 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

The fastest car was 1.25 times faster than that, so it goes 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour! 



"
"Okay, so Liam is 16 now, and two years ago he was twice as old as Vince.  That means two years ago, Vince was 16 / 2 = 8 years old.  

Now Vince is 8 + 2 = 10 years old. 


"
"Okay, so Arnold and Madeline painted the same amount of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30.  Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so let's figure that out first.

If Sarah painted 'x' eggs, Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs.  Together they painted 30, so:

x + (x + 12) = 30

That simplifies to 2x + 12 = 30.  

Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2x = 18.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 9. So Sarah painted 9 eggs and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Arnold and Madeline painted the rest of the eggs, which is 56 total eggs - 30 eggs = 26 eggs. Since they painted the same amount, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Finally, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.



**Answer: 8** 
"
"Okay, so Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them in boxes of 8. That means he'll need 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and he has 25 boxes, so the boxes weigh 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces.

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so 200 crayons weigh 200 ounces.

That means the total weight is 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.

"
"Okay, so John cuts down a big tree that's 80 feet long. He can use 80% of it, which is like 64 feet.  He cuts that into logs that are 4 feet long each.  He gets 16 logs that way.  Then, he cuts each log into 5 planks.  That means he has 80 planks in total.  If he sells each plank for $1.20, he'll make 80 planks * $1.20 = $96.00! 


"
"Okay, so Valerie makes $5000 a month, and that's half of what her brother makes.  To find out how much her brother makes, we double Valerie's amount: $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

Then we add their salaries together: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Their mom makes twice what they both make, so we multiply their combined salary by 2: $15,000 * 2 = $30,000.

Finally, we add up everyone's salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.


45000 
"
"Okay, so Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.  We know she spends 40 minutes on the beach.

To figure out how fast she walks on the beach, we divide the distance by the time: 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, she walks 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute on the sidewalk.

Now we can find out how long it takes her to walk the mile on the sidewalk: 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

Finally, we add the time she spends on the beach and the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"
"Okay, so Bob starts with some marbles, and then gets 2 dozen more.  A dozen is 12, so that's 2 * 12 = 24 more marbles.  

That means he has 60 marbles total after getting those extra ones, so he must have had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles to begin with.

If he loses 10 marbles, he'll have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles left. 



"
"Okay, so Donny needs his water to be at least 40 degrees.  He mixes some of his 33-degree water with some hotter water.  

If he uses 4 ounces of the 33-degree water and 1 ounce of the hotter water, it has to be at least 40 degrees.  

Let's think about it:

* The 4 ounces of 33-degree water is 33 * 4 = 132 degrees.
*  The total has to be at least 40 * 5 = 200 degrees.

So, the hotter water has to be at least 200 - 132 = 68 degrees. 




"
"Okay, so his farm starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.  

Each day he gets 20 more cows and 10 more chickens.  That means in three weeks (which is 21 days) he gets:

* 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 more cows
* 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 more chickens

So now he has:

* 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows
* 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

And altogether, he has 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals! 


"
"Okay, so Russell buys 4 packs of bagels, and each pack has 9 bagels. That means he gets 4 * 9 = 36 bagels in total.  

The packs cost $10 each, so that's $10 * 4 = $40.  But he gets 10% off, which is $40 * 0.10 = $4.  So he pays $40 - $4 = $36 for all the bagels.

Finally, to find out how much each bagel costs, we divide the total price by the number of bagels: $36 / 36 = $1 per bagel. 



**Answer: $1.00**
"
"Okay, so Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, which means he ate 18 scoops.  

It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. That means it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops.

So, to make 1 scoop, it takes 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes.

Since Gomer ate 18 scoops, he ate 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

"Okay, so Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, which is 3 times 30, which is 90 eggs. Then he eats 5 eggs a day for another 30 days, so that's 5 times 30, which is 150 eggs.  

In total, he eats 90 plus 150, which is 240 eggs.  

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, he needs 240 divided by 12, which is 20 dozens of eggs. 


**Answer: 20** 
"
"Okay, so there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red ones, which is 34.  That means there are 17 + 34 = 51 red and green jellybeans.

"Okay, so there are 5 parts men and 9 parts women on the bus.  That means there are 5 + 9 = 14 parts total.

Since there are 84 people on the bus, each part is worth 84 people / 14 parts = 6 people.

That means there are 5 parts * 6 people/part = 30 men and 9 parts * 6 people/part = 54 women.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 women - 20 women = 34 women left on the bus.

"Okay, so Faraday sells sunflowers for $2 each and bouquets for $8.  

He makes $26 from selling individual sunflowers and $56 from selling bouquets each day.  

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers. So, he sells 56 / 8 = 7 bouquets each day. That means he sells 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers in bouquets.

He also sells 26 / 2 = 13 sunflowers individually each day.

In total, he sells 84 + 13 = 97 sunflowers each day.

Over three days, he sells 97 * 3 = 291 sunflowers.

"Okay, so Adam has $100 and wants to buy rocks to sell.  He can buy each rock for $5 and sell it for $7.  

If he buys all the rocks he can with his money and only sells 60% of them, he'll lose some money. Let's figure out how much!

First, he can buy 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

Then, he sells 20 * 0.60 = 12 rocks.

He makes 12 * 7 = $84 from selling the rocks.

Since he started with $100 and only made $84, he loses $100 - $84 = $16.

"Okay, so Lauren can do 5 big pictures, 6 medium pictures, or 7 small pictures each day.  

* For the big pictures, it'll take her 45 pictures / 5 pictures a day = 9 days.
* For the medium pictures, it'll take her 36 pictures / 6 pictures a day = 6 days.
* For the small pictures, it'll take her 49 pictures / 7 pictures a day = 7 days.

To do all the pictures, she'll need 9 days + 6 days + 7 days = 22 days.

"Okay, so Sid drove 110 miles in 2 hours, and then another 140 miles in 3 hours.  To find his average speed, we need to figure out the total distance and the total time.

* Total distance: 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
* Total time: 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, average speed is found by dividing the total distance by the total time:

* Average speed: 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

"Okay, so Mark has one ticket with a 20% chance of winning, and the other ticket is way better, three times more likely to win!  

That means the second ticket has a 20% * 3 = 60% chance of winning.

To find out the chances of *both* tickets winning, we multiply those chances together: 20% * 60% = 12%.


**Answer:** 12% 
"
"Okay, so Jim found 27 seashells, which is 5 more than Carlos. That means Carlos found 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.  

Since Carlos found twice as many as Carrey, Carrey must have found 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Together they found 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

If they split them evenly, each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"Okay, so the first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than that, which means it's 60/100 times 5 minutes longer.  That's 3 minutes longer!

So the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

The whole cassette is 5 + 8 = 13 minutes long.

"
"Okay, so Linus bought 2 phones for $20 each on Monday, so he spent 2 * $20 = $40.  He sold them for twice the price, so each phone sold for $20 * 2 = $40. That means he made $40 - $20 = $20 profit on each of those phones, for a total of $20 * 2 = $40 profit on Monday.

Then on Tuesday, he bought 4 phones for $20 each, spending 4 * $20 = $80. He sold them for $40 each, making $40 - $20 = $20 profit per phone. That's a total of $20 * 4 = $80 profit on Tuesday.

In total, he made $40 + $80 = $120 profit. 



"
"Okay, so Isabel is 7 feet tall. Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.  Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.  Since Carl's cane is half his height, it's 6 / 2 = 3 feet long. 


**Answer:** 3 feet 
"
"Okay, so Hortex makes 4200 bottles of carrot juice each day.  Each bottle gives you 20% of the energy you need each day.  

If we need to give 2300 people 100% of their energy for the day, how many more bottles does Hortex need to make?

Let's think:

* Each person needs 100% of their energy, and each bottle gives 20%, so each person needs 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.
*  That means 2300 people need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.
* Hortex only makes 4200 bottles now, so they need to make 11500 - 4200 = 7300 more bottles.

"Okay, so there are 8 babies total. 

3/4 of them wear purple, which is 6 babies.  The rest, 1/4, wear blue, which is 2 babies.

2 of the blue babies and 2 of the purple babies wear bows. That means 4 babies in total wear bows.

Out of those 4, 2 are purple.  

So, 2 out of 4 is 50%!

"Okay, so Abraham has 80 square meters of land. He sells half of it for $50 each, so that's 80 / 2 = 40 square meters sold for 40 * $50 = $2000.

Then he sells another quarter of the land left, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.  He sells that for $30 each, so that's 20 * $30 = $600.

Now he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sells that for $3 per square meter, so he makes 20 * $3 = $60.

Finally, he adds up all his money: $2000 + $600 + $60 = $2660.

"Okay, so Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.  Lamar found 5, Stacy found twice that, so she found 5 * 2 = 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.  

In total, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.  

That means there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hidden. 




"
"Okay, so John picks up trash from three apartment buildings. The first two have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 * 2 = 400 apartments.  The last building has 60% more apartments than the first two together, so that's 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments.  

That means the last building has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments total.

He picks up trash from all of them three times a week, so that's 640 * 3 = 1920 times a week.

He gets paid $0.40 each time, so he makes 1920 * $0.40 = $768.00 a week.

"Okay, so the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope.  And the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  

Let's say the yellow rope is 'y' centimeters long.  That means the blue rope is 'y - 7' centimeters long.  And the red rope is 4 times the blue rope, so it's 4 * (y - 7) centimeters long.

Together, all three ropes are 37 centimeters long, so:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Let's simplify that:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

So the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.  

The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter, so it's 12 - 7 = 5 centimeters long.

Finally, the red rope is 4 times the blue rope, which is 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

"Okay, so Ronnie got $5 and Rissa got three times that, which is $15.  They both gave the same amount to their sister.  Let's say they each gave 'x' dollars.

Rissa had $15 and gave away 'x', so she has $15 - x left. We know that's 4/5 of her original amount, so:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

That means $15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get:

-x = -3

So, x = $3.  That means each of them gave $3 to their sister.

Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, so he has $2 left.

"Okay, so there's this mural with red, white, purple, and yellow paint.  The yellow takes up half the mural, which is 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.  

That means the other half, 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints, is split between red, white, and purple. Since they use the same amount of each, that's 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints of red paint.

"Okay, so each bedroom is 20 feet long and 12 feet wide, which means they're 20 * 12 = 240 square feet each.  

Tom has 4 bedrooms, so that's 240 * 4 = 960 square feet for all the bedrooms.

The living room is 5 times bigger than a bedroom, so it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Then there's 1000 square feet for the rest of the house.

Adding it all up: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet!

"Okay, so there are 120 pods in the bigger box because it has 20% more than the regular box.  

If each cycle uses one pod, and the bigger box has 120 pods, you can run 120 cycles.

Since the bigger box costs the same as the regular box, you can run 120 cycles for $12.

But the question asks how many cycles you can run for $1.  So you would divide the number of cycles by 12: 120 cycles / 12 = 10 cycles.

"Okay, so Thomas takes out a bunch of $20 bills.  He loses some on the way home, then uses half of what's left to pay a bill.  After that, he somehow gets three times the money he had.  Finally, he turns all his money into $5 bills.  

To figure out how many $5 bills he has, we need to work backwards.

* **First, he triples his money:**  That means he had to have had 60 bills before he tripled it, because 60 x 3 = 180.
* **Before he tripled it, he had 60 bills:** That means he had 60 bills before he paid the bill.
* **Before he lost any bills, he had 80 bills:**  He had 60 bills after paying the bill, and he used half of them, so he had double that before.
* **He started with 80 bills:**  He took out 1000 dollars in $20 bills, which is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.


So he has **60** five dollar bills. 
"
"Okay, so Team A scored 4 goals in the first half. Team B scored 2 fewer than Team A, so they scored 2 goals.

In the second half, Team B scored 4 times as many goals as they did in the first half, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals.  Team A scored 1/4 of the number of goals Team B scored in the second half, so they scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Adding up all the goals, Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals total, and Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals total.

Together, they scored 6 + 10 = 16 goals in the whole match! 


"
"Okay, so the teacher has 5 inches of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. That means he has 55% left.

"Okay, so there are 12 boys and 12 girls, that's 24 kids total.  

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so that's 12 / 3 = 4 girls.

And one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so that's 12 / 4 = 3 boys.

That means 4 + 3 = 7 kids are on varsity.

So, 24 - 7 = 17 kids aren't on varsity.

"Okay, so James starts with 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 of them, which means he fixes 4 teeth. Then the dentist caps 7 more than that, so he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.  

That means the dentist fixed a total of 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage, we do 15 divided by 30, which is 0.5.  Then we multiply by 100% to get 50%.

"Okay, so Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk for $3.50 per gallon. That means he spent 4000 * 3.50 = $14,000 in total.

Then, 2/5 of the milk went bad, which is (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons.  

Since the bad milk cost $3.50 per gallon, the total cost of the bad milk was 1600 * 3.50 = $5600.

So Mr. Marcellus got $5600 back as a refund. 


"
"Okay, so here's how to solve this problem:

Let's say Wendy is 'w' years old and Colin is 'c' years old.

*  Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years:  w = 5(c + 7)
*  In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can use them to figure out how old Colin is now.  Let's solve for 'w' in the first equation:

w = 5c + 35

Now we can plug that into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Let's simplify that:

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3

Subtract 'c' from both sides:

25 = (2/3)c + 35/3

Subtract 35/3 from both sides:

25 - 35/3 = (2/3)c

Find a common denominator:

75/3 - 35/3 = (2/3)c

40/3 = (2/3)c

Multiply both sides by 3/2:

(40/3) * (3/2) = c

20 = c


So Colin is 20 years old. 
"
"Okay, so Bob has $27,000 to buy books for 3 schools.  He can get 100 books for $500.  

First, let's see how many times he can buy 100 books: $27,000 divided by $500 is 54.

That means he can buy 54 sets of 100 books, which is 54 * 100 = 5400 books in total.

To find out how many books each school gets, we divide the total books by the number of schools: 5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school.

"Okay, so each cheese pizza has 12 slices and each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices.  

If each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 cheese slices, that's 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 cheese slices needed.

And they each eat 4 pepperoni slices, so that's 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 pepperoni slices needed.

To get 36 cheese slices, Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas (36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas).

To get 24 pepperoni slices, she needs 3 pepperoni pizzas (24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas).

So, Kate needs to buy a total of 6 pizzas!

On the third day they used half a pack, which is 25 bandages, and got two new packs, so 100 bandages. They had 78 left at the end of the day, so they must have had 169 bandages before the third day (78 + 100 = 169).

Since they had 38 bandages left after the first day, they must have started with 131 bandages (169 - 38 - 50 = 131).

She makes $1.50 per hour, so she earns 45 times 1.50, which is $67.50 each week.

Since April has 4 weeks, she makes 67.50 times 4, which is $270.

"Okay, so John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. That means each bottle of scotch costs $60.  

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 bottles of cognac.  Cognac costs 50% more than scotch, so each bottle costs $60 plus half of $60, which is $30 more. That means each bottle of cognac costs $90.

To find out how much he spends on cognac, we multiply the number of bottles by the price per bottle: 20 bottles * $90/bottle = $1800.

Finally, to find the total cost, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

For the Lodgepole Pines, he planted 1/4 more than the first day, which is 40 / 4 = 10 more.  So he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pines on the second day.

In total, he planted 30 White Oaks + 50 Lodgepole Pines = 80 trees on the second day.

And on the first day, he planted 20 White Oaks + 40 Lodgepole Pines = 60 trees.

Adding both days together, he planted 80 + 60 = 140 trees.

"Okay, so there are 66 fish.  One-third of them have red stripes, which is 66 divided by 3, which is 22 fish.

That means 66 minus 22 equals 44 fish are left.

Five-elevenths of those fish have blue stripes, so that's 44 times 5 divided by 11, which is 20 fish.

So, there are 22 red striped fish plus 20 blue striped fish, which makes a total of 42 fish with either red or blue stripes.

Her sister takes one palette, which has 4 colors, so now she has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

She uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which is 6 / 2 = 3 colors.

"Okay, so Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times taller than him. That means the house is 60 * 7 = 420 inches tall.

The first floor is 3 times his height, so it's 60 * 3 = 180 inches high.

To find how high the roof is from the second floor, we need to figure out how tall the second floor is.  The second floor is the whole house height minus the first floor height, so it's 420 - 180 = 240 inches tall.

Finally, the roof is the whole second floor height, so the roof is 240 inches high from the second floor.

Alphas found 40% of the shells, which is the same as finding 0.40 times 700, which is 280 shells.

That means there were 700 - 280 = 420 shells left.

The Finders found 60% of the remaining shells, so they found 0.60 times 420, which is 252 shells.

Finally, Gogetters found the rest, so they found 420 - 252 = 168 shells.

* The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
* The second needs to walk 4 miles.
* The third needs to walk 3 miles.

That's a total of 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles for those three dogs.

We know all four dogs need to walk 3 miles on average, so that's 3 miles/dog * 4 dogs = 12 miles total.

To find out how much the last dog walks, we subtract the miles the other dogs walk: 12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.

Each kilogram of tuna sells for $0.50, so he'll make 128 times $0.50, which is $64.00! 


"
"Okay, so Trinity sells the magazines for more than she bought them.  She sells them for 11/8 of the price she paid, which means she makes a little extra money.

Let's see, she bought them for $72 and sells them for 11/8 of that.  That's like multiplying $72 by 1.375 (because 11/8 is the same as 1.375).

So, she sells them for $72 * 1.375 = $99.

To find her profit, we subtract what she paid from what she sold them for: $99 - $72 = $27.


**Answer:** $27 
"
"Okay, so the dehumidifier takes out 1 liter of water on low, 2 liters on medium, and 4 liters on high.

* Low setting: 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters
* Medium setting: 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters
* High setting: 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Adding it all up: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters 


**Answer: 29**
"
"Okay, so they had 10 packs of balloons and each pack had 30 balloons, right?  That means they started with 10 * 30 = 300 balloons.  Then they had 12 left over, so they threw 300 - 12 = 288 balloons. 


288 
"
"Okay, so she uses 14 mL of one medicine and 3 times that amount of the other, which is 14 * 3 = 42 mL.  

That means each dose has 14 + 42 = 56 mL of medicine.

For 8 doses, she'd need 56 * 8 = 448 mL. 


448 
"
"Okay, so Ali's class has 120 students.  John's classes each have 1/8 the size of Ali's, so each of his classes has 120 / 8 = 15 students.  Since John has two classes, that's 15 * 2 = 30 students.  

Together, they have 120 + 30 = 150 students. 


"
"Okay, so Stephen owes his sister $300 plus 2% extra.  

First, let's figure out the extra amount: 2% of $300 is $6 (because 2 out of 100 times 300 is 6).

That means he owes a total of $306.

He pays $25 each month for 11 months, which is $275 total.

To find out how much he pays in the last month, we subtract that from the total he owes: $306 - $275 = $31.




**Answer: 31**
"
"Okay, so Jordan has two kids who need 5 diapers each per day. That means they go through 2 times 5, which is 10 diapers total.  His wife changes half, so that's 10 divided by 2, which is 5 diapers.  That means Jordan changes the other 5 diapers. 


5 
"
"Okay, so the jar is a cube, right?  It's 6 inches by 6 inches by 15 inches.  That means it holds 6 times 6 times 15, which is 540 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, and they can only fit in there about 80% of the time because they're not perfectly packed. So, that means there's space for about 540 times 0.80, or 432 cubic inches worth of jelly beans.

If each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, that means there's room for 432 divided by 0.15, which is 2880 jelly beans.

Tim thinks 30% of them are red, so he'd guess there are 2880 times 0.30, or 864 red jelly beans.

But the real answer is 900 red jelly beans.  So, Tim was off by 900 minus 864, which is 36. 




"
"Okay, so the bus starts with 20 people. Then 40 more get on, so there are 20 + 40 = 60 people.

At the next stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who got on at the first stop get on, which is 30 people.  

So now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people.

The number of people doubles at the third stop, so there are 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus can hold 200 people, so there are 200 - 180 = 20 empty seats. 



**Answer:** 20 
"
"Okay, so Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year and it costs $2 each time.  

For 5 years, she goes 3 times a year * 5 years = 15 times. That costs 15 times * $2 = $30.

Then the price goes up by 150%, which is like adding another $2 to the price, so it's $5 now.

For the next 3 years, she goes 3 times a year * 3 years = 9 times. That costs 9 times * $5 = $45.

In total, she spends $30 + $45 = $75. 




"
"Okay, so there are 30 students in total, right?  And they can only fit 8 in each escape room group.  That means they'll need 30 / 8 = 3.75 groups.  

Since you can't have parts of groups, they'll need 4 groups.

If each group gets 45 minutes, it'll take 4 groups * 45 minutes/group = 180 minutes. 



"
"Okay, so John made 4 tables at $20 each, which is 4 times $20, so that's $80.  He also made 2 roof frames at $10 each, so that's 2 times $10, which is $20.  To find out how much Ali has to pay, we add those together: $80 + $20 = $100! 


100 
"
"Okay, so Ian has a 40 foot board and wants to cut it into two pieces.  The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece.  

Let's say the shorter piece is 8 feet long. That means the longer piece would be 8 times 4, which is 32 feet long.  

Does that add up to 40 feet? Yep! 


32 
"
"Okay, so Aiden makes 16 meatballs from each pound of beef and he wants 80 meatballs.  That means he needs 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of beef.

He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of beef, so he'll need 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning. 


10 
"
"Okay, so Luke needs fabric for five windows. Each window is 35 inches wide, so first we need to find the total width of all the windows.  That's 5 windows times 35 inches each, which is 175 inches.

He wants to buy fabric that's twice the width of all the windows, so he needs to buy 175 inches times 2, which is 350 inches of fabric. 


"
"Okay, so the first 16 minutes cost $0.25 each, so that's 16 times $0.25 which is $4.00.  

Then, the rest of the minutes cost $0.20 each, and there are 36 - 16 = 20 minutes left.  That's 20 times $0.20, which is $4.00 more.

Adding those together, the whole call costs $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00 




8.00"
"Okay, so it rained 2 inches on Monday.  Tuesday is supposed to rain 1 more inch than twice the amount from Monday.  

Twice the amount from Monday is 2 * 2 = 4 inches.

Then you add 1 more inch, so Tuesday will have 4 + 1 = 5 inches of rain. 


**Answer:** 5 inches 
"
"Okay, so Carly made cupcakes and brownies for her class.  She made 2 less than three times the number of brownies as cupcakes.  Her class has 5 people and each person gets 2 treats.  

Let's think about it:

*  If each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people, that means she needs to make 5 * 2 = 10 treats in total.

*  Let's say she made 'c' cupcakes. That means she made 3c - 2 brownies (three times the cupcakes minus 2).

*  Together, the cupcakes and brownies add up to 10 treats: c + (3c - 2) = 10

*  Combining like terms, we get 4c - 2 = 10

*  Adding 2 to both sides, we have 4c = 12

*  Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find out that c = 3.




**Answer:** Carly made 3 cupcakes. 
"
"Okay, so a manicure is $35 and a pedicure is $40.  That's $35 + $40 = $75 together.  

But they give you 20% off if you get both, which is like $75 times 0.20, which is $15 off! So that means it's $75 - $15 = $60 for the manicure and pedicure.

Then she wants nail art on all ten fingers, and that's $3 per nail, so that's 10 times $3, which is $30.

Finally, we add that to the price of the manicure and pedicure: $60 + $30 = $90!



"
"Okay, so Susan gets 3 magazines that each have 12 issues a year, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 issues.  Then she has one magazine with 6 issues.  The last magazine has 4 times that amount, so it has 6 * 4 = 24 issues.  

Adding all those up, she gets 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 magazines a year! 


"
"Okay, so Samantha has 27 paintings and that's 12 less than Shelley.  To find out how many paintings Shelley has, we add 12 to Samantha's amount: 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

Then we know Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so we subtract 8 from Shelley's amount: 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.


Kim has 31 paintings. 
"
"Okay, so the toy cost $40 in November.  Then it went up by 80%, which means it got more expensive by $32 (because 80% of $40 is $32).  

That makes the toy $72 in December.  

Then in January, it went down by 50%, which is half of $72, so $36.

So the toy cost $36 in January. 


"
"Okay, so Charlie makes $80 for each regular lesson and he has 4 of those. That's $80 * 4 = $320.

He gives a discount to veterans, so he makes $80 - $20 = $60 for each veteran lesson.  He has 2 veteran lessons, so he makes $60 * 2 = $120 from those.

To find his total earnings, we add those together: $320 + $120 = $440. 


"
"Okay, so to find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her quiz scores and then divide by how many quizzes she took. 

50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

There are 9 quizzes, so 630 divided by 9 is 70.


70 
"
"Okay, so Eve started with 20 pomelos.  She has 1/4 of them left, which is the same as 5 pomelos.  To find out how many she gave away, we subtract: 20 - 5 = 15

**Answer:** Eve gave away 15 pomelos. 


"
"Okay, so Walter starts with 60 apples. He eats 2/5 of them, which is like eating 24 apples.  That leaves him with 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

Then he gives his sister 25% of the remaining apples.  25% of 36 is the same as (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples.

After giving some to his sister, Walter has 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

He sells each apple to his uncle for $3, so he makes 27 * $3 = $81.


**Answer: $81** 
"
"Okay, so Regina wrote 9 books last year, and that's 3/4 of the books she wrote this year.  To find out how many she wrote this year, we can think of it like this:

If 9 books is 3 out of 4 parts, then one part is 9 / 3 = 3 books.

Since there are 4 parts total, she wrote 3 * 4 = 12 books this year! 


**Answer: 12**"
"Okay, so Michael drives 50 kilometers every hour for three whole days.  That means he drives for 24 hours a day times 3 days, which is 72 hours total.

So, he drives 50 kilometers per hour times 72 hours, which equals 3600 kilometers.

The trip from Alaska to Texas is 6000 kilometers long.  To find out what percentage of the trip Michael covered, we can divide the distance he drove by the total distance and multiply by 100%.

That's 3600 kilometers divided by 6000 kilometers, which is 0.6.  

Multiplying that by 100% gives us 60%.


**Answer:** 60% 
"
"Okay, so Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times that many to make juice, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.  

Then, their mom used 48 grapes to make pies because each pie needs 12 grapes and she made 4 pies.

In total, they used 36 grapes (6 + 30) plus the 48 grapes for the pies, so there were 84 grapes to begin with. 


"
"Here's how to solve it:

* Start with the total number of teachers: 82
* Subtract the number of sick teachers: 82 - 13 = 69
* Add the number of substitute teachers: 69 + 9 = 78


There were **78** teachers at school that day. 
"
"Okay, so Bud spends $1.00 on pasta and $3.00 on cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 times 2 = $6.00 on gruyere cheese.  That means he spends $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00 on cheese each week.

Adding the pasta, he spends $1.00 + $9.00 = $10.00 every week on mac and cheese.

In a year, there are 52 weeks, so he spends $10.00 x 52 = $520.00 on mac and cheese all year. 


"
"Okay, so the custodian cleans 80 classrooms and it takes 15 minutes per classroom. That means they spend 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes cleaning.

They work an 8 hour day, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we do 1200 / 480 * 100% = 250%. 


**Answer:** 250% 
"
"Okay, so the middle shelves each hold 10 books, and there are two of them. That's 10 * 2 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf holds twice as many as a middle shelf, so it holds 10 * 2 = 20 books.

The top shelf holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it holds 20 - 5 = 15 books.

That means each bookcase can hold 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

If Elly has 110 books, she needs 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases. 


**Answer: 2** 
"
"Okay, so Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, and each dozen cost $2.40. That means she spent 5 * $2.40 = $12.00 on the eggs.

She's selling them in sets of 3 for $1 each.  She has 5 dozens, which is 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.  That means she can sell them in 60 / 3 = 20 sets.

So, she'll make 20 * $1 = $20.00 selling the eggs.

If she made $20.00 and spent $12.00, her profit is $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00 


**Answer: $8.00** 
"
"Okay, so Skyler has 100 hats. Half of them are red, which is 50 hats.  That leaves 50 hats that aren't red.

Three-fifths of the rest are blue, so that's (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

That means there are 50 - 30 = 20 white hats. 


**Answer:** 20 
"
"Okay, so Archie gets a bag of jerky with 30 sticks for $18, but it's on sale for $3 less. That means the bag costs $15.  

To find out how much each stick costs, we divide the total price by the number of sticks: $15 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, that means each stick costs 50 cents. 


"
"Okay, so Audrey needs to get 70% of the questions right on both tests combined.  

* There are 70 questions on the first test and she got 60% right, so she got 70 * 0.60 = 42 questions right.

*  That means she needs 77 questions right in total (110 total questions * 0.70).

* To get to 77, she needs 77 - 42 = 35 questions right on the second test. 



**Answer: 35** 
"
"Okay, so Mary made strawberry ice cubes and blueberry ice cubes.  She made 5 times as many blueberry cubes as strawberry cubes, but also had to take away 4.  If she made 116 ice cubes total, how many blueberry cubes did she make?

Let's think:

* If we let 's' stand for the number of strawberry cubes, the blueberry cubes would be 5s - 4.
*  Together, they make 116 cubes: s + (5s - 4) = 116

Now we can solve for 's':

*  6s - 4 = 116
*  6s = 120
*  s = 20  (So she made 20 strawberry cubes)

Finally, let's find the blueberry cubes:

* Blueberry cubes = 5 * 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

"Ara has been playing basketball for four years and scores 21 points in each game. If she plays 40 games every year, how many points has she scored in total?

Here's how to figure it out:

* First, find out how many games she's played in total: 4 years * 40 games/year = 160 games
* Then, multiply the number of games by her points per game: 160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points


3360 
"
"Okay, so Brendan starts with 10 marbles. He drops half, which is 5. Then he finds 3, so he has 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.  But wait, one of them is a bead, not a marble!  So he's left with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles. 


"
"Okay, so Jason needs to sell 15 cars.  He knows that for every 25 calls he makes, one person comes to the dealership.  And then, for every 2 people who come to the dealership, one buys a car.

So first, we need to figure out how many people he needs to get to the dealership. Since 1 out of every 2 people who come in buys a car, he needs twice as many people to come in as cars he wants to sell. That means he needs 15 cars * 2 = 30 people to come to the dealership.

Now, he needs 25 calls for every person who comes in, so he needs to make 30 people * 25 calls/person = 750 calls.



**Answer:** 750 
"
"Okay, so there are 4 people and each person gets a flashlight, so that's 4 flashlights.  

Then there are 8 rooms, and they have 2 flashlights per room, so that's 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights.

They have 4 rooms with 4 small candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles.

And they have 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles.

Adding it all up: 4 flashlights + 16 flashlights + 16 candles + 20 candles = 56 light sources.




"
"Okay, so Mitchell has 2 bags of chips with 55 chips in each bag. That means he has 2 times 55, which is 110 chips total.  If he's sharing with 5 people, each person gets 110 divided by 5, which is 22 chips. 


22 
"
"Okay, so it takes John 5 minutes for the first side.  The next two sides take twice as long, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 minutes each.  

Then the last two sides take half the time of the first side, so that's 5 minutes divided by 2, which is 2.5 minutes each.

Adding it all up: 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes. 


**30**
"
"Okay, so there are 20 helmets.  Since there are half as many robots as helmets, there are 20 / 2 = 10 robots.  

And there are twice as many footballs as helmets, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

In total, there are 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 things in the changing room. 



"
"Okay, so Tim works 6 hours a day, and each call takes 15 minutes.  That means he has 6 hours times 60 minutes in an hour, which is 360 minutes each day to answer calls.  

Then, we divide the total minutes by the time per call: 360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

Finally, he works 5 days a week, so he answers 24 calls a day times 5 days a week, which is 120 calls a week! 


"
"Okay, so Louise needs to varnish 6 paintings.  

With the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes per painting, so that's 6 times 7, which is 42 minutes total.

With the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes per painting, so that's 6 times 12, which is 72 minutes total.

To find out how much longer the new varnish takes, we subtract: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.


**Answer: 30 minutes** 
"
"Okay, so Crista has 20 plants.  

* 4 plants need half a cup of water, so that's 4 * (1/2) = 2 cups.
* 8 plants need a full cup of water, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups.
* The rest of the plants (20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants) need a quarter cup each, so that's 8 * (1/4) = 2 cups.

Adding it all up: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups!

"
"Okay, so Phineas has to go 200 yards back home.  He goes half the distance on land and half in water.  

* On land, he hops 20 yards every minute, so for 100 yards it'll take him 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

* In the water, he swims 10 yards every minute, so for 100 yards it'll take him 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

*  In total, it takes him 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes to get home. 



**Answer: 15** 
"
"Okay, so Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box has 8 sticks.  That means he needs 56 / 8 = 7 boxes.  

If each box costs $2.00, then 7 boxes will cost 7 * $2.00 = $14.00 


$14.00 
"
"Okay, so the main phone is twice as expensive as the other phones.  If the main phone is $20, that means each of the other phones costs $20 / 2 = $10.

There are four other phones, so they cost a total of $10 * 4 = $40.

Adding the cost of the main phone, the whole plan costs $20 + $40 = $60. 


"
"Okay, so Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts a day, and a dozen has 12 doughnuts. That means he makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts every day.

If each doughnut sells for $2, he makes 120 * $2 = $240 each day.

June has 30 days, so he makes $240 * 30 = $7200 in June. 


"
"Jade takes 210 pictures and wants to upload them to Instagram. She uploads 7 pictures at a time and does that 6 times a day.  How many days will it take her to upload all her pictures?

Let's figure that out!

* She uploads 7 pictures * 6 times a day = 42 pictures each day.
* To upload all 210 pictures, it will take her 210 pictures / 42 pictures a day = 5 days. 


**Answer: 5 days** 
"
"Okay, so Alicia takes 5 blouses, 2 pants, and 1 skirt to the dry cleaners each week.  

* Blouses cost $5 each, so 5 blouses cost 5 * $5 = $25.
* Pants cost $8 each, so 2 pants cost 2 * $8 = $16.
* The skirt costs $6.

That means each week, dry cleaning costs $25 + $16 + $6 = $47.

Over 5 weeks, that's $47 * 5 = $235. 



"
"Okay, so John can talk 150 words per minute normally.  After training, he's 2.5 times faster, which means he talks 150 * 2.5 = 375 words per minute.

He needs to talk 10 pages, and each page has 450 words, so that's 10 * 450 = 4500 words total.

To find out how long it takes, we divide the total words by his new talking speed: 4500 words / 375 words per minute = 12 minutes. 


**Answer:** 12 minutes 
"
"Okay, so Conor saw 50 people on the first day.  The next day, there were 20 more people, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 people.  Then on the third day, there were twice as many people as the second day, which is 70 * 2 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week, he saw an average of 60 people each day, so that's 60 * 4 = 240 people.

To find the total, we add up all the days: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400 people.


**Answer:** 400 
"
"Okay, so first, 20 kernels pop in the first 30 seconds. Then, three times that amount pops in the next 30 seconds, so that's 20 times 3, which is 60 kernels.  

The next 30 seconds, four times the first amount pops, so that's 20 times 4, which is 80 kernels.  

Then, the last 30 seconds, half the amount from the previous 30 seconds pops, so that's 80 divided by 2, which is 40 kernels.

Finally, a quarter of the last amount pops from the leftover heat, so that's 40 divided by 4, which is 10 kernels.

Adding all those up: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels! 


"
"Okay, so Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice for every gallon of lemonade.  He's making 4 gallons, so that's 4 cups of juice.  Since 6 lemons make 1 cup of juice, he'll need 4 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons for the main batch.

Then Allen wants a gallon that's twice as tart, so Tim needs to use twice the lemon juice for that one. That means he needs 1 cup * 2 = 2 cups of juice for Allen's gallon.  

That's 2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons for Allen's lemonade.

In total, Tim needs 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons. 



"
"Okay, so there are 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs.  

German Shepherds eat 5 kg of food each per day, so 3 of them eat 3 * 5 = 15 kg.

Bulldogs eat 3 kg each per day, so 2 of them eat 2 * 3 = 6 kg.

That means they eat a total of 15 + 6 = 21 kg of food each day.

In a week, there are 7 days, so they eat 21 * 7 = 147 kg of food. 


**Answer: 147** 
"
"Okay, so there are 10 two-legged animals and 15 four-legged animals.  

That means there are 10 * 2 = 20 legs from the two-legged animals.

And there are 15 * 4 = 60 legs from the four-legged animals.

In total, there are 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

Since each pair of legs has two legs, there are 80 / 2 = 40 pairs of legs. 


40 
"
"Okay, so there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, which is 4 times 2 = 8 yellow blocks.  

That means there are 4 + 8 = 12 blue and yellow blocks together.

If there are 32 blocks total, then there must be 32 - 12 = 20 red blocks. 


"
"Okay, so Elvis drove west for 5 hours at 18 miles per hour, which means he went 5 * 18 = 90 miles.  Then he drove east for 8 hours at the same speed, so he went 8 * 18 = 144 miles.  Since he drove farther east, he's 144 - 90 = 54 miles from his house. 


**Answer:** 54 miles 
"
"Okay, so the boat started at $9000.  

The first year it lost 30% of its value, which is like taking 30 out of every 100 dollars.  So it lost $2700 (30% of 9000). That means it was worth $6300 after the first year.

The second year, it lost another 30%, so it lost another $1890.  That means it was worth $4410.

The third year, it lost 20%, which is $882.  

So after three years, the boat is worth $3528. 




"
"Okay, so there are 232 Starbursts total.  There are 54 red ones, and twice as many orange, so that's 54 times 2, which is 108 orange candies.  Then there are half as many yellow as red, so 54 divided by 2 is 27 yellow candies.  

If you add up the red, orange, and yellow candies, you get 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.  

That means there are 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies! 



"
"Okay, so Helen stayed in a hotel for 3 nights and each night cost $80. That means the hotel cost her 3 * $80 = $240.

She also took the bus 7 times, and each bus ride cost 10% of $80, which is $8.  So, the bus rides cost her 7 * $8 = $56.

To find the total cost of her trip, we add the hotel cost and the bus cost: $240 + $56 = $296. 


"
"Okay, so Mazie gave 52 marbles away to Dallas and Darla.  Dallas dropped 4 marbles, so he must have had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.  

If Dallas has 25 marbles, then Darla must have gotten 52 - 25 = 27 marbles. 


"
"Okay, so they have to pay for adult tickets, a kid's ticket, and popcorn.  

* Adult tickets are $12 each.
* A kid's ticket is $8.
* Two popcorns cost $3 each, so that's $3 x 2 = $6.

To figure out the total, I need to know how many adults are going! 


"
"Okay, so the car weighs 1200 pounds, and there's 250 pounds of stuff in it.  His kids weigh 75 pounds each, and there are two of them, so that's 75 * 2 = 150 pounds.

That means the total weight is 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds.

If it takes 1% of the weight to move the car, that's 1600 * 0.01 = 16 pounds.

"
"To find out how much crepe paper James needs, we have to figure out the total length of all the sides of his fence.  

Since his fence is a rectangle, we can do that with this formula:

* Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

He needs 20 feet of paper for the long side and 15 feet for the short side. So:

* Perimeter = 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet)
* Perimeter = 2 * 35 feet
* Perimeter = 70 feet 


**Answer:** James needs 70 feet of crepe paper. 
"
"Okay, so Mia is 40 and Emma is 16 years older than her. That means Emma is 40 + 16 = 56 years old.  

To find the average age, we add their ages together (40 + 56 = 96) and then divide by 2.  

So the average age is 96 / 2 = 48. 



"
"Okay, so Tom found 214 seashells, Nancy found 432, and Benny found 86.  That's a lot of shells!

First, we need to add up how many they found in total: 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells.

Then, we know 67 were cracked, so we subtract those: 732 - 67 = 665 seashells.


They found 665 good seashells together. 
"
"Okay, so each place setting costs $6 for the dinner plate plus $4 for the salad plate plus $5 for the bowl. That's $15 for each setting.  Since she needs 12 place settings, she'll spend $15 times 12, which is $180. 


180.00 
"
"Okay, so Steve took 10 hours to do the puzzle.  Anna took 2 hours longer than half of Steve's time.  

Half of Steve's time is 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours.

So Anna took 5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours. 


**Answer:** 7 hours 
"
"Okay, so Dexter's pigs eat 4 pounds of feed twice a day, which is 8 pounds each pig per day.  Since he has 5 pigs, they eat a total of 8 * 5 = 40 pounds of feed every day.

Over a week, that's 40 pounds/day * 7 days/week = 280 pounds of feed.

If he started with 300 pounds, he'll have 300 - 280 = 20 pounds left. 


**20** 
"
"Okay, so John needs 20 guests * 2 hot dogs each, which is 40 hot dogs.  He has 4 already, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 more hot dogs.

Each pack has 6 hot dogs, so he needs to buy 36 / 6 = 6 packs.

If each pack costs $2, he'll spend 6 * $2 = $12. 


**Answer:** $12 
"
"Okay, so Frances makes $2 for each cupcake and she sells 20 cupcakes, so that's 2 times 20 which is $40.  She also sells 40 cookies for $1 each, so that's 40 times 1 which is $40.  That means she made a total of $40 plus $40, which is $80.  She spent $20 on trays, so she has $80 minus $20, which is $60 left. 


"
"Okay, so there are 5 kids at first. Then on the second street, each kid gets a friend, so there are 5 times 2 kids, which is 10.  

On the third street, each of those 10 kids gets TWO more friends, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 kids.  

But then 5 kids leave, so there are 20 - 5 = 15 kids left. 



**Answer: 15** 
"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Start with the total meals:** Mamou has 1,360 meals.
* **Add up the meals given out:** 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals
* **Subtract the meals given out from the total:** 1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals

Mamou has **1,218** meals left to distribute. 


"
"Okay, so James has a quarter, which is worth 25 cents.  He also has two nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 cents.  Finally, he has seven dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents, so that's 7 * 10 = 70 cents.  

To find the total, we add it all up: 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents! 


"
"Okay, so there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.  The sisters are all 16, so that's 3 * 16 = 48 years old.  One brother is 12, and the other brother is twice that age, so he's 12 * 2 = 24.  That means the brothers are a total of 12 + 24 = 36 years old.  

Adding the sisters' ages and the brothers' ages, we get 48 + 36 = 84 years old. 



"
"Okay, so Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, which is 30 minutes total each day.  

That means in a week she meditates for 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes.

She also does yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week, which is 5 hours total or 300 minutes.

So in a week she does 210 minutes + 300 minutes = 510 minutes of meditation and yoga.

Over 4 weeks, that's 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes. 



"
"Okay, so Octavia's using small, medium, and large t-shirts for her quilt.  

* Small shirts are 3 square feet each, and she's using 11 of them, so that's 3 * 11 = 33 square feet.
* Medium shirts are 4 square feet each, and she's using 8 of them, so that's 4 * 8 = 32 square feet.
* Large shirts are 6 square feet each, and she's using 6 of them, so that's 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

To find the total, we add it all up: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.


101 
"
"Okay, so a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and a dozen has 12 seeds, right?  That means a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.  Fifty percent of 36 is half of it, so that's 36 / 2 = 18 more seeds.

That means a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Together, they have 36 + 54 = 90 sunflower seeds. 



"
"Okay, so George has 18 pens. Timothy has three times that amount, so Timothy has 18 * 3 = 54 pens.  Sarah has half the number of pens Timothy has, so Sarah has 54 / 2 = 27 pens. 


"
"Okay, so Albert is 36 inches tall. Anne is twice as tall as Albert, so Anne is 36 * 2 = 72 inches tall.  Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72 - 2 = 70 inches tall now.  Since Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, she was 70 - 3 = 67 inches tall before summer. 


**Answer:** 67 
"
"Okay, so they make 5000 chocolate bars each day and sell each bar for $2.  

There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks they make 5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars.

If they sell each bar for $2, they'll make 70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000. 


"
"Okay, so Jake gets two T-shirts for half off, which means each shirt costs $8 - $4 = $4.  That's $4 x 2 = $8 for the shirts.

The shoes were originally $40, but he saves 40% which is $40 x 0.40 = $16. So the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

In total, Jake spends $8 + $24 = $32 at the store. 


"
"Okay, so Ryan gets $6 each week for doing his chores.  He did them for 3 weeks, so he earned $6 x 3 = $18.

Then he bought ice cream for himself and 3 friends, and each cone cost $1.25. That's $1.25 x 4 cones = $5.00.

After buying ice cream, he has $18 - $5.00 = $13.00 left.

Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $13.00 / $6.50 = 2 tickets. 



"
"Okay, so Ellen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a photo frame, which is $105 total.  Lani spent $30 on sunglasses and $100 x 2 = $200 on bathrobes, so she spent $230. Together they spent $105 + $230 = $335. 


"
"Okay, so Tim makes this cool honey and jam mix.  

* Each jar needs 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 a pound, so that's 2 * 6 = $12.
* He also needs 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 a pound, which is 1.5 * 8 = $12.
* And don't forget 2 pounds of honey at $10 a pound, so that's 2 * 10 = $20.

That means each jar costs him $12 + $12 + $20 = $44 to make.

He sells each jar for $50, so he makes $50 - $44 = $6 profit on each jar.

If he sells 10 jars, he'll make $6 * 10 = $60 in profit! 



"
"Okay, so there are 32 quarters, which is $8.00.  Then there are 95 dimes, which is $9.50.  

There are 120 nickels, so that's $6.00. And finally, 750 pennies is $7.50.

If you add all that up, it's $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00 



"
"Okay, so Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 each for her and her sister on movie tickets, so that's $7.50 x 2 = $15.00.  Then she spent $8.50 on a bracelet.  

That means she spent a total of $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00.

If her parents gave her $40.00, she has $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00 left. 


13.00 
"
"Okay, so Josh fixes 3 cars each day he's open.  He's closed on Sunday and Wednesday, so that's 5 days a week he's working.  

That means he fixes 3 cars/day * 5 days/week = 15 cars each week.

He makes $4 for each car, so he earns $4/car * 15 cars/week = $60 each week.

Over two weeks, he'd make $60/week * 2 weeks = $120. 



"
"Okay, so Randy starts with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies. That's 18 cookies in total.

He eats 3 cookies, one of each kind, so that's 3 cookies gone. Then he eats 2 oatmeal cookies, so that's 5 cookies gone total.

He gives away 2 sugar cookies, leaving him with 13 cookies.

Finally, he bakes 4 of each kind, so that's 12 more cookies!

13 + 12 = 25 cookies! 


"
"Okay, so Matthew has 12 toy soldiers and wants to sell them.  He's got a buyer who'll pay $5 for half of them and $7 for the other half.  

Let's figure out how much he'd make:

* Half his soldiers is 12 / 2 = 6 soldiers.
* He'd get 6 * $5 = $30 for the first half.
* Then he'd get 6 * $7 = $42 for the other half.

* In total, he'd make $30 + $42 = $72! 




"
"Okay, so the dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, which is 6 times 14, which is 84 holes.  

Then Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 more, so he's really only filling in 9 minus 6, which is 3 holes each day.

To fill 84 holes, it'll take him 84 divided by 3, which is 28 days.

And since there are 7 days in a week, it'll take him 28 divided by 7, which is 4 weeks. 


**Answer: 4 weeks** 
"
"Okay, so Norman High has 4000 students. Butler High has 3/4 of that, which is like finding 3 out of every 4 groups of 1000.  That's 3000 students.

To find the difference, we subtract: 4000 - 3000 = 1000 students.


**Answer: 1000** 
"
"Okay, so they made 7995 cookies total.  

They made 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies.  

To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made, we need to subtract those from the total:

7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2325 


They made 2325 chocolate chip cookies! 
"
"Okay, so Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.  Igor messed up a bit! He only got 8 test tubes (half of what was asked for) and 16 Petri dishes (2 more than asked for).  

We know he had 29 things on the bench in the end.  If he had 8 test tubes and 16 Petri dishes, that's 8 + 16 = 24 things already.  

So, he must have lost 29 - 24 = 5 beakers. 




**Answer:** 5 
"
"Okay, so James needs screws for 4 tables, and each table has 4 legs. That means he needs screws for 4 times 4, which is 16 legs.  

Since each leg needs 2 screws, he'll need 16 times 2, or 32 screws in total.  

If he starts with 40 screws, he'll have 40 minus 32, which is 8 screws left over. 


8 
"
"Okay, so there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many in the second basket.  That means there are 10 times 2, which is 20 eggs in the second basket.  

If you add the eggs from both baskets together, you get 10 plus 20, which is 30 eggs. 


30 
"
"Okay, so Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than her, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.  Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $400 + $300 = $700.  

To find the total, we add it all up: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180 


"
"Okay, so Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron ran half that, which is 2 miles.  Aaron finished in 16 minutes, so he ran at a speed of 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute. Vanessa ran twice as slow as Aaron, so she ran at 0.125 miles per minute / 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute.  To find out how long it took her to run 4 miles, we do 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute = 64 minutes. 


**Answer:** 64 minutes 
"
"Okay, so he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and he has 200 feet of dock.  That means he needs 200 * 3 = 600 feet of line in total.  But he already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 feet more. 


**Answer:** 594 
"
"Okay, so Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations each night.  They make $5 x 2 = $10 from the meals and then another $5 from the wine, so that's $10 + $5 = $15 per reservation.

Since they're open 2 days a week, they make $15 x 6 = $90 each day.

Over the whole week, they make $90 x 2 = $180. 


"
"Okay, so the fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.  That means each watermelon cost $80 / 50 = $1.60.

He made a 25% profit, which means he made $1.60 x 0.25 = $0.40 more on each watermelon.

So, each watermelon sold for $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00 



**Answer: $2.00** 
"
"Okay, so John had James when he was 19, and James is twice as old as his sister Dora. Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she's 9 now. That means James is 9 times 2, which is 18.

John is now 19 + 18 = 37 years old.  He had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, his youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old. 


**8**"
"Okay, so Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes and Jane takes 4 minutes.  That means in an hour (which is 60 minutes), Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.  Jane can only peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges in the same amount of time.  

So Ana peels 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane. 


**Answer:** 5 
"
"Okay, so Mark's radiator cost $400 but he got it for 80% off at a junk shop. That means he saved $400 * 0.80 = $320.  

The radiator only cost him $400 - $320 = $80.

Then he paid a mechanic $50 per hour for 3 hours of work, so that was $50 * 3 = $150.

Adding it all up, he paid $80 + $150 = $230 for the whole thing. 



"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they have 70 legs in total.  Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs.  

Let's think about it:

* If all the animals were cows, they'd have 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs. That's too many!

* So, there must be some chickens.  

Let's try figuring out how many chickens there could be. If there were 10 chickens, that's 10 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 20 legs.  That leaves 70 total legs - 20 legs = 50 legs for the cows.  But that means there would be 50 legs / 4 legs/cow = 12.5 cows, which isn't possible since we can't have half a cow!

Let's try a smaller number of chickens.  What if there are 5 chickens? That's 5 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 10 legs.  That leaves 70 total legs - 10 legs = 60 legs for the cows.  That means there would be 60 legs / 4 legs/cow = 15 cows.

That works! 


**Answer:** There are **5** chickens. 
"
"Okay, so there are 7 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices, which means there are 7 * 8 = 56 slices in total.  

Henry and his 3 friends are 4 people altogether.  

If they share the slices equally, each person gets 56 / 4 = 14 slices.
