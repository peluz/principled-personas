"Let's break this problem down methodically.

First, we need to determine the amount of water in each drink. The orange drink is two-thirds water, so in 10 liters, there are (2/3) * 10 liters = 6.67 liters of water.  The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, meaning it contains (3/5) * 15 liters = 9 liters of water.

However, we must account for the spilled orange drink. This reduces the water content of the orange drink by 1 liter, leaving us with 6.67 liters - 1 liter = 5.67 liters.

"Let's break this problem down systematically.  

Let 'g' represent the number of gold coins and 's' represent the number of silver coins. We know:

*  g + s = 110 (The total number of coins)
*  g = s + 30 (There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

We can use substitution to solve for 'g'.  Substitute the second equation into the first:

Combine like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

s = 40

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

g = s + 30

g = 40 + 30

g = 70



Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Let's break this problem down geometrically.  

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we're dealing with a geometric sequence.  We know the first term (the top level) is 16 square feet.  To find the total square footage of all levels, we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Where:

* S = the sum of the series
* a = the first term (16)
* r = the common ratio (1/2)
* n = the number of terms (4)

Plugging in our values:

S = 16 (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
S = 16 (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 (15/16) * 2
S = 30 square feet

Finally, to find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

Average = 30 / 4 = 7.5 square feet

    * We know d + c - 12 = r (the number of rabbits is 12 less than the total dogs and cats)

* **Substitute to solve for the number of rabbits:**
    * Since c = 2d, we can substitute '2d' for 'c' in the second equation: d + 2d - 12 = r
    * This simplifies to 3d - 12 = r

* **Use the given information about dogs to find 'd':**
    * We know d = 60 (there are 60 dogs)

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces and places 25% of them, which is (25/100) * 1000 = 250 pieces.  This leaves 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces remaining.

Her mom then places one-third of the remaining pieces, which is (1/3) * 750 = 250 pieces.

Finally, we subtract the number of pieces her mom placed from the remaining pieces to find the number left: 750 - 250 = 500 pieces.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Outer Dimensions:** Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
* **Wall Thickness:** The walls are 1 inch thick.
* **Inner Dimensions:**  To find the usable space, we subtract the wall thickness from each dimension: 
    * Length: 5 inches - 1 inch - 1 inch = 3 inches
    * Width: 6 inches - 1 inch - 1 inch = 4 inches
    * Height: 4 inches - 1 inch - 1 inch = 2 inches

* **Volume of One Box:**  Volume is calculated by multiplying length, width, and height: 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

* **Total Volume:** Since there are three boxes, the total inner volume is 24 cubic inches/box * 3 boxes = 72 cubic inches.

"Let's break down Frankie's TV watching habits:

* **Monday & Tuesday:** He watched a total of 2 hours (1 hour/night * 2 nights).
* **Thursday:** He watched 1.5 hours (1 hour + 0.5 hours).
* **Friday:** He watched 2 hours (1 hour/episode * 2 episodes).

This means he spent 5.5 hours watching TV across Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday (2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5).

Since he watched a total of 7 hours, he must have spent 1.5 hours watching TV on Wednesday (7 - 5.5 = 1.5).

Finally,  he watched 3 thirty-minute episodes on Wednesday (1.5 hours / 0.5 hours/episode = 3 episodes).

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

* Let 'x' represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

* This year, he baked twice the amount from last year, so he baked 2x cookies.

* He ended up with 15 more cookies than intended, meaning he baked 2x + 15 cookies.

*  After dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110

* Simplifying the equation: 2x + 10 = 110

* Subtracting 10 from both sides: 2x = 100

* Dividing both sides by 2: x = 50



Therefore, Henry baked **50** cookies last year.

"Let's break this problem down systematically.  

Let Seth's current age be represented by the variable 's' and Brooke's current age by 'b'.  We are given two key pieces of information:

*  ""Seth is twice as old as Brooke"": This translates to the equation s = 2b.
*  ""In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28"": This gives us the equation (s + 2) + (b + 2) = 28.

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. s = 2b
2. s + b + 4 = 28

We can solve for 's' (Seth's age) using substitution.  Substitute the value of 's' from equation 1 into equation 2:

2b + b + 4 = 28

Combine like terms:

3b + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3b = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

b = 8

Now that we know Brooke is 8 years old, we can find Seth's age using equation 1:

s = 2 * 8

s = 16



Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"Let's break down this probability problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a standard six-sided die. There are three favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of a total of six possible outcomes.  Therefore, the probability is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2.

Next, consider the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.  The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6, or 1/2.  Given that the first roll was even, the probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is also 1/2. To get the probability of both events happening, we multiply these probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Finally, to find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

Converting this to a percentage, we get (1/4) * 100% = 25%.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Half a dozen plates:**  This means 6 plates. Since each plate costs $6000, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

* **Cost of twenty dozen cups:** We know this is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates, so it's $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

* **Cost per cup:** Twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.  To find the cost of a single cup, divide the total cost by the number of cups: $34800 / 240 cups = $145/cup.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let 's' represent the current amount of water in the small pool.  Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, the big pool has 4s gallons.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the amount of water the small pool had.  Let's say the small pool had 's + 16' gallons four minutes ago. This means the big pool had 2(s + 16) gallons four minutes ago.

Both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, so in the past four minutes, each pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now we can set up an equation:

* Big pool now: 2(s + 16) - 16 = 4s 

Simplifying the equation:

* 2s + 32 - 16 = 4s
* 16 = 2s
* s = 8


**Therefore, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water.**

* **Let 'x' represent the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.**

* **Tallest trees:** Joanne gathered 30 apples, and her sister gathered twice that amount (60 apples).

* **Shortest trees:** Joanne gathered 15 apples (half the amount from the tallest trees), and her sister gathered three times that amount (45 apples).

* **Total apples:** Joanne's total is 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x, and her sister's total is 60 + 45 = 105.

* **Combined total:**  Their combined total is (45 + x) + 105 = 500

* **Solve for x:** 
    * 150 + x = 500
    * x = 500 - 150
    * x = 350



**Answer: Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.**

"This problem can be solved using a system of equations.  

Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries. We know:

* **Heads:** c + d = 180 
* **Humps:** 2c + d = 304

We can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries) using substitution.  Solve the first equation for 'c':

c = 180 - d

Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:

2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':

360 - 2d + d = 304
-d = -56
d = 56



Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries in the herd.

"Let's break down Tom's journey:

* **First four days:** He travels 200 kilometers each day, accumulating 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.
* **Next two days:** He covers 30% of the distance from the first four days, which is 0.30 * 800 = 240 kilometers.
* **Total for the first six days:**  800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.
* **Second week:** He travels 300 kilometers each day for seven days, totaling 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.
* **Total trip distance:** Adding the distances from both weeks, we get 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.



Therefore, Tom traveled a total of **3140** kilometers.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* Let 'T' represent the size of Timothy's locker.
* Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's, so Zack's locker is T/2.
* Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's, meaning Peter's locker is (T/2) * (1/4) = T/8.

We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so T/8 = 5.  

To solve for T, multiply both sides of the equation by 8: T = 40.



**Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.**

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Understanding Area:** The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, which is equal to 9 feet (since there are 3 feet in a yard).

* **Finding the Width:**  We can use the area formula to find the width: 360 square feet = 9 feet * width.  Dividing both sides by 9 feet, we get a width of 40 feet.

* **Calculating the Perimeter:** The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding up the lengths of all its sides.  Since opposite sides of a rectangle are equal, we can use the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).  Plugging in our values, we get Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.



**Therefore, the perimeter of Billie's bedroom is 98 feet.**

"Let's break down this insect-collecting problem step-by-step.

*  Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
*  Let 'D' represent the number of insects David found.
*  Let 'L' represent the number of insects Lily found.

We know:

* L + D + B = 43  (The total number of insects)
* L = D + 7       (Lily found 7 more than David)
* D = B / 2        (David found half of what Bodhi found)

Substituting the second and third equations into the first, we get:

(D + 7) + D + (D * 2) = 43

Simplifying:

4D + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

4D = 36

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

* Let 'M' represent the number of goals Mark scored.
* Let 'A' represent the number of goals Anna scored.

We know Richie scored 80 goals, and that's 20 more than Mark:  R = M + 20

We also know Richie scored 45 more than Anna: R = A + 45

Since Richie's goals are represented by 'R' in both equations, we can set them equal to each other: M + 20 = A + 45

Now we can solve for Mark's goals (M):

* Subtract 20 from both sides: M = A + 25

We know Richie scored 80 goals, so substitute that into either of the original equations to solve for Anna's goals (A):

* 80 = A + 45
* Subtract 45 from both sides: A = 35

Now that we know Anna scored 35 goals, we can find Mark's goals:

* M = A + 25
* M = 35 + 25
* M = 60

Finally, to find the total goals scored, add up the goals for each teenager:

* Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
* Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175

"Let's break this problem down systematically.

Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.  We know:

* Red jelly beans: 0.99b (1% fewer than blue)
* Green jelly beans: 1.01b (1% more than blue)

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so:

"Let's break down this culinary conundrum step-by-step.

*  Let 'x' represent the cooking time for the rice.
*  Pork takes 20 minutes longer than rice, so its cooking time is 'x + 20'.
*  Beans take half the time of rice and pork combined, meaning their cooking time is (x + x + 20) / 2 = (2x + 20) / 2 = x + 10.

*  The total cooking time is the sum of all three: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 3x + 30

We know rice takes 30 minutes to cook, so x = 30.  

Substituting this back into our total cooking time equation: 3(30) + 30 = 90 + 30 = 120 minutes.

* **Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so Max has x + 12 cookies.**

* **Katarina has 5 fewer cookies than Max, meaning she has (x + 12) - 5 = x + 7 cookies.**

* **Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so she has (x + 12) + 23 = x + 35 cookies.**

* **We know Katarina has 68 cookies, so x + 7 = 68.**

* **Solving for x, we find x = 61 (the Cookie Monster's cookies).**

* **Now we can find the total cookies:** 61 + (61 + 12) + 68 + (61 + 35) = 298 cookies.



**Therefore, they have a total of 298 cookies.**

"Let 'x' represent the original length of the dress.  

The dress was extended by 50%, which is equivalent to 0.50x.  The total length after the extension is x + 0.50x = 1.50x.

Adding the 20cm lace trim brings the final length to 1.50x + 20cm.  We know this final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.50x + 20 = 140

Subtracting 20cm from both sides, we get:

1.50x = 120cm

Finally, dividing both sides by 1.50, we find the original length:

x = 80cm 



**Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm.**

"Let's break this problem down systematically.

Let 't' represent the age of one triplet.  Since one twin is 7 years older than a triplet, the twin's age can be represented as 't + 7'.  The total age of all five children is 44, so we can write the equation:

t + t + t + (t + 7) + (t + 7) = 44

Simplifying the equation:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Dividing both sides by 5:

t = 6

Now that we know one triplet is 6 years old, we can find the age of one twin:

t + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13



Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

* **Cost of one lollipop:**  Since Manolo bought five lollipops for $3.20 and we know the total cost of the candies is $1.20, we can find the cost of one lollipop: $3.20 - $1.20 = $2.00.  Therefore, one lollipop costs $2.00 / 5 = $0.40.

* **Cost of ten lollipops:**  The cost of ten lollipops is simply 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.

* **Cost of ten candies:**  We know each candy costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.  Therefore, ten candies cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

* **Total cost:**  The total cost of ten lollipops and ten candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

First, we need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month. He saves 2/5 times more than Rong's 20 coins, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8 coins.  This means Neil saves a total of 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Next, we calculate their annual savings. Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins per year. Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year = 336 coins per year.

Finally, we find their total savings after ten years. Rong saves 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins. Neil saves 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Adding their individual savings, they have a combined total of 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

* **Dog's rate:** The dog eats the same 9 sausages in 20 minutes, so its rate is 9/20 = 0.45 sausages per minute.

* **Combined rate:**  To find the average time, we need to consider their combined rate.  Since they eat at different speeds, we can't simply average their individual rates.  

* **Alternative approach:**  A more intuitive way to think about this is to realize that the total time it takes to eat 9 sausages is the sum of the time each animal takes. We already know that's 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

First, we need to express Topher's shoe size in inches.  Since there are 12 inches in a foot, his 8-foot shoe is 8 * 12 = 96 inches long. Adding the extra 4 inches, his shoe is a total of 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, let 'x' represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We know that 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe plus 10 inches equals the length of Topher's shoe.  This can be written as the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

To solve for x, we subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90

"Let's break down this fish-tastic problem!

Let 'w' represent the number of white fish Bob bought and 'o' represent the number of orange fish he bought.  We know:

*  w + o = 17  (The total number of fish he bought)
*  o = 2w       (He bought twice as many orange fish as white fish)

We can use substitution to solve for 'w'.  Since we know 'o' is equal to 2w, substitute that into the first equation:

w + 2w = 17

Combine like terms: 3w = 17

Divide both sides by 3: w = 5.67

Since Bob can't buy parts of fish, we round down to the nearest whole number.


**Answer:** Bob bought 5 white fish.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

*  Let 'z' represent the number of ounces of citrus zest (and fragrance).
*  Since the amount of salt and sugar are equal, let 's' represent the number of ounces of each.
*  We know oil is twice the amount of salt, so oil is 2s ounces.

We're given that the total weight of the scrub is 10 ounces.  This means:

z + z + s + s + 2s = 10

Simplifying the equation:

2z + 4s = 10

We also know that z = s (since the amount of zest and fragrance are equal, and the amount of salt and sugar are equal).  Substituting 'z' with 's' in the equation:

2s + 4s = 10

Combining like terms:

6s = 10

Dividing both sides by 6:

s = 10/6 = 5/3

Since oil is 2s, the amount of oil used is:

2 * (5/3) = 10/3 ounces.

* **Formulate equations:**

   *  y = b - 3  (You are three years younger than your brother)
   *  y = s + 2  (You are two years older than your sister)
   *  Mom's age = 3b - 1
   *  y + b + s + (3b - 1) = 87 (The sum of all ages is 87)

* **Simplify and solve:**

   1.  Combine like terms in the last equation: 4b + y + s = 88
   2.  Substitute 'y' from the first equation: 4b + (b - 3) + (y - 2) = 88
   3.  Simplify: 5b + y - 5 = 88
   4.  Substitute 'y' from the first equation again: 5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88
   5.  Combine like terms: 6b - 8 = 88
   6.  Solve for 'b': 6b = 96  =>  b = 16
   7.  Substitute 'b' back into y = b - 3 to find 'y': y = 16 - 3  =>  y = 13

"To determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to figure out her total earnings from mowing lawns first.  

Let 'x' represent the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.  

* Kamala's lawn: 3x
* Alba's lawn: 5x

Her total earnings from mowing are: 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x

"Let's break down this swimming problem step-by-step:

**1.  Distance Swum:**

* James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake: 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles

**2.  Time for First Swim:**

* Time = Distance / Speed 
* Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

**3.  Resting Time:**

* Resting time is half the swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

**4.  Remaining Distance:**

*  Remaining distance: 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

**5.  Time for Second Swim:**

*  Speed for the second swim is half the original speed: 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour
*  Time = Distance / Speed
*  Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

**6.  Total Time:**

* Total time = First swim time + Resting time + Second swim time
* Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours



**Therefore, it took James 17 hours to cross the lake.**

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

*  Let 'x' represent the number of points Azibo scored.

* Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati scored 'x + 20' points.

* Dinar scored 10 fewer points than Bahati, so Dinar scored 'x + 20 - 10' or 'x + 10' points.

* The total points scored by the team is 45, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

* Simplifying the equation: 3x + 30 = 45

* Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

* Dividing both sides by 3: x = 5


Therefore, Azibo scored **5** points.

"Let's break this problem down:

*  Courtney's count of 48 represents the total number of people if her estimate was accurate.
* Kelly states Courtney overestimated by 20%, meaning 20% of the actual attendance was added to Courtney's count.

To find the actual attendance, we need to reverse this overestimation.  Let 'x' represent the actual number of attendees.  We can set up the equation:

x + 0.20x = 48

Combining like terms:

1.20x = 48

Dividing both sides by 1.20:

x = 40 



**Therefore, 40 people really attended the concert.** 
"
"Let's break this problem down step by step:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
*  Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey, so Jason carried 2x balls.
*  Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, meaning Jordan carried 2 * (2x) = 4x balls.

Together, they carried a total of x + 2x + 4x = 7 balls.

Combining like terms, we get 7x = 7.

Dividing both sides by 7, we find x = 1.

Since Jeffrey carried x balls, he carried 1 ball.  Jason carried 2x balls, so he carried 2 * 1 = 2 balls.  And Jordan carried 4x balls, meaning he carried 4 * 1 = 4 balls.




Therefore, the coach brought a total of 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls to practice.

* **Holes after filling:** They filled in 2 holes, leaving them with 31 - 2 = 29 holes.
* **Holes at the end of day 1:**  The problem states there were four times as many holes at the end of day 3 as at the end of day 1.  Let 'x' represent the number of holes at the end of day 1.  We know 4x = 29.
* **Solving for x:** Divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find x = 7.25.

Since we can't have a fraction of a hole, this problem presents a logical inconsistency.  It's impossible for the number of holes to quadruple from the end of day 1 to the end of day 3.

"Let's solve this Pokemon problem!

Let  'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan caught.  We know:

* Alex caught 5 more than Stan: A = S + 5
* Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch: S = 4W - 13
* Together they caught 339: A + S + W = 339

Now, we can use substitution to solve for S. 

Substitute the expressions for A and S into the total Pokemon equation:

(S + 5) + S + W = 339

Simplify:

2S + W = 334

Solve for W in terms of S using the second equation:

W = (S + 13) / 4

Substitute this value of W back into the simplified equation:

2S + (S + 13) / 4 = 334

Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:

8S + S + 13 = 1336

Combine like terms:

9S + 13 = 1336

Subtract 13 from both sides:

9S = 1323

Divide both sides by 9:

S = 147



**Therefore, Stan caught 147 Pokemon.**

First, we need to figure out how many plants Pat needs.  Her flower bed is 111 feet long, and each plant needs 12 inches of space plus 1.5 feet (18 inches) of space between them.  

* Convert the flower bed length to inches: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches
* Calculate the total space needed for plants: 1332 inches - (1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot) = 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches
* Calculate the number of plants needed: 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants. Since Pat can't have half a plant, she needs 110 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

Let 'x' represent Bill's age when he first saw Comet Halley.  

We know Bill's father was 30 years old when he saw the comet. Bill saw it again when he was three times his father's age, meaning he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Since Comet Halley has a 75-year orbit, the time between Bill's two sightings is 75 years.  This means:

90 - x = 75

Solving for x:

x = 90 - 75
x = 15


Therefore, Bill was **15** years old when he first saw Comet Halley.

"Let's break down Buford's check-writing habits:

* **Monthly Expenses:** He writes 1 check for electricity and 1 check for gas, totaling 2 checks per month.
* **Church Donations:** He contributes to the church twice a month, resulting in 2 checks per month.
* **Quarterly Expense:**  He pays his pest and lawn service quarterly, which means 4 checks per year.

Now, let's calculate his annual check count:

* **Monthly Checks:** 2 checks (electricity/gas) + 2 checks (church) = 4 checks per month
* **Total Annual Checks:** 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks
* **Add Quarterly Checks:** 48 checks + 4 checks (pest/lawn) = 52 checks



**Therefore, Buford writes 52 checks per year.**

"Let's break down this problem systematically.

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of flights the first plane makes per day.

* We know the first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, so that's (3/4)x flights to Greece.

* The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, meaning (1/4)x / 2 = (1/8)x flights go to each of those countries.

* We're also given that the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes.  Therefore, x = 44 * 2 = 88 flights.

*  Now we can find the number of flights to France: (1/8) * 88 = 11 flights.

"
"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Tobias's howl:** Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
* **Chikote's howl:** Chikote howls twice as long as Tobias, so he howls for 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.
* **Combined howl of Tobias and Chikote:** Together, they howl for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
* **Igneous's howl:** Igneous howls for the same length of time as Tobias and Chikote combined, so he howls for 60 seconds.
* **Total howl time:** All three wolves howl for a total of 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.
* **Total howl time in minutes:**  Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 120 seconds is equal to 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.



Therefore, the combined length of time the three wolves howl is **2 minutes**.

"To determine the percentage of watermelon each adult receives, we can use a simple proportion. 

Let 'x' represent the size of one child's slice.  Since each adult gets a slice twice as big, an adult's slice is 2x.  

The total watermelon is divided into 6 slices, so we have the equation:

4x + 2(2x) = 6

Simplifying:

4x + 4x = 6
8x = 6
x = 0.75

Therefore, each adult receives 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 slices.

To express this as a percentage, we divide the adult's share by the total slices and multiply by 100%:

(1.5 slices / 6 total slices) * 100% = 25%

To isolate 'x', divide both sides of the equation by 8: 
x = 8


**Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in each box.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

*  Let 'x' represent the initial charge of the power bank.

*  The power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour for 5 hours, which is a total loss of 0.09 * 5 = 0.45x.

*  After 5 hours, the remaining charge is x - 0.45x = 0.55x.

*  Then, it lost 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours, a total loss of 0.07 * 3 = 0.21x.

*  The final charge is 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x.

*  We know this final charge is 28%, so 0.34x = 0.28.

* **Scenario 1: Substitute Teacher** 
   *  There's a 50% chance Marcus has a substitute teacher who won't collect homework. This means he avoids having to turn it in.

* **Scenario 2: Normal Teacher**
   * If the normal teacher is present, there's a 40% chance she'll give an extension. This means a 60% chance she'll expect the homework.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the total amount Jim needs to earn back. This includes the principal of his loans and the income he forgoes by not working during his studies.  

* Total loans: $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000
* Lost income: $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000
* Total amount to earn back: $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

Next, we calculate Jim's new annual income after graduating.

* New income: $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

Finally, we divide the total amount to be earned by his new annual income to find out how many years it will take him to recoup his expenses.

* Years to repay: $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years

"Let's break this problem down systematically.

*  Let 'x' represent the share of the first person.

* The second person received x + $80.

* The third person received twice the amount of the second person, which is 2(x + $80).

The total amount divided among the three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920

Simplifying the equation:

x + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920
4x + $240 = $1920
4x = $1680
x = $420

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.  

Let 'x' represent the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.  

* **First set:** x + 4 
* **Third set:** x / 2

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Combining like terms:

2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

2.5x = 15

Dividing both sides by 2.5:

x = 6

Therefore, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.  

To find the number of balls in the first set, we substitute x = 6 into the expression for the first set:

First set: 6 + 4 = 10

"The car's value depreciates by 21% each year.  We can model this with an exponential decay function.  

Let:

*  V(t) = the value of the car after t years
* V(0) = $20000 (initial value)
* r = 0.21 (depreciation rate)

The formula for exponential decay is: V(t) = V(0) * (1 - r)^t

To find the price in 2010, we need to calculate V(3) since 2010 is 3 years after 2007:

V(3) = $20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3 
V(3) = $20000 * (0.79)^3
V(3) = $20000 * 0.4913
V(3) ≈ $9826 



**Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9826.**

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area to be painted.  

* The north and south walls each have an area of 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
* The east and west walls each have an area of 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.

Therefore, the total area of all four walls is (80 sq ft * 2) + (40 sq ft * 2) = 160 sq ft + 80 sq ft = 240 square feet.

Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, Tony will need 240 sq ft / 20 sq ft/gallon = 12 gallons of paint.

At a cost of $12 per gallon, the total cost to paint the room will be 12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144.

*  Let 'S' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.
*  Camden painted 'S + 12' eggs.

We know:

* A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56  (Total eggs painted)

Simplifying the equation:

* 2A + 2S + 12 = 56
* 2A + 2S = 44
* A + S = 22  

We also know:

* S + (S + 12) = 30 (Camden and Sarah's eggs)
* 2S + 12 = 30

"Let 'm' represent the number of men and 'w' represent the number of women on the bus. We know:

*  m/w = 5/9 
* m + w = 84

We can solve for 'w' (the number of women) using these equations.  

First, solve the first equation for 'm':
m = (5/9)w

Substitute this value of 'm' into the second equation:
(5/9)w + w = 84

Combine the 'w' terms:
(14/9)w = 84

Multiply both sides by (9/14) to isolate 'w':
w = 54

After 20 women alight, the number of women remaining is:
54 - 20 = 34

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so its length is 'y - 7' centimeters.
*  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, making its length '4(y - 7)' centimeters.

We know the total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  This gives us the equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.



Therefore, the length of the red rope is **20 centimeters**.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry ice cubes as 's'.  The problem states that Mary makes 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4 for blueberry cubes.  This can be represented as 5s - 4.  

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes: s + (5s - 4) = 116.

Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116.  Adding 4 to both sides, we have 6s = 120.  

Dividing both sides by 6, we find s = 20.

Now, we can calculate the number of blueberry cubes: 5 * 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'b' represent the number of beakers Igor lost.**

* **Test tubes:** Igor gathered half the requested amount, so he had 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
* **Petri dishes:** He gathered two more than requested, meaning he had 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
* **Total items on the bench:**  Igor had 8 + 7 + (7 - b) = 29 items on the bench.

* **Simplify the equation:** 15 + 7 - b = 29
* **Combine like terms:** 22 - b = 29
* **Solve for 'b':**  Subtract 22 from both sides to get -b = 7.  Then, multiply both sides by -1 to find b = -7.

Since we can't have a negative number of beakers, this indicates there's an error in the problem statement. It's impossible for Igor to have lost beakers and still ended up with 29 items on the bench.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let  'x' represent Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.  Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, his speed is 2x.

We know Aaron runs 2 miles and completes his portion in 16 minutes.  We can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

Therefore, 16 = 2 / 2x, which simplifies to 16 = 1/x.  Solving for x, we find x = 1/16 miles per minute.

Vanessa runs at a speed of x miles per minute, so her time to complete 4 miles is:

time = distance / speed = 4 / (1/16) = 64 minutes.

"This is a classic problem that can be solved using a system of equations.  

Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows. We know:

*  c + w = 20  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

We can solve for 'c' using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:

1. Solve the first equation for 'w': 
   w = 20 - c

2. Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. Simplify and solve for 'c':
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5
