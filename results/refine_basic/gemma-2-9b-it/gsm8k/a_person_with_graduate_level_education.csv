"Let's break down Josh's real estate venture.  

The house's value appreciation of 150% represents a significant increase.  To determine his profit, we need to calculate the final value of the house after the renovations and then subtract his total investment.

The increased value is 150% of the original $80,000 purchase price, which is (1.50) * $80,000 = $120,000.  

Adding this to the original price, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

His total investment includes the purchase price and the renovation costs, totaling $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

Finally, his profit is the difference between the final value and his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. 



**Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000.**

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

* **Charleston's Sheep:** Since Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, which has 20, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

* **Toulouse's Sheep:** Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, meaning Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

* **Total Sheep:**  To find the total number of sheep, we sum the sheep populations of each city: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep. 



Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a combined total of 260 sheep.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the time it would take Carla to download the entire 200 GB file at her normal speed of 2 GB per minute. This is a simple division: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

However, the download is interrupted after 40% of the file is downloaded.  This means 40% of 200 GB, or 80 GB, is downloaded before the restart.

The restart takes 20 minutes, and Carla has to start the download from the beginning.  Therefore, she needs to download the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).

At a download speed of 2 GB per minute, this will take 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB/minute).

Finally, we add the time spent downloading the initial portion, the restart time, and the time to download the remaining portion: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Let's break down John's journey to determine his final distance from home.

First, he travels 180 miles (60 mph * 3 hours) on his initial trip.  

Then, he encounters a 2-hour traffic delay, covering zero distance.  

Subsequently, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph, covering 15 miles.  

Finally, he completes the remaining 1.5 hours of his return trip at 80 mph, covering 120 miles (80 mph * 1.5 hours).

Therefore, his total distance traveled on the return trip is 135 miles (0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles).

Since he traveled 180 miles away and then 135 miles back, his final distance from home is 45 miles (180 miles - 135 miles).

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

Let 'x' represent the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie possessed.  

*  At the green house, she sold x/3.
*  At the red house, she sold 2 more, bringing the total sold to x/3 + 2.
*  The remaining vacuum cleaners after the green and red houses were x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2.
*  At the orange house, she sold half of the remaining stock:  ((2x/3) - 2) / 2 = (x/3) - 1.

We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so:

(2x/3) - 2 - (x/3) + 1 = 5

Simplifying the equation:

x/3 - 1 = 5

Adding 1 to both sides:

x/3 = 6

Multiplying both sides by 3:

x = 18



Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail, Marissa needs to consider the time already spent and the remaining distance.  

She has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, which translates to an average speed of 3 mph.  To reach the desired 4 mph average, she needs to cover the remaining 6 miles at a faster pace.  

Let 'x' be the speed (in mph) she needs to walk the remaining distance.  We can set up the following equation:

(6 miles / x) + 2 hours = (12 miles / 4 mph)

Simplifying the equation:

(6 / x) + 2 = 3

(6 / x) = 1

x = 6 



**Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.**

"Let's break down this problem systematically.

First, we need to determine the water content of each drink. The orange drink is two-thirds water, meaning it contains (2/3) * 10 liters = 6.67 liters of water.  The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so it contains (3/5) * 15 liters = 9 liters of water.

However, we must account for the spilled orange drink. This reduces the total water from the orange drink to 6.67 liters - 1 liter = 5.67 liters.

Finally, we add the water content of both drinks to find the total water in the mixture: 5.67 liters + 9 liters = 14.67 liters. 



**Therefore, there are 14.67 liters of water in the remaining mixture.**

"Let's analyze the coin distribution.  We can represent the number of silver coins as 's' and the number of gold coins as 'g'.  We know that the total number of coins is 110, so s + g = 110.  Additionally, we are told that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, meaning g = s + 30.

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get s + (s + 30) = 110.  Simplifying, we have 2s + 30 = 110.  Subtracting 30 from both sides yields 2s = 80.  Dividing both sides by 2, we find s = 40.

Now, we can substitute the value of s back into the equation g = s + 30 to find g = 40 + 30 = 70.

"To determine the average square footage of each level, we can utilize the concept of a geometric series.  

The square footage of each level forms a geometric sequence where the first term is 16 and the common ratio is 1/2 (since each level is half the size of the one below it).  

The sum of a finite geometric series is given by:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where:

* S is the sum of the series
* a is the first term
* r is the common ratio
* n is the number of terms

In this case, a = 16, r = 1/2, and n = 4.  Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

S = 16 (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2) = 16 (1 - 1/16) / (1/2) = 16 (15/16) * 2 = 30 square feet.

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 30 square feet.

* Sarah does 4 times the amount David does, so Sarah does 4x pounds of laundry.
* Raymond does half the amount Sarah does, meaning he does (4x)/2 = 2x pounds of laundry.

We know Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so 4x = 400.  Solving for x, we find that David does 100 pounds of laundry (400 / 4 = 100).

Therefore, Raymond does 2x = 2 * 100 = 200 pounds of laundry.

The difference in laundry between Raymond and David is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine Julia's rowing speed.  We know she covers 20 feet in 16 seconds, so her speed is 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Next, we can calculate the total distance she rows to reach the shore.  Since the shore is 64 seconds away, she rows a total of 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.

Finally, we can determine the amount of water that enters the boat.  The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.  Over 80 feet, the boat takes on (2 liters / 10 feet) * 80 feet = 16 liters of water.



**Therefore, the boat takes on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reaches shore.**

"Let's break down Sasha's lumber profit calculation:

First, we need to determine the new prices of the lumber after the 50% price increase.  

* 2x4 boards: $10 * 1.50 = $15 per board
* 4x4 boards: $16 * 1.50 = $24 per board

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling each type of board:

* 2x4 boards: 10 boards * $15/board = $150
* 4x4 boards: 5 boards * $24/board = $120

Finally, add the revenue from both types of boards to find the total revenue:

* $150 + $120 = $270

Now, subtract the original cost of the lumber to determine the profit:

* $270 - $180 = $90

"To determine the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to make a few assumptions.  

Let's assume that Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's.  

Here's how we can solve this:

1. **Adrien's initial salary:** Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can represent Lylah's initial salary as 'x'. Adrien's initial salary would then be 1.30x.

2. **Adrien's salary four years later:** Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his previous salary of $40,000. This means his salary four years later is $40,000 + (40/100)*$40,000 = $56,000.

3. **Lylah's salary four years later:** Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we can calculate her salary four years later.  Let's say her salary increased by 'y' percent.  Her salary four years later would be x + (y/100)*x.

4. **Total salary:** To find the total salary of both, we add their individual salaries four years later: $56,000 + x + (y/100)*x.

**Without knowing the exact percentage increase for Lylah (y), we cannot determine the total salary of both four years later.**

"Let's break down this beehive problem systematically.  

We're given that the total number of bees is 700, and there's a specific relationship between the number of queen bees, baby bees, and worker bees.  

* Let 'q' represent the number of queen bees.
* Let 'b' represent the number of baby bees.
* Let 'w' represent the number of worker bees.

We know:

* b = 2q  (Twice as many babies as queens)
* w = 2b  (Twice as many worker bees as babies)

"Let's denote Seth's current age as 's' and Brooke's current age as 'b'.  We are given two key pieces of information:

1. **s = 2b:** Seth's age is twice Brooke's age.
2. **(s + 2) + (b + 2) = 28:** In two years, the sum of their ages will be 28.

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:

(2b + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Simplifying the equation:

3b + 4 = 28
3b = 24
b = 8

Now, we can find Seth's age by substituting the value of 'b' back into the equation s = 2b:

s = 2 * 8
s = 16


Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step. 

First, we need to determine the profit per gallon of lemonade.  Since they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, their revenue per gallon is $0.50 * 20 = $10.  Knowing that each gallon costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, their profit per gallon is $10 - ($3 + $2) = $5.

To find the total cost of lemons, we can use the fact that they made a $25 profit.  Since their profit per gallon is $5, they must have made 25 / 5 = 5 gallons of lemonade.  Therefore, the total cost of lemons is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

"Let's break down Zaid's monthly expenditures to determine his remaining funds.

First, we calculate his spending on rent and fuel:

* Rent: (1/4) * $6000 = $1500
* Fuel: (1/3) * $6000 = $2000

His total spending on these two categories is $1500 + $2000 = $3500.

Subtracting this from his income leaves him with $6000 - $3500 = $2500.

He then donates half of this remaining amount: $2500 / 2 = $1250.

This leaves him with $2500 - $1250 = $1250.

Finally, we account for his daughter's and wife's expenses: $200 + $700 = $900.

Therefore, Zaid has $1250 - $900 = $350 remaining at the end of the month.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using a variable approach.

Let:

*  *J* = Jan's current age
*  *M* = Mark's current age
*  *E* = Jean's current age

We are given the following information:

*  *E = M + 2*  (Jean is two years older than Mark)
*  *M - 2 = 5 + (J/2 - 2)* (Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age)
*  *J = 30* (Jan is 30 years old)

Now we can substitute and solve for *E*:

1. **Substitute J = 30 into the second equation:**

"Let's break down this probability problem.

First, we need to determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a standard six-sided die. There are three favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of a total of six possible outcomes.  Therefore, the probability is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 50%.

Next, consider the probability of rolling two even numbers consecutively.  There are three even numbers on a die (2, 4, and 6). The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 or 1/2.  Given that the first roll was even, the probability of rolling another even number on the second roll remains 1/2.  To get the probability of both events happening, we multiply these probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Finally, the difference in probability between these two events is 50% - 25% = 25%.

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will have paid after 12 months: $165/month * 12 months = $1980.

Finally, to find the remaining balance, we subtract the total payment from the total amount due: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we know Harriet is currently 21 years old.  Since Adrian is three times Harriet's age, Adrian is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.  

We also know Harriet is half Zack's age, meaning Zack is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

In three years, their ages will be:

* Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years old
* Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years old
* Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years old

The average age of the three in three years is the sum of their ages divided by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 45 years. 



**Therefore, the average age of the three in three years will be 45.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the updated composition of James's Pokemon card collection after his transactions.  He loses 8 water-type cards, leaving him with 40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards.  Simultaneously, he acquires 14 grass-type cards, bringing his total to 20 + 14 = 34 grass-type cards.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cards in his collection: 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

To find the probability of randomly selecting a water-type card, we divide the number of water-type cards by the total number of cards: 32 / 96 = 0.3333.

Finally, we express this probability as a percentage and round to the nearest integer: 0.3333 * 100% = 33%.



**Therefore, the percentage chance of randomly selecting a water-type card is 33%.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Collar Stitches:** The collar requires a tenth of the body stitches, so it takes 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches.

2. **Rosette Stitches:** The rosette requires twice the number of stitches as the collar, meaning it takes 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches.

3. **Total Stitches for Body, Collar, and Rosette:**  Adding these together, we get 900 stitches + 90 stitches + 180 stitches = 1170 stitches.

4. **Total Stitches for Sleeves:**  Since the entire sweater has 1800 stitches, the sleeves must account for 1800 stitches - 1170 stitches = 630 stitches.

5. **Stitches per Sleeve:**  Finally, dividing the total sleeve stitches by two, we find that each sleeve requires 630 stitches / 2 = 315 stitches.



Therefore, each sleeve takes **315** stitches.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.

* **Step 1: Cards with 'A'**  We begin by calculating the number of cards with the letter 'A': (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

* **Step 2: Remaining Cards**  Subtracting the cards with 'A' from the total, we have 80 - 32 = 48 cards left.

* **Step 3: Cards with 'B'** Next, we determine the number of cards with 'B' from the remaining cards: (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

* **Step 4: Cards Remaining After 'B'**  Subtracting the cards with 'B', we are left with 48 - 24 = 24 cards.

* **Step 5: Cards with 'C'**  Now, we find the number of cards with 'C': (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

* **Step 6: Cards with 'D'**  Finally, the number of cards with 'D' is the difference between the remaining cards and those with 'C': 24 - 15 = 9 cards.

"To determine the total time required, we first need to calculate the time spent on each type of hole.  

For the small holes, Matthew spends 3 minutes per hole and needs to dig 30 holes, resulting in a total time of 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.

Similarly, for the large holes, he spends 10 minutes per hole and needs to dig 15 holes, resulting in a total time of 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.

The total time to complete both tasks is the sum of these individual times: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

Finally, we convert this time to hours by dividing by the number of minutes in an hour: 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

"Let's denote Ruby's current age as 'R' and Sam's current age as 'S'.  We are given two key relationships:

1. **R = 6S:** Ruby's age is six times Sam's age.

2. **R + 9 = 3(S + 9):** In nine years, Ruby's age will be three times Sam's age.

We can solve for 'S' by substituting the first equation into the second:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the right side:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Combining like terms:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

S = 6


Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the number of spots on a single mamba. Since a cobra has twice the spots of a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 spots / 2 = 35 spots.

Next, we calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras: 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots.

Similarly, we find the total number of spots on all the mambas: 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots.

The total number of spots on all the snakes is the sum of the spots on the cobras and the mambas: 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots.

Finally, half the total number of spots is 4900 spots / 2 = 2450 spots.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

Shannon's iced coffee weakens due to two factors: the addition of ice cubes and the addition of cream.  

* **Ice Cube Contribution:** Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, she uses 65 degrees / 13 degrees/ice cube = 5 ice cubes.  This results in a weakening of 5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters/ice cube = 60 milliliters.

* **Cream Contribution:** The addition of 15 milliliters of cream directly weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

* **Total Weakening:** The total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream: 60 milliliters + 15 milliliters = 75 milliliters.




**Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the number of junior programmers.  Since they constitute 2/5 of the total workforce of 100 employees, there are (2/5) * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

This means there are 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Junior programmers earn $2000 per month, while senior programmers earn $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

Therefore, the total monthly salary paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Similarly, the total monthly salary paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

Finally, the total monthly salary paid to all programmers is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Monday's Harvest:**  Since Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday (as indicated by the $56 revenue), we know she harvested 14 apples that day.

* **Tuesday's Harvest:** On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

* **Wednesday's Harvest:**  Wednesday's harvest was double Tuesday's, meaning she picked 12 * 2 = 24 apples.

* **Total Harvest:**  To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we sum the harvests from each day: 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples.




Therefore, Lucy picked a total of 50 apples over the three days.

"To determine Karan's monthly payment, we first need to calculate the total interest accrued over the five months.  

Using the formula for simple interest:

Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100

Interest = ($3650 * 10 * 5) / 100 = $1825

Next, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan must repay:

Total Amount = Principal + Interest = $3650 + $1825 = $5475

Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months = $5475 / 5 = $1095

"Let 'x' represent the original amount of land Mr. Ruther possessed.  We know that after selling 3/5 of his land, he was left with 12.8 hectares.  This can be expressed as the equation:

x - (3/5)x = 12.8

Combining like terms, we get:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To isolate 'x', we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)

Calculating the result:

x = 32 hectares 



Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially owned 32 hectares of land.

"Here's how to determine Mel's energy savings:

First, we need to calculate Mel's initial daily energy consumption: 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours.

After reducing his usage by 5 hours, his new daily consumption is: 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours.

This results in a daily energy saving of: 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours.

Over 30 days, the total energy saved is: 4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours.

Finally, we convert this to kilowatt-hours: 135,000 watt-hours / 1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours.



Therefore, Mel will save **135** kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days.

Let 'x' represent the total number of Pokemon cards Kenny initially owned.

* Kenny sold a portion of his cards, earning $1.50 per card.  The total earnings from selling cards can be represented as 1.50(x - (x/3)), where (x/3) represents the number of cards he kept.
* We know this earnings, plus his spending money, equals the cost of the amusement park ticket.  This can be expressed as: 1.50(x - (x/3)) + 50 = 100

Now, let's solve for x:

1. Simplify the equation: 1.50(2x/3) + 50 = 100
2. Continue simplifying: 1x + 50 = 100
3. Subtract 50 from both sides: x = 50


Therefore, Kenny started with **50** Pokemon cards.

"Let's break down Charlotte's shopping trip:

* **Pot and pan set:** $120.00
* **Mixing bowls:** $20.00
* **Utensils (5 x $5.00):** $25.00

The total cost before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

A 20% discount on $165.00 is calculated as $165.00 * 0.20 = $33.00

Therefore, Charlotte's final bill is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00 



**Final cost: $132.00**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let 'c' represent the number of candy bars George purchased.  We know the following:

* The cost of a bag of chips is $0.40.
* The cost of a candy bar is $0.75.
* George spent $5.00 in total.
* He had 1% of his money left, meaning he spent 99% of it.

We can set up an equation to represent the total cost:

0.40 * 3 + 0.75 * c = 0.99 * 5.00

Simplifying the equation:

1.20 + 0.75c = 4.95

Subtracting 1.20 from both sides:

0.75c = 3.75

Dividing both sides by 0.75:

c = 5


Therefore, George bought **5** candy bars.

"Let's break down this problem:

We know the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width: Area = Length * Width.  We're given the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards, which we need to convert to feet: 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet).  

Now we can solve for the width: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Finally, the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).  Plugging in our values: Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet. 



**Answer:** 98 feet

"Let's break down the problem systematically:

* **Initial Temperature:** The house starts at 40 degrees.
* **Temperature Change from Baking:** The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour for 3 hours, resulting in a total increase of 15 degrees.
* **Temperature After Baking:** Adding the temperature increase to the initial temperature, we get 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.
* **Temperature Change from Window:** The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the cooling effect is 2 * (30/10) = 6 degrees.
* **Final Temperature:** Subtracting the cooling effect from the temperature after baking, we arrive at 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.



Therefore, the house's final temperature is **49 degrees**.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we need to express all times in a consistent unit. Let's use minutes. Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, his bike time is 80 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes), and his run time is 50 minutes.  This gives us a total time of 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, meaning his swim time is 0.90 * 40 = 36 minutes.  He takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time was 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.  Therefore, James' run time is 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

"Let's break down this problem methodically. 

First, we need to determine the distance the horse covers.  Knowing the speed is 32 miles per hour and the time is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we can use the formula: distance = speed * time. This gives us 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Next, we know the horse consumes half a bale of hay for every mile run.  Therefore, over 16 miles, the horse eats 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is 8 bales * $3/bale = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which amounts to 6 bills * $5/bill = $30.

Finally, his change is calculated as his total money minus the cost of the hay: $30 - $24 = $6.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the final cost per razor.

Heather purchases two packs of razors, originally priced at $4.00 per pack.  This totals $8.00.  The ""buy one get one free"" offer effectively reduces the cost by half, leaving her with a total cost of $4.00.  

Since each pack contains four razors, she acquires eight razors in total.  Therefore, the cost per razor is $4.00 / 8 razors = $0.50 per razor.  

Converting this to cents, we get 50 cents per razor.

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the total height contributed by each layer and sum them up.

* **Bottom layer:**  The bottom layer consists of four cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, resulting in a total height of 4 * 64 = 256 inches.

* **Second layer:** The second layer has three cheerleaders, also 64 inches tall, contributing a height of 3 * 64 = 192 inches.

* **Third layer:** The third layer consists of two cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, adding a height of 2 * 64 = 128 inches.

* **Top layer:** The shortest cheerleader, standing at 60 inches, forms the top layer.

Adding the heights of all the layers, we get 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches.

Finally, converting inches to feet by dividing by 12, we find the total height of the pyramid to be 636 / 12 = 53 feet. 



**Therefore, the human pyramid is 53 feet tall.**

"To determine the guest count at which the two venues have equal cost, we need to set up an equation. 

Let 'x' represent the number of guests.

* **Venue 1:** The cost is a fixed $200 plus $5 per guest for food, resulting in a total cost of $200 + $5x.
* **Venue 2:** The cost is a flat $25 per guest, giving us a total cost of $25x.

Equating these two expressions, we get:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Solving for x:

* Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x
* Divide both sides by $20: x = 10


Therefore, 10 guests are required for the two venues to have the same cost.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.  

We can represent the number of insects each person found with variables:

*  Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
*  Let 'D' represent the number of insects David found.
*  Let 'L' represent the number of insects Lily found.

We're given the following information, which we can translate into equations:

*  L + D + B = 43  (The total number of insects)
*  L = D + 7       (Lily found 7 more than David)
*  D = B / 2        (David found half of what Bodhi found)

To solve for L (the number of insects Lily found), we can use substitution.  

First, substitute the second equation (L = D + 7) into the first equation:

(D + 7) + D + B = 43

Next, substitute the third equation (D = B / 2) into the above equation:

(B/2) + 7 + (B/2) + B = 43

Simplify and solve for B:

(2B/2) + 7 + B = 43
B + 7 + B = 43
2B + 7 = 43
2B = 36
B = 18

Now that we know B (Bodhi found 18 insects), we can find D (David found half of Bodhi's amount):

D = B / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

Finally, we can find L (Lily found 7 more than David):

L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16



**Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.**

"To determine Elvis's required daily savings in the second half of April, we can set up a system of equations. 

Let 'x' represent Elvis's daily savings in the first half of April.  Since he aims to save twice as much daily in the second half, his daily savings in the second half would be '2x'.

We know his total savings target for the month is $1125.  Therefore:

15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Simplifying the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125
45x = 1125
x = 25

This means Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half of April.  

His daily savings in the second half are twice this amount: 2 * $25 = $50.

"To determine the number of gumballs Colby can purchase, we first need to calculate his total monetary assets.  

He has 8 quarters, which is equivalent to 8 * $0.25 = $2.00.

His 6 dimes are worth 6 * $0.10 = $0.60.

The 14 nickels amount to 14 * $0.05 = $0.70.

Finally, his 15 pennies represent 15 * $0.01 = $0.15.

Adding these values together, we find Colby has a total of $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, he can purchase $3.45 / $0.05 = 69 gumballs.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine Ruiz's hourly production rate. Since he makes 120 pounds of chocolate in two hours, his hourly rate is 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.

Next, we find Marissa's hourly production rate. She makes 3/4 the amount Ruiz makes in two hours, which is (3/4) * 120 pounds = 90 pounds in two hours.  Therefore, her hourly rate is 90 pounds / 2 hours = 45 pounds per hour.

Now we can calculate their daily production. Ruiz produces 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds in a day. Marissa produces 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds in a day.

Finally, their combined daily production is 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds.

"
"To determine the tire lifespan, we first need to calculate the total rotations the tires undergo annually.  Since the car rotates its tires 725 times for every 2 miles driven, and Jeremy drives 400 miles per month, the tires rotate 400 miles/month * (725 rotations/2 miles) = 145,000 rotations per month.  

Over a year, this translates to 145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations per year.

Knowing that each tire can withstand 10,440,000 rotations, we can find the lifespan by dividing the total tire capacity by the annual rotation count: 10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years. 



Therefore, the tires will need to be replaced after **6 years**.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the cost per pump.

First, we need to understand the relationship between shampoo usage and washings.  The jumbo bottle provides enough shampoo for 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.  

Since Jackie uses only 1 pump per wash, we can deduce that one pump will last for 120 washings / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we can calculate the cost per washing: $24.00 / 120 washings = $0.20 per washing.

Finally, we can determine the cost per pump: $0.20 per washing * 60 washings = $12.00.

Converting this to cents, we get $12.00 * 100 cents/$1 = 1200 cents.

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to analyze the funding pattern.  

He begins with $100,000 for the first 5 months.  Subsequently, his funding increases by 50% each month for the remaining 45 months. This represents a geometric progression.

The total cost can be calculated as follows:

* **Cost of the first 5 months:** $100,000 * 5 = $500,000
* **Cost of the remaining 45 months:** This requires the sum of a geometric series.  The formula for the sum of a finite geometric series is:

   S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

   Where:
    * S = the sum of the series
    * a = the first term in the series ($150,000, since the funding increases after the first 5 months)
    * r = the common ratio (1.50, representing the 50% increase)
    * n = the number of terms (45 months)

* **Total Cost:** Add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the remaining 45 months.



Let me know if you'd like me to calculate the sum of the geometric series and provide the final numerical answer.

"Let's break down Lorraine's sticker-button transactions systematically.

First, we'll analyze the trades involving small stickers.  Lorraine exchanges 90% of her 30 small stickers for large buttons. This equates to 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers, which translates to 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Next, consider the trades involving large stickers. Lorraine trades half of her 40 large stickers, resulting in 0.50 * 40 = 20 large stickers being exchanged for additional large buttons. This gives her another 20 large buttons.

Finally, the remaining 20 large stickers are traded for small stickers, yielding 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, let's consolidate Lorraine's button holdings:

* She started with 27 small buttons from the initial trade.
* She acquired 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.
*  

Therefore, Lorraine ends up with a total of 27 + 20 = 47 buttons.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let  'x' represent the number of shingle cases needed for the second house.  The first house requires half the amount of the second, which is x/2.  The third house needs double the amount of the first, so it requires 2*(x/2) = x cases.

The total number of shingle cases across all three houses is 250, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 + x + x = 250

Combining like terms, we get: 2.5x = 250

Dividing both sides by 2.5, we find x = 100.

Therefore, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the total cost of Mike's digital movie collection.

First, we calculate the cost of the series movies: 

*  Mike has 600 movies, and a third are in series, so there are 600 * (1/3) = 200 series movies.
*  Since series movies cost 60% of a regular movie, they cost 10 * (6/10) = $6 each.
*  The total cost of the series movies is 200 * $6 = $1200.

Next, we calculate the cost of the remaining movies:

*  There are 600 - 200 = 400 non-series movies.
*  40% of these are older movies, costing $5 each, so there are 400 * 0.40 = 160 older movies.
*  The total cost of the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.
*  The remaining non-series movies are 400 - 160 = 240 movies.
*  These cost $10 each, so they total 240 * $10 = $2400.

Finally, we add up the cost of all the movies:

*  The total cost is $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the Llesis family's hiking speed.  They hiked at half their driving speed minus 5 miles per hour.  Since their driving speed was 50 mph, their hiking speed was (50 mph / 2) - 5 mph = 20 mph.

Next, we can calculate the distance they covered while hiking.  They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 mph, resulting in a distance of 1.5 hours * 20 mph = 30 miles.

Now, let's find the distance they covered while driving.  They spent 6 hours total on their journey minus the 1.5 hours spent hiking, leaving 6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours for driving.  

Finally, we can calculate the total distance to their vacation spot. They drove 4.5 hours at 50 mph, covering a distance of 4.5 hours * 50 mph = 225 miles.  Adding the hiking distance, the total distance to their vacation spot is 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

* Let 'e' represent the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
* Ava jumps on 'e + 8' enemies.
* Let 'b' represent the number of berries Emma collects.
* Ava collects 'b + 3' berries.

Now, we can express their scores based on the given point system:

* Emma's score: 10e + 5b + 30t 
* Ava's score: 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)

To find the difference in their scores, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's score:

[10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)] - [10e + 5b + 30t]

Simplifying the expression:

10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t - 120 - 10e - 5b - 30t = -25


Therefore, the difference between their scores is **-25**.

"Let's break down this mosaic problem step-by-step.

Milo needs 12 glass chips per square inch for his mosaic.  Since he wants a mosaic that is 3 inches tall, he'll need 3 * 12 = 36 chips for the height.

He has two bags of chips, each containing 72 chips, giving him a total of 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

After using 36 chips for the height, he has 144 - 36 = 108 chips remaining.

With 108 chips and 12 chips needed per inch, he can make a mosaic that is 108 / 12 = 9 inches long.

"To determine the initial amount of tea, we need to account for the tea consumed.  

First, calculate the total tea consumed by the students who drank 1.5 quarts each: 4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts.

Next, calculate the total tea consumed by the students who drank 2 quarts each: 16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts.

The total tea consumed is the sum of these two amounts: 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts.

Finally, add the remaining tea to the consumed tea to find the initial amount: 10 quarts + 38 quarts = 48 quarts.

Converting quarts to gallons, we get 48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons. 



**Therefore, there were 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party.**

"This problem involves exponential growth.  

Here's how to calculate the additional students:

* **Understanding the Pattern:** The student population doubles each month. This means we're dealing with a geometric sequence where the common ratio is 2.

* **Calculating the Growth:**

    * January: 10 students * 2 = 20 students
    * February: 20 students * 2 = 40 students
    * March: 40 students * 2 = 80 students
    * April: 80 students * 2 = 160 students
    * May: 160 students * 2 = 320 students

* **Finding the Difference:**  The total student population at the end of May is 320 students.  Subtracting the initial number of students, we find the additional students: 320 - 10 = 310 students.

"Let's break down the problem systematically:

1. **Initial Petal Count:** Rose begins with 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals.

2. **Second Batch:** She adds 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals.

3. **Third Batch:**  Then, 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals.

4. **Final Batch:**  Finally, 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals.

5. **Total Petals Before Loss:**  The total number of petals before any are lost is 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

6. **Petals Lost:** She loses 1 flower from each batch, resulting in a loss of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 petals.

"Let's break down this arcade expenditure problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the playtime of each friend in terms of quarters. Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter, while his two less skilled friends play for half that time, or 10 minutes per quarter. His more skilled friend plays for 1.5 times Jack's duration, meaning they play for 30 minutes per quarter.

Next, we convert the total playtime of 4 hours into minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now we can calculate the number of quarters each friend uses:

* Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters
* Weaker friends (2): 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters total, or 12 quarters each
* Stronger friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters

Finally, we sum the quarters used by all friends: 12 + 12 + 12 + 8 = 44 quarters.

Multiplying this by the cost per quarter ($0.25) gives us the total expenditure: 44 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $11.00

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

Define variables to represent the quantities:

* Let 'z' represent the ounces of citrus zest.
* Since the fragrance amount is equal to the zest,  'z' also represents the ounces of fragrance.
*  The salt and sugar amounts are equal, so let 's' represent the ounces of both salt and sugar.
*  The oil amount is twice the salt amount, so oil is 2s ounces.

We know the total weight of the scrub is 10 ounces: z + z + s + s + 2s = 10

Simplify the equation: 2z + 4s = 10

We also know that z = s (since the zest and salt amounts are equal). Substitute 'z' with 's' in the equation: 2s + 4s = 10

Combine like terms: 6s = 10

Solve for 's': s = 10/6 = 5/3 ounces

Finally, calculate the oil amount: 2s = 2 * (5/3) = 10/3 ounces.



**Answer:** Tanya uses 10/3 ounces of oil.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

* **Joe's initial car count:** Since Joe has twice the number of cars Robert has (20 cars), Joe begins with 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

* **Cars sold:** Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is calculated as 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.

* **Cars given away:** Joe donates twice the number of cars he sold, meaning he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

* **Total cars disposed of:**  Joe disposed of a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

* **Remaining cars:**  After selling and giving away cars, Joe has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.



**Therefore, Joe has 16 cars remaining.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using a system of equations.

Let:

*  *x* represent the number of cards PJ has.
*  *y* represent the number of cards Smendrick has.
*  *z* represent the number of cards Becca has.

We are given the following information:

1.  *x + y + z = 341*  (The total number of cards)
2.  *y = 3x* (Smendrick has three times the amount PJ has)
3.  *z = y + 12* (Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick)

Now we can substitute equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

*x + (3x) + (3x + 12) = 341*

Simplifying the equation:

*7x + 12 = 341*

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

*7x = 329*

Dividing both sides by 7:

*x = 47*

Now that we know *x* (PJ's cards), we can find *z* (Becca's cards):

*z = y + 12 = (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153*




**Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.**

"To determine the number of glue stick packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required: 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.  

Next, we divide the total glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.

Since Mr. Jackson can only purchase whole packs, he must round this number up to the nearest integer, resulting in the need for 7 packs.

"Let's analyze the badge-earning rates:

* **Claire:** Earns 1 badge per month.
* **Amber:** Earns 1 badge every two months (half the rate of Claire).
* **Wendy:** Earns three times the rate of Claire, meaning she earns 3 badges per month.

Over a year (12 months):

* Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
* Amber: 1 badge / 2 months * 12 months = 6 badges
* Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

Therefore, Wendy earns 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

"Let's analyze this problem systematically.  We can represent the number of books each person has with variables:

*  Let  'F' represent the number of books Fawn has.
*  Let 'A' represent the number of books Anne has.
*  Let 'S' represent the number of books Sofie has.

We are given the following information, which we can express as equations:

*  S + A + F = 85  (The total number of books)
*  S = A + 25   (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
*  A = F - 12    (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

To solve for F, we can use substitution.  First, substitute the second equation into the third equation:

S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

Now, substitute the values of A and S from the second and modified third equations into the first equation:

(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85

Simplify and solve for F:

3F + 1 = 85
3F = 84
F = 28



Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

"To determine the total cost, we can break down the problem step-by-step.

First, we need to find the price per bottle of soda and water.  We know 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, so a single bottle costs $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.  Similarly, 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, meaning each bottle costs $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the cost of David's purchase. Three bottles of soda would cost 3 * $3.00 = $9.00, and two bottles of water would cost 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Finally, the total cost is the sum of these two amounts: $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00. 



**Therefore, David's purchase will cost $13.00.**

"Let's analyze Kelly's grocery expenditure step-by-step.

The bacon costs $10 for 5 packs, implying a price of $2 per pack.  Each pack of chicken costs twice the price of bacon, making it $4.  The total cost of the chicken is 6 packs * $4/pack = $24.

Strawberries are priced at $4 per pack, so 3 packs cost 3 * $4 = $12.  Apples cost half the price of strawberries, meaning each pack costs $4 / 2 = $2.  The total cost of the apples is 7 packs * $2/pack = $14.

Adding up all the costs, we have $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Therefore, Kelly has $65 (budget) - $60 (spending) = $5 remaining in her budget.

"To determine the class's profit, we first need to calculate their total revenue and total expenses.  

Revenue is the total amount earned from selling the lollipops: 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.8/lollypop = $240.

Expenses are the costs incurred in purchasing the lollipops: 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollypop = $150.

Profit is the difference between revenue and expenses: $240 - $150 = $90. 


Therefore, the class raised a profit of $90 from selling the lollipops.

"Let's break down Larry's pet population systematically:

* **Dogs:** Larry has three times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 cats * 3 = 9 dogs.
* **Rabbits:** He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, meaning he has 9 dogs - 2 = 7 rabbits.
* **Fish:**  Larry's fish tank holds three times the number of fish as rabbits, resulting in 7 rabbits * 3 = 21 fish.
* **Gerbils:** His gerbil collection is one-third the size of his fish collection, so he has 21 fish / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Finally, to determine the total number of pets, we sum all the individual counts: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Water Transfer:** Anthony and his father transfer half the pool's water into the tank, which is 10000 gallons / 2 = 5000 gallons.

2. **Water Consumption:**  The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day for 6 days, resulting in a total consumption of 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons.

3. **Remaining Water:**  Subtracting the consumed water from the initial amount in the tank, we find 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons remaining.



Therefore, there will be **2000** gallons of water left in the tank after 6 days.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the calorie content of each mini pastry.  A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 the calories of a regular cinnamon roll, which has 600 calories.  Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has 600 calories / 3 = 200 calories.

Similarly, a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 the calories of a regular muffin, which has 450 calories.  This means a mini blueberry muffin has 450 calories / 3 = 150 calories.

Now we can calculate the total calories in each type of pastry:

* Cinnamon rolls: 200 mini rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories
* Blueberry muffins: 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories

Finally, to find the total calories in all the pastries, we add the calories from both types: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

"Let's analyze the problem systematically.  We are given that the sum of Peter's, Paul's, and Jean's ages is 100.  We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and Jean's ages.

Let's denote Jean's age as 'j', Paul's age as 'p', and Peter's age as 'pe'.  We can express the given information as a system of equations:

* pe + p + j = 100 
* p = j + 10
* pe = p + j

Substituting the second equation into the third equation, we get:

* pe = (j + 10) + j
* pe = 2j + 10

Now, substitute both the second and the modified third equation into the first equation:

* (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100

Simplifying the equation:

* 4j + 20 = 100
* 4j = 80
* j = 20

Now that we know Jean's age (j = 20), we can find Peter's age:

* pe = 2j + 10
* pe = (2 * 20) + 10
* pe = 50




Therefore, Peter is 50 years old.

"To determine the difference in earnings, we first need to calculate the daily production and revenue for each widget maker. 

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and sells them for $6 each, resulting in a daily revenue of 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * $6/widget = $8640.

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour, generating a daily revenue of 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * $6/widget = $6480.

Over a 30-day month, the Widgeteer 3000 would earn $8640/day * 30 days/month = $259,200.  

Similarly, the WidgetMaster 9000 would earn $6480/day * 30 days/month = $194,400.

Therefore, Cameron's cost would be:

* 1000 pesos (initial 12 hours) + (5 hours * 70 pesos/hour) = 1350 pesos.

Had he opted for the 24-hour rate, his cost would have been 1600 pesos.

The difference in cost represents his savings: 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos. 



**Answer:** Cameron saves 250 pesos. 
"
"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the amount of hay each sheep requires. We know a sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount a goat needs.  Since a goat needs 5 pounds of hay, twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.  Subtracting 3 pounds, we find that each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.

Similarly, the total hay needed for the sheep is 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

Finally, to find the total hay Nate needs, we add the hay required for both goats and sheep: 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds. 



**Answer:** Nate needs 159 pounds of hay.

"Let's analyze James's journey across the lake.  

First, we need to determine the time spent swimming the initial 60% of the lake's distance. This is calculated as:

Time = Distance / Speed = (0.60 * 20 miles) / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half the time he spent swimming: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

For the remaining 40% of the lake, he swims at half his original speed, meaning he travels at 1 mile per hour.  The time taken for this leg is:

Time = Distance / Speed = (0.40 * 20 miles) / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours.

Finally, to find the total time, we sum the time spent swimming the first leg, resting, and swimming the remaining distance:

Total Time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours. 



**Therefore, it took James 17 hours to cross the lake.**

"Let's analyze this Pokemon-catching scenario.  We can represent the number of Pokemon caught by each person with variables:

*  Let  'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
*  Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
*  Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

We are given the following information, which we can express as equations:

*  A + S + W = 339  (The total number of Pokemon caught)
*  A = S + 5         (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4W - 13       (Stan caught 13 less than four times Adelwolfe's catch)

To determine the number of Pokemon Stan caught (S), we can employ a substitution method:

1. **Substitute** the expressions for 'A' and 'W' from the second and third equations into the first equation:
   (S + 5) + S + (S - 13) / 4 = 339

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   2S + (S - 13) / 4 = 334

3. **Multiply** both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
   8S + S - 13 = 1336

4. **Combine** like terms:
   9S - 13 = 1336

5. **Add** 13 to both sides:
   9S = 1349

6. **Divide** both sides by 9:
   S = 149.89 (approximately)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a Pokemon, we can round this number to the nearest whole number.

*  t = e * 20 (The total watch time is the number of episodes multiplied by the length of each episode)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for 't':

t = (t / 20) * 20

Simplifying, we get:

t = t

This means the total watch time is equal to itself.  However, we know there must be a specific number of minutes.  Therefore, we need more information to determine the exact value of 't'.

"To determine the total distance between the bird's homes, we need to analyze the bird's flight path.  

The bird first flies 300 miles south at 30 mph for 10 hours.  Then, it flies 36 miles north at 18 mph for 2 hours. Finally, it flies another 110 miles south at 22 mph for 5 hours.

The net southward distance is the sum of the southward distances minus the northward distance: 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.



**Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Define variables:** Let 'R' represent the number of cherries Robert has, 'J' represent the number of cherries Jerry has, and 'I' represent the number of cherries Richard has.

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * We know R = 30 (Robert has 30 cherries).
   * We know R = I + 10 (Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard).
   * We know R + I + J = 60 (The total number of cherries is 60).

3. **Solve for J (the number of cherries Jerry has):**
   * Substitute R = 30 into the equation R = I + 10 to get 30 = I + 10.
   * Solving for I, we find I = 20 (Richard has 20 cherries).
   * Substitute R = 30 and I = 20 into the equation R + I + J = 60 to get 30 + 20 + J = 60.
   * Simplifying, we get 50 + J = 60.
   * Solving for J, we find J = 10 (Jerry has 10 cherries).

4. **Calculate the difference:** Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.



Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using a system of equations.

Let:

*  *E* = Emil's current age
*  *D* = Dad's current age
*  *B* = Brother's current age

We know the following:

*  *E* = 19 
*  *D* - 5 = 2 * (*E* + 5)  (Dad's age in 5 years will be twice Emil's age in 5 years)
*  *B* - 5 =  *E* / 2 (Brother's age in 5 years will be half Emil's age in 5 years)

Now we can substitute the known value of *E* into the equations:

*  *D* - 5 = 2 * (19 + 5)
*  *B* - 5 = 19 / 2

Simplifying:

*  *D* - 5 = 48
*  *B* - 5 = 9.5

Solving for *D* and *B*:

*  *D* = 53

"Let's break down Pat's flower bed dilemma.  

First, we need to determine the total linear space available for planting.  Converting the flower bed's length to inches, we have 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.  

Next, we factor in the spacing between plants.  With 1.5 feet of space between each plant, that translates to 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches of space per plant.  Subtracting this from the total length, we get 1332 inches - 18 inches = 1314 inches of usable planting space.

Now, we can calculate the number of plants Pat needs by dividing the usable planting space by the width of each plant: 1314 inches / 12 inches/plant = 109.5 plants.  Since Pat can't purchase half a plant, she'll need to buy 110 plants.

Finally, considering Pat already owns 17 plants, she needs to purchase 110 plants - 17 plants = 93 plants from the store.  At a cost of $6 per plant, the total expenditure will be 93 plants * $6/plant = $558.

"To determine the percentage of watermelon each adult receives, we can model this problem with a simple ratio. 

Let 'x' represent the size of a child's slice.  Since each adult receives a slice twice the size of a child's, an adult's slice is represented as '2x'.  

The total watermelon is divided into 6 slices, so we have the equation: 4x + 2(2x) = 6

Simplifying the equation: 4x + 4x = 6
                                 8x = 6
                                 x = 0.75

Therefore, a child's slice is 0.75 units.  An adult's slice is 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 units.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine the remaining water needed to fill the tank.

**Day 1:**

* Wanda pumps 1/4 of the tank's capacity: (1/4) * 18000 gallons = 4500 gallons
* Ms. B pumps 3/4 of Wanda's amount: (3/4) * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons
* Total pumped on day 1: 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons

**Day 2:**

* Wanda pumps 2/3 of her day 1 amount: (2/3) * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons
* Ms. B pumps 1/3 of her day 1 amount: (1/3) * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons
* Total pumped on day 2: 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step to determine the power bank's initial charge.

Let 'x' represent the power bank's initial charge percentage.

*  The power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours, resulting in a loss of 0.09 * 5 = 0.45x.

*  After these 5 hours, the remaining charge is x - 0.45x = 0.55x.

*  Subsequently, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours, leading to a loss of 0.07 * 3 = 0.21x.

*  The final charge, which is 28%, can be expressed as 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x.

*  Therefore, 0.34x = 0.28.

*  Solving for x, we find x = 0.28 / 0.34 = 0.82 or 82%.



**Answer:** The power bank's charge when Maria went to the park was 82%.

"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings.  Her hourly wage is $10, and she earns an additional $15 per hour in tips, resulting in a total of $25 per hour.  Working 40 hours a week, she earns $25 * 40 = $1000 per week.

Next, we need to figure out how much money she needs to save for her down payment.  A 20% down payment on a $10,000 car is $10,000 * 0.20 = $2000.

Finally, we can determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work by dividing the total amount needed for the down payment by her weekly earnings: $2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks.

"Let's break down Jamaar's purchasing power.  He has $10 and each fruit item has a specific price point after tax.  

First, we need to determine the total cost of the fruit he's already purchased:

* Peaches: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
* Pears: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
* Kiwis: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
* Apples: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these costs together, we get $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25.

This leaves Jamaar with $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 for additional purchases.

Finally, we can determine how many plums he can buy with the remaining funds: $0.75 / $0.25 per plum = 3 plums.

"The price of carrots increases by 5% annually.  We can model this with the following formula:

Future Price = Present Price * (1 + Growth Rate) ^ Number of Years

In this case:

* Present Price = $120
* Growth Rate = 0.05 (5%)
* Number of Years = 3

Plugging these values into the formula:

Future Price = $120 * (1 + 0.05) ^ 3 
Future Price = $120 * (1.05) ^ 3
Future Price = $120 * 1.157625
Future Price ≈ $138.92



Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be **$139**.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.  Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

The revenue from the small stuffed animals is 2x * $4 = $8x.  The revenue from the large stuffed animals is x * $12 = $12x.  

The total revenue is the sum of these two amounts: $8x + $12x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get $20x = $120.  Dividing both sides by $20, we find x = 6.

Therefore, Teresa sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step to determine the dwarves' ore output.

First, we need to calculate the daily ore production per dwarf with a steel pickaxe.  We know a dwarf mines 12 pounds with bare hands and twice that with an iron pickaxe (12 * 2 = 24 pounds).  A steel pickaxe increases output by 50% compared to the iron pickaxe, meaning an additional 24 * 0.50 = 12 pounds.  Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Next, we calculate the total daily output for 40 dwarves using steel pickaxes: 40 dwarves * 36 pounds/dwarf = 1440 pounds.

Finally, we determine the monthly output over 30 days: 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = 43,200 pounds.



**Answer:** 43,200 pounds

"Let's break down this probability problem step-by-step.

* **Event 1: Substitute Teacher** 
   The probability of a substitute teacher is 50%.

* **Event 2: Normal Teacher, No Extension**
   The probability of the normal teacher being present AND not giving an extension is 
   0.50 (probability of normal teacher) * 0.60 (probability of no extension) = 0.30

* **Event 3:  Normal Teacher, Extension, No Dog Excuse**
   The probability of the normal teacher being present, giving an extension, AND Marcus not using the dog excuse is 0.50 * 0.40 * 0.80 = 0.16

* **Event 4:  Normal Teacher, No Extension, Dog Excuse**
   The probability of the normal teacher being present, not giving an extension, AND Marcus using the dog excuse is 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06

The probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is the probability of any of these events NOT happening.  Therefore:

Probability (Marcus has to turn in homework) = 1 - (Probability of Event 1 + Probability of Event 2 + Probability of Event 3 + Probability of Event 4)

Probability (Marcus has to turn in homework) = 1 - (0.50 + 0.30 + 0.16 + 0.06) = 1 - 1.02 = **0.76**

"Let's break down this problem systematically. 

First, we need to determine Jim's total financial burden. This includes the principal amount of his student loans and the income he forgoes by not working during his four years of study.  His total loan amount is $50,000 per year * 4 years = $200,000.  His lost income is $25,000 per year * 4 years = $100,000.  Therefore, Jim needs to earn back a total of $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

Next, we calculate his post-graduation income. His degree triples his previous salary, so he now earns $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

Finally, we determine the number of years it will take him to recoup his expenses.  Dividing his total financial obligation by his new annual income, we get $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 3) + 2x = 32

Combining like terms: 4x + 3 = 32

Subtracting 3 from both sides: 4x = 29

Dividing both sides by 4: x = 7.25

This means Jake ate 7.25 slices.  

Becky ate x + 3 = 7.25 + 3 = 10.25 slices.

And Silvia ate 2x = 2 * 7.25 = 14.5 slices.

"To determine the discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to first calculate the price at which he purchased the watch.  A 75% discount on a $2000 watch means he paid 25% of the original price, which is 0.25 * $2000 = $500.

Subsequently, his friend purchased the watch for 120% of this price, equating to 1.20 * $500 = $600.

The discount his friend received is the difference between the original price and the price he paid,  $2000 - $600 = $1400.

Finally, the discount percentage is calculated as (discount amount / original price) * 100% = ($1400 / $2000) * 100% = 70%.

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 20

Therefore, Sam receives 20 feet of fence.  Since the total fence length is 100 feet, there is no leftover fence.

"Let's break down Marcel's bicycle sales to determine his total earnings.

First, we know the price of each bike type: MTBs at $500, BMXs at $250 (half the price of an MTB), and Trek bikes at $450.

We're given that Marcel sold 300 bikes in total, with half being Trek bikes (150 bikes) and 15% being BMX bikes (45 bikes).  This leaves 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes sold.

Now, we can calculate the earnings from each type:

* Trek bikes: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
* BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
* MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

Finally, to find Marcel's total earnings, we sum the earnings from each bike type: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let 'x' represent the number of miles Brian walks each day.  We know that in seven days, Sofie will walk 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.  Since Sofie will walk twice the distance Brian walks in that time, we can set up the equation:

7x = 70 / 2

Simplifying the equation:

Since the manufacturer needs a total of 420 toys (400 original order + 20 to complete the order), the fifth worker must produce 420 toys - 200 toys = 220 toys.

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 220 toys / 10 hours = 22 toys per hour.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let 'a' represent the number of eggs Arnold painted, and since he and Madeline painted the same amount, Madeline also painted 'a' eggs.  Let 's' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.  We know Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so he painted 's + 12' eggs.

We are given that the total number of eggs painted is 56.  This can be expressed as the equation:

a + a + s + (s + 12) = 56

Simplifying the equation:

2a + 2s + 12 = 56

2a + 2s = 44

a + s = 22

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs:

s + (s + 12) = 30

2s + 12 = 30

2s = 18

s = 9

Now that we know Sarah painted 9 eggs, we can substitute that back into the equation a + s = 22:

a + 9 = 22

a = 13

Therefore, Arnold painted 13 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

The difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs is 21 - 13 = 8.

"Let's break down this probability problem:

* **Define Events:**

    *  Let 'P' be the event that a baby is wearing purple.
    *  Let 'B' be the event that a baby is wearing a bow.

* **Probabilities:**

    *  P(P) = 3/4 (probability of a baby wearing purple)
    *  P(B|P) = 1/3 (probability of wearing a bow given they are wearing purple)
    *  P(B|¬P) = 1 (probability of wearing a bow given they are not wearing purple)

* **Calculate the Overall Probability:**

We want to find P(P|B), the probability a baby is wearing purple given they are wearing a bow.  We can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(P|B) = [P(B|P) * P(P)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of wearing a bow, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|P) * P(P)  +  P(B|¬P) * P(¬P)

Where P(¬P) = 1 - P(P) = 1/4

Substitute the values:

P(B) = (1/3) * (3/4) + 1 * (1/4) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2

Now, plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(P|B) = [(1/3) * (3/4)] / (1/2) = 1/2

* **Convert to Percentage:**

P(P|B) * 100% = 50%




**Therefore, there is a 50% chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.**

* **Stacy's Find:** Stacy finds twice the number of eggs Lamar did, meaning she finds 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.

* **Charlie's Find:** Charlie locates 2 fewer eggs than Stacy, resulting in a find of 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

* **Mei's Find:** Mei discovers half the number of eggs Charlie did, so she finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

* **Total Eggs Found:**  The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

* **Remaining Eggs:**  Subtracting the found eggs from the initial count, we determine that 36 - 27 = 9 eggs remain hidden. 



**Therefore, 9 eggs are still hidden in the yard.**

"Let's analyze the avocado tree's fruit production over its lifespan:

* **Year 5:** 50 fruits
* **Year 6:** 50 * 3 = 150 fruits
* **Year 7:** 50 * 7 = 350 fruits
* **Year 8:**  A 10-year-old tree produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits, and an 8-year-old produces 200 less, so it yields 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
* **Year 9:** 0 fruits
* **Year 10:** 1000 fruits

Summing the fruit production across all years: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350 fruits.



Therefore, an avocado tree produces a total of **2350** fruits in its 10-year lifespan.

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as 'y'.  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so its length is 'y - 7'.  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, making its length '4(y - 7)'.

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

Therefore, the length of the red rope is:

4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let 'x' represent the amount of money each sibling gave to their sister.

Rissa received three times the amount Ronnie did, meaning she started with 3 * $5 = $15.  After giving away 'x' dollars, Rissa has $15 - x dollars remaining.  We're told this amount is equal to 4/5 of her original amount:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15$

Simplifying the equation:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting 15 from both sides:

$-x = -3$

Finally, multiplying both sides by -1:

$x = $3

This means each sibling gave $3 to their sister.  Since Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, he has $5 - $3 = $2 remaining. 



**Therefore, Ronnie has $2 left.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Bedroom Area:** Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

2. **Total Bedroom Area:**  Since there are four bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 240 * 4 = 960 square feet.

3. **Living Room Area:** The living room is five times the size of a bedroom, meaning its area is 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

4. **Total House Area:**  Adding the areas of the bedrooms, living room, and the remaining 1000 square feet, we get 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.



Therefore, the total area of the house is **3160 square feet**.

"Let's break down the problem systematically.

In the first half, Team B scores 2 fewer goals than Team A, who scored 4.  Therefore, Team B scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, Team B's goal output quadruples their first-half performance, resulting in 2 * 4 = 8 goals.  Team A, in the second half, scores one-fourth the number of goals Team B scored, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Finally, to determine the total goals in the match, we sum the goals scored by each team in both halves: Team A (4 + 2 = 6 goals) and Team B (2 + 8 = 10 goals).  

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using a system of equations.

Define variables:

* Let Wendy's current age be represented by 'w'
* Let Colin's current age be represented by 'c'

Formulate equations based on the given information:

*  ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now"":  w = 5(c + 7)
*  ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now"": c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations and two unknowns, allowing us to solve for 'c'.

Solve for 'w' in terms of 'c' from the first equation:

w = 5c + 35

Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for 'c':

3c + 75 = 5c + 35
40 = 2c
c = 20

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step to determine the initial number of bandages.

* **Day 3:** The nurses had 78 bandages left after using half a bulk pack (50/2 = 25 bandages) and receiving two bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages).  This means they had 78 + 25 - 100 = 69 bandages at the start of day 3.

* **Day 2:**  They used 10 fewer bandages than day 1, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages on day 2.

* **Total Bandages Used:** Over the three days, they used a total of 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages.

* **Initial Bandages:**  To find the starting number, we add the total used to the number they had at the start of day 3: 91 + 69 = 160 bandages.

Over 11 months, Stephen pays a total of $25 per month, resulting in a payment of $25 * 11 = $275.

Finally, to find the amount Stephen pays in the twelfth month, we subtract the total paid over the first 11 months from the total amount owed: $306 - $275 = $31.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.

First, we need to determine the jar's volume: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.  

Next, considering the packing efficiency, the usable volume for jelly beans is 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

We can then calculate the maximum number of jelly beans the jar could hold: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

Tim estimates that 30% of these jelly beans are red, so his estimated number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.30 = 864.

Finally, the difference between his estimate and the actual number of red jelly beans (900) is 900 - 864 = 36. 



**Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.**

"Let's break down Pauline's museum expenditures.

Initially, Pauline spends $2 per visit, making three visits annually. Over five years, her total expenditure is 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

Subsequently, the price per visit increases by 150%, adding $3 to the original $2, resulting in a new price of $5 per visit.  

For the next three years, Pauline continues her museum visits at the increased rate, spending 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

Therefore, Pauline's total museum expenditure over the eight-year period is $30 + $45 = $75.

"Let's analyze Jake's shopping trip step-by-step.

The T-shirt deal offers a 50% discount on the second shirt, effectively reducing the cost of the second T-shirt to half its original price.  Since each T-shirt originally costs $8, the second shirt costs $4.  Therefore, the total cost of the two T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

The shoes are discounted by 40% of their original price of $40. This discount amounts to $16 ($40 * 0.40).  Subtracting the discount from the original price, we find the sale price of the shoes to be $24 ($40 - $16).

Finally, to determine Jake's total expenditure, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let  'x' represent Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.  Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, his speed is 2x.

We know Aaron runs 2 miles (half the distance Vanessa runs) in 16 minutes.  Therefore:

"This problem can be solved using a system of equations.  Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows. We know:

*  c + w = 20  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

We can solve for 'c' using substitution.  From the first equation, we can isolate 'w':

w = 20 - c

Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
