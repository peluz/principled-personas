"Let's break this problem down step by step.

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

*  At the green house, she sold x/3.

*  At the red house, she sold 2 more, so that's x/3 + 2.

*  After the green and red houses, she had x - (x/3) - 2  vacuum cleaners left.

*  At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (1/2) * (x - (x/3) - 2).

*  We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so: x - (x/3) - 2 - (1/2) * (x - (x/3) - 2) = 5

Now we can solve for x:

1. Simplify the equation.
2. Combine like terms.
3. Isolate x.

"Let's figure this out!  Gretchen has 110 coins in total, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  

If we think of the silver coins as 's' and the gold coins as 'g', we can set up these equations:

* g = s + 30

We can use substitution to solve for 'g'. Since we know g = s + 30, we can substitute that into the first equation:

s + (s + 30) = 110

Now, combine like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

s = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  Now we can find the number of gold coins:

g = s + 30
g = 40 + 30
g = 70


Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

* **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**  There are three even numbers (2, 4, and 6). The probability of rolling one even number is 3/6 or 1/2.  Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

"Let's break this problem down:

*  First, we know the hamsters used 50 pieces of straw (10 hamsters * 5 pieces/hamster).
*  Then, the rabbits used 20 pieces of straw.
*  That means the rats used 90 pieces of straw (160 total pieces - 50 pieces - 20 pieces).
*  Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, there are 15 rats in total (90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat).
*  Finally, with the rats divided equally among 3 cages, there are 5 rats in each cage (15 rats / 3 cages).

* **Noah's age six years ago:**  Noah was half Cera's age six years ago, meaning he was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
* **Population of Chile six years ago:** We know the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.
* **Population of Chile now:** The population of Chile is now double what it was six years ago, so the current population is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"Let's break this down:

First, we need to figure out the total interest Karan will pay.  That's calculated by multiplying the principal amount ($3650), the interest rate (10%), and the time (5 months), then dividing by 100.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Chip Cost:** 3 bags of chips * $0.40/bag = $1.20
* **Money Left:** George had $5.00 and spent $1.20 on chips, leaving him with $5.00 - $1.20 = $3.80.
* **Candy Bar Cost:** Since $3.80 represents 1% of his original $5.00, he spent $5.00 - $3.80 = $1.20 on candy bars.
* **Number of Candy Bars:** $1.20 / $0.75/candy bar = 1.6 candy bars.

Since George can't buy parts of candy bars, he bought **1** candy bar.

* **Venue 1:** Costs $200 plus $5 per guest for food.
* **Venue 2:** Costs $25 per guest, and food is included.

To find out when the venues cost the same, we need to set up an equation.  Let 'x' represent the number of guests.

* Venue 1 cost: $200 + $5x
* Venue 2 cost: $25x

Now we can set them equal:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Subtract $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Divide both sides by $20:

x = 10


**Answer:** Mark needs 10 guests for the venues to cost the same.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

*  Let's say Bodhi found 'B' insects.
*  David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found B/2 insects.
*  Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found (B/2) + 7 insects.

We know that together they found 43 insects, so:

B + (B/2) + 7 = 43

Now we can solve for B:

* (3/2)B + 7 = 43
* (3/2)B = 36
* B = 24 

Since David found half of Bodhi's insects, David found 24 / 2 = 12 insects.

Finally, Lily found 12 + 7 = 19 insects.




Lily found 19 insects.

*  Let 't' be the age of one triplet.
*  Since one twin is 7 years older than a triplet, the twin's age is 't + 7'.

*  The total age of all five children is 44, so we have the equation: t + t + t + (t + 7) + (t + 7) = 44

*  Simplifying the equation: 5t + 14 = 44

*  Subtracting 14 from both sides: 5t = 30

*  Dividing both sides by 5: t = 6

*  Now that we know one triplet is 6, we can find the twin's age: 6 + 7 = 13


One of the twins is 13 years old.

"Let's break down the cost of the fruit crate:

* **Bananas:** Each banana costs twice as much as an apple, which is $0.50, so a banana costs $1.00.  The crate has 5 bananas, so they cost $1.00 * 5 = $5.00.
* **Apples:** Apples cost $0.50 each, and there are 12 in the crate, for a total of $0.50 * 12 = $6.00.
* **Oranges:** Oranges are the most expensive, costing three times the price of a banana, or $1.00 * 3 = $3.00 each. With 7 oranges, they cost $3.00 * 7 = $21.00.

Finally, add up the cost of all the fruits: $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00.

"To figure this out, first we need to see how many students are in each group if they are divided into six groups.  There are 54 students divided by 6 groups, which means each group has 9 students.

If they need 12 groups, that means they need 12 groups times 9 students per group, which equals 108 students.

Since they only have 54 students now, they need 108 students - 54 students = 54 more students.

To figure out how many more groups they need, we divide the number of extra students by the number of students per group: 54 students / 9 students per group = 6 groups.

Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish, for a total of 7.  He bought 17 new fish, and now he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  

Let's use variables:

*  Let 'w' represent the number of white fish Bob bought.
*  Let 'o' represent the number of orange fish Bob bought.

We know:

*  w + o = 17 (The total number of fish he bought)
*  o = 2w (He has twice as many orange as white)

We can use substitution to solve for 'w'. Since we know o = 2w, we can substitute that into the first equation:

w + 2w = 17

Combining like terms:

3w = 17

w = 5.67

Since Bob can't buy parts of fish, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"Let's figure this out! 

Milo needs 12 chips per square inch for his mosaic.  Since his mosaic is 3 inches tall, he'll need 3 * 12 = 36 chips for the height.

He has 72 chips per bag and two bags, so he has 72 * 2 = 144 chips total.

That means he has 144 - 36 = 108 chips left over.

With 108 chips and 12 chips needed per inch, his mosaic can be 108 / 12 = 9 inches long.

"Let's figure this out!

First, we need to find out how much tea was drunk in total.  Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so they drank 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Then, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, for a total of 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

That means a total of 6 + 32 = 38 quarts of tea were consumed.

Since there are 10 quarts left, there must have been 10 + 38 = 48 quarts at the beginning of the party.

Finally, there are 4 quarts in a gallon, so there were 48 / 4 = 12 gallons of tea at the beginning.

"Felix made $105 during the week helping kids get their stuff out of trees. He charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs.  To find out how many branches he climbed on average each day, we need to figure out the total number of branches and then divide by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find the total number of branches: $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Next, divide the total branches by 7 days: 420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches/day

* Then she adds 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals
* Next, she picks 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals
* And finally, 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals

That's a total of 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals before any are lost.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Jack's playtime:** Jack plays for 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes. Since he plays for 20 minutes per quarter, he uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

* **Weaker friends' playtime:** Each of the weaker friends plays for half as long as Jack, so they play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They play for a total of 2 friends * (240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter) = 48 quarters.

* **Better friend's playtime:** The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, meaning they play for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. They use 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

* **Total quarters:**  Adding up the quarters used by everyone, we get 12 quarters + 48 quarters + 8 quarters = 68 quarters.

* **Total money spent:**  Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total money spent is 68 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17.00.

*  Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Now, let's solve for x:

* Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329
* Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

"Let's figure this out!

* Let F be the number of books Fawn has.
* Let A be the number of books Anne has.
* Let S be the number of books Sofie has.

We know:

* S + A + F = 85 (Total books)
* S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more than Anne)
* A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer than Fawn)

Let's substitute to solve for F:

1. Since S = A + 25, we can write: (A + 25) + A + F = 85

2.  Simplifying: 2A + F + 25 = 85

3.  We also know A = F - 12, so substitute that in: 2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85

4.  Expanding: 2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85

5.  Combining like terms: 3F + 1 = 85

6.  Subtracting 1 from both sides: 3F = 84

7.  Dividing both sides by 3: F = 28



Fawn has 28 books.

Let's use variables to represent each person's age:

* Peter's age: P
* Paul's age: Pa
* John's age: J

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100  
* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

We can use substitution to find Peter's age:

1. Since Pa = J + 10, we can substitute that into the equation P = Pa + J:
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. Now substitute both Pa = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. Simplify and solve for J:
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4.  Substitute J = 20 back into the equation P = 2J + 10:
   P = (2 * 20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10
   P = 50



Peter is 50 years old.

"Let's figure this out!

First, we need to calculate how many widgets each machine makes in a month:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each machine:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Finally, the difference in earnings is:

* $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"Let's figure out how much Cameron saves!

He stays for 17 hours total (from 5 pm to 10 am).  The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos, and he pays an extra 70 pesos per hour for the remaining 5 hours. That's 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.

So, his total cost is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

If he'd paid for the full 24 hours, it would have cost him 1600 pesos.

Cameron saves 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

"Let's figure this out!

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount a goat needs.  That means each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds of hay.

"Let's figure this out! 

* Let A be the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
* Let S be the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
* Let W be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

We know:

* A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon)
* A = S + 5 (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

Let's use substitution to solve for S:

1. Since A = S + 5, we can substitute (S + 5) for A in the first equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. Simplify:
   2S + W = 334

3.  We also know S = 4W - 13. Substitute that into the simplified equation:
   2S + W = 334
   2(4W - 13) + W = 334

4. Simplify and solve for W:
   8W - 26 + W = 334
   9W = 360
   W = 40

5. Now that we know W = 40, substitute it back into the equation S = 4W - 13:

"Let's break this problem down:

*  The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high.
*  The room warms up 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.

Here's how the temperature changes:

* **Low setting (3 hours):** 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees cooler
* **High setting (4 hours):** 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees cooler
* **Total cooling:** 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees cooler
* **Warming (2 hours):** 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees warmer

* **Net cooling:** 18 degrees cooler - 4 degrees warmer = 14 degrees cooler


The final temperature was **14 degrees** lower than the starting temperature.

"Let's break this problem down:

*  Bill's dad saw Comet Halley when he was 30 years old.
*  Bill saw it again when he was three times his dad's age, so he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.
*  Since the comet returns every 75 years,  the time between Bill's two sightings is 75 years.

*  This means Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he first saw the comet.

*  After those 5 hours, the remaining charge was x - 0.45x = 0.55x

*  Over the next 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% per hour, for a total loss of 7 * 3 = 21%.

*  This means the final charge, 28%, is equal to 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x

"Hey there! Let's break this down. 

Marcus has a 50% chance of having a substitute teacher who won't collect homework.  If his regular teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.  Even if no one gets an extension, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing her his dog ate his homework.

To figure out the chance he *has* to turn it in, we need to think about all the ways he *doesn't* get out of it.

*  He has to turn it in if there's no substitute AND no extension AND he doesn't convince the teacher about the dog.

Let's calculate those probabilities:

* No substitute: 50%
* No extension (given the regular teacher is there): 60% (100% - 40%)
* Doesn't convince the teacher: 80% (100% - 20%)

Now, multiply those probabilities together: 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.24

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

*  Let 'x' represent the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.

*  The first set had four more balls than the second: x + 4
*  The third set had half the number of balls as the second: x / 2

*  In total, he retrieved 19 balls: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Now, let's solve for x:

* Combine like terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19
* Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15
* Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6

Finally, find the number of balls in the first set:

* First set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10




Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. 

The car depreciates 21% each year, so we need to calculate that for each year from 2007 to 2010.

* **2008:** Depreciation = $20000 * 0.21 = $4200
   Price in 2008 = $20000 - $4200 = $15800

* **2009:** Depreciation = $15800 * 0.21 = $3318
   Price in 2009 = $15800 - $3318 = $12482

* **2010:** Depreciation = $12482 * 0.21 = $2622.62
   Price in 2010 = $12482 - $2622.62 = $9859.38

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. 

If 40% of the school is made up of 240 boys, we can find the total number of students first.  

*  Think of it like this: 40% represents 240 students.  
*  To find 100%, we can set up a proportion: 40/100 = 240/x
*  Cross-multiply: 40x = 100 * 240
*  Simplify: 40x = 24000
*  Solve for x (the total number of students): x = 24000 / 40 = 600 students

Now that we know there are 600 students total, we can find the number of girls:

*  Subtract the number of boys from the total: 600 - 240 = 360 girls

*  Together, they painted 2x eggs.

*  Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs in total, with Camden painting 12 more than Sarah.  Let's say Sarah painted 'y' eggs, so Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.

*  We know y + (y + 12) = 30

*  Combining like terms: 2y + 12 = 30

*  Subtracting 12 from both sides: 2y = 18

*  Dividing both sides by 2: y = 9 (Sarah painted 9 eggs)

*  Camden painted y + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

*  Since Arnold and Madeline painted 2x eggs, and the total is 56, we have 2x + 30 = 56

*  Subtracting 30 from both sides: 2x = 26

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at a certain speed and takes 40 minutes to do so.  To find her speed on the beach, we divide the distance by the time: 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed there is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at this faster speed.  To find the time spent on the sidewalk, we divide the distance by the speed: 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

Finally, to get the total time for her 3-mile walk, we add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'y - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, making it 4 * (y - 7) centimeters long.

We know the total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Now, let's solve for 'y':

* y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
* 6y - 35 = 37
* 6y = 72
* y = 12

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:

* Red rope length = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20


The red rope is 20 centimeters long.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, Rissa received three times the amount Ronnie did, so she started with 3 * $5 = $15.

Both Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount of money to their sister. Let's call that amount 'x'.

We know that after giving money away, Rissa has 4/5 of her original amount left.  This means:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides:

-x = -3

Multiplying both sides by -1:

x = $3

So, each of them gave $3 to their sister.

Finally, Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, leaving him with $5 - $3 = $2.

"Let's figure this out!

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower, so it has 0.50 * 36 = 18 more seeds. That means a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Together, they have 36 + 54 = 90 sunflower seeds.

"Let's figure out Jake's total spending!

First, the T-shirts: since he gets 50% off the second one, he pays $8 for the first and $4 for the second (half price). That's $8 + $4 = $12 for the T-shirts.

Next, the shoes: a 40% discount on $40 is $16, so the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, add up the cost of the T-shirts and shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.


Jake spends $36 at the store.

"Let's figure this out! 

If Farmer Brown has 20 animals and they have a total of 70 legs, we can use a little bit of math to find out how many are chickens. 

* Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We know:

*  c + w = 20  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

We can use substitution to solve for 'c'.  From the first equation, we know w = 20 - c.  Let's plug that into the second equation:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplify and solve for 'c':

2c + 80 - 4c = 70
-2c = -10
c = 5


There are **5** chickens on Farmer Brown's farm!
