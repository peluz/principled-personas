To figure out how old Allen will be in 10 years, we gotta figure out how old he is now.  

If they're 7 to 11, that means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11.  

So, we gotta split 162 years up into 18 parts (7 + 11).  Each part is 162 / 18 = 9 years old.

Allen is 11 parts, so he's 11 * 9 = 99 years old now.

In 10 years, he'll be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"Okay, so there's 60 dogs, right? And for every dog, there's two cats.  That means there's 60 dogs times 2 cats, which is 120 cats.

So, there's 60 dogs plus 120 cats, which is 180 dogs and cats altogether.

The problem says there are 12 less rabbits than dogs and cats, so there's 180 minus 12, which is 168 rabbits.

If you add up all the animals, you got 168 rabbits plus 180 dogs and cats, which is 348 pets in total.

So far, she spent 100 plus 80, which is 180 bucks.

Now, the 2x4s went up by half, so they cost 10 times 1.50, which is 15 bucks each.  And the big ones went up by half too, so they cost 16 times 1.50, which is 24 bucks each.

She sells all the 2x4s for 15 bucks each, so that's 10 times 15, which is 150 bucks.  And she sells all the big ones for 24 bucks each, so that's 5 times 24, which is 120 bucks.

So she made 150 plus 120, which is 270 bucks.

If she spent 180 bucks and made 270 bucks, that means she made 270 minus 180, which is 90 bucks.

Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so that's 4 times 45, which is 180 bucks.  He buys 20 peppers, so that's 20 times 15, which is 300 bucks. And he buys 10 oranges, so that's 10 times 40, which is 400 bucks.

If you add all that up, it's 180 plus 300 plus 400, which is 880 bucks.

Let's see... 500 people times 24 minutes... that's a whole lotta minutes!  

If they make $150 an hour from the doctors, and they see folks for a whole bunch of hours, that's gotta be a good chunk of change. And then they charge folks even more!

He didn't finish all the questions, though.  The first test had 75 and the second had 100, so that's 75 + 100 = 175 questions.

I dunno, maybe there's like, 50 queens?  That'd mean 100 babies, right?  And then twice as many worker bees as babies... so that'd be 200 worker bees.  

But that doesn't seem right, 'cause that's only 350 bees total.  

Let's try a smaller number for the queens... maybe 25?  That'd be 50 babies, and then 100 worker bees.

"Okay, so the hat is 25 bucks, right?  The jacket is three times that, so it's 75 bucks.  The pants cost the same as the hat and jacket put together, and then you split it in half.  So, that's like 100 bucks for the pants.  Then you add it all up: 25 plus 75 plus 100... that's 200 bucks! 


"
"Let's see... 80 spiders, and they got 8 legs each, so that's a whole lotta legs! 80 times 8 is...  *counts on fingers*  640 legs!  

Then there's 90 bugs, and they got 6 legs each, so that's 90 times 6... *counts on fingers again*  540 legs!

And then there's them weird ones with 10 legs each, 3 of 'em... that's 3 times 10... 30 legs!

*Adds up the legs* 640 plus 540 plus 30... that's 1210 legs! 



"
"Let's see... Sally Four and Sally Thirtytwo are the same age, and they're 8 years old.  Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so she's 8 times 2, which is 16.  Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so she's 16 plus 3, which is 19.  

Now, add up all their ages: 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51

"
"Okay, so she pays $300 for her student loans, $200 for her credit card, and $500 for her house. That's $1000 all together.  She wants to pay 50% more than that, so she pays an extra $500.  So she pays $1500 every month.

"Okay, so Zaid makes $6000 a month. He spends $1500 on rent 'cause that's a quarter of his money. Then he spends $2000 on gas, 'cause that's a third.  

That's $3500 gone already.  He gives half of what's left to charity, which is $1250.

Then he gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700. That's another $900 gone.

So, he started with $6000, spent $3500, then $1250, and then $900.  

Let me see... $6000 - $3500 - $1250 - $900 = $350 left.

The other team, the first guy is slow, 60 seconds.  But then he gets faster, like 3 seconds faster each time.  So, 57, then 54, then 51.  Add those up, that's 222 seconds.

So the first team wins by 2 seconds!

If you add it all up, tickets plus food plus rides, that's $20.25 plus $15.75 plus $66, which is $102.  

And they split it three ways, so each person paid $102 divided by 3, which is $34.

"Okay, so he starts with 50 trees, right?  He plants 10 more every year for 10 years, so that's 100 more trees.  Then he chops down 2 each year, so that's 20 less.  

That means he has 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.

Then 30% of 'em die, which is a whole lotta trees!  Let's see, 30% of 130 is... well, I dunno, a lot!  But it's gotta be less than 130.  So he's got less than 130 left.

Let's see... they took away 6, so there's 12 pink left. Then they put 6 white ones back, so there's 12 pink and 6 white. Then they put 18 more pink ones out, so that's 12 plus 18, which is 30 pink!  

So, there's 30 pink and 6 white... that means there's 30 - 6 = 24 more pink ones! 



**24**

"She got ten dollars back.  
"
"A pen costs the same as a pencil and eraser together.  A pencil is $1.20 and an eraser is $0.30.  So a pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

"They got 200 pounds of carrots and wanna give each of the 40 places 2 pounds.  So, that's 40 times 2... which is 80 pounds.

"Okay, so she starts with 20 cards, right? Then she gets three times that many, so that's 20 times 3, which is 60 cards.  

Next month she gets 20 less than the month before, so that's 60 minus 20, which is 40 cards.

Then she gets twice the amount from the first two months put together.  So, that's 60 plus 40, which is 100, and then 100 times 2, which is 200 cards.

Finally, you add up all the cards she got: 20 plus 60 plus 40 plus 200, which is 320 cards. 



"
"Okay, so Mark edits 1000 sentences, right? And he gets 5 cents for each one from one guy. That's 1000 times 5, which is 5000 cents.  The other guy pays him twice as much, so that's 5 cents times 2, which is 10 cents per sentence.  He edits the same amount for that guy, so that's 10 cents times 1000 sentences, which is 10,000 cents.  

Now, we gotta add that all up: 5000 cents plus 10,000 cents is... 15,000 cents!





"
"He gets 5 pails in the mornin' and 6 in the afternoon. Each pail holds 5 liters, so...  

Let's see... 5 times 5 is 25, and 6 times 5 is 30.  

So, 25 plus 30 is... 55! 


**55** 
"
"He gets five thousand dollars right away, and then he makes a hundred dollars more every week.  So he makes a hundred dollars more a week times fifty-two weeks, which is five thousand two hundred dollars.

"Okay, so there's 25 chocolate bars and they each weigh 40 grams, right? That's 25 times 40, which is a hundred...  a hundred...  *counts on fingers*  a hundred and...  *struggles*  ...oh, a thousand grams!

Then there's 80 of them apple things, and they weigh half as much as a chocolate bar, so 40 divided by 2 is 20 grams each.  

So, 80 times 20 is... *counts on fingers again* ... sixteen hundred grams!

Add those together, a thousand and sixteen hundred... that's... *counts on fingers* ... two thousand, six hundred grams! 





"
"She bought four cakes on Monday, then three times that on Tuesday, so that's twelve more. Then she bought five times the amount from Tuesday on Wednesday, so that's sixty cakes!  If you add it all up, she bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.

"Okay, so they got these plates, right? Half a dozen of 'em cost a whole lotta money, $6000 each!  That's $36,000 for the whole bunch.

Now, these cups, they cost $1200 less than those fancy plates.  Twenty dozen cups, that's a whole lotta cups!  

If they cost $36,000 minus $1200, that means they cost $34,800.

To figure out how much one cup costs, we gotta divide that big number by the number of cups. Twenty dozen is 240 cups, so... $34,800 divided by 240... that's $145 for each cup! 


**Answer:** $145 
"
"Okay, so Sara wants a jacket for thirty bucks and two pairs of shoes at twenty bucks each. That's sixty bucks for the shoes, right?  So, that's thirty plus sixty... ninety bucks total!

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the little one.  How much water is in the little pool now?

Let me think...  If the big pool had twice as much water before, and now it has four times as much, that means it got a whole lot more water.  The little pool must have lost a lot too, 'cause it's not getting any new water.  

Hmm... I dunno, I'm not good at math.  



"
"She needs to work a whole lotta hours!  Shoes cost a whole bunch, and then there's that belt too.  Let's see... if she makes eight bucks an hour, and she needs to make three hundred and fifty-two dollars...  That's a lot of hours!  I reckon it's gotta be around forty-four hours.

In three years, Harriet will be 21 plus 3, that's 24. Zack will be 42 plus 3, that's 45. And Adrian will be 63 plus 3, that's 66.

So, to find the average, you add all their ages together: 24 plus 45 plus 66, that's 135. Then you divide that by 3, which is 45.

"Okay, so there's this game, right?  Four folks played and got 251 points total. Naomi got 68, which is a good chunk. Yuri got 10 more than half of what Naomi got.  Brianna got 17 more than Naomi.  So, to find out what Jojo got, we gotta figure out how many points the other three got first.  

Let's see... half of Naomi's points is 68 divided by 2, which is 34. Yuri got 34 plus 10, so he got 44 points. Brianna got 68 plus 17, so she got 85 points.

Now, add up Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna's points: 68 plus 44 plus 85 is 197.

Finally, subtract that from the total points to find Jojo's score: 251 minus 197 is 54.

He had 40 water cards and lost 8, so he has 32 left.  He had 20 grass cards and got 14 more, so he has 34 grass cards now.  

That means he has 32 + 34 + 30 = 96 cards total.

So, out of 96 cards, 32 are water. That's like, a little more than a third, right?

33%

Then he has to pay ten percent tax on that, which is...  two thousand four hundred dollars.

Then she does it 4 days a week, so that's $1500 times 4, which is $6000 a week.

The movie takes 5 weeks, so that's $6000 times 5, which is $30,000.

But then she gets a discount, 10% off, so that's $30,000 times 0.10, which is $3000.

So, she pays $30,000 minus $3000, which is $27,000.

"She spent a whole bunch of money, like, $12 for cake stuff, $43 for presents, $15 for decorations, $4 for invites, and $22 for goodie bags.  That's a lotta money!  

If she split it with her two parents, that's three people.  So, she had to pay $32 each.

"Let's see... four bags of onions, and each bag has 50 pounds... that's a whole lotta onions!  If each pound is a buck fifty,  that means...  *counts on fingers*  $1.50 times 200...  *struggles*  ... that's $300!

"Okay, so the sister ate 5 cookies one day and 13 the next.  That's a whole lotta cookies! Sue ate four times as many as her sister the first day, so she ate 5 times 4, which is 20 cookies. Then she ate twice as many as her sister the next day, so she ate 13 times 2, which is 26 cookies.  

Sue ate 20 plus 26, which is 46 cookies in all. Her sister ate 5 plus 13, which is 18 cookies.

Each cookie has 200 calories, so Sue ate 46 times 200, which is 9200 calories. Her sister ate 18 times 200, which is 3600 calories.

Sue ate 9200 minus 3600, which is 5600 more calories than her sister.

"Let's see...  There's 20 kids in each class, and there's three classes, so that's 60 kids total. Half the kids are boys, so that's 30 boys.  The first class has 15 girls and the second has 12, so that's 27 girls.  If there's 30 boys and 27 girls, that means there's 6 boys in the last class.

"He started with 61 apps, then took away 9, so that's 61 - 9 = 52.  Then he put 18 more on, so 52 + 18 = 70 apps.

"Let's see... he killed ten wolves and fifteen of them furry cat things yesterday.  Today he got three times as many wolves as them cat things, so that's a whole lotta wolves!

"Mitchel went down the slide a whole lotta times, 30!  Anne went down less, like, 30% less than Mitchel.  That's a bit tricky, but I know 30% is like a third, so she went down 10 less times.  Robert went down way more than Anne, like 4 times more!  So he went down 84 times! 


"
"Okay, so there's ten places with twenty cows each, right? That's a whole lotta cows! Then this fella, Mr. Sylas, buys forty more cows and puts them in all the places.  

If he puts the new cows evenly, that means each place gets two more cows.  

So, if we take eight of them places, each with two extra cows, that's eight times two... which is sixteen cows! 


"
"Let's see... he's got a whole bunch of pennies, that's like, a dollar, right?  Then he's got some nickels, those are worth a nickel each, so that's a couple bucks.  Dimes are worth ten cents, so that's another couple bucks. And he's got forty dollar bills, that's, like, forty bucks!  

If you add it all up, he's got a whole lotta money!

"
"Okay, so the tree is 200 feet tall and each part is 10 feet long. That means there are, like, 20 pieces of the tree.  Each piece weighs 400 pounds, so the whole tree weighs 20 times 400, which is... 8000 pounds!  But the termites ate some, 30% of it.  That's a lot!  Let's see, 30% of 8000 is...  *counts on fingers*  That's 2400 pounds!  So, the tree weighs 8000 minus 2400, which is... 5600 pounds!

"She owes fifty cents for each book, and she got eight books. So that's eight times fifty cents, which is four dollars.  Then she gotta pay two more dollars 'cause one book was late.  So, four plus two is six dollars.

"Okay, lemme see... Andrea got lotsa apples, 52 of 'em! Jamal got 8 less apples than her, so he got 52 - 8 = 44 apples.  

Jamal got 4 more bananas than apples, so he got 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea got half as many bananas as Jamal, so she got 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Andrea got 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.

Jamal got 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits.

Together they got 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"Okay, so there's 9,300 pennies in a cup.  They want to know how much money is in two-thirds of that cup.  

Hmm... two-thirds... that's like, a lot!  Let's see... if I take a big chunk outta that cup, like two-thirds, I bet it's gonna be a good bit of money.

"Chris got 6 trees, see?  Ferdinand got half as many as Chris, so he got 3 trees.  Harry got twice as many as Ferdinand, but then he got 5 more.  So Harry got 6 times 2, which is 12, and then he got 5 more, so he got 17 trees.  Harry got 17 - 3 = 14 more trees than Ferdinand.

"Carmen got a hunnert bucks, Samantha got twenty-five more than Carmen, so she got one-twenty-five.  Daisy got fifty more than Samantha, so she got one-seventy-five.  If you add it all up, they got four hundred dollars together.

"Okay, so the house costs $350,000.  Then there's this extra money for the people helpin' sell it, 5% of $350,000... that's $17,500.  And then there's another fee, 12% of $350,000, which is $42,000.  

So, the house costs $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Mrs. Cruz only has $400,000, so that means the house costs $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500 more than she can afford. 



"
"Okay, so he sold the house for four hundred thousand dollars.  Then he had to pay some fees, like three percent of the price for moving it over, and five percent to the people who helped him sell it.  That's twelve thousand plus twenty thousand, right?  Then he paid two hundred fifty thousand for the rest of the money he owed on the house.  

If you take all that money away from the four hundred thousand, how much is left?  Let me see... four hundred minus two hundred eighty-two is... one hundred eighteen thousand! 



"
"Okay, so the oil takes 20 minutes to get to 300 degrees. Then it takes 40% longer to get to 400 degrees.  That means it takes 8 more minutes, right? So that's 28 minutes to get the oil hot.

Then it cooks for 5 minutes less than it took to heat up, so that's 23 minutes.

Add those together, and it takes 51 minutes in total. 



"
"He spent five bucks for each paper ad, and he got fifty papers, so that's five times fifty, which is two hundred and fifty bucks.  Then he spent seventy-five bucks for each TV ad, and he got fifteen of them, so that's seventy-five times fifteen, which is one thousand one hundred and twenty-five bucks.  If you add those two numbers together, you get one thousand three hundred and seventy-five bucks.

"
"Okay, so he got two houses, right?  And each house has three rooms.  Each room has two windows.  That's six windows per house.  Then there's four more windows in each house.  So, that's ten windows per house.  Two houses times ten windows... that's twenty windows!

"Okay, so the sweater has a body, a collar, a fancy flower thing, and two sleeves.  The body has 900 stitches, and the collar has one-tenth of that, so 90 stitches. The flower thing has twice as many stitches as the collar, so that's 90 times 2, which is 180 stitches.  

Now, the whole sweater has 1800 stitches, so we gotta figure out how many are left for the sleeves.  Let's add up the stitches we know: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

That means the sleeves have 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each one has 630 / 2 = 315 stitches. 




"
"She bought 20 packs of tomato seeds at 40 bucks a pack, so that's 20 times 40, which is 800 bucks.  Then she got 80 packs of celery seeds at 30 bucks a pack, so that's 80 times 30, which is 2400 bucks.  If you add those two together, that's 800 plus 2400, which is 3200 bucks.

"Okay, so this Sean fella, he gotta learn a bunch of words, huh? 

* That song he's singin' has 54 lines.
* The first scene, it's got twice as many lines as the song, but he only gets to say a third of 'em. So that's 54 times 2, which is 108, and then 108 divided by 3 is 36 lines for him.
* The second scene, it's got 6 more lines than the song, so that's 54 plus 6, which is 60 lines.  He says four out of every five lines in that scene, so that's 60 times 4/5, which is 48 lines.

* Now, to find out how many lines he gotta learn in total, we add it all up: 36 plus 48 plus 54, which is 138 lines.

Now, add those together: 90 minutes plus 150 minutes... that's 240 minutes.  

Hmm, how many hours is that?  Well, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is... 4 hours!

"Lemme see... 20 popsicles at a quarter each... that's like, 5 bucks, right?  And the ice cream bars are 50 cents each, so four of them is two bucks.  So, 5 plus 2... that's 7 bucks!

"Okay, so there's 70 spots on a cobra and twice as many spots on a cobra as a mamba.  That means a mamba has 70 spots / 2 = 35 spots.

There's 40 cobras, so that's 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

And there's 60 mambas, so that's 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

All together, that's 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Half of that is 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.

"Okay, so there's 12 players and 3 coaches, right?  That's 15 people in all.  And each player brings two friends, so that's 12 times 2, which is 24 more people.  That makes 15 plus 24, which is 39 people.  

If a pizza feeds 3 people, then they need 39 divided by 3, which is 13 pizzas.  

And if each pizza costs $15, then 13 times 15 is...  $195!

"Okay, so she uses eight of them sparkly rocks, right? And each rock is one inch long. That's eight inches total.

If you add up all the stories, it's 20 plus 40 plus 60 plus 40 plus 80 plus 120... that's a whole lotta stories!  Let me count 'em up... 360 stories!

Now, the flag has 76 stars total, so there's 76 - 36 = 40 stars left.

If each of them rows has 5 stars, then there's 40 / 5 = 8 rows of 5 stars.

"The fast car goes 60 miles every hour, and the slow car goes half as fast.  So the slow car goes 30 miles every hour.

Jim got 18 points 'cause 21 - 3 = 18.

Tony got 42 points 'cause 21 times 2 is 42.

Then they all got one more point 'cause they were all over 20.

So Mike got 22, Jim stayed at 18, and Tony got 43.

Addin' it all up, they got 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

Then the next day, he did more pushups, but less squats. And he did twice as many dumbbell presses.

"Let's see... they eat two times a day, right? So that's 5 people times 0.2 kilos each, that's a whole kilo each meal.  So they eat 2 kilos a day.  

If they eat 2 kilos a day, and there's 42 kilos in the bag, that means it'll last 42 divided by 2... that's 21 days.

"
"Okay, so he drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, right? That's 60 miles a day.  

He does that 5 days a week, so that's 60 times 5, which is 300 miles a week.

Then he does that for 50 weeks, so that's 300 times 50, which is 15,000 miles a year.

He pays 2 dollars for every mile, so that's 15,000 times 2, which is 30,000 dollars for the driving.

He also gives the driver 150 dollars every month, and there are 12 months in a year, so that's 150 times 12, which is 1,800 dollars.

So, 30,000 plus 1,800 is 31,800 dollars.

"He worked out for 23 minutes on Sunday and 16 minutes on Monday, so that's 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.  He wants to do twice that on Tuesday, so he needs to work out for 39 times 2, which is 78 minutes.

Then they got some left over, and they sell half of that in the afternoon and half in the evenin'.  So, how many they sell in the afternoon?  Hmm, let's see... two-thirds of 60 is 40, so that leaves 20.  Half of 20 is 10.

"Joey loses weight every week, right?  He loses 8 pounds every four weeks.  So that means he loses 2 pounds every week.  Sandy wants to lose the same amount, so if she loses 2 pounds every week, it'll take her 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"Okay, so the ice cream used to be $13 but now it's $11, that means you save $2 for each one, right?  

If you buy two tubs, that's $2 times 2, which is $4 saved on the ice cream.

The milk was cheaper by $0.50, and you're gettin' four packs, so that's $0.50 times 4, which is $2 saved on the milk.

So, if you add the ice cream savings and the milk savings, you save a total of $4 plus $2, which is $6.

"Three folks eat three eggs each, so that's nine eggs right there.  The other two eat two each, so that's another four eggs.  That makes thirteen eggs a day.

"Let me see...  Cera is 46 now, so six years ago she was 40.  Noah was half her age then, so he was 20.  

They said Chile's population six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so that means it was 3000 times 20, which is 60,000.

Now, Chile's population is double what it was then, so it's 60,000 times 2, which is 120,000. 


120,000 
"
"Okay, so there's 105 players in total, right?  And twice as many on offense as defense.  That means if there's 'x' on defense, there's '2x' on offense.  Then there's half as many on special teams as defense, so that's 'x/2'.  

Puttin' it all together, we got: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To get rid of that fraction, I'll multiply the whole thing by 2: 2x + 4x + x = 210

Now we got: 7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7, and we find out x = 30.  

So there's **30** players on defense.

"Solomon got 20 marbles from Johanna and put 'em in the store with the 50 he already had. That's 20 + 50 = 70 marbles.

Then his daddy gave him some more, two-fifths of the 20 he got from Johanna. That's like, 20 times 2/5, which is 8 marbles.

So now he has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2 kilos, so he has 78 times 2 kilos, which is 156 kilos of marbles!

The other half are the older guys, and they make 400 more than the young'uns, so they make 2400 a month.  That's 50 folks times 2400, which is 120,000 bucks.

So, if you add those two together, 100,000 plus 120,000, that's 220,000 bucks the company pays out every month.

Hmm... if two groups are the same, let's say they each have 60 kids. That's 120 kids right there.  

Then the last group would have 10 less, so it'd have 50 kids.  

But that's not right, 'cause 120 plus 50 is 170, not 200.  

Let's try 70 kids in each of the bigger groups. That's 140 kids.  

The last group would have 60 kids.  

And 140 plus 60 is 200!  

So the smallest group has 60 kids.

Hmm...  If he watched 6 hours of shows and that's 30%, how long was his whole vacation?

So the whole trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

And it does that 3 times a day, so that's 225 * 3 = 675 miles a day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so it goes 18,000 / 675 = 26.66 days between services.  

But you can't have parts of days, so it's gotta be 27 days.

So now we got 880 plus 176, which is 1056 dollars for the frames.

Two of the seniors get pins that cost 5 bucks each, so that's 2 times 5, which is 10 bucks.

And then 1 out of every 4 seniors gets a cord that costs 12 bucks.  So that's 11 seniors times 12 bucks, which is 132 bucks.

Meat costs seven bucks a pound, and cheese is three bucks a pound.  So, that's 20 pounds times seven bucks, plus 20 pounds times three bucks...  Let me see... that's 140 plus 60...  That's 200 bucks! 


"
"Let's see... he has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis. So that means he has 40 times 2, which is 80 corns.  

Then he buys more cannolis, so now he has 40 plus 60, which is 100 cannolis.  

He also has less corn now, so he has 100 cannolis minus 40, which is 60 corns.

So, he has 60 corns plus 100 cannolis, which is 160 altogether.

"Okay, so they hired 40 folks in May, and each one makes $15 an hour for 40 hours a week. That's $600 a week for each worker.  

In May, they worked a whole month, so that's $600 times 4 weeks, which is $2400 a month for each worker.  

Then, a quarter of the workers left in June, so that's 40 workers divided by 4, which is 10 workers. That leaves 30 workers in June.

So, in June, they paid $2400 a month for each of the 30 workers, which is $72,000.

In total, they paid $96,000 in May and $72,000 in June, so that's $168,000 altogether.

To find out how many smell like a wet dog AND go boom, you gotta do a little bit of math.  It's like, 1% of the candles go boom, and out of those, 5% smell like a wet dog.  

So, it's a tiny bit, like 25 candles. 



"
"Okay, so she gets four blouses, right?  And each one is twenty bucks, but they're on sale for thirty percent off.  That means each one is six dollars cheaper.  So, each blouse costs fourteen dollars.  If she buys four, that's fourteen times four... which is fifty-six dollars!

Her sister, she got twice as many from the tall ones and three times as many from the little ones.  They got 500 apples all together.  

Let me think... Joanne got 30 from the tall ones and 15 from the little ones, so that's 45 apples.  Her sister got 60 from the tall ones and 45 from the little ones, so that's 105 apples.  Together they got 150 apples from the tall and little trees.  

That means Joanne got 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the medium ones. 




"
"Okay, so we got camels and them dromedary things, right?  There's 180 heads in total, and 304 bumps. Camels got two bumps each, and them dromedaries only got one.

"Okay, so he pays eight bucks for six months, right? That's eight times six, which is forty-eight. Then it goes up to twelve bucks a month for eight months, so that's twelve times eight, which is ninety-six.  After that, it's fourteen bucks a month for, let's see, twelve months, so that's fourteen times twelve, which is one hundred sixty-eight.  

If you add all that up, forty-eight plus ninety-six plus one sixty-eight, that's three hundred and... uh...  three hundred and twelve!

The room's got an area of 360 square feet, and we know the length is 9 feet.  To find the width, we gotta divide the area by the length: 360 feet divided by 9 feet is 40 feet.

Now, to find the perimeter, we add up all the sides: 9 feet plus 40 feet plus 9 feet plus 40 feet. That's 98 feet!

"
"Elizabeth got 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. That's 3 packs in all. Margareth got 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red, so she got 7 packs.  

Each pack has 20 beads, so Elizabeth has 3 packs times 20 beads is 60 beads. Margareth has 7 packs times 20 beads is 140 beads.

Margareth has 140 beads and Elizabeth has 60 beads.  Margareth has 140 - 60 = 80 more beads.

"Okay, so the house starts at 40 degrees, right?  Then he bakes for a while and it gets hotter, like 5 degrees hotter every hour he bakes.  He bakes for 3 hours, so that's 15 degrees hotter.  

Then he opens a window, and the house gets a little colder.  It gets 2 degrees colder for every 10 minutes the window is open, and he opens it for half an hour, which is 30 minutes.  So it gets 6 degrees colder.

"Okay, so Jon took 40 minutes to swim, one hour and 20 minutes to bike, and 50 minutes to run. That's a total of 2 hours and 10 minutes.  James was faster in the swim, like 10% faster, so he did that part quicker.  But he took 5 minutes longer on the bike.  Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took longer overall.  

Let's see... James' swim was 40 minutes minus 4 minutes, so 36 minutes.  His bike was 80 minutes plus 5 minutes, so 85 minutes.  

If Jon took 2 hours and 10 minutes, and James took 10 minutes longer, then James took 2 hours and 20 minutes.  

To figure out how long James took to run, we gotta subtract his swim and bike times from that.  So, 2 hours and 20 minutes minus 36 minutes minus 85 minutes... that's 59 minutes.

And he's got ten boxes, so that's 32 times 10... that's 320 feet of dirt he needs.

Now, each bag has 2 feet of dirt, so he needs 320 divided by 2... that's 160 bags of dirt.

And each bag costs $12, so 160 times 12... that's $1920!

That means he spends $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000 every month on the plane.

"Okay, so the cat takes 30 minutes to gobble up nine sausages. The doggo eats the same amount, but faster, like in 20 minutes.  

If you add up their times, that's 30 plus 20, which is 50 minutes.

Then you gotta split that 50 minutes in half 'cause there's two of 'em. So, 50 divided by 2 is 25 minutes.

"Topher's shoe is, like, super big! It's 8 feet and 4 inches long.  That's a whole lotta inches!  Bobby's shoe is smaller, but Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the size of Bobby's shoe.  Hmm... let me think... if Topher's shoe is 100 inches long ( 'cause 8 feet is 96 inches and 4 inches more), and it's 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe, then Bobby's shoe must be 10 inches long.

To figure out how many didn't vote, we gotta think: how many folks were left after lunchtime? Then, how many of *them* voted?  

Let's see... two out of five is the same as 1000 folks. So, 5000 minus 1000 is 4000 folks left. Then, two out of three of those folks voted, which is another 2666...ish.  

So, 4000 minus 2666 is...  1334 folks didn't vote by the end of the day.

"Let's see... she got two books that weigh 2 pounds each, so that's 2 times 2 which is 4 pounds. Then she got one book that weighs 4 pounds and one that weighs 3 pounds.  That's 4 + 3 = 7 pounds.  And the history book weighs twice as much as the English book, so it weighs 3 times 2 which is 6 pounds.  If you add all that up, it's 4 + 7 + 6 = 17 pounds.

"
"Okay, so Candidate A got 20% of the votes.  Candidate B got more than A, like 50% more.  That means B got a whole lot more!  

If there were 100 people voting, and A got 20, that's 20 people.  And B got more than that, so they got more than 20.  

That leaves the rest for Candidate C, right?  So, C got the rest of the votes.  


Let me think... 100 people - 20 for A -  that leaves 80.  And B got more than 20, so C got less than 80.

"Okay, so there's 50 kids in the class. Ten like to bake, and five like basketball.  That means the rest like video games or music, right?

There's twice as many kids who like music as basketball, so there's 5 times 2 = 10 kids who like music.

If 10 like music and 5 like basketball, that's 10 + 5 = 15 kids.

So, 50 - 15 = 35 kids like video games.

Let's see...  

First park, that's $26 times two, that's $52 for the grownups.  Then $12 times two, that's $24 for the kids.  So that's $52 plus $24, that's $76 for the first park.

Second park, that's $14 times two, that's $28 for the grownups.  Then $10 times two, that's $20 for the kids.  So that's $28 plus $20, that's $48 for the second park.

If they go to the second park, they save $76 minus $48, which is $28.

"Okay, so she rents out 60 chairs each day on the weekdays, right?  That's 60 times 5 days, so 300 chairs a week.

Then on the weekends, she rents out 100 chairs each day, so that's 100 times 2 days, which is 200 chairs a week.

So, all together, she rents out 300 plus 200, which is 500 chairs every week.

Now, there are four weeks in a month, so that's 500 times 4, which is 2000 chairs a month.

Two months is 2000 times 2, so she rents out 4000 chairs in two months.

"Let's see... 11 kids need the tiny shirts, and twice as many need the small ones, so that's 11 times 2, which is 22 kids.  Then there's 4 less kids that need the medium shirts than the small ones, so that's 22 minus 4, which is 18 kids.  Half as many kids need the big shirts as the medium ones, so that's 18 divided by 2, which is 9 kids.  And then 6 more kids need the extra big shirts than the big ones, so that's 9 plus 6, which is 15 kids.  

If you add up all the kids, you get 11 plus 22 plus 18 plus 9 plus 15, which is 75 kids!

"He needs wheels for 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.  Cars need 4 wheels each, so that's 57 times 4, which is...  *counts on fingers*  228 wheels. Motorcycles need 2 wheels each, so that's 73 times 2, which is... *counts on fingers* 146 wheels.  

That means he needs 228 plus 146, which is... *counts on fingers* 374 wheels in total.

Then there's the rest of the movies, 400 of 'em.  Forty percent of them are old movies, so that's 160 movies times five bucks each, which is 800 bucks.

The rest of the movies, that's 240 of 'em, cost ten bucks each, so that's 2400 bucks.

"The ring cost six hundred for the diamond and three hundred for the gold, so that's nine hundred dollars.  Then he had to pay extra, like thirty percent more, so that's...  *counts on fingers*  ...three hundred dollars more!

"Okay, so there's 340 third graders that passed, and 40 fourth graders passed.  Then the fifth graders, they had twice as many pass as the fourth graders, so that's 40 times 2, which is 80.  

That means a total of 340 + 40 + 80 = 460 kids passed.  

And there's 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 kids in total.

So, 460 out of 1000 passed, which is... well, that's gotta be like 46% or somethin'.

"He needs 36 chips for the tall part, right?  He's got 144 chips in total.  That means he's got 108 left over.  If each inch needs 12 chips, he can make his mosaic 9 inches long. 


"
"Okay, so they drank some tea, right?  Four folks had 1.5 quarts each, so that's like, 6 quarts gone. Then sixteen more had 2 quarts each, so that's 32 quarts gone.  

That means they drank a total of 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

And they got 10 quarts left over, so they musta started with 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Now, a gallon is like, four quarts, so they had 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

* January: 10 times 2 is 20
* February: 20 times 2 is 40
* March: 40 times 2 is 80
* April: 80 times 2 is 160
* May: 160 times 2 is 320

So there's 320 students by the end of May.  If they started with 10, that means 320 - 10 = 310 more students joined. 


**310** 
"
"He made $105 all week, and each branch costs a quarter.  So, he climbed a whole lotta branches!  Let's see... $105 divided by $0.25 is...  *counts on fingers* ... 420 branches!

"Let's see... she got 3 flowers with 5 petals, so that's 15 petals. Then she got 4 flowers with 6 petals, that's 24 petals.  Then 5 flowers with 4 petals, so that's 20 more petals. And lastly, 6 flowers with 7 petals, so that's 42 petals.  

She picked up a whole bunch, so let's add it all up: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals!  

But then she dropped one of each kind, so that's 4 petals gone.  

So, she has 101 - 4 = 97 petals left.

They play for four whole hours, which is a lotta time!  Jack uses up a bunch of quarters, 'cause he's playin' a lot. His other two friends, they use even more 'cause they ain't as good. And the good friend, he uses a good amount too.

Let me see...  Jack uses 12 quarters, the other two use 48, and the good one uses 8.  That's a whole lotta quarters!

If a quarter is worth 25 cents, then...  *counts on fingers*  That's... $17.00! 





"
"Okay, so she uses the same amount of the fancy smell stuff and the lemon peel stuff, right? And the salt and sugar are the same too.  She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as the lemon peel stuff.  

Let's see... if she uses 2 ounces of the lemon peel stuff, that means she uses 4 ounces of salt 'cause it's twice as much. And then she uses 8 ounces of oil 'cause it's twice as much as the salt.  

So the answer is 8 ounces.

If you take away the dog food cans from the cat food cans, you get... 88 minus 36... that's 52 more cans of cat food!

"Okay, so Becca, Smendrick, and PJ got Magic Cards, right?  They got 341 cards all together. Becca got 12 more than Smendrick, and Smendrick got 3 times as many as PJ.

"Let's see... Cindy had 5 green eggs, and twice as many blue ones, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 blue eggs.  Then she had one less pink egg than blue, so 10 - 1 is 9 pink eggs.  And she had a third as many yellow eggs as pink, so that's 9 divided by 3, which is 3 yellow eggs.  

If you add all those up, 5 + 10 + 9 + 3, that's 27 eggs!

If you add all that up, it's 72 plus 90 plus 120, which is 282 minutes a week.

One chandelier is $15.

Ten pictures is 10 times $15, so that's $150.

So, $30 plus $15 plus $150 is $195 extra.

Then you add that to the $129 they already charge, so it's $195 plus $129, which is $324.

"Okay, so he's got three glue sticks, right?  One's got a little bit left, one's got most of it, and the other's half gone.  

If a glue stick is 12 millimeters long, that means the first one has 2 millimeters left 'cause 1/6 of 12 is 2.  The second one has 8 millimeters left 'cause 2/3 of 12 is 8.  And the last one has 6 millimeters left 'cause half of 12 is 6.

"Okay, so Jack got 60 dishes, right?  He got twice as many dishes as socks, so he got 60 dishes / 2 = 30 socks.  Peter got twice as many socks as Jack, so he got 30 socks * 2 = 60 socks. Peter got half as many dishes as Jack, so he got 60 dishes / 2 = 30 dishes.  

Together they got 30 socks + 60 socks = 90 socks.  And they got 60 dishes + 30 dishes = 90 dishes.

So, all together they got 90 socks + 90 dishes = 180 socks and dishes.

Then there's 20 flowery shirts with buttons, so that means 30 flowery shirts don't have buttons.

If we take the flowery shirts without buttons (30) and take away the white shirts without collars (20), we get 10 more flowery shirts without buttons.

"Okay, so he had 55 goats on one farm and 45 on the other.  He sold 10 from the first farm and twice as many from the second farm, so he sold 10 times 2 which is 20 goats from the second farm.  

That means he has 55 minus 10 goats left on the first farm, which is 45 goats.  And he has 45 minus 20 goats left on the second farm, which is 25 goats.

If you add those together, he has 45 plus 25 goats left, which is 70 goats.

Then you got three baskets of them red things, and they usually cost eighteen bucks each, but you get two bucks off each one, so that's six bucks off.  

So them red things cost eighteen times three, which is fifty-four, then you take away the six bucks, and that's forty-eight bucks.

Now you add the green stuff and the red stuff together, seventy-five plus forty-eight, and that's... one-hundred and twenty-three bucks!

"They make 125 on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then twice that on Friday, so that's like... 125 times two, which is 250.  So, 125 plus 125 plus 250 is...  500!

"The daisies got more petals 'cause they got 10 each and the orchids got 5 each.  Let's see, 4 daisies times 10 petals is 40 petals.  The orchids got 5 times 5 petals is 25 petals.  40 minus 25 is 15.  So the daisies got 15 more petals. 


15

"Okay, so there's 100 plants, right?  A quarter of 'em are inside, so that's 25 plants.  

That leaves 75 plants outside.  Two-thirds of those are outside plants, so that's like, a whole bunch.  

That means the rest are the flowery ones.  

Hmm,  25 flowery plants out of 100... that's gotta be 25%!

"Let me see... that whatchamacallit thing goes fast, huh?  Eleven times faster than that other thingy.  And the whirligig goes five times faster than that other thingy.  So, if the whatchamacallit goes 121 meters per second, the other thingy must go...  121 divided by 11 is 11.  And the whirligig goes five times that, so it goes 11 times 5... which is 55!

"Martin weighs 55 kg, and Carl weighs 16 kg more than him.  So Carl weighs 55 + 16 = 71 kg.  Christian weighs 8 kg more than Carl, so he weighs 71 + 8 = 79 kg.  Harry weighs 5 kg less than Christian, so he weighs 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"He rents his car out a lot, 10 times a month!  And each time it's for 3 hours.  He makes $25 for each hour, so that's a good chunk of change.  Let's see, 10 times 3 is 30 hours.  Then 30 times 25 is... $750!  He has to pay $500 for the car, so that means he makes $750 - $500 = $250 extra.

"He makes 20 cents for each package, and he does 10 less than 50 packages every hour. So he does 40 packages an hour.  That means he makes 40 times 20 cents, which is $8.00 an hour.

"
"Let's see... Larry's got 3 kitties, and three times as many doggies, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 doggies.  Then he's got 2 less bunnies than doggies, so 9 minus 2 is 7 bunnies.  He's got three times as many fishies as bunnies, so 7 times 3 is 21 fishies.  And he's got a bunch of gerbils, which is a third of the fishies, so 21 divided by 3 is 7 gerbils.  

Now, let's add 'em all up: 3 kitties + 9 doggies + 7 bunnies + 21 fishies + 7 gerbils... that's a whole lotta pets!

"She got 12 cups left after makin' the cinnamon tea.  Then she put 'em in 3 rows, so that's 12 / 3 = 4 cups in each row.  She puts the same amount of chamomile and mint in each row, so that's 4 / 2 = 2 cups of mint in each row.

Let's see... he can spend $10 on a Friday movie, and he wants popcorn and candy, so that's $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.  He has $150 and already spent some, so he has $150 - $20 = $130 left.  He can see 2 more movies on Friday. 



**Answer: 2**

"Okay, so he made a bunch of them little cinnamon rolls, 200 of 'em, and them blueberry muffins, 300 of them.  

A normal cinnamon roll has, like, a whole lotta calories, 600! But these are mini ones, so they got, like, 1/3 of that.  That's 600 / 3 = 200 calories each.

Them blueberry muffins, they got 450 calories normal size, but mini ones are 1/3 of that, so 450 / 3 = 150 calories each.

Now, let's see... 200 rolls times 200 calories each is... 40,000 calories for the rolls.

And 300 muffins times 150 calories each is... 45,000 calories for the muffins.

So, all together, that's 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories! 


"
"She got 39 on Monday, then twice that on Tuesday and Wednesday, so that's 39 times 2, which is 78 each day.  So that's 39 plus 78 plus 78, which is 195. Then she got 48 on Thursday and 57 on Friday.  So that's 195 plus 48 plus 57, which is 300 Junebugs all together.  If she did that over 5 days, that means she got an average of 60 Junebugs each day.

"Okay, so Peter, Paul, and Jean are a hundred years old all together. Paul is ten years older than Jean. And Peter is as old as Paul and Jean put together.  

Hmm... if Paul is ten years older than Jean, that means if Jean is 10, Paul is 20.  

And if Peter is as old as Paul and Jean together, that means if Jean is 10 and Paul is 20, Peter is 30.  

So Peter must be 30!

Let's see... 10 folks times 5 boxes is 50 boxes. Then they got 10 more boxes already, so that's 60 boxes in total.

They can fit two boxes on each table, so they need 60 boxes divided by 2 boxes per table... that's 30 tables!

But they already got 15 tables, so they need 30 tables minus 15 tables... which is 15 more tables!

"
"Zoey spit her seeds real far! She had a whole bunch, like forty, and each one went ten feet.  Sydney had a few less seeds, thirty-five, but she spit 'em farther, twelve feet each.  

If you add up how far Zoey spit and how far Sydney spit, then split that number in half, that's the average. 


Let me think...  Zoey spit 400 feet, and Sydney spit 420 feet. That's 820 feet total.  

Half of 820 is... 410 feet.

"Okay, so the Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets every hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45.  Each widget sells for $6.  

If they both run for 24 hours a day for a whole month (30 days), the Widgeteer 3000 would make more money.  A whole lot more! 


Let me see... 60 widgets times 24 hours is 1440 widgets a day.  Then times 30 days, that's 43,200 widgets!  Times $6 each, that's...  *counts on fingers*  a whole bunch of money!  

The other one, the WidgetMaster 9000, makes less widgets, so it makes less money.  


I dunno the exact numbers, but the Widgeteer 3000 makes way more!

"Okay, so this Cameron guy, he stays at the hotel for a long time, right?  He could pay a lot for the whole day, or he could pay less and just add some extra money for the time he goes over.  

He stays for 17 hours, but the hotel only charges for 12 hours.  That means he has to pay extra for 5 more hours.  

Each extra hour costs 70 pesos, so 5 hours times 70 pesos is 350 pesos.

So, he pays 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours plus 350 pesos for the extra time, which is 1350 pesos total.

If he paid for the whole 24 hours, it would be 1600 pesos.

He saves 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos! 



"
"Goats eat 5 pounds each, and there's 15 goats, so that's 5 times 15, which is 75 pounds.

Sheep eat less than goats, like 3 pounds less than twice what a goat eats. Twice 5 is 10, and then take away 3, so sheep eat 7 pounds each.

There's 12 sheep, so they eat 7 times 12, which is 84 pounds.

Add the goat food and the sheep food together, 75 plus 84, and that's 159 pounds of hay Nate needs. 



"
"John makes fifty bucks an hour and worked six hours, so he made fifty times six, which is three hundred dollars.  He spent fifty on gas and fifty on pencils, so that's a hundred dollars gone.

"Craig spelled out a whole bunch of words, like 20 of 'em, and each one had 15 letters.  His brother spelled some too, but he used more letters, like 50 more than Craig.  

To find the total, we gotta add up all the letters Craig used and all the letters his brother used.  Craig used 20 times 15, which is 300 letters. His brother used 300 plus 50, which is 350 letters.

So, if you add 300 and 350, you get 650 letters total.

"The teacher gets 100 bottles for each coupon, and she has 9 coupons, so that's 100 times 9, which is 900 bottles.  Then she gives each kid 2 bottles, so that's 2 times 29 kids, which is 58 bottles.  If she starts with 900 and gives away 58, she has 900 minus 58, which is 842 bottles left. 


**842**

"Okay, so she comes out to the house and it's forty bucks just to show up. Then she works for two and a quarter hours, and that's thirty-five bucks an hour, so that's like... eighty somethin'.

"Okay, so James buys 10 CDs for fifteen bucks each, that's 150 bucks total.  He gets 40% off, so he saves 60 bucks.  That means he pays 90 bucks for all the CDs.  Then he sells 5 of 'em for 40 bucks each, so he makes 200 bucks.  

If he made 200 and spent 90, he's up 110 bucks, right?  


"
"Let's see... she got six yams at one fifty each, so that's six times one fifty... that's nine dollars.  Then she got ten sweet potatoes at two bucks a piece, so that's twenty dollars.

"Okay, so this fella James, he's swimmin' across a lake, right?  It's 20 miles wide. He swims at 2 miles an hour.  He swims for a bit, like 60% of the way, then he stops on an island for a break.  He rests for half as long as he swam. Then he swims the rest of the way, but this time he's only goin' half as fast.  How long did it take him to get across?

Let me see...  He swims half the lake, that's 10 miles.  At 2 miles an hour, that takes him 5 hours.  He rests for half that time, so 2.5 hours.  Then he swims the other 10 miles, but now he's only goin' 1 mile an hour, so that takes 10 hours.  

Add it all up: 5 hours + 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 17.5 hours.

"Seven times the amount of bread Sam had is, like, 7 times 70, which is 490.  Then you gotta take away 40 'cause the bakery has 40 less. So, 490 minus 40 is 450.

"Okay, so he gets 10 cents for every dollar of the New York Times paper, and 8 cents for every dollar of the Wall Street Journal.  

He sells 6 New York Times papers at 5 bucks each, so that's 6 times 5, which is 30 bucks.  Then he gets 10% of that, so 3 times 3 is 9 bucks.

He sells 10 Wall Street Journal papers at 15 bucks each, so that's 10 times 15, which is 150 bucks.  He gets 8% of that, so 8 times 15 is 120 bucks.

Then he adds those two amounts together, 9 plus 120, which is 129 bucks.

"Jonathan got 24 cups, right?  And he has two-thirds as many spoons as cups. So, he has 24 times two-thirds... that's like 16 spoons.  Then he gives 6 away, so he has 10 spoons left.  He has 24 cups plus 10 spoons, so he has 34 things in total. 


"
"Okay, so there's 1000 beds in the hospital, and 1 out of every 5 is taken. That means 200 beds are full.  Then, 50 more people come in every day for two weeks, which is 14 days.  So, 50 times 14 is 700 more people.  

If you add those 700 to the 200 that were already there, that's 900 beds full.  

That means there are 100 beds left empty.

"She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are for work. That leaves 9 emails for family and her boyfriend.  Two-thirds of those 9 emails go to family, so that's 6 emails.  That means 3 emails are left for her boyfriend.

"Courtney said there was 48 people at the concert, but Kelly said Courtney was wrong and counted too many. Kelly said Courtney counted 20% too many.  

If Kelly is right, there was probably less than 48 people there.  Hmm... let's see... 20% of 48 is like... 10 people, maybe? So, if Courtney counted 10 too many, there was probably like 38 people there.

"That bird flew a long way!  Let's see... it flew south for a good while, then kinda went back a bit, then flew south again.  

*  First trip south: 30 miles an hour for 10 hours... that's 300 miles!
*  Then it flew north for 2 hours at 18 miles an hour, so that's 36 miles.
*  Last trip south: 22 miles an hour for 5 hours, so that's 110 miles.

So, it flew 300 miles south, then 36 miles north, then another 110 miles south.  That means it flew a total of 300 + 110 - 36 = 374 miles south.

* And the last four are the mix-and-match ones, those take 18 minutes each. That's 4 times 18, which is 72 minutes.

* Now, add all that up: 45 minutes plus 110 minutes plus 72 minutes... that's 227 minutes!

"He needs two pieces of wood for every foot of fence, right?  So, he needs two pieces for each of the long sides, and two pieces for each of the short sides.  

That's 2 times 15 for the long sides, and 2 times 10 for the short sides.  

So, it's 30 plus 20... which is 50 pieces of wood.  Then you gotta double that 'cause he needs two pieces for every foot!

So, he needs 100 pieces of wood.

"Okay, lemme see... Sunny sold gingerbread for six bucks a box and apple pie for fifteen.  On Saturday, he sold ten gingerbread and eleven apple pies. On Sunday, he sold five more gingerbread than Saturday, so that's fifteen gingerbread. And he sold fifteen apple pies on Sunday too.  

Let's see... Saturday he made 10 times six for the gingerbread, plus eleven times fifteen for the apple pies. That's sixty plus one sixty-five, which is two hundred twenty-five. Then on Sunday, he made fifteen times six for the gingerbread, plus fifteen times fifteen for the apple pies. That's ninety plus two hundred twenty-five, which is three hundred fifteen.

So, two hundred twenty-five plus three hundred fifteen is... five hundred forty!

Let's see... if Emil's 24, his daddy's gotta be 48 'cause he's twice Emil's age.  And his brother's gonna be 12 'cause Emil's twice his age.

"Okay, so the air conditioner thingy cools the room, right?  It cools it 2 degrees every hour on low, and 3 degrees every hour on high.  

It ran on low for 3 hours, so that's 2 times 3 is 6 degrees cooler.

Then it went on high for 4 hours, so that's 3 times 4 is 12 degrees cooler.

So far, it's cooled the room 6 plus 12 is 18 degrees.

But then it got turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up 2 degrees every hour, so that's 2 times 2 is 4 degrees warmer.

So, 18 degrees cooler minus 4 degrees warmer... that means the room is 14 degrees cooler than it started.

"Okay, so the comet comes back every 75 years, right?  Bill's dad saw it when he was 30.  Bill saw it again when he was three times older than his dad was then.  That means Bill was 3 times 30, which is 90 years old.  

If the comet comes back every 75 years, and Bill was 90 when he saw it the second time, he musta been 90 - 75 = 15 when he saw it the first time.

The plane that goes to Greece also goes to France and Germany, but not as much as Greece.  It splits the rest of its trips even between France and Germany.

The plane that goes to Poland makes 44 trips, and that's only half of what the other plane does.  

So, how many times does the plane that goes to Greece go to France?  Hmm... let's see... if it makes 44 times two, that's 88 trips total.  And it goes to Greece three out of four times, so that's like 66 trips to Greece.  

That leaves 88 - 66 = 22 trips left.  And it splits those even between France and Germany, so that's 22 / 2 = 11 trips to France.

If all the kids are 20 years old total, then Wilfred must be 20 - 17 = 3 years old.

* 100 folks at the wedding times 15 cookies each is 1500 cookies.
* Half of 1500 cookies is 750 cookies.

"Doctor Jones works for nine hours.  He spends time lookin' at his patients, twenty minutes for each one, and he's got ten appointments, thirty minutes each.  That's a lotta time!  

If he's got nine patients, that's 9 times 20 minutes, which is 180 minutes.  Then he's got 10 appointments times 30 minutes each, that's 300 minutes.  

So, 180 plus 300 is 480 minutes.  

Now, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 480 minutes is 8 hours.  

That means he's got one hour left for his records.

They use it three times a week, so that's forty times three, which is...  *counts on fingers*  ...one-hundred and twenty bucks a week.

"Okay, so there's 50 porcupines, and 3 out of every 5 are girls.  That means there's 30 girl porcupines.  

Each girl has 4 babies every month, so in a whole year, that's a lot of babies!  Let's see... 30 girls times 4 babies each times 12 months... that's a whole bunch!

"Okay, so the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.  To find out how much water it holds, you gotta multiply those numbers together, right?

That's 14 times 25 times 4, which is... lemme see... 1400.  

So the pool holds 1400 of whatever they measure water in.  Then they say you gotta multiply that by 5.9 to get the gallons.

1400 times 5.9 is...  *counts on fingers* ...8260 gallons!

And they charge 10 cents for each gallon, so 8260 times 10 cents is... *counts on fingers again* ...$826!

The other half of the kids are younger than 16, so that's another 1500 kids.  And half of those are boys, so that's 1500 / 2 = 750 boys.  That means 1500 - 750 = 750 girls are younger than 16.

To find the total number of girls, you add those two groups together: 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls.

The first day, Wanda put in a quarter of it, which is 4,500 gallons. Ms. B put in three-quarters of what Wanda did, so she put in 3,375 gallons.

The next day, Wanda put in two-thirds of what she put in the day before, so that's 3,000 gallons. Ms. B only put in a third of what she put in the first day, which is 1,125 gallons.

Let's see... Wanda put in 4,500 + 3,000 = 7,500 gallons total.

And Ms. B put in 3,375 + 1,125 = 4,500 gallons total.

Together they put in 7,500 + 4,500 = 12,000 gallons.

So, she gave away 900 sweets - 120 sweets = 780 sweets.

Then she split those 780 sweets between her 10 friends, so each friend got 780 sweets / 10 friends = 78 sweets.

Hmm... let me think... if she sold two of the little ones for every big one, that means she made more money from the little ones.  

She made $4 times the number of little ones she sold.  So, if she made $120 total, and the little ones cost $4 each, she musta sold a bunch of 'em!  

Let me see... $120 divided by $4 is 30.  So she sold 30 little ones.

"Okay, so he's got 24 feet of driveway and puts a soda bottle every 3 feet. That means he's got 24 divided by 3, which is 8 bottles.  He takes 5 seconds to get to each bottle, so he's gonna be walkin' around for 8 times 5 seconds... which is 40 seconds! 


**40**

"He got two boxes with forty apples in each box, so that's eighty apples all together.  If he puts eight apples in each pack, he can make ten packs. 


"
"Okay, so she buys two pounds of the fancy cheese at eleven bucks a pound, that's twenty-two dollars. Then she gets three pounds of the other cheese at six bucks a pound, so that's eighteen dollars.  

If she started with fifty dollars, and that cheese cost her forty dollars, she's got ten dollars left. 


"
"Well, lemme see... He got $50,000 in loans each year for four years, so that's a whole lotta money!  $50,000 times 4 is...  *counts on fingers*  200,000!  And he was makin' $25,000 a year before, so for four years that's another 100,000.  So he owes 200,000 plus 100,000, which is 300,000!  

Now, he's makin' three times what he was before, so that's 25,000 times 3, which is 75,000 a year.  To make back 300,000, it'll take him 300,000 divided by 75,000...  *thinks hard*  That's 4 years! 


**Answer: 4** 
"
"Okay, so the bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, right?  He needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider.  That means each piece of fabric is 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.

To find out how much fabric he needs, you gotta multiply the length times the width. So, 8 feet times 10 feet is 80 square feet for each piece.  

Since he needs two pieces, that's 80 times 2, which is 160 square feet. 



"
"Okay, so they delivered 425 letters on Monday.  Then on Tuesday, they did 17 more than a fifth of Monday's, so that's like, 85 times 17, which is...  *counts on fingers* ... a lot!  Then on Wednesday, they did twice that and added 5 more.  

Let me see... 425 plus that big number from Tuesday plus the Wednesday number... *counts on fingers again* ... that's gotta be 736! 


"
"Okay, so she's got 16 folks comin' over, right? 

Ten of 'em want the chicken salad, and that's six fifty a piece. So that's ten times six fifty, which is... lemme see... sixty-five bucks!

Then six folks want the pasta salad, and that's six bucks a head. So that's six times six, which is thirty-six bucks.

Add those two together, and you get...  *counts on fingers*  ...one hundred and three-six! 




"
"Okay, so the guy lost five bucks first. Then he won some money, more than twice what he lost, plus a buck.  That's like, eleven bucks. Then he lost even more than that, like, a little over fifteen bucks.  

If you add up all the money he lost, it's like twenty-one fifty.  

To find out how much he lost on average, you gotta divide that by three, right?  So, that's like seven bucks and change. 


**7.17** 
"
"Let's see... 26 countries, and each has 5 cities with 1000 people in 'em.  So that's 26 times 5, which is... 130.  Then you gotta multiply that by 1000, right?  So, 130 times 1000 is... 130,000 people! 


"
"Xavier was 4 feet tall, and that's like 48 inches, right? He got 3 inches taller, so now he's 51 inches. Cole was 50 inches and got 2 inches bigger, so he's 52 inches tall.  If you take away Xavier's height from Cole's height, that's 52 - 51 which is 1 inch. 


**1** 
"
"Okay, so there's this money, $1920, and three folks split it up.  The second guy gets $80 more than the first guy, and the third guy gets twice what the second guy got.  

To figure out how much the first guy got, let's think about it like this:

*  Let's say the first guy got 'x' dollars.
*  The second guy got 'x + $80'.
*  The third guy got 2 times the second guy's amount, so he got 2 * (x + $80) dollars.

Now, all three amounts added together gotta equal $1920, right? So:

x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920

Let's simplify that:

x + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920

That makes:

4x + $240 = $1920

Now, we gotta get 'x' by itself.  Subtract $240 from both sides:

4x = $1680

And then divide both sides by 4:

x = $420




So the first guy got $420. 
"
"Well, lemme see... They paint for three weeks, right? That's like, 21 days.  And they work three-eighths of a day each day.  So, that's a whole lotta days times a little bit of work each day.  

To figure out how many hours that is, we gotta figure out how many hours are in a day, which is eight.  

Then we gotta add up all the hours they work.  

*whispers*  I think it's about 15 and a half hours each. 


"
"Okay, so this Rory fella, he's pickin' up tennis balls, right?  He got more in the first set than the second, and half as many in the third as the second.  He picked up 19 balls total.  

Let me think... if he got more in the first set, and less in the third,  the second set musta been the middle one.  

Hmm...  I dunno, maybe he got 6 balls in the second set?  That means he got 10 in the first and 3 in the third.  That adds up to 19!

"Okay, so the car cost $20,000 back in 2007.  It loses 21% of its value every year.  

In 2008, it lost a chunk of money, like $4200.  That means it was worth $15,800.

Then in 2009, it lost another bit, about $3300.  So it was worth $12,482.

And in 2010, it lost some more, maybe around $2600.  That leaves it worth about $9859.

"Half the books are in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 books.

Ten percent of the books are in German, so that's 50 * 0.10 = 5 books.

"
"She drove 325 kilometers each day for four days, so she drove a total of 325 times 4, which is 1300 kilometers.  

To find out how many more kilometers she needs to drive, we take the total distance, 1955 kilometers, and subtract the distance she already drove, 1300 kilometers. 

That means she needs to drive 1955 minus 1300, which is 655 kilometers more. 


655 
"
"She drinks 8 cups a day, and there's 16 cups in a gallon, so she drinks half a gallon each day.

"
"Okay, so Romeo starts with 120 folks on the train. Then 20 more jump on. That's 120 plus 20, which is 140.

Then 50 get off, so it's 140 minus 50, which is 90.

But then twice as many get on as got off, so that's 50 times 2, which is 100 more people.  So now there's 90 plus 100, which is 190.

And then 80 more get off, so 190 minus 80 is 110. 


**110** 
"
"Okay, so she got a top for ten bucks, and the shorts were five bucks more than that, so they cost fifteen.  Them shoes were forty-eight bucks, but they were half off, so they cost twenty-four.  And she got socks for eight bucks, but had two dollars off, so they cost six.  If you add all that up, it's ten plus fifteen plus twenty-four plus six... that's fifty-five!

"
"Okay, so the insurance is more 'cause he had a wreck.  It's 60% more than normal, which is $120.  That means it's like adding 60% of $120 to the normal price.  

Let's see... 60% of $120 is...  *counts on fingers*  That's $72 more!  So now it's $120 plus $72, which is $192 a month.

A year is 12 months, right? So, $192 times 12 is... *counts on fingers again*  $2304! 



"
"He does the sheets for four little beds and one big bed, so that's five sets.  He can only do two little sets at a time and one big set, so that's five loads every week.

"
"They watch four movies on Saturday and half as many on Sunday, so that's two movies.  That's six movies all together for the weekend.  If they do that every week for four weeks, that's six times four, which is... twenty-four!

* The cast is two hundred bucks.
* The doctor visit is three hundred bucks an hour, but it was only half an hour, so that's one hundred fifty.
* The pills are four bucks each, and she got thirty, so that's twelve times four, which is... uh...  four eighty.
* Parking was six bucks an hour, and she had to park for two hours, so that's twelve bucks.

"
"Okay, so he sends out 700 little coupons, and twice as many big ones, so that's 700 times 2, which is 1400 big coupons.

The little coupons cost 5 cents each, so 700 times 5 cents is 3500 cents.  That's $35.00

The big coupons cost 15 cents each, so 1400 times 15 cents is 21000 cents. That's $210.00

He sold 300 bikes in all. Half of them were the Trekking ones, so that's 150 bikes.  Then 15% were BMX, so that's like 45 bikes.  The rest were MTBs, so 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTBs.

Now, let's see... he made $450 times 150 for the Trekkin' bikes, that's $67,500.  Then $250 times 45 for the BMXs, that's $11,250.  And $500 times 105 for the MTBs, that's $52,500.

Let's see... 80 times 2 is 160, and 40 times 2 is 80.  So that's 160 plus 80, which is 240 square feet total.

Now, one of them paint cans covers 20 square feet, so he needs 240 divided by 20, which is 12 cans.

Each can costs 12 bucks, so 12 cans times 12 dollars is... 144 dollars!

She also got some towels for thirty bucks, but they were ten percent off, so she saved three bucks.  Those towels cost twenty-seven bucks.  So, she spent sixteen plus twenty-seven, which is forty-three bucks.  Addin' that to the seventy she had left, her new balance is one hundred and thirteen bucks.

"Let's see...  

* Them red balls, they cost nine bucks each, and there's three of 'em, so that's nine times three... which is twenty-seven dollars.

* Them blue ones cost five bucks each, and there's eleven of 'em, so that's five times eleven... that's fifty-five dollars.

* And them green ones, they cost three bucks each, and there's twenty-five of 'em, so that's three times twenty-five... that's seventy-five dollars.

* Now, if you add all that up... twenty-seven plus fifty-five plus seventy-five... that's...  *counts on fingers* ...one hundred and fifty-seven dollars!

"Amalia cut the grass for four hours. Megan walked the dog, which took her two hours longer than Amalia. So, she walked the dog for six hours. Dior did the laundry, and that took her four hours longer than Amalia cuttin' the grass. That means she did laundry for eight hours.  

If you add up all their times, it took them four plus six plus eight, which is eighteen hours.

"He drives to his parents' place and back, right?  So that's two trips.  He drives 2 hours each way, and his car goes 70 miles an hour.  So that's 2 hours times 70 miles, which is 140 miles each way.  

Then you gotta double that 'cause he goes back and forth, so that's 140 times 2, which is 280 miles for the whole trip.

And he does that twice a month, so that's 280 times 2, which is... 560 miles!

"Okay, so they need to make 400 toys, but they need 20 more. That means they gotta make 420 toys in total.

Two workers make 6 toys each per hour, so that's 12 toys an hour from those two.  They work for 10 hours, so that's 12 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys.

Then there are two other workers making 4 toys each per hour, so that's 8 toys an hour from them.  Over 10 hours, that's 8 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys.

So far, they made 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.

To make 420 toys, they need to make 420 toys - 200 toys = 220 more toys.

If they work for 10 hours, the last worker has to make 220 toys / 10 hours = 22 toys per hour.

"Kory's dog is 60 pounds.  Elijah's first dog is a quarter of that, so it weighs 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half of Kory's dog, so it weighs 30 pounds.

"Let's see... Seth gave half his stickers to Luis, then Luis used half of his, and gave the rest to Kris. Kris kept some and gave the rest to Rob.  

Hmm...  If Rob got 7, Kris musta had 7 plus 9, so 16 stickers.  That means Luis had twice as many as Kris, so 16 times 2 is 32.  And since Luis got half of Seth's, Seth musta had 32 times 2, which is 64!

"He got 3 big bags, each holdin' 10 ounces.  So that's 3 times 10, which is 30 ounces of M&Ms.  Now, each ounce has 30 M&Ms, so he's got 30 times 30, which is 900 M&Ms.  If he puts 10 in each little bag, he can make 900 divided by 10, which is 90 bags.

"Okay, so the fastest car is way faster than the second fastest car, like, a whole lot faster.  The second fastest car is five times faster than a normal car, and a normal car goes 120 miles per hour.  So the second fastest car goes 120 times 5, which is 600 miles per hour.  And the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than that, so it goes 600 times 1.25, which is 750 miles per hour!

"Arnold and Madeline painted the same amount, and Camden and Sarah painted 30 together. Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  

Let's see... if Sarah painted 9, Camden painted 21. Arnold and Madeline painted the rest, so they painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs together. That means they each painted 13.

Camden painted 21 and Arnold painted 13, so Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more.

"Okay, so Nik has a lotta crayons, 200 of 'em. He wants to put 'em in boxes, and each box holds 8 crayons.  

Each crayon weighs an ounce, and each box weighs 8 ounces too.  

He's gonna put all his crayons in boxes, and there are 16 ounces in a pound.  

How much do all the crayons and boxes weigh together, in pounds?  

Hmm... let's see... 200 crayons, 8 in a box... that's 25 boxes.  

Each box is 8 ounces, so 25 boxes is 200 ounces.  

And the crayons weigh 200 ounces too!  

So that's 400 ounces total.  

Now, there are 16 ounces in a pound, so 400 ounces is... 25 pounds!

"Okay, so Donny needs his water to be at least 40 degrees, right?  He mixes some of his 33-degree water with some hotter water.  

If he uses 4 ounces of the 33-degree water and 1 ounce of the hotter water, it's enough to drink. That means the hotter water has to be pretty darn hot!  I'd say it's gotta be at least 68 degrees or more. 


"
"Okay, so there's 50 cows and 20 chickens to start.  Then they get 20 more cows every day for three weeks, and 10 more chickens every day for three weeks.  

Let's see... that's a lot of cows!  Three weeks is like, 21 days, right? So that's 20 cows a day times 21 days, that's 420 more cows!  

And for the chickens, that's 10 chickens a day times 21 days, that's 210 more chickens!

So, we got 50 cows plus 420 cows, that's 470 cows. And 20 chickens plus 210 chickens, that's 230 chickens.

If you add those together, that's 470 cows and 230 chickens, that's... 700 animals!

"
"Let's see... there's 17 green ones, and twice as many red ones, so that's 17 times 2, which is 34 red ones.

If there's 60 jellybeans in all, then there must be 60 minus 51, which is 9 blue ones.

"Okay, so Faraday sells them sunflowers for two bucks each and a whole bunch for eight bucks.  He makes twenty-six bucks from the single ones and fifty-six bucks from the big bunches each day.  Now, each big bunch has twelve sunflowers in it.  

Let's see... if he makes fifty-six bucks from the bunches, that means he sold fifty-six / eight = seven bunches.

That means he sold seven bunches times twelve sunflowers each = eighty-four sunflowers from the bunches.

And he sold twenty-six bucks worth of single sunflowers, so that's twenty-six / two = thirteen sunflowers.

So, in total, he sold eighty-four plus thirteen = ninety-seven sunflowers each day.

Over three days, that's ninety-seven times three = two ninety-one sunflowers!

"Jim got 27 seashells, and that's 5 more than Carlos. Carlos got twice as many as Carrey.  Let's see... if Jim got 27, Carlos got 27 - 5 = 22.  Carrey got 22 / 2 = 11.  

So together they got 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.  

If they split them up even, each fella gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

Then he sold another chunk, a quarter of what was left, for 30 bucks a piece. That's 10 squares times 30, so 300 bucks.  Then he sold the rest for 3 bucks a square, so that's 30 squares times 3, which is 90 bucks.  If you add it all up, 2000 plus 300 plus 90, that's 2390 bucks!

"Let's see...

* Year 5: 50 avocados
* Year 6:  That's three times the first year, so 50 times 3 is 150 avocados.
* Year 7: Seven times the first year, so 50 times 7 is 350 avocados.
* Year 8:  A 10-year-old tree has lots of avocados, like 20 times the first year, so that's 50 times 20 is 1000 avocados.  But this tree is 2 years younger, so it has 1000 minus 200, which is 800 avocados.
* Year 9:  No avocados this year.
* Year 10:  A 10-year-old tree has 20 times the first year, so 50 times 20 is 1000 avocados.

"Team A scored 4 goals in the first half, and team B scored 2 less than that, so they scored 2 goals.  

In the second half, team B scored 4 times more than the first half, so they scored 2 times 4, which is 8 goals. Team A scored 1/4 of what team B scored, so they scored 8 divided by 4, which is 2 goals.

Team A scored a total of 4 plus 2, which is 6 goals. Team B scored 2 plus 8, which is 10 goals.

If you add those together, they scored 6 plus 10, which is 16 goals in total.

"He got 850 kilos of coal, and each bag is 50 kilos.  So he got 850 / 50 = 17 bags.

"Okay, lemme see... they used some bandages, then got more.  Then they used some more, and got even more.  In the end, they had 78 left.  

Hmm...  Let's see, they used 38 the first day, then 10 less the second day... that's 28.  Then they used half a pack the third day, which is 25.  So that's 38 plus 28 plus 25... that's 91 bandages used in all.

They had 78 left, so they musta started with 91 plus 78... that's 169 bandages!

But wait, they got more bandages on the third day, two packs worth! That's 100 more bandages.  So before they got those, they had 169 minus 100... that's 69 bandages.

And before the first day, they had 69 plus the 38 they used... plus the 50 they got... that's 157 bandages!

*  She makes $1.50 times 7.5 hours, that's $11.25 a day.
*  Then she makes that $11.25 times 6 days, so that's $67.50 a week.
*  And there's four weeks in April, so that's $67.50 times 4, which is $270.
*  Oh, and don't forget that extra ten bucks!

So, she makes $280 in April.

"Let's see... he gets three bucks for the wash, one fifty for cleanin' his room, seventy-five cents for the trash, and fifty cents for the dishes.  

He did the dishes six times, washed his clothes once, took out the trash twice, and cleaned his room once.

* Dishes: 6 times * fifty cents = three bucks
* Wash: one time * three bucks = three bucks
* Trash: two times * seventy-five cents = one fifty
* Cleanin': one time * one fifty = one fifty

Three plus three plus one fifty plus one fifty... that's nine bucks!

"Whale got 40 gallons o' blood, right?  A shark got three times more'n that, so that's 40 times 3, which is 120 gallons.  Ten sharks, that's 120 times 10, so... 1200 gallons! 


"
"Let's see...  

First, there was 50 folks in the mornin'. Then 40 more came in. That's 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Then twice as many as the 40 came in for lunch, so that's 40 times 2 = 80 more folks.

And then three times the first group came in, so that's 50 times 3 = 150 more.

So, we gotta add it all up: 90 + 80 + 150 = 320 people. 



**320** 
"
"She got 5 packs of red pens, and then got twice as many black pens.  So she got 5 times 2 = 10 packs of black pens.  That's 10 times 5 pens is 50 black pens.  Then she got 5 times 5 is 25 red pens.  So she got 50 plus 25 is 75 pens in all.

"Okay, so he buys ten bottles of scotch for six hundred bucks. That means each bottle costs sixty bucks.  

Then he buys twice as many of them fancy cognac bottles, which cost fifty percent more.  So, a cognac bottle costs sixty times one and a half, which is ninety bucks!

He buys twenty of them fancy bottles, so that's twenty times ninety, which is eighteen hundred bucks.

Add that to the six hundred for the scotch, and he spent two thousand four hundred bucks in total.

"Okay, so Mr. Julius planted twenty oak trees, right?  Then he planted twice as many pine trees, so that's forty pines.  

The next day, he planted ten more oaks, makin' it thirty oaks total.  And he planted a little more pines, like a quarter more, so that's... let's see... ten more pines, plus the forty he already had, that's fifty pines.

"That Mattison fella is short, only 60 inches tall! His house is way taller, seven times taller even!  So that's 60 times 7, which is... lemme see... 420 inches!  The first floor is three times his height, so that's 60 times 3, which is 180 inches.  

Now, to find how high the roof is from the second floor, we gotta take the whole house height and subtract the first floor height.  So, 420 inches minus 180 inches... that's 240 inches!  

But that's the height of the whole second floor, not just the roof.  So we gotta take that 240 inches and subtract the first floor height again.  240 inches minus 180 inches... that's 60 inches!


**60** 
"
"Okay, so there's 700 shells, right?  And the Alphas found, like, a whole bunch, 40% of 'em. That's a lotta shells!  Then the Finders got 60% of what was left.  

To find out how many the Gogetters got, we gotta figure out how many were left after the Alphas and Finders.  

Let's see... 700 shells minus 280 (that's what the Alphas found) is 420 shells left.

Then the Finders took 60% of those 420 shells, which is...  *counts on fingers*  252 shells!

So, the Gogetters got 420 minus 252, which is... 168 shells!

He used the slow one for three days, so that's three cups a day times three days, that's nine cups.

Then he used the medium one for three days, so that's six cups a day times three days, that's eighteen cups.

Then he used the fast one for five days, so that's twenty cups a day times five days, that's a hundred cups.

If you add it all up, nine plus eighteen plus a hundred, that's a hundred and twenty-seven cups!

If she needs 8 doses, she'll use 56 times 8, which is 448 milliliters total.

"Pauline goes to the museum a bunch, three times every year.  It costs two bucks each time.  So in five years, she goes 3 times a year times 5 years, which is 15 times. That's 15 times two bucks, so 30 bucks.

"He needs two spoonfuls of that fancy stuff for every pound of meat, right?  He's makin' 80 meatballs, and each pound makes 16 meatballs. So he needs 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat.

Then he does two lessons for, like, less money 'cause they're veterans.  He takes twenty-five percent off, so that's like, twenty bucks less each.  So those lessons are sixty bucks each, and he does two of them, so that's sixty times two, which is one-twenty.  Then you add the three-twenty and the one-twenty together, and that's... four-forty! 



"
"Let's add all them numbers up: 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

"She wrote 9 books last year, and that's like 3 out of 4 of the books she wrote this year.  So, to find out how many she wrote this year, we gotta figure out what number 9 is 3/4 of.  

Think of it like this: if she wrote 4 books, that'd be the whole thing.  Since 9 is 3 out of 4, we gotta make 9 bigger to be the whole 4.  

If 9 is 3 parts, and we want 4 parts, we gotta add some more.  

Let's see... 9 plus 3 more is 12!

"Let's see... Madeline ate some grapes, then her brother used a whole bunch more to make juice.  Then Mama used even more to make pies.  

If each pie needs 12 grapes and she made 4 pies, that's 12 times 4, which is 48 grapes.  

So there were 48 grapes for the pies plus the grapes Madeline ate and the ones her brother used.  

Hmm... Madeline ate 6 and her brother used 5 times that many, so that's 6 times 5, which is 30 grapes.

That means there were 48 + 6 + 30 grapes in the beginning.  

So the answer is 84 grapes!

That means each bookcase holds 20 + 10 + 10 + 35 = 75 books.

She has 110 books, so she needs 110 / 75 =  a little more than one bookcase.  

So she needs two bookcases.

Then there are 40 questions on the second test.  She needs to get 70% of the whole thing right, so that's 110 times 0.70, which is 77 questions.

"He got two bags of chips, and each bag has 55 chips in it.  So that's two times 55, which is 110 chips.  Then he's sharin' with five people.  So, 110 chips divided by 5 people... that's 22 chips for each person.

"
"Let's see...  He takes 5 minutes for the first side. Then it takes twice as long for the next two, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 minutes each.  So far that's 5 plus 10 plus 10, which is 25 minutes.  Then the last two sides are half the time of the first, so that's 5 divided by 2, which is 2 and a half minutes each.  So that's 2 and a half plus 2 and a half, which is 5 minutes.  

Add that to the 25 minutes, and it takes 30 minutes to do the whole thing.

Let's see... 6 hours is a long time, like 6 times 60 minutes, right? That's 360 minutes.  

Then he does 360 minutes divided by 15 minutes per call, which is... 24 calls a day!

He does 120 calls a week! 



"
"Okay, so she paints six pictures, right?  The new stuff takes 12 minutes to dry on each one, so that's 12 times 6, which is 72 minutes.  The old stuff only took 7 minutes each, so that's 7 times 6, which is 42 minutes.  

If the new stuff takes 72 minutes and the old stuff takes 42, that means the new stuff takes 72 - 42 = 30 minutes longer.

"The main phone is twice as much as the other phones, so the other phones cost half as much.  If the main phone is $20, the other phones cost $20 / 2 = $10 each.

Then you add the main phone, so it's $40 + $20 = $60 for the whole thing.

"Let's see...  

* First day, 50 folks at the beach.
* Next day, 20 more showed up, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 people.
* Then, twice as many as the second day, so 70 times 2 is 140 people.
* The rest of the week, he saw 60 people each day, and there are 4 more days, so that's 60 times 4 = 240 people.

"Let's see... twenty pop first, then three times that many, so that's sixty more. Then four times the first bunch, so that's eighty. Then half of that last bunch, so forty more.

A week's got seven days, so that's 21 times 7, which is...  *counts on fingers* ...147 kilos! 



"
"Well, there's 10 of them two-legged critters and 15 of them four-legged ones.  

Two-legged critters got 2 legs each, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 legs.

Four-legged ones got 4 legs each, so that's 15 times 4, which is 60 legs.

Add those together, you got 20 plus 60, which is 80 legs.

Now, each pair of legs has two legs, so you gotta divide 80 by 2, which is 40 pairs.
