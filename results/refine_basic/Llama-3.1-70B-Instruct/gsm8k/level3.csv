"To calculate Janet's daily earnings at the farmers' market, we need to determine the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

First, let's find the number of eggs she has available for sale. We'll subtract the eggs she eats for breakfast and the eggs she uses for baking muffins from the total number of eggs laid.

Total eggs laid: 16
Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3
Eggs used for baking muffins: 4
Total eggs used: 3 + 4 = 7
Eggs available for sale: 16 - 7 = 9

Now, let's calculate Janet's daily earnings by multiplying the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg.

Price per egg: $2
Daily earnings: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 * (1/2) = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts. 

2 + 1 = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To calculate the profit made by Josh, we need to determine the selling price of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% + 150%). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. To find the new value, we calculate 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, this $200,000 is the value of the house before repairs. The $50,000 in repairs is in addition to this value. Therefore, the selling price of the house is $200,000 + $50,000 = $250,000, but this is incorrect as the $50,000 is already included in the 150% increase. The correct selling price is $200,000.

The total cost is the cost of the house plus the cost of repairs: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"The art of multiplication is a beautiful thing. Let's break down James' weekly sprinting routine to calculate the total meters he runs.

First, we need to determine the total number of sprints James completes in a week. Since he runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week, we multiply the number of sprints by the frequency: 3 sprints * 3 times a week = 9 sprints per week.

Now, we know James runs 60 meters per sprint. To find the total meters, we multiply the number of sprints per week by the distance per sprint: 9 sprints * 60 meters per sprint = 540 meters.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of feed Wendi's chickens require in a day and then subtract the amount already given to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we calculate the total daily feed needed for 20 chickens, with each chicken requiring 3 cups of feed per day. This is found by multiplying the number of chickens by the amount of feed per chicken: 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups.

Next, we add the amounts of feed given in the morning and afternoon to find the total amount of feed already provided: 15 cups (morning) + 25 cups (afternoon) = 40 cups.

Now, we subtract the total amount of feed already given from the total daily feed needed to find the amount required for the final meal: 60 cups (total daily feed) - 40 cups (feed already given) = 20 cups.

"To calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, we need to consider the discount applied to every second glass. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of the original price, which is $5 * 0.6 = $3.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can pair them up: 8 pairs of glasses, with each pair consisting of a full-priced glass and a discounted glass. The cost of each pair is $5 (full price) + $3 (discounted price) = $8.

Now, we multiply the cost of one pair by the total number of pairs: 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"The art of multiplication and addition. Let's break down the problem with precision. 

We know Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so we multiply 20 by 4 to find Charleston's total: 20 * 4 = 80 sheep.

Now, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. To find Toulouse's total, we multiply Charleston's total by 2: 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.

To find the combined total, we add the number of sheep in each city: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

"Calculating download times with interruptions and restarts can be a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart. Since the file is 200 GB and she downloads 40% of it before the restart, we can calculate the amount downloaded as 40% of 200 GB, which is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB.

Given Carla's download speed of 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, which takes 20 minutes, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. This means she needs to download the entire 200 GB file. At her download speed of 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the initial download time, the restart time, and the time it takes to download the entire file: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes.

"To determine the distance John is from home, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

Initially, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he travels in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

After turning around, John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

Next, he drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he travels in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5) at a speed of 80 mph. The distance he travels in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance John travels after turning around is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Since John is trying to get back home, we subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the distance he traveled before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we'll break down her pay into regular and overtime components. 

First, let's calculate her regular pay for the first 40 hours. Her regular hourly rate is $10, so her regular pay is 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

Next, we'll calculate her overtime pay. She worked 5 hours beyond the 40-hour mark, and her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour. So, her overtime pay is 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

Now, let's add her regular pay and overtime pay to find her total earnings for the week: $400 + $60 = $460.

"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we'll break down the calculation step by step.

First, we know the program had 60 downloads in the first month.

Next, the number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. This can be calculated as 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

Now, for the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this reduction, we'll find 30% of 180, which is 0.3 * 180 = 54. Subtracting this from the second month's total, we get 180 - 54 = 126 downloads in the third month.

Finally, we can find the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To calculate the total cost of the pastries, we'll start by multiplying the number of dozens by the cost per dozen for each type of pastry.

For the donuts, we have 3 dozen at $68 per dozen, so the total cost is 3 × $68 = $204.

Next, we have 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen, giving us a total cost of 2 × $80 = $160.

Lastly, the 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen will be 6 × $55 = $330.

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to perform a break-even analysis. The break-even point is the point at which the total revenue equals the total cost.

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total cost is the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) plus the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree ($3 per year), which can be represented as 90 + 3x.

The total revenue is the annual revenue from selling lemons (7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year), which can be represented as 10.5x.

To find the break-even point, we set the total revenue equal to the total cost and solve for 'x':

10.5x = 90 + 3x

Subtract 3x from both sides:

7.5x = 90

Divide both sides by 7.5:

x = 12

However, this is the break-even point, and we want to know when Carlos will start earning money. Since the total revenue will be more than the total cost after the break-even point, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. We know Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after visiting the orange house. Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, she must have had 10 vacuum cleaners before visiting the orange house (because 10 / 2 = 5).

Before visiting the orange house, Melanie had already visited the red house, where she sold 2 vacuum cleaners. So, before visiting the red house, she must have had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.

Before visiting the red house, Melanie had already visited the green house, where she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners. Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners she started with as 'x'. Since she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners. This means she had x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after visiting the green house.

We know that after visiting the green house, Melanie had 12 vacuum cleaners before visiting the red house. So, we can set up the equation:
2x/3 = 12

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3/2:
x = 18

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first calculate the percentage of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16.

25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance combined. 
Contemporary dance students percentage = 4/20 * 100 = 20%
Jazz dance students percentage = 4/20 * 100 = 20%

The total percentage of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance = 20% + 20% = 40%

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we subtract the total percentage of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from 100%.
Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 100% - 40% = 60%

"To determine the most profitable option, we need to calculate the increase in value for each purchase plan.

For the jewelry worth $5,000, a 2.5% increase would result in an additional value of $5,000 * 0.025 = $125.

For the electronic gadgets worth $8,000, a 1.2% increase would result in an additional value of $8,000 * 0.012 = $96.

Comparing the two options, it's clear that the jewelry offers a higher increase in value. Therefore, the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

"When analyzing the movement of the two trains, it's essential to consider the directions and distances covered. Since both trains travel westward for 80 miles on the first day, this distance is a straightforward addition to their overall total. The next day, they change direction and travel northward, covering 150 miles. This change in direction doesn't affect the total distance, as distance is a scalar quantity that doesn't consider direction.

To calculate the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances covered on both days:

Total distance = Distance covered westward + Distance covered northward
Total distance = 80 miles + 150 miles
Total distance = 230 miles

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we'll start by determining her weekly earnings from teaching and coaching, then multiply those by the number of weeks she works in a year.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. To find her weekly earnings from teaching, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Next, we multiply her weekly earnings from teaching by the number of weeks she works in a year:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. To find her weekly earnings from coaching, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Then, we multiply her weekly earnings from coaching by the number of weeks she works in a year:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, we add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we must first establish the total number of eggs consumed. Claire eats 3 eggs per day, and there are 7 days in a week. Thus, in one week, she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs.

Since we're calculating for 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly egg consumption by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Now, to convert the total number of eggs into dozens, we divide by 12, as 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs. 
84 / 12 = 7.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed at which Marissa must walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours, we can find the time left for her to complete the remaining distance.

Time left = Total time - Time already taken
Time left = 3 hours - 2 hours
Time left = 1 hour

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water and we have 10 liters initially, the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters. However, 1 liter of the orange drink was spilled, so we need to subtract 1/3 liter of water (since 1 liter is 1/10 of 10 liters, and 1/10 * 2/3 = 1/15, but for simplicity, we can calculate the amount of water spilled as 1/3 liter, which is 1 * 2/3). Now, we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left, which is 20/3 - 1/3 = 19/3 liters of water.

To simplify, we can convert 19/3 to a mixed number or a decimal, but for the sake of calculation, we will keep it as a fraction. 

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink. The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, and we have 15 liters of it. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 19/3 + 9. To add these two quantities, we need a common denominator, which is 3. So, we can rewrite 9 as 27/3. Now, we can add: 19/3 + 27/3 = 46/3.

To convert 46/3 to a decimal or mixed number, we can divide 46 by 3, which gives us 15.33. However, since the question asks for the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we can express the answer as a decimal or a mixed number.

The answer is: 15.33"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then find out how many years ago his son was born.

First, we know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is currently 31 years old. We can calculate Raymond's age by adding 6 to Samantha's age:
Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

Now that we know Raymond's age, we can find out how many years ago his son was born. Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, we subtract 23 from his current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at which son was born
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

"To calculate the total number of DVDs sold, we'll break it down step by step. 

First, we have 3 customers who bought 1 DVD each. Using the multiplication principle, we can find the total DVDs sold to these customers: 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.

Next, we have 2 customers who bought 2 DVDs each. Again, using the multiplication principle, we find the total DVDs sold to these customers: 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Lastly, the remaining 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything for them.

Now, let's add the DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

"Calculating the original price of an item after a discount is a straightforward process. To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the discounted price Kyle paid is 75% of the original price, since he received a 25% discount.

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. We know that 75% of 'x' is equal to $19.50. We can express this as:

0.75x = 19.50

To isolate 'x', we'll divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book is $26."
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of boxes of pizza as 'x'. We know that the total cost of the items is $50.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15, and the cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6. The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since the total cost is $50, the remaining amount spent on pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17. We also know that each box of pizza costs $8.50. We can set up the equation:

8.50x = 17

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 8.50:

x = 17 / 8.50
x = 2

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To calculate the total amount Mishka spent, we'll start by multiplying the cost of each item by the number of items purchased.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 × $16.50. Using my expertise in multiplication, I can tell you that 3 × $16.50 equals $49.50.

Next, we have 3 pairs of pants at $22.50 each. Multiplying 3 by $22.50 gives us $67.50.

Lastly, Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each. 3 × $42 equals $126.

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total. As an expert in addition, I can assure you that $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 equals $243.

"To calculate the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to determine the number of cartons she'll purchase and multiply that by the cost per carton.

First, let's find out how many cartons she'll need. Since she eats one serving per night and there are 15 servings per carton, we can divide the total number of servings (60) by the number of servings per carton (15). This gives us 60 ÷ 15 = 4 cartons.

Now, we multiply the number of cartons (4) by the cost per carton ($4.00). This results in 4 × $4.00 = $16.00.

"The art of subtraction. Let's break it down with precision. We have a total distance of 60 miles, and we want to find the distance between Henry's first and second stops.

First, we need to determine the distance that doesn't fall between the two stops. The distance traveled before the first stop is 20 miles, and the distance remaining after the second stop is 15 miles. To find the total distance that doesn't fall between the two stops, we subtract these values from the total distance.

However, a more elegant approach is to simply add the distance traveled before the first stop and the distance remaining after the second stop, then subtract this sum from the total distance.

Distance traveled before the first stop: 20 miles
Distance remaining after the second stop: 15 miles
Total distance: 60 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = Total distance - (Distance traveled before the first stop + Distance remaining after the second stop)
= 60 - (20 + 15)
= 60 - 35
= 25 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the cost of the boots and the cost of the two pairs of high heels. Let's denote the cost of the boots as B.

We know that one pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, so the other pair costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 more than the two pairs of heels together, we can set up the equation:

B = $99 + $5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

B = $104

Therefore, the boots cost $104.

"When dealing with ratios and systems of equations, it's essential to establish a clear representation of the given information. In this case, we're given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. We can represent their ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a scaling factor.

Given that their total age now is 162, we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms to simplify the equation:

18x = 162

Now, divide both sides by 18 to solve for x:

x = 9

With the value of x determined, we can find Allen's current age by substituting x into the expression for Allen's age:

Allen's current age = 11x
= 11(9)
= 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we simply add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10
= 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate each friend's guess and then find the average.

The first friend's guess is 80.

The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first one. To find half of 80, we can divide by 2 or multiply by 1/2. Multiplying 80 by 1/2 gives us 40. Adding 20 to that gives us 60.

The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first one. To find 25% of 80, we can multiply 80 by 0.25, which gives us 20. Adding 20 to 80 gives us 100.

Now, we add up the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the sum by the number of guesses. Since there are three guesses, we divide 240 by 3.

10 (dogs) × 0.5 (hours/dog) = 10 × 0.5 = 5 hours/day

Now, to find the total hours spent per week, we multiply the daily hours by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

5 (hours/day) × 7 (days/week) = 5 × 7 = 35 hours/week

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x' and the number of gold coins as 'y'. We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can write the equation:

x + y = 110

We are also given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, which can be expressed as:

y = x + 30

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for 'x':

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting 'x' into the second equation:
y = 40 + 30
= 70

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step. Let's denote the number of jewels Siobhan has as S, the number of jewels Aaron has as A, and the number of jewels Raymond has as R.

We know that Raymond has 40 jewels, so R = 40.

We're also given that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. We can express this as an equation: A = (1/2)R + 5. Since R = 40, we can substitute this value into the equation to find A:
A = (1/2)(40) + 5
A = 20 + 5
A = 25

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. We can express this as an equation: S = A - 2. Since A = 25, we can substitute this value into the equation to find S:
S = 25 - 2
S = 23

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To calculate the total points Mike scored, we need to determine the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To calculate this, we find 25% of 4 points by multiplying 4 by 0.25, which equals 1 point. Then, we add this to the original 4 points, resulting in 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we simply add the points scored in the first and second 20 minutes to find the total points. 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

"To determine the total cost of yogurts for Terry over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts consumed and then find the cost.

Terry eats 2 yogurts per day. Over 30 days, he consumes 2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts.

The yogurts are sold in sets of 4 for $5.00. To find the cost of 60 yogurts, we divide 60 by 4 to find the number of sets and then multiply by the cost per set.

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts/set = 15 sets
15 sets * $5.00/set = $75.00

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John made from selling his lego sets. Since he sold them for $15 each, we multiply the number of lego sets (13) by the selling price ($15):

13 * 15 = $195

Next, we calculate the total amount John spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so we multiply the number of video games (8) by the price per game ($20):

8 * 20 = $160

We are also given that John had $5 left after buying the video games. To find the total amount he spent, including the leftover money, we add the cost of the video games and the leftover money:

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165

Now, we compare the total amount John made from selling lego sets ($195) to the total amount he spent, including the leftover money ($165). The difference between these two amounts represents the money John didn't spend, which in turn represents the lego sets he didn't sell:

$195 (total made) - $165 (total spent) = $30

Since each lego set is worth $15, we can find the number of lego sets John didn't sell by dividing the unspent amount ($30) by the price per lego set ($15):

$30 ÷ $15 = 2

Therefore, John still has 2 lego sets.

"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he covers and the total time he spends running.

Given that John runs 60 miles a week and runs 3 days a week, we can proceed to calculate his running time. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours, and on the other two days, he runs half as much, which is 1.5 hours per day.

Total running time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day)
Total running time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5
Total running time = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate John's running speed using the formula:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Dana's running, walking, and skipping speeds. Let's denote her walking speed as w miles per hour, her running speed as r miles per hour, and her skipping speed as s miles per hour.

We are given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, so s = 3. We also know that she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, so s = r/2. Since s = 3, we can write:

r/2 = 3
r = 6

Now, we know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, so r = 4w. Since r = 6, we can write:

6 = 4w
w = 6/4
w = 1.5

Now that we have Dana's running and walking speeds, we can calculate the distance she can travel in 6 hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she can travel in 2 hours while running is 2 * 6 = 12 miles.
The distance she can travel in 4 hours while walking is 4 * 1.5 = 6 miles.

The total distance she can travel in 6 hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

"To determine the safe distance from which Polly can hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the total distance she can throw the javelin and then subtract the dragon's flame distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. Since she can throw it three times farther than without the gemstone, we multiply the original distance (400 feet) by 3. This gives us 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, we subtract the dragon's flame distance (1000 feet) from the total distance Polly can throw the javelin: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To determine the number of pieces taken by the guests, we must first calculate the total number of pieces of pie that Grandma Jones had. This can be done by multiplying the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie. 

5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

Now, we know that there were 14 pieces of pie remaining at the end of the evening. To find out how many pieces were taken, we simply subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to calculate the remaining calories in your daily target and then convert that to grams.

First, let's find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. You have a target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we can calculate how many servings you can eat with 200 calories.
200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Now, we need to convert 0.8 servings to grams. We know that a 300g bag has 5 servings, so we can calculate the weight of one serving.
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.

Multiply the weight of one serving by 0.8 to find the weight of 0.8 servings.
60g * 0.8 = 48g.

"To determine Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles, we need to calculate his total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax to make 10 candles, to make 20 candles, he requires 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, we'll calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the time it takes to write an article, which is 4 hours.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday, we can calculate this by finding 2/5 of the number of articles she wrote on Monday and adding that to the number of articles she wrote on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To solve this problem, we'll set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased as x.

We know that Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had a total of 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work, so the number of Post-it notes she had remaining can be represented as (80 + x) - 220.

We're told that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, so we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Now, let's solve for x by simplifying the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23
Combine the constants:
-140 + x = 23
Add 140 to both sides:
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The final answer is: 163"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, let's find the number of blue ties John bought. We know he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. We can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 times the number of blue ties:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, let's find the cost of each red tie. We know the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To find the cost of each red tie, we can calculate 50% of the cost of each blue tie and add it to the cost of each blue tie:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of Cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now that we know the number of red ties and the cost of each red tie, we can find the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

Total number of units = 15 * 8
Total number of units = 120

Now, we'll find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

Number of unoccupied units = Total number of units * (1/4)
Number of unoccupied units = 120 * (1/4)
Number of unoccupied units = 120 / 4

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

"To tackle this problem, we need to break it down step by step. Uriah's goal is to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. He starts by removing 30 comic books, each weighing 1/4 pound. To find the total weight of the comic books removed, we multiply the number of comic books by their individual weight: 30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, we subtract to find the remaining weight he needs to remove: 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we know that each toy weighs 1/2 pound, which is equivalent to 0.5 pounds. To find the number of toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To determine the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each, resulting in 6 × $60 = $360. Additionally, 4 car tires are repaired at $40 each, yielding 4 × $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each, resulting in 12 × $40 = $480. No truck tires are repaired, so the total revenue on Friday is $480.

Comparing the revenues, we see that Thursday's revenue ($520) exceeds Friday's revenue ($480). To find the difference, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

"To find the average square footage of a level, we can utilize the properties of a geometric series. The top level has a square footage of 16, and each subsequent level has twice the square footage of the level above it. This forms a geometric series with a common ratio of 2.

The series representing the square footage of the levels is 16, 32, 64, 128. This is a finite geometric series with the first term a = 16, common ratio r = 2, and number of terms n = 4.

The sum of a finite geometric series can be calculated using the formula:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Substituting the given values, we get:

S = 240

The sum of the square footage of all levels is 240. To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the sum by the number of levels:

Average = S / n
= 240 / 4

"To determine the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in that time frame.

First, let's calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days. Since the puppy consumes 1 cup of dog food per day, the total amount is:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

Next, we'll calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the remaining days of the year. There are 365 days in a year, so the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day for:
365 days - 180 days = 185 days

The total amount of dog food consumed in the remaining 185 days is:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

Now, we'll find the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year by adding the amounts from the two periods:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Finally, we'll divide the total amount of dog food consumed by the number of cups in one bag to find the number of bags needed:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the amounts of laundry done by Raymond, Sarah, and David. We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. 

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of laundry David does. Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as D. The proportion is:

400 = 4D

To find D, we divide both sides by 4:

D = 400 / 4
D = 100

So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

We are also given that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Let's denote the amount of laundry Raymond does as R. We can set up an equation based on this relationship:

R = 1/2 * 400
R = 200

Now that we know the amounts of laundry done by Raymond and David, we can find the difference:

Difference = R - D
= 200 - 100
= 100

"To determine the better price and calculate the savings, we need to analyze the unit prices of the two options.

Option 1: Package of 3 flowers for $2.50
Unit price = $2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.833 per flower

Option 2: Package of 2 flowers for $1
Unit price = $1 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.833 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price:
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
9 packages * $1 per package = $9

If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the other price, the cost would be:
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15

The amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is:
$15 - $9 = $6

"To calculate the cost of the grooming after the discount, we'll first determine the discount amount. The original price is $100, and the groomer offers a 30% discount for new customers. 

To find 30% of $100, we multiply $100 by 0.3 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%). This gives us a discount of $30. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price.

$100 (original price) - $30 (discount) = $70

The cost of the grooming after the discount is $70."
"To solve this problem, we'll start by calculating the amount of water each girl received. Since they each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, we can find their individual shares by dividing 24 by 6. 

24 ÷ 6 = 4 liters per girl

Since there are two girls, their combined share is 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

Now, let's add the boy's share of 6 liters to the girls' share. 
8 (girls) + 6 (boy) = 14 liters

The total amount of water initially was 24 liters. To find the amount of water left, we'll subtract the total amount taken (14 liters) from the initial amount.

24 - 14 = 10 liters

"To determine the number of stickers Charlie has left, we'll start by calculating the total number of stickers he had initially. This involves adding the stickers he already had, the ones he bought, and the ones he received for his birthday.

10 (initial stickers) + 21 (bought stickers) + 23 (birthday stickers) = 54 stickers

Now, we need to find out how many stickers Charlie gave away and used. This involves adding the stickers he gave to his sister and the ones he used for the greeting card.

9 (given to sister) + 28 (used for greeting card) = 37 stickers

Finally, we subtract the number of stickers Charlie gave away and used from the total number of stickers he had.

54 (total stickers) - 37 (given away and used) = 17 stickers

"To find Alex's weight, we'll start by multiplying Grace's weight by 4. This is a straightforward multiplication problem: 4 × 125 = 500. Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than this amount, we subtract 2 from 500, yielding 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weight, we simply add their individual weights together. This is a basic addition problem: 125 (Grace's weight) + 498 (Alex's weight) = 623.

"The art of multiplication is a wondrous thing, and I'm delighted to apply it to this lovely problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We have 3 rose bushes, each adorned with 25 roses. To find the total number of roses, we multiply the number of bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 × 25 = 75 roses.

Now, each of these 75 roses has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose: 75 × 8 = 600.

And there you have it – the total number of thorns is a grand total of:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of games the team won as 'W' and the number of games they lost as 'L'. We know that the total number of games played is 22, so we can write the equation:

W + L = 22

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write another equation:

W = L + 8

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for L:

(L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms:
2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
L = 7

Now that we have the value of L, we can find the value of W by substituting L into one of the original equations. We'll use the second equation:

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

"To determine the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene's vacationing years span from 23 to 34 years old. To find the number of years he has been vacationing, we subtract his starting age from his current age: 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Now, we multiply the number of years by the number of vacations per year, which is 4. This gives us the total number of vacations: 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each vacation corresponds to one quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is 44.

First, the alarm rang 4 times. 

The second time it rang, it did so for three times as long as the first time. As a multiplication expert, I can tell you that's 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. To find half of a number, we divide by 2. So, 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add the number of times it rang each time. As an addition expert, I can assure you that 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to consider the 10% increase in her monthly salary after completing 5 years with the company.

Initial monthly salary: $600
10% increase: $600 * 0.10 = $60
New monthly salary after 5 years: $600 + $60 = $660

Since the company only increases the salary by 10% once after 5 years, the new monthly salary of $660 will remain constant for the next three years. To find the annual salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12.

Annual salary after 5 years: $660 * 12 = $7920

This annual salary will remain the same for the next three years, as there are no further increases mentioned. Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will still be $7920.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a simple equation. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:
x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

The number of copies Harald sold is 8,000.

"To determine the number of gift bags Christina will need, we first calculate the number of guests that will show up. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of guests that will show up as follows:

Number of guests that will show up = Total number of guests - (1/4 * Total number of guests)
= 16 - (16 * 0.25)
= 16 - 4
= 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, the total number of gift bags she needs is:

Total gift bags = 0.75 * Number of guests that will show up
= 0.75 * 12
= 9

The cost of the gift bags is $2 each, so the total cost will be:

Total cost = Total gift bags * Cost per gift bag
= 9 * 2

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed for the dinosaur picnic, we'll start by calculating the amount required for the adults. Since each adult dinosaur consumes 10 pounds of potato salad, we multiply the number of adults (20) by the amount each adult eats (10 pounds). This gives us 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Next, we calculate the amount needed for the children. Given that a child eats half as much as an adult, we divide the adult's portion (10 pounds) by 2, resulting in 5 pounds per child. With 5 children attending the picnic, we multiply the number of children (5) by the amount each child eats (5 pounds), yielding 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad required for the adults (200 pounds) to the total amount required for the children (25 pounds). This gives us 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

Now, we're given that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. We can represent this as an equation: Jan's pets = 3 * Marcia's pets. Since Marcia has 6 pets, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we simply add the number of pets each person has: Cindy's pets + Marcia's pets + Jan's pets = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the ages of Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James as A, J, C, and M, respectively.

We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so we can write an equation: A = J + 5.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so we can write another equation: A = C - 2.

Additionally, we know that James is 1 year younger than Corey, and James is 10 years old, so we can write: M = C - 1, and M = 10.

Substituting M = 10 into the equation M = C - 1, we get 10 = C - 1. Solving for C, we find C = 11.

Now, we can substitute C = 11 into the equation A = C - 2, which gives A = 11 - 2 = 9.

Finally, we can substitute A = 9 into the equation A = J + 5, which gives 9 = J + 5. Solving for J, we find J = 4.

Jackson's age is 4."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Gerald's original time as G. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can express Lee's time as G - 2. Given that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, we can set up the equation:

G - 2 = 38

Now, we can solve for G by adding 2 to both sides of the equation:

G = 38 + 2
G = 40

This means Gerald's original time was 40 seconds. 

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so his new time will be 90% of his original time. We can calculate this by multiplying his original time by 0.9:

New time = 0.9G
New time = 0.9 * 40
New time = 36

2. There are two cats for every dog: C = 2D.
3. The number of dogs is 60: D = 60.

We can substitute the value of D into the second equation to find the number of cats: C = 2(60) = 120.

Now, we can substitute the values of D and C into the first equation to find the number of rabbits: R = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168.

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats: R + D + C = 168 + 60 + 120 = 348.

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to determine the total number of girls. Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys and then find the number of girls.

Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = (2 * 200) / 5 = 400 / 5 = 80

Now, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys = 200 - 80 = 120

Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we can calculate the number of girls in the girl scout.

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = (2 * 120) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80

Finally, we can find the number of girls not in the girl scout by subtracting the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To determine the difference in hours slept between Harry and James, we first need to find out how many hours James slept. Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can calculate this by multiplying 2/3 by the number of hours Harry slept.

Harry slept 9 hours, so James slept (2/3) * 9 hours. To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator (2) by the whole number (9), then divide by the denominator (3). This gives us (2 * 9) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept to find the difference. 
9 hours (Harry) - 6 hours (James) = 3 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final amount of sauce to find the initial amount of canned tomatoes, and then determine the number of tomatoes used.

First, we know that the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, so the 32 ounces of sauce would have come from twice that amount of canned tomatoes. This means the initial amount of canned tomatoes is 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Next, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes are in 64 ounces. Since each can is 16 ounces, we can set up a proportion to find the number of cans: 16 ounces/can = 64 ounces/x cans. Solving for x, we get x = 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Finally, we know that each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we can multiply the number of cans by 3 to get the total number of tomatoes: 4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. We know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes, and 5 cars took an exit to avoid the jam. Let's start by finding the total number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam.

Since 5 cars took the exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the total number of cars minus the cars that took the exit. 

Total number of cars = 30
Cars that took the exit = 5
Cars that drove through the traffic jam = Total number of cars - Cars that took the exit
= 30 - 5
= 25

Now, we know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. To find the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, we subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.

Cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes = Cars that drove through the traffic jam - Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes

"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she has initially and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

First, let's find out how many potted plants Mary already has. Since she has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, we can multiply the number of plants per ledge by the total number of ledges: 2 * 40 = 80.

In addition to the 80 potted plants, Mary received 18 new potted plants. So, the total number of plants she has is 80 + 18 = 98.

Now, let's calculate the number of plants she will give away. Since she will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, she will give away a total of 40 plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants: 98 - 40 = 58.

Since the city is 42 miles across, we can set up a proportion to find the time it takes to cover the entire city:

3 miles / 10 minutes = 42 miles / x minutes

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1000 * 1/4 = 1000 / 4 = 250

So, Poppy placed 250 pieces. Now, we subtract this from the total number of pieces to find the remaining pieces.

1000 - 250 = 750

Next, we need to find out how many pieces her mom placed. Since her mom placed a third of the remaining 750 pieces, we'll multiply 750 by 1/3.

"To calculate the total inner volume of the boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of each box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we'll subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length and width, and 2 inches from the height.

Length (L) = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Width (W) = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Height (H) = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

The inner volume of each box is calculated by multiplying the inner length, width, and height: 
Inner volume = L * W * H = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday as x.

We know that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. We can convert this to minutes: 7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 420 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total minutes of TV Frankie watched on other days. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes each night, which is 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode (60 minutes) and a 30-minute show, which is 90 minutes. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Total minutes of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 120 + 90 + 120 = 330 minutes.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

60x + 330 = 420

Here, 60x represents the total minutes of TV Frankie watched on Wednesday (since each episode is 30 minutes, we multiply x by 60 to convert it to minutes).

To solve for x, we can subtract 330 from both sides of the equation:

60x = 420 - 330
60x = 90

Now, we can divide both sides by 60:

x = 90 / 60
x = 1.5

However, since x represents the number of episodes, and we can't watch a fraction of an episode, we need to convert 1.5 hours to the number of episodes. Since each episode is 30 minutes, 1.5 hours is equal to 3 episodes (1.5 hours * 2 episodes/hour = 3 episodes).

"To tackle this problem, we'll employ a systematic approach using linear equations. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry aimed to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, the target number of cookies for this year is 2x. However, he inadvertently baked 15 more cookies than intended, resulting in a total of 2x + 15 cookies.

Unfortunately, Henry dropped 5 cookies while putting them out to cool, leaving him with (2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

We're given that this number equals 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

To isolate x, we'll subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 100

Next, we'll divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Next, we need to determine the cashback amount. Again, a simple multiplication: Cashback per gallon ($0.20) multiplied by the Number of gallons (10).

Cashback amount = $0.20 * 10
Cashback amount = $2.00

Now, to find the total cost after cashback, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost of the gas. A basic subtraction problem.

"To determine the average number of roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them consumed. 

Beatrice's roll-ups can be visualized as a rectangle with a width of 2 roll-ups and a length of 24 rolls. The total number of roll-ups she ate is the area of this rectangle, which is calculated as width times length: 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups.

Similarly, Marcell's roll-ups can be represented as a rectangle with a width of 3 roll-ups and a length of 14 rolls. The total number of roll-ups he ate is the area of this rectangle, which is 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Now, we can find the total number of roll-ups eaten by adding the individual totals: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups eaten by the number of people, which is 2. Therefore, the average number of roll-ups eaten is 90 / 2 = 45.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish a relationship between the time it takes Julia to row a certain distance and the amount of water the boat takes on. 

First, let's find Julia's rowing rate in feet per second. We know it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

Rowing rate = Distance / Time 
Rowing rate = 20 feet / 16 seconds 
Rowing rate = 1.25 feet/second 

Now, we can use this rate to find the total distance Julia rows to reach the shore, given that it's 64 seconds away.

Distance = Rate * Time 
Distance = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds 
Distance = 80 feet 

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of water the boat takes on for 80 feet.

2 liters / 10 feet = x liters / 80 feet 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply.

2 * 80 = 10 * x 
160 = 10x 
x = 160 / 10 
x = 16

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and set up the necessary equations. Let's denote the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as x.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. This can be expressed as:
Jamal's phone = 6 * B
1800 = 6 * B

We can solve for B by dividing both sides by 6:
B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we are also given that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. This can be expressed as:
B = 50 * x
300 = 50 * x

We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 50:
x = 300 / 50
x = 6

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we first need to determine the total cost price of the lumber she purchased. 

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 each, and she has 10 of them. So, the total cost for these boards is 10 * $10 = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 each, and she has 5 of them. So, the total cost for these boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost price of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have increased by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price, or 1.5 times the cost price.

The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. For 10 boards, the total selling price is 10 * $15 = $150.

The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each. For 5 boards, the total selling price is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total selling price of the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost price from the total selling price: $270 - $180 = $90.

"When dealing with ratios, it's essential to understand the relationship between the given quantities. In this case, the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the fraction of the total that represents the sugar.

The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20. This means that for every 20 units of the mixture, 7 units are sugar.

Given that Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar:

(7/20) = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and divide:

x = (7 * 120) / 20
x = 840 / 20
x = 42

The number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42."
"The art of multiplication is at play here. Let's break it down with precision. John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair contains 2 shoes, we can calculate the total number of shoes by multiplying the number of pairs by 2 (to account for the shoes in each pair) and then by 3 (the number of children).

So, we have 2 pairs * 2 shoes/pair * 3 children = 2 * 2 * 3 = 12 shoes.

Now, with the total number of shoes in hand, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of shoes by the cost of each shoe, which is $60. Thus, 12 shoes * $60/shoe = $720.

"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we'll start by calculating the number of vehicles already at the port from the first day. With 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles, the initial count is 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles.

Given that the total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day, we can find the number of vehicles imported on the second day by subtracting the initial count from the total. This gives us 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.

Now, to find the number of containers, we'll divide the number of vehicles from the second day by the number of vehicles per container, which is 5. This calculation yields 20 / 5 = 4.

The number of containers imported on the second day is 4."
"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps. 

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and it increased by 40%. To find his new salary, we'll calculate 40% of his old salary and add it to his old salary:
40% of $40,000 = 0.4 * $40,000 = $16,000
New salary = Old salary + Increase
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, let's find Lylah's salary four years ago. We know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
40% of $30,769 = 0.4 * $30,769 = $12,308
New salary = Old salary + Increase
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

Distance = 30 miles

Next, we'll calculate the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:
x + 2 = 12

Now, isolate 'x' by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
x = 12 - 2
x = 10

Therefore, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations with multiple variables. Let's denote the cost of a pepper as P, the cost of a watermelon as W, and the cost of an orange as O.

We are given the following information:
- A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so W = 3P.
- An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so O = W - 5.
- The cost of each pepper is $15, so P = 15.

We can substitute the value of P into the first equation to find the cost of a watermelon:
W = 3P
W = 3(15)
W = 45

Now, we can substitute the value of W into the second equation to find the cost of an orange:
O = W - 5
O = 45 - 5
O = 40

Now that we have the costs of each item, we can calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend:

"To determine the hospital's profit from the patient visits, we need to calculate the total cost of the doctors and the total revenue from the patients.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by the doctors in hours. Since there are 500 patients and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, we can calculate the total time in minutes as follows:
500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

To convert the total time to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Now, let's calculate the cost of the doctors to the hospital. The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total cost is:
200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

Next, we calculate the revenue from the patients. The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so the total revenue is:
200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit the hospital makes is the difference between the revenue and the cost:

"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets. The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12, and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. 

Total cost = Cost of adult ticket + Cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can set up an equation to find the amount she gave the cashier. Let's call this amount 'x'. The equation would be:

x - Total cost = Change received
x - $22 = $8

To find 'x', we can add $22 to both sides of the equation:

x = $22 + $8
x = $30

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of Dorothy's friends as 'x'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can write the equation:

3x = 12

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. We can write another equation:

James' friends = 4 * x
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To determine the waiting time, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, we'll convert their distances from miles to feet, as their speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home by dividing their respective distances by their speeds.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time.

Waiting time: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"The art of calculating earnings from a bike inflation service. Let's break it down with precision.

First, we have the bicycles. With 5 people and 2 tires per bicycle, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is 5 × 2 = 10.

Next, we have the tricycles. 3 people with 3 tires per tricycle results in 3 × 3 = 9 tires inflated.

And then, there's the unicycle with 1 tire inflated.

Now, let's add up the total number of tires inflated: 10 (bicycles) + 9 (tricycles) + 1 (unicycle) = 20 tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total amount made is 20 × 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 500 cents ÷ 100 = 5 dollars.

"The art of multiplication and subtraction. Let's break it down with precision. 

First, we need to determine the total number of cookies Carl purchased. With 10 packs of cookies, each containing 6 cookies, we can calculate the total number of cookies by multiplying the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack.

Total number of cookies = 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Now, we know each cookie costs $0.10. To find the total cost, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie.

Total cost = 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so to find the change he receives, we subtract the total cost from the bill amount.

Change = $10 (bill) - $6 (total cost) = $4

"To solve this problem, we'll work backwards, starting with the last event and using the information given to find the original number of french fries.

We know that after the ants carried off a fry, 5 fries were left. So, before the ants took a fry, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, leaving 1/3 of the fries behind. Since 6 fries represent 1/3 of the remaining fries, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * (x - 30) = 6

To solve for x - 30, we multiply both sides by 3:

x - 30 = 6 * 3
x - 30 = 18

Now, we add 30 to both sides to find the number of fries before the raccoon stole some:

x = 18 + 30
x = 48

However, this is not the original number of fries. We need to account for the 9 fries eaten by the pigeons and the 7 fries eaten by the seagull. So, we add those back in:

x = 48 + 9 + 7
x = 64

Finally, we add the 14 fries eaten by Dave to find the original number of fries:

x = 64 + 14
x = 78

"To calculate the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to determine his weekly class hours and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a semester.

Kimo's weekly schedule consists of three 1-hour classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. This totals 3 * 3 = 9 hours for these three days. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes, which amounts to 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. For these two days, that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours. 

Combining the hours from both sets of days, we get 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours per week.

Given that there are 16 weeks in a semester, we can find the total hours spent attending classes by multiplying the weekly hours by the number of weeks: 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.

"To determine the total length of the baked goods, we'll calculate the length of each type and add them together. 

First, we'll convert the length of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet, as the final answer is required in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches. To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12: 1200 inches / 12 = 100 feet.
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches. Converting to feet: 720 inches / 12 = 60 feet.
- Baguettes: Since the length of the baguettes is already given in feet (2 feet/baguette), we can directly calculate their total length: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet.

Now, we add the lengths together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

- Baboons: 100 bananas

Using my expertise in addition, I can calculate the total number of bananas needed per month:
200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to multiply the monthly total by 2. As an expert in multiplication, I can calculate this as follows:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas

The final answer is: 1400"
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between Blake and Kelly, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake's distance can be calculated by multiplying the number of round trips by the length of the field times two, since he's running back and forth. The field is 100 yards long, so each round trip is 200 yards. Therefore, Blake's total distance is 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly's distance is a bit more complex. She runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Since she's running to the 40-yard line and back, we need to multiply the distance to the 40-yard line by two. This gives us 40 * 2 = 80 yards per trip. Multiply this by the number of trips, and we get 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding this to her initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Now, to find the difference in distance traveled, we subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"To determine the tank's water depth on Wednesday, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps. 

First, we need to find the depth of the water on Tuesday. Since the tank had 7 feet more water than Monday's 17 feet, we add 7 to 17:
17 + 7 = 24 feet

Now that we know the depth on Tuesday, we can calculate the depth on Wednesday, which is two-thirds of Tuesday's depth. To do this, we multiply Tuesday's depth by 2 and then divide by 3:
(2/3) * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16 feet

The tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"The art of calculating the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin is a straightforward yet delightful exercise in addition and subtraction. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we'll calculate the number of fish caught by Anakin: 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. This gives us a total of 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.

Now, let's determine the number of fish caught by Locsin. We know that Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Finally, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, resulting in 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

With these numbers in hand, we can calculate Locsin's total catch: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

Now, to find the grand total, we simply add the number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin: 19 + 13 = 32.

"To calculate the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we can use the compound interest formula. Since the price increases by 20% every 2 months, we can calculate the total number of periods as 36 months / 2 months = 18 periods.

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r)^n, where:
A = final amount
P = principal amount (initial price) = $20
r = interest rate per period = 20% = 0.20
n = number of periods = 18

However, since the interest rate is 20% every 2 months, we need to adjust the formula to A = P(1 + r)^n, where r is the interest rate per period and n is the number of periods.

A = 20(1 + 0.20)^18
A ≈ 20(7.4853)
A ≈ 149.71 * 3.57 
A ≈ 532.39

"To determine the total value of all the toys, we need to establish the cost of each type of toy and then sum those costs.

First, we know the cost of one red car is $4. Therefore, the cost of 5 red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

Next, we're given that one action figure costs $5. Thus, the cost of 3 action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, its cost is also $15.

Now, we can calculate the total value of all the toys by adding the costs of the red cars, action figures, and the doll: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of eggs Sandra needs to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan.

15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Now, we know Sandra receives 9 eggs for each babysitting job. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per job.

45 eggs / 9 eggs/job = 5 jobs

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote Brooke's current age as 'x' and Seth's current age as 'y'. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation:

y = 2x

We also know that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. We can write another equation based on this information:

(x + 2) + (y + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

x + y + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

x + y = 24

Now, substitute the first equation (y = 2x) into the second equation (x + y = 24):

x + 2x = 24

Combine like terms:

3x = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting x into the first equation (y = 2x):

y = 2 * 8
y = 16

The final answer is: 16"

"To solve this problem, we can represent the ages of the birds as variables and set up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, Sally Four, and Sally Thirtytwo as S2, GR, SF, and ST, respectively.

We know that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so we can write the equation:
S2 = GR + 3

We also know that Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so we can write the equation:
GR = 2SF

Since Sally Four and Sally Thirtytwo are the same age, we can write the equation:
SF = ST

We are given that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, so we can substitute this value into the equation:
SF = 8

Now, we can substitute SF = 8 into the equation GR = 2SF to find Granny Red's age:
GR = 2(8) = 16

Next, we can substitute GR = 16 into the equation S2 = GR + 3 to find Sally Two's age:
S2 = 16 + 3 = 19

Now that we have the ages of all four birds, we can find the total age by adding them together:

Total minimum monthly payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we calculate the increase:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, we add the increase to the minimum payment:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into its key components. We know that Juan and Carlos sell each glass of lemonade for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. This means their revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

We also know that their cost per gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, making their total cost per gallon $5. This gives us a profit per gallon of $10 - $5 = $5.

Since they made a total profit of $25, we can set up the equation:

Profit per gallon * Number of gallons = Total profit
$5 * Number of gallons = $25

Solving for the number of gallons, we get:

Number of gallons = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

Now, we can find the total cost of lemons by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost of lemons per gallon:

Total cost of lemons = Number of gallons * Cost of lemons per gallon
Total cost of lemons = 5 * $3
Total cost of lemons = $15

"To determine the amount of money Zaid will have left after all expenses and donations, we need to break down his expenditures step by step.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on rent and car fuel. Zaid earns 6000$ per month and spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500. He also spends 1/3 on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000.

The total amount spent on rent and car fuel is 1500 + 2000 = 3500. Subtracting this from his monthly salary, we get 6000 - 3500 = 2500.

Next, Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. Half of 2500 is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250. After the donation, he is left with 2500 - 1250 = 1250.

Finally, Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$ for expenses, totaling 200 + 700 = 900. Subtracting this from the remaining amount, we get 1250 - 900 = 350.

- Bo has 40 crabs, so B = 40.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so M = B - 4.
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so R = M + 10.

We can substitute the value of B into the equation for M:
M = 40 - 4
M = 36

Now, we can substitute the value of M into the equation for R:
R = 36 + 10
R = 46

Now that we have the number of crabs each person has, we can find the total number of crabs by adding the number of crabs each person has:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote Jan's age as J, Mark's age as M, and Jean's age as N.

We know that Jan is 30 years old, so J = 30.

We also know that Jean is two years older than Mark, which can be expressed as:
N = M + 2

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30, two years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28. Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14. Mark was 5 years older than that, so Mark's age two years ago was 14 + 5 = 19. Since that was two years ago, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21.

However, we can also express Mark's age two years ago in terms of his current age: M - 2. We can set up an equation based on the information that Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age two years ago:
M - 2 = (J - 2) / 2 + 5

Substituting J = 30 into the equation above:
M - 2 = (30 - 2) / 2 + 5
M - 2 = 28 / 2 + 5
M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we have Mark's age, we can find Jean's age using the equation N = M + 2:
N = 21 + 2
N = 23

"To determine the likelihood of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 versus rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event.

First, let's consider the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.

Next, we'll calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. This simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5. Since the die is rolled twice, we multiply the probabilities together: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

Now, we'll find the difference between the two probabilities: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

The difference in likelihood is 25%."
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to determine Jenna's share and add it to her mom's share. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can calculate her share by dividing her mom's total by 2. 

Her mom picked 20 apples, so Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples. Now, we simply add Jenna's share (10 apples) to her mom's share (20 apples) to get the total number of apples they both picked: 10 + 20 = 30.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 6 * 3r = 18r.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160, and 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and the hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We can now set up an equation based on the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and the hamsters:

18r + 50 = 140

Subtracting 50 from both sides of the equation gives us:

18r = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 18 gives us:

r = 5

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage.

"Calculating the total amount Mandy should pay Benedict is a straightforward process. We'll start by determining the interest accrued over the 3-month period.

The initial amount owed is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%, or 0.02 in decimal form. To find the interest for one month, we multiply the initial amount by the monthly interest rate:

$100 * 0.02 = $2

Since the interest rate is monthly, we'll multiply the monthly interest by the number of months:

$2 * 3 = $6

Now, we add the interest to the initial amount to find the total amount Mandy should pay:

$100 + $6 = $106

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'.

The cost price per bag is $20, and the transportation cost per bag is $2, so the total cost per bag is $20 + $2 = $22.

The selling price per bag is $30, resulting in a profit of $30 - $22 = $8 per bag.

The total profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:
8x = 400

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by 8:
x = 400 / 8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To determine the amount each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the outing and then divide it by 3.

First, we calculate the cost of the food by subtracting $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides by multiplying the cost per ride by the number of rides.
Cost of rides = Cost per ride * Number of rides
Cost of rides = $33 * 2
Cost of rides = $66

Now, we calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets, food, and rides.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Finally, we divide the total cost by 3 to find the amount each friend paid.
Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

"To determine the daily insect consumption of a flock of ten ducks, we must first calculate their weekly needs. Since each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply this amount by the number of ducks.

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/week/duck = 35 pounds/week

Now, to find the daily consumption, we divide the weekly needs by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps. 

First, let's calculate the net gain of trees per year. Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Since this process occurs over 10 years, we multiply the net gain per year by the number of years: 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Now, we add the net gain to the initial number of trees: 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees.

Next, we calculate the number of trees that die. 30% of the trees die, which is equivalent to 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

Finally, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of events and apply the necessary arithmetic operations.

Initially, Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos. On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 1/3 * 18 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, on Saturday, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, let's calculate the total number of pink flamingos: 12 (remaining from Saturday) + 18 (added on Sunday) = 30 pink flamingos. The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount Violetta prepared for the purchase. 

$20 (prepared amount) - $10 (total cost) = $10

"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we first need to establish the cost of a single pen. Given that a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined, we can calculate this by adding the cost of a pencil ($1.20) to the cost of an eraser ($0.30).

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we can find the cost of 8 pens by multiplying the cost of a single pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = 8 * Cost of a pen
Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50
Cost of 8 pens = $12

"To determine the amount of carrots that will not be used, we need to calculate the total amount of carrots distributed to the restaurants. Since each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots and there are 40 restaurants, we can find the total amount distributed by multiplying the number of restaurants by the amount each receives.

Total carrots distributed = Number of restaurants * Carrots per restaurant
Total carrots distributed = 40 * 2
Total carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available to find the amount not used.

Carrots not used = Total amount of carrots available - Total carrots distributed
Carrots not used = 200 - 80
Carrots not used = 120

"To determine the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we establish Elaine's initial number of Pokémon cards: 20.

Next, we calculate the number of cards she collected in the first month, which is three times her initial number: 3 * 20 = 60.

In the second month, Elaine collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month. So, we subtract 20 from the number of cards collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40.

Now, we need to find the combined number of cards collected in the first and second months: 60 + 40 = 100.

In the third month, Elaine collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: 2 * 100 = 200.

Finally, we add the cards collected each month to her initial number of cards: 
20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher as 'x'. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences, we can set up the equation:

2x = 1000

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 500

This means Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Let's denote the amount Publisher A pays per sentence as 'a'. We know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so a = 5.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, the amount Publisher B pays per sentence is 2a = 2 * 5 = 10 cents.

Now, we can calculate the total amount Mark makes in a week. The amount he earns from Publisher A is 500 * a = 500 * 5 = 2500 cents. The amount he earns from Publisher B is 500 * 2a = 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we'll break it down into two components: his annual salary with the raise and the one-time monetary reward.

First, let's calculate John's annual salary before the raise. He makes $2000 per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, so his total earnings before the raise would be:

$2000 per week * 52 weeks = $104,000 per year

The 5% raise is calculated as:

$2000 per week * 0.05 = $100 per week increase

So, John's new weekly salary after the raise is:

$2000 per week + $100 per week = $2100 per week

His total earnings after the raise would be:

$2100 per week * 52 weeks = $109,200 per year

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his annual salary:

$109,200 per year + $5000 = $114,200

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year would be $114,200.

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down his cheese consumption across different meals and calculate the total slices used.

First, let's consider Carl's lunch. He ate a sandwich every day for a week, which is 7 days. Since he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, the total slices used for lunch can be calculated as follows:
2 slices/ sandwich * 7 sandwiches = 2 * 7 = 14 slices

Next, we'll look at Carl's breakfast. He had cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Given that he used 2 slices per sandwich, the number of slices per omelet is 2 + 1 = 3 slices. The total slices used for breakfast can be calculated as:
3 slices/ omelet * 3 omelets = 3 * 3 = 9 slices

Lastly, Carl used 8 slices of cheese in his macaroni and cheese for dinner.

Now, we'll add the slices used for each meal together to find the total number of slices:
14 slices (lunch) + 9 slices (breakfast) + 8 slices (dinner) = 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices

"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we'll break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, let's calculate the total number of pens Janet initially had. She had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Using the fundamental principle of addition, we add these two quantities together: 22 + 10 = 32.

Next, we'll calculate the number of pens Janet bought. She purchased 6 bags of blue pens, with each bag containing 9 pens. To find the total number of blue pens, we apply the multiplication principle: 6 * 9 = 54.

Janet also bought 2 bags of red pens, with each bag containing 6 pens. Again, using multiplication, we find the total number of red pens: 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, we add the number of blue pens and red pens together to find the total number of pens Janet bought: 54 + 12 = 66.

Finally, we add the initial number of pens Janet had to the number of pens she bought: 32 + 66 = 98.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, given that she can remove her lowest score.

First, let's calculate the total score required to achieve an average of 93 across 5 tests (since the lowest score will be removed). We multiply the desired average by the number of tests that will be included in the average:

93 * 5 = 465

This is the total score Brinley needs to achieve across her top 5 tests.

Next, let's calculate the total score of Brinley's first 5 tests, excluding the lowest score. We add up the scores of her first 5 tests:

89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

We excluded the lowest score (71) from this calculation, as it will be removed from the average.

Now, we subtract the total score of the first 5 tests (excluding the lowest score) from the total score required to achieve an average of 93:

465 - 367 = 98

This means Brinley needs to score at least 98 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

"To determine the total kilometers Micheal rode, we'll break down the problem into two parts: the first 4 weeks and the last 3 weeks.

First, let's calculate the total kilometers for the first 4 weeks. Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week, so in 4 weeks, he rode a total of 5 * 4 = 20 times. Since he rode 25 kilometers each time, the total kilometers for the first 4 weeks is 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

Next, we'll calculate the total kilometers for the last 3 weeks. Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week, so in 3 weeks, he rode a total of 2 * 3 = 6 times. Since he rode 60 kilometers each time, the total kilometers for the last 3 weeks is 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we'll add the total kilometers from both periods to find the overall total. The sum is 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"The art of multiplication and addition is a wondrous thing, my friend. Let's apply these fundamental principles to solve the problem at hand.

First, we know that Joe's bag contains 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g. To find the total weight of the chocolate bars, we simply multiply the number of bars by their individual weight: 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Now, we're told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. This means that each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar, which is 40g / 2 = 20g. With 80 candied apples in the bag, we multiply the number of apples by their individual weight: 80 * 20g = 1600g.

The final step is to add the weight of the chocolate bars to the weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. Let's denote the cost of each cup as 'x'. We are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.

First, we calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since half a dozen is 6, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Now, we know that the total cost of 20 dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of 20 dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since 1 dozen is 12, 20 dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. We can now set up an equation to find the cost of each cup:

20 * 12 * x = 34800

Combine like terms:
240x = 34800

Now, divide both sides by 240 to solve for x:
x = 34800 / 240
x = 145

The total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, we need to determine how much money Sara already has. She had $10 saved before she started babysitting, and she earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids. Since she babysits 4 times, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

The total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Now, we need to find out how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes. We subtract the amount she already has from the total cost: $70 - $30 = $40.

Since Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can set up an equation to find out how many times she must mow the lawn. Let x be the number of times she mows the lawn. The equation is 4x = $40.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = $40 / 4 = 10.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations with two variables. Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can write an equation based on this information:

w = r + 2

We also know that the total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up another equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can substitute the expression for w from the first equation into the second equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"Calculating the time Gary spends walking around the park is a straightforward process. First, we need to determine the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). Given the park's dimensions, we can plug in the values: Perimeter = 2(6 miles + 1.5 miles).

Performing the calculation, we get: Perimeter = 2(7.5 miles) = 15 miles.

Now that we have the perimeter, we can find the time it takes Gary to walk around the park by dividing the perimeter by his walking speed. The formula for time is Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance is the perimeter of the park (15 miles), and Gary's walking speed is 3 miles/hour.

Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we can model the situation using a system of differential equations. Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool as S(t) and the amount of water in the big pool as B(t), where t is time in minutes.

Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute, we can write the following differential equations:

dS/dt = -4
dB/dt = -4

We are given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This can be expressed as:

B(-4) = 2S(-4)

We are also given that now (t = 0), the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:

B(0) = 4S(0)

To solve this problem, we can integrate the differential equations to find the general solutions:

S(t) = -4t + C1
B(t) = -4t + C2

where C1 and C2 are constants.

Using the initial conditions, we can write:

B(-4) = 2S(-4)
-4(-4) + C2 = 2(-4(-4) + C1)
16 + C2 = 2(16 + C1)
16 + C2 = 32 + 2C1
C2 - 2C1 = 16

B(0) = 4S(0)
-4(0) + C2 = 4(-4(0) + C1)
C2 = 4C1

Now we have a system of linear equations:

C2 - 2C1 = 16
C2 = 4C1

Substituting C2 = 4C1 into the first equation:

4C1 - 2C1 = 16
2C1 = 16
C1 = 8

Now that we have C1, we can find C2:

C2 = 4C1
C2 = 4(8)
C2 = 32

Now we can find S(0), the amount of water in the small pool now:

S(0) = -4(0) + C1
S(0) = 0 + 8
S(0) = 8

However, we need to account for the 16 gallons lost by the small pool over the 4 minutes. Since the pool was losing water at a constant rate, we can subtract the amount lost:

"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and the belt, we must first calculate the total cost of the items. This is done by adding the cost of the shoes to the cost of the belt.

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work.

Number of hours = Total cost / hourly wage
Number of hours = $352.00 / $8.00
Number of hours = 44

"To calculate Janeth's remaining balance, we need to determine the total amount she owes, including the principal and the additional 10% interest. The principal amount is $2000, and the 10% interest is calculated as $2000 * 0.10 = $200. Therefore, the total amount owed is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth's monthly payment is $165, and she will make 12 payments. The total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount owed: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"The art of addition is a wondrous thing. Let's apply it to this lovely problem. We have 4 roses in the vase, and there are 7 more dahlias than roses. To find the total number of flowers, we must first determine the number of dahlias.

The number of dahlias is equal to the number of roses plus 7. So, we add 4 (the number of roses) and 7 (the additional dahlias). This gives us 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we simply add the number of roses (4) to the number of dahlias (11). This yields 4 + 11 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information given to set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote Adrian's age as A, Harriet's age as H, and Zack's age as Z.

We know that Harriet is 21 years old now, so H = 21.

We are also given that Harriet is half the age of Zack, which can be expressed as:
H = (1/2)Z

Since H = 21, we can substitute this value into the equation above to find Zack's age:
21 = (1/2)Z
Z = 2 * 21
Z = 42

Now, we know that Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, which can be expressed as:
A = 3H
A = 3 * 21
A = 63

Now that we have the current ages of all three individuals, we can find their ages in three years by adding 3 to each:
- Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack's age in three years: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian's age in three years: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. We know that the total points scored by all four students is 251, and Naomi scored 68 of those points.

Next, we need to find out how many points Yuri scored. We are told that Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. To find half of Naomi's points, we divide her score by 2: 68 ÷ 2 = 34. Then, we add 10 to this result to find Yuri's score: 34 + 10 = 44.

Now, let's calculate Brianna's score. We know that she scored 17 points more than Naomi, so we add 17 to Naomi's score: 68 + 17 = 85.

We now have the scores for Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68, 44, and 85, respectively. To find the total points scored by these three students, we add their scores: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

Finally, to find Jojo's score, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students: 251 - 197 = 54.

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles using the same principle: 8 * 5 = 40 minutes. Again, the product gives us the total time spent on sudoku puzzles.

Now, to find the total time spent on both types of puzzles, we simply add the time spent on crossword puzzles to the time spent on sudoku puzzles: 30 + 40 = 70 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps. 

First, we need to find out how much water was left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. We can do this by subtracting the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank.

Initial water = 120 liters
Water used = 90 liters
Water left = Initial water - Water used
Water left = 120 - 90
Water left = 30 liters

Now that we know 30 liters of water were left, we can calculate the amount of rainwater collected. Since the rainwater collected is twice as much as what was left, we'll multiply the amount of water left by 2.

Rainwater collected = 2 * Water left
Rainwater collected = 2 * 30
Rainwater collected = 60 liters

Finally, we'll find the total amount of water in the tank now by adding the water left and the rainwater collected.

Total water now = Water left + Rainwater collected
Total water now = 30 + 60
Total water now = 90 liters

= 90 - 40
= 50

Now that we know the number of petunias, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias.

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
= 90 + 50
= 140

"To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the number of days for the trip to Rochester by bus and the number of days for the return trip by car.

First, we know the trip to Rochester by bus takes 6 days.

Since it takes half as many days to travel by car, we can calculate the return trip duration by multiplying the bus trip duration by 1/2 or 0.5. This gives us 6 * 0.5 = 3 days for the return trip by car.

Now, to find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we simply add the number of days for the trip to Rochester by bus (6 days) and the number of days for the return trip by car (3 days). This gives us 6 + 3 = 9 days.

"To determine the probability of selecting a water type card from James' collection, we must first establish the total number of cards and the number of water type cards after the changes.

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards, totaling 90 cards.

After losing 8 water type cards, the number of water type cards decreases to 40 - 8 = 32.

The purchase of 14 grass type cards increases the total number of cards to 90 - 8 + 14 = 96.

Now, we can calculate the probability of selecting a water type card by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards.
Probability = 32 / 96 ≈ 0.3333

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100.
Percentage chance = 0.3333 * 100 ≈ 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of selecting a water type card is 33%.

Upgrading the meal for an extra $3.00 brings the total cost to $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

Now, let's apply the gift card. Chad has a $5.00 gift card, which will be subtracted from the total cost. So, the amount owed is $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"To determine the time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined work rate. 

Kalinda's work rate is 4 pieces per minute. Since her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, her work rate is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: 4 pieces/minute + 2 pieces/minute = 6 pieces/minute.

Now, we can use their combined work rate to find the time it will take to complete the puzzle. Time is equal to the total number of pieces divided by the combined work rate: 360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

"To determine the number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we'll calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we'll find 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Next, we'll calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, we'll find 3/4 of 84.

To find 3/4 of 84, we can multiply 84 by 3 and then divide by 4.

3/4 of 84 = (84 * 3) / 4 = 252 / 4 = 63

So, Ashlyn harvested 63 more watermelons, leaving 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

The number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21.

"To calculate the total cost, we'll break it down into three components: the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars. Since Mark buys 12 cars at $20,000 each, we multiply the number of cars by the cost per car: 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

Next, we calculate the tax, which is 10% of the total cost of the cars. To find 10% of $240,000, we multiply by 0.1: 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

Finally, we add the registration fees, which are $1000 per car. For 12 cars, the total registration fees are 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

Now, let's add the three components together to find the total cost: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

First, let's find one-third of the penguins, which is the number that jumped in the ocean and the number that went inside the cave. Since one-third is equivalent to 1/3, we can multiply 36 by 1/3 to find the number of penguins in each group.

36 * 1/3 = 12

Since two groups of penguins left the sunbathing area, we multiply 12 by 2 to find the total number of penguins that left.

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we must first calculate his daily and weekly consumption, as well as his girlfriend's. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his weekly consumption is:

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Given that Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can calculate her weekly consumption by dividing Steve's weekly consumption by 2:

42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Now, we can find their combined weekly consumption by adding Steve's and his girlfriend's weekly consumption:

42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/week = 63 tomatoes/week

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we can find the number of vines needed by dividing their combined weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine:

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/week/vine = 21 vines

"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we must first calculate the total number of slices required. With 20 friends and 4 slices per friend, the total number of slices needed is 20 * 4 = 80 slices.

Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, we'll divide the total number of slices required by 8. However, it's essential to consider that we can't order a fraction of a pizza. Therefore, we'll perform the division and round up to the nearest whole number if necessary.

80 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas

In this case, the division results in a whole number, so no rounding is required. John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each friend gets 4 slices.

"To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to consider the initial pens and the pens he makes from the empty ones.

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens.

When the ink runs low in these 25 pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

Now, he has 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens.

We can see a pattern emerging here. Every time the ink runs low, Ram can make 1/5 of the total pens into new pens. This is a geometric series with a common ratio of 1/5.

Let's calculate the total number of pens Ram gets to have:

"The art of multiplication and addition at its finest. Let's break it down step by step. Johnny starts with a solid foundation of $20, his allowance. He then adds an extra $10, which is a straightforward addition problem. 

$20 (allowance) + $10 (extra) = $30

Now, we're told that this sum triples in a year. As a multiplication expert, I can tell you that tripling a number is equivalent to multiplying it by 3. So, we'll multiply $30 by 3.

$30 * 3 = $90

"To solve this problem, we can represent the given information as a system of linear equations. Let's denote Jessa's age as J, Joan's age as N, and Mary's age as M.

We know that Jessa is 20 years old, so J = 20.
We also know that Joan is five years older than Jessa, which can be represented as N = J + 5.
Lastly, Mary is two years younger than Joan, so M = N - 2.

Now, we can substitute the values to find the ages of Joan and Mary:
N = J + 5
N = 20 + 5
N = 25

M = N - 2
M = 25 - 2
M = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:
J + N + M = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68

"To determine the number of students who exited through entrance/exit C, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the number of students who exited through entrance/exit A. Since 30% of the students left through this exit, we find this number by multiplying the total number of students (1000) by 0.3.

Number of students who exited through A = 1000 * 0.3
= 300

Now, we subtract this number from the total to find the remaining students.

Remaining students = 1000 - 300
= 700

Next, we calculate the number of students who exited through entrance/exit B, which is 3/5 of the remaining students. To do this, we multiply the remaining students (700) by 3/5.

Number of students who exited through B = 700 * (3/5)
= 420

Finally, we subtract the number of students who exited through B from the remaining students to find the number of students who exited through entrance/exit C.

Number of students who exited through C = 700 - 420
= 280

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that John has twice as many candies as Robert. Let's represent the number of candies Robert has as 'R'. Since John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

2R = 54

To find the value of R, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

R = 54 / 2
R = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can use the information that James has 6 more candies than Robert to find the number of candies James has:

J = R + 6
J = 27 + 6
J = 33

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has:

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
= 54 - 33
= 21

"Let's break down the problem. We have two individuals, Dolly and Pandora, with a total of 3 books between them (2 belonging to Dolly and 1 to Pandora). The task is to determine the total number of books they will collectively read, considering that each person reads all the books, including their own and the other's.

Since there are 3 unique books in total, and each person reads all 3 books, we can simply multiply the number of unique books by the number of people reading them. However, this would count each book twice (once for each person), so we need to consider the total number of unique book readings.

A more straightforward approach is to consider the total number of unique book readings directly. Each book is read by 2 people (Dolly and Pandora), so we multiply the number of unique books by 2. 

There are 3 unique books, and each is read by 2 people, resulting in a total of 3 * 2 = 6 book readings.

"To determine the number of hours Mike spends writing a week, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to find out how many pen pals Mike has after stopping communication with 2 of them. He initially had 5 pen pals, so after stopping communication with 2, he has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. Therefore, the total number of letters Mike writes a week is 2 * 3 = 6 letters.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages Mike writes a week is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Now, we know Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find the total time he spends writing a week, we multiply the total number of pages by the time it takes to write a page: 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes.

Finally, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

"The art of subtraction and multiplication. Let's break down Jason's phone plan conundrum.

First, we need to calculate the total minutes Jason spends on daily calls with his boss. Since he has a 15-minute call every day for 30 days, we multiply the duration of each call by the number of days:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Now, we add the extra 300 minutes of calls he made to other people:
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Jason's total monthly minutes are 1000. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly limit:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Next, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Then, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. After this, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries.

We know that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to subtract the number of fries Griffin had before Ginger gave her some from the total number of fries Griffin had in the end. 

So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 27 - 7 = 20.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

We are told that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28. So, we can set up the equation:

2 * 2x = 28

Combine like terms and solve for x:
4x = 28
x = 28 / 4
x = 7

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To determine the total amount Jean paid for the makeup services, we'll break down the calculation into manageable steps.

First, we need to find the total hours of makeup work per week. Since the makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, the total hours per week is:

6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week

Next, we'll calculate the total hours for the entire movie, which takes 5 weeks to finish:

24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Now, we can find the total cost before the discount by multiplying the total hours by the hourly rate of $250:

120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

The makeup artist offers a 10% discount due to the large amount of work. To calculate the discount amount, we'll find 10% of the total cost:

10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Finally, we'll subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the amount Jean paid:

$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To determine the amount each person paid, we must first calculate the total cost of the party supplies. This involves adding the individual costs together.

Total cost = cost of cake + cost of presents + cost of decorations + cost of invitations + cost of goodie bags
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22

Using my expertise in addition, I can efficiently calculate the total cost. 
$12 + $43 = $55
$55 + $15 = $70
$70 + $4 = $74
$74 + $22 = $96

Now that we have the total cost, we can proceed to divide it by 3, as the cost is split evenly among three people. My expertise in division allows me to accurately perform this calculation.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

Total weight = 4 * 50
Total weight = 200 pounds

Now, we know the cost per pound is $1.50. To find the total cost, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cookies Sue and her sister ate, and then find the difference in calories consumed.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate on both days: 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. 

Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's find the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's sister: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue's sister: 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
Sue: 46 * 200 = 9200 calories

Now, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:

We're provided with the information that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - (15 + 12) = 30 - 27 = 3.

Now, we know the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the class: 20 - 3 = 17.

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into two parts: the number of animals Rick killed last night and the number of animals he killed today.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. To find the total number of animals he killed last night, we simply add these two numbers together: 10 + 15 = 25.

Now, let's calculate the number of animals Rick killed today. We know that he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Since Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed today, we add the number of wolves and cougars: 36 + 12 = 48.

Finally, we add the total number of animals Rick killed last night (25) to the total number of animals he killed today (48) to find the overall total: 25 + 48 = 73.

Using the order of operations, we first perform the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12. Then, we add 6 to the result: 12 + 6 = 18.

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor.

30% of 30 = 0.3 * 30 = 9

Now, subtract 9 from 30 to find the number of times Anne went down the slide.
30 - 9 = 21

Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.
21 * 4 = 84

The number of times Robert went down the water slide is 84."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. First, let's find the total number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, but the problem later states 20 stalls, so we will use 20 stalls for the distribution of the new cows. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls. So, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 2 (new cows) = 22 cows.

To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after termites ate 30% of it, we'll follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to find the total weight of the tree before the termites' damage. Given that each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can calculate the total weight by dividing the height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 and multiplying by 400 pounds.

200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to calculate 30% of the total weight to find the weight of the wood eaten by the termites.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

To find the weight of the remaining wood, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the total weight.

Weight of remaining wood = Total weight - Weight eaten by termites
Weight of remaining wood = 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds
Weight of remaining wood = 5600 pounds

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations using the given information. Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as A, the number of bananas Jamal has as B, and the number of bananas Andrea has as C.

We know that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and she has 52 apples. So, we can write an equation for the number of apples Jamal has:
A + 8 = 52
A = 44

We also know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so we can write an equation for the number of bananas Jamal has:
B = A + 4
B = 44 + 4
B = 48

Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, we can write an equation for the number of bananas Andrea has:
C = B / 2
C = 48 / 2
C = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas each person has:
Andrea's fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76

$350,000 + $17,500 = $367,500
$367,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price.

$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total deductions from the selling price and then subtract that amount from the selling price.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees, which are 3% of the selling price. This is calculated as 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price. This is calculated as 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

In addition to these fees, Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house.

Now, let's calculate the total deductions: $12,000 (transfer fees) + $20,000 (brokerage fee) + $250,000 (remaining loan amount) = $282,000.

To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we subtract the total deductions from the selling price: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to break down the problem into its individual components.

First, it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees. To calculate this, we find 40% of 20 minutes, which is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. Therefore, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees.

The total time to warm the oil is the sum of the time it takes to heat the oil to 300 degrees and the time it takes to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees, which is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. So, the cooking time is 48 - 5 = 43 minutes.

Finally, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time to warm the oil and the time to cook, which is 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.

"To calculate the total amount spent on all the ads, we'll start by multiplying the number of newspaper ads by the cost per ad. In this case, the real estate agent bought 50 newspaper ads at $5 each, so the total cost of newspaper ads is 50 * 5 = $250.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of television ads by multiplying the number of television ads by the cost per ad. The agent bought 15 television ads at $75 each, so the total cost of television ads is 15 * 75 = $1125.

Now, we'll add the cost of newspaper ads and television ads to find the total amount spent. The total cost is $250 + $1125 = $1375.

"The art of division is at play here. Let's dissect the problem with precision. We're given that the juggler has 16 balls, with half of them being golf balls. To find the number of golf balls, we simply divide the total number of balls by 2.

16 ÷ 2 = 8

Now, we're told that half of these golf balls are blue. To find the number of blue golf balls, we divide the number of golf balls by 2.

8 ÷ 2 = 4

The juggler has 4 blue golf balls.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we'll start by defining the number of M&Ms in the first bag as 300. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so we can express this as 300 + 12. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, which is 300 / 2 or 300 * (1/2).

Now, let's calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag:
First bag: 300
Second bag: 300 + 12 = 312
Third bag: 300 * (1/2) = 150

To find the total number of M&Ms, we'll add the number of M&Ms in each bag together:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

"The art of calculating total windows. Let's break it down with precision. 

First, we have 2 houses, each with 3 bedrooms. Since each bedroom has 2 windows, we can calculate the total number of bedroom windows per house by multiplying the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom: 3 * 2 = 6.

Now, we add the 4 additional windows in each house, which aren't connected to bedrooms. This brings the total number of windows per house to 6 + 4 = 10.

To find the total number of windows between the two houses, we simply multiply the total number of windows per house by the number of houses: 10 * 2 = 20.

First, let's add the costs of the items: 
$4.20 (cocoa) + $9.45 (laundry) = $13.65
$13.65 + $1.35 (pasta) = $14.99

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
$20 (amount paid) - $14.99 (total cost) = $5.01

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully break it down into manageable parts. First, let's calculate the number of stitches for the collar. Since the collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches as the body, and the body takes 900 stitches, we can calculate the stitches for the collar as follows:

Collar stitches = (1/10) * 900 = 90 stitches

Next, we know that the rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Therefore, the number of stitches for the rosette is:

Rosette stitches = 2 * 90 = 180 stitches

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:

Total stitches (body, collar, rosette) = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches for the two sleeves is:

Total stitches (sleeves) = 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches

Finally, since there are two sleeves, we can calculate the number of stitches for each sleeve by dividing the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:

Stitches per sleeve = 630 / 2 = 315 stitches

"To determine the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds, we'll calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, then add them together.

First, we'll find the cost of the tomato seeds by multiplying the number of packets by the cost per packet. Since there are 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 each, the total cost is 20 * 40 = $800.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the celery seeds. With 80 packets at $30 each, the total cost is 80 * 30 = $2400.

Now, we'll add the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds together: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we'll break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's consider the solo song, which has 54 lines.

Next, we'll analyze the first scene. Since it has twice the number of lines as the song, we multiply the number of lines in the song by 2: 54 * 2 = 108. However, Sean only needs to memorize a third of these lines, so we divide 108 by 3: 108 / 3 = 36.

Moving on to the second scene, we know it has six more lines than the song. To find the total number of lines in the second scene, we add 6 to the number of lines in the song: 54 + 6 = 60. Since four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, we multiply 60 by 4/5: 60 * 4/5 = 48.

Now, we add the lines for the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of cards with the letter A. Since 2/5 of the cards have the letter A, we multiply 80 by 2/5:
80 * 2/5 = (80 * 2) / 5 = 160 / 5 = 32

Now, we subtract the cards with A from the total to find the remaining cards:
80 - 32 = 48

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B, which is 1/2 of the remaining cards:
48 * 1/2 = 48 / 2 = 24

We subtract the cards with B from the remaining:
48 - 24 = 24

Then, we find the number of cards with the letter C, which is 5/8 of the remaining cards:
24 * 5/8 = (24 * 5) / 8 = 120 / 8 = 15

Now, we subtract the cards with C from the remaining:
24 - 15 = 9

The remaining cards have the letter D, so the number of cards with D is 9.

"To determine the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we'll calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes. Since it takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig a small hole, we multiply the time per hole by the number of holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes/hole = 90 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time for the large holes. It takes Matthew 10 minutes to dig a large hole, so we multiply the time per hole by the number of holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes/hole = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for the small holes and large holes to find the total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

"The art of addition is a wondrous thing. Let's apply it to this delightful problem. We're given that the sum of Mico and Marco's ages is 20. To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we simply need to add 10 years to each of their current ages. This is equivalent to adding 10 + 10 to their current combined age.

So, we take their current sum of 20 and add 20 to it. This yields a sum of 40.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write the equation:
R = 6S

We are also given that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This translates to:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, we can substitute the expression for R from the first equation into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides gives us:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides yields:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:
S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate the total amount Peter paid, we'll start by multiplying the number of popsicles by their individual cost. Since there are 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, we can find the total cost of the popsicles by multiplying 20 and 0.25. This results in 20 * 0.25 = $5.

Next, we'll calculate the total cost of the ice cream bars. With 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, we multiply 4 and 0.50 to get 4 * 0.50 = $2.

Now, we'll add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid. Adding $5 and $2 gives us $5 + $2 = $7.

"To find half the number of spots the snakes have combined, we'll start by determining the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2. 

Number of spots on a mamba = 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas. 

Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70 = 2800
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35 = 2100
Total spots on all snakes = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Finally, we'll find half the number of spots they all have combined by dividing the total spots by 2.

Half the number of spots = 4900 / 2 = 2450

"To determine the total number of people attending the soccer game, we need to calculate the number of team members, coaches, and guests. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15.

Since each team member brings 2 guests, we can multiply the number of team members by 2 to find the total number of guests: 12 * 2 = 24.

Now, we add the total number of team members, coaches, and guests to find the total number of people attending: 15 + 24 = 39.

Given that each pizza serves 3 people, we can divide the total number of people attending by 3 to find the number of pizzas needed: 39 ÷ 3 = 13.

Finally, we multiply the number of pizzas needed by the cost per pizza to find the total amount Maddy will spend: 13 * 15 = 195.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads, let's denote the number of beads as 'b'. We know that each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches. Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, and the total length of the necklace is 25 inches.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

8 (length of topaz gemstones) + (1/4)b (length of sterling silver beads) = 25 (total length of the necklace)

Combine like terms and solve for 'b':

8 + (1/4)b = 25

Subtract 8 from both sides:

(1/4)b = 17

Multiply both sides by 4 to isolate 'b':

b = 17 * 4
b = 68

"To calculate the total number of stories Alani and her siblings wrote, we first need to determine the number of stories each of them wrote in the first and second weeks.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. To find the total number of stories in the first week, we simply add these numbers together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of stories each of them wrote in the second week. Since they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week, we can multiply the first week's numbers by 2.

Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories in the second week.
Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories in the second week.
Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories in the second week.

The total number of stories in the second week is 40 + 80 + 120 = 240.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the total number of stories in the first and second weeks: 120 + 240 = 360.

"To determine the amount of money Kelly will have left after purchasing a can of pop for 55 cents, we must first calculate the total value of her coins. 

Kelly has 5 quarters, each valued at 25 cents. Therefore, the total value of her quarters is 5 x 25 = 125 cents. 
She also has 2 dimes, each valued at 10 cents. The total value of her dimes is 2 x 10 = 20 cents. 
Combining the values of her quarters and dimes, Kelly has a total of 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Now, we subtract the cost of the can of pop (55 cents) from Kelly's total amount of money (145 cents): 
145 - 55 = 90 cents.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. First, let's calculate the total number of stars in the rows of 8 stars and 6 stars.

The flag has 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. Additionally, there are 2 rows of 6 stars, which gives us 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

Now, we add the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows: 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has a total of 76 stars, we subtract the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows: 76 - 36 = 40.

Finally, we divide the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows: 40 / 5 = 8.

"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we must first calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, we can find the total weight by multiplying the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone.

Total weight of flagstones = Number of flagstones * Weight of each flagstone
Total weight of flagstones = 80 * 75
Total weight of flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck, which is 2000 pounds.

Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of each truck
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Therefore, the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip is 3."
"To determine the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first establish the speed of the car in the slow lane. Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance of 480 miles.

time = distance / speed
time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
time = 16 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of medals given out for counting as 'x'.

We know that Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It is given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This can be represented as:

39 = x - 10x

However, this equation doesn't accurately represent the relationship. A more accurate representation would be that the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. This can be represented as:

x = 10 * 39

However, this equation also doesn't accurately represent the relationship. A more accurate representation would be that Ali and Izzy have 1/10 of the total number of medals given out for counting. This can be represented as:

39 = (1/10)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 10:

x = 39 * 10

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps. First, we need to find the total number of chocolate bars available. Since there are 8 packets, each containing 5 chocolate bars, we multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars per packet: 8 * 5 = 40.

Next, we determine the total number of chocolate bars the adults will receive. With 4 adults getting 6 chocolate bars each, we multiply the number of adults by the number of chocolate bars per adult: 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

"To calculate Susan's earnings, we first need to determine her total working time. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a 3-hour period. However, she takes a 30-minute break, so we subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert her working time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes by 10 to find the number of 10-minute intervals:

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Finally, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and apply the conditions specified.

First, let's establish the initial points for each player:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which is 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Next, we need to consider the condition for the extra points in the fourth round: every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Based on this condition:
- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets 1 extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets 1 extra point.

Now, let's calculate the total points for each player after the extra points have been distributed:
- Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
- Jim: 18 points (no change)
- Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Finally, we need to find the total points for all three players after the extra points have been distributed. To do this, we simply add up the points for each player:

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and with 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day. 

With 5 members in the household, the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day. 

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week.

"To determine the annual driving expenses for John, we'll break down the calculation into several steps.

First, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year. Since John's workplace is 30 miles away, and he makes a round trip each day, the daily distance is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles. With 5 working days per week, the weekly distance is 60 miles * 5 = 300 miles. Given that John works 50 weeks a year, the total annual distance is 300 miles * 50 = 15,000 miles.

Next, we'll calculate the annual cost of the miles driven. With a charge of $2 per mile, the total annual cost for miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000.

In addition to the mileage cost, John also gives his driver a monthly bonus of $150. To find the annual bonus, we multiply the monthly bonus by 12: $150 * 12 = $1,800.

Finally, we add the annual mileage cost and the annual bonus to find the total annual driving expenses: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

"The arrangement of pages in a simple folding newspaper or tabloid follows a specific pattern. When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to analyze this pattern.

Notice that the pages are arranged in a way that the first and last pages (1 and 32) are on the back, the second and second-to-last pages (2 and 31) are on the front, and so on. This pattern suggests that the pages are paired in a way that requires a specific number of pieces of paper.

Let's consider the sequence of page numbers: 1, 2, ..., 32. When folded, the pages are paired as follows: (1, 32), (2, 31), (3, 30), ..., (16, 17). This pairing reveals that each piece of paper contains two pages, one on the front and one on the back.

Since there are 32 pages, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pairs, and thus the number of pieces of paper used.

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 2
= 32 / 2
= 16

However, this calculation assumes that each pair of pages requires a separate piece of paper. But in this case, the pages are arranged in a way that the front and back of each piece of paper are paired. This means that the 16 pairs of pages are actually printed on 8 pieces of paper, with each piece of paper containing two pairs of pages (front and back).

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left, we'll first calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half of her $50, we can find this amount by multiplying $50 by 0.5 (which is equivalent to dividing by 2). 

$50 * 0.5 = $25

She also spent $10 on rides, so the total amount spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$50 - $35 = $15

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Elise started with 250 books and has 50 unsold books left, so she sold a total of 250 - 50 = 200 books over the three years.

We also know that she sold 45 books in the current year and twice as many books in the first year, so she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

Let's denote the number of books sold in the second year as x. We can set up an equation based on the total number of books sold:

90 (first year) + x (second year) + 45 (current year) = 200 (total books sold)

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

135 + x = 200

Now, isolate x by subtracting 135 from both sides of the equation:

x = 200 - 135
x = 65

So, Elise sold 65 books in the second year. Since each book sells for 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:

65 * 20 = 1300

"To calculate Watson's total earnings for the month of April, we'll break it down into two parts: his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his weekly earnings from his hourly wage. Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, which is a total of 10 * 5 = 50 hours per week. Since he earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 50 * $10 = $500.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage for the month. Assuming a 4-week month, his total earnings from his hourly wage are $500 * 4 = $2000.

Moving on to his weekly bonus, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. With 4 weeks in the month, his total bonus is $300 * 4 = $1200.

To find Watson's total earnings for the month, we simply add his total earnings from his hourly wage and his total bonus: $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

"When dealing with percentages, it's essential to understand that the percentage represents a fraction of the whole. In this case, John beats 80% of the people he arm wrestles, which means he loses to the remaining 20%.

To find the number of people he lost to, we can calculate 20% of the total number of people he arm wrestled, which is 20.

20% of 20 = (20/100) * 20 = 4

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we'll calculate two-thirds of 60. 

Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 3 = 120 / 3 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total to find out how many are left: 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Next, we need to find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon. Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish a ratio between the time it takes Joey and Sandy to lose the same amount of weight. We know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week.

First, let's find out how much weight Joey loses in 4 weeks, which is given as 8 pounds. Since Joey loses this weight in 4 weeks, we can find his weekly weight loss by dividing the total weight loss by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week, which is 2 pounds. This means Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks (8 pounds), we can set up a proportion. If Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, she will lose 8 pounds in x weeks, where x is the number of weeks we're trying to find.

We can set up the proportion as follows: 2 pounds / 4 weeks = 8 pounds / x weeks.

Cross-multiplying, we get 2x = 8 * 4, which simplifies to 2x = 32.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 16.

"To calculate the total savings, we'll start by determining the savings from the ice cream. The original price of a tub of ice cream is $13, and the sale price is $11. By subtracting the sale price from the original price, we find the savings per tub: $13 - $11 = $2. 

Now, we multiply the savings per tub by the number of tubs purchased, which is 2. This gives us a total savings of 2 * $2 = $4 from the ice cream.

Next, we calculate the savings from the milk. Each packet of milk has a discount of $0.5. To find the total savings from the milk, we multiply the discount per packet by the number of packets purchased, which is 4. This results in a total savings of 4 * $0.5 = $2 from the milk.

Finally, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings: $4 + $2 = $6.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of times the 3-day and 5-day cycles occur within the 15-day period. 

First, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5. The LCM of 3 and 5 is 15, which means that every 15 days, both cycles will coincide.

In one 15-day cycle, the number of new arms will be 15 / 3 = 5, and the number of new legs will be 15 / 5 = 3.

Since 15 days is equal to one complete cycle, the total number of new limbs will be the sum of new arms and new legs, which is 5 + 3 = 8.

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract that from his total budget, then subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits at $100 each will be 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, we calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each will be 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that amount is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding the extra $700, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, we can calculate the total expenses: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Theo's total budget is $6000, and he wants to save $2000. To find out how much he has left to spend on gifts, we subtract his total expenses and the amount he wants to save from his total budget: $6000 - $1950 = $4050, then $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

"To calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we'll break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the daily egg consumption. Three family members eat 3 eggs each, resulting in a total of 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. The remaining two family members eat 2 eggs each, totaling 2 * 2 = 4 eggs. 

Now, we'll add these two amounts together to find the total daily egg consumption: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since the family eats eggs every day, we'll multiply the daily total by 7 to find the weekly consumption: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"Let's analyze the given information and represent it as a system of linear equations. We have three variables: Trent's age (T), Jane's age (J), and Quinn's age (Q). We are given the following information:

1. Trent is 5 years older than Jane: T = J + 5
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn: J = Q - 3
3. Quinn is 30 years old: Q = 30

We can use substitution to solve for Trent's age. First, substitute Q = 30 into the second equation to find Jane's age:

J = Q - 3
J = 30 - 3
J = 27

Now, substitute J = 27 into the first equation to find Trent's age:

T = J + 5
T = 27 + 5
T = 32

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and break it down into manageable steps.

First, we know that Cera is currently 46 years old. Six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship. Let N be Noah's age six years ago. We can write the equation as:

N = (1/2) * 40
N = 20

This tells us that Noah was 20 years old six years ago.

Now, we are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. We can set up another equation to represent this relationship. Let P be the population of Chile six years ago. We can write the equation as:

P = 3000 * 20
P = 60,000

This gives us the population of Chile six years ago.

Finally, we are told that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. We can set up an equation to represent this relationship. Let C be the current population of Chile. We can write the equation as:

60,000 = (1/2) * C
C = 60,000 * 2
C = 120,000

Therefore, the population of Chile now is 120,000.

Population of Chile now: 120,000"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the number of players on each team using variables. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. Given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. Since there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

"To determine the number of people attending Martha's party, we first need to calculate the total number of people invited. There are 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people.

The total number of people from the 2 families with 6 people is 2 * 6 = 12. 
The total number of people from the 3 families with 4 people is 3 * 4 = 12. 
So, the total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Now, we need to subtract the people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments. 
8 people couldn't come due to illness. 
Additionally, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. To find this number, we multiply 8 by 1/4, which is equivalent to 8 * 0.25 = 2.

The total number of people who couldn't come is 8 + 2 = 10. 
Finally, we subtract this number from the total number of people invited to find the number of people who show up for Martha's party: 24 - 10 = 14.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon initially had 50 marbles. He bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so now he has 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find 2/5 of 20, we multiply 20 by 2 and then divide by 5: (20 * 2) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8 marbles.

Now, Solomon has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kgs.

"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we first need to calculate its volume. The pool's dimensions are given as 6 feet in length, 4 feet in width, and 5 feet in depth. The formula for calculating the volume of a rectangular prism, such as this pool, is:

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Now that we have the volume, we can calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost is:

Cost = volume * cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * 0.1
Cost = 12

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and apply the concepts of ratios and proportions.

Let's start by identifying the number of boys in the classroom, which is given as 30. We are also told that the number of girls is 3 times the number of boys. This can be represented as a ratio of girls to boys: 3:1. To find the number of girls, we can multiply the number of boys by 3:

Number of girls = 3 × 30 = 90

Next, we are told that the number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys. This can be represented as a ratio of nongendered children to boys: 1:10. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10:

Number of nongendered children = 1/10 × 30 = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children in the classroom by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

Total children = 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123

"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This ratio can be expressed as a fraction, 1/3, where the numerator represents the number of electric poles and the denominator represents the number of electric wires.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. We can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1/3 = x/45

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 × 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to isolate x:

x = 45 ÷ 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of women who stayed at the party. 

First, let's calculate the total number of people who initially attended the party. There were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

We are told that 1/4 of the total number of people left the party. To find the number of people who left, we can calculate 1/4 of 40, which is (1/4) * 40 = 10 people.

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3. This means that the remaining 7 people who left must be women (10 total people left - 3 men = 7 women).

Now, we can find the number of women who stayed by subtracting the number of women who left from the initial number of women. The number of women who stayed is 15 - 7 = 8.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Since 2 pencils are loose, the 3 boxes contain 26 - 2 = 24 pencils.

Now, we need to find out how many pencils each box can hold. We can do this by dividing the number of pencils in the boxes (24) by the number of boxes (3). This gives us 24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box.

Next, we need to find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils, so together they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

Finally, we need to find the number of boxes needed to store all their pencils. We can do this by dividing the total number of pencils (72) by the number of pencils each box can hold (8). This gives us 72 / 8 = 9 boxes.

"To determine the total weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes required to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide the total cooling required (65 degrees) by the cooling effect of each ice cube (13 degrees) to find the number of ice cubes needed: 65 ÷ 13 = 5 ice cubes.

Next, we need to calculate the weakening effect of these 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so the total weakening due to the ice cubes is 5 × 12 = 60 milliliters.

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee. Since the added liquid also weakens the coffee, we can simply add the volume of cream (15 milliliters) to the weakening effect of the ice cubes (60 milliliters) to find the total weakening: 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the given information. We know that 5 people traded their old records for new ones, and the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.

Let x be the number of old records each person brought in. Since there are 5 people, the total number of old records is 5x.

We also know that the total number of new records is 7. Since the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1, we can set up the equation:

5x / 2 = 7

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

5x = 14

Now, we can divide both sides by 5:

x = 14/5
x = 2.8

However, since x represents the number of old records each person brought in, and it must be a whole number, we can multiply x by 5 to find the total number of old records:

Total old records = 5x

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. First, we'll find the number of junior programmers, then their total salary, followed by the number of senior programmers and their total salary.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * Total number of employees
= 2/5 * 100
= 40

Now, we know that the company has 100 employees, and 40 are junior programmers. To find the number of senior programmers, we subtract the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Next, we calculate the total salary of junior programmers. Since each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month, we multiply the number of junior programmers by their monthly salary:

Total salary of junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Monthly salary
= 40 * $2000
= $80,000

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly salary is $2000 + $400 = $2400. Now, we calculate the total salary of senior programmers:

Total salary of senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Monthly salary
= 60 * $2400
= $144,000

Finally, we find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month by adding the total salaries of junior and senior programmers:

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total salary of junior programmers + Total salary of senior programmers

Given the phone's charging rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time needed to charge the remaining 40% by multiplying the remaining percentage by the charging rate.

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

"To determine the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to calculate the rewards earned and the total discount applied.

First, let's calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip. The customer spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn a $1 reward. So, the number of rewards earned is $80 / $20 = 4. Since each reward is worth $1, the total rewards earned is 4 * $1 = $4.

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used their rewards, which gives them a $4 discount. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are worth $4, the coupon discount is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount applied is the sum of the rewards and the coupon discount, which is $4 + $8 = $12.

To find the amount the customer paid, we subtract the total discount from the original price: $43 - $12 = $31.

"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate, we need to carefully calculate the net income for each job, taking into account the various tax implications.

Let's start with Job A. The gross income is $15 per hour, and with 2000 hours worked per year, the total gross income is $30,000. However, we must consider the 20% total tax rate, which amounts to $6,000 in taxes. Therefore, the net income for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Now, let's analyze Job B. The gross income is $42,000 per year, but we need to subtract the $6,000 property tax, resulting in a net income before tax of $36,000. With a 10% tax rate applied to this amount, the taxes owed would be $3,600. Consequently, the net income for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Comparing the net incomes, it's clear that Job B offers a higher net pay rate. To determine the difference, we subtract the net income of Job A from that of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we'll start by calculating the amount required for 8 batches of suckers. Since each batch of suckers needs 30 ounces of sugar, we multiply 8 (the number of batches) by 30 (the amount of sugar per batch). This gives us 8 * 30 = 240 ounces of sugar.

Next, we calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge, which is 70 ounces.

Now, we add the amount of sugar needed for the suckers (240 ounces) to the amount needed for the fudge (70 ounces). This gives us a total of 240 + 70 = 310 ounces of sugar.

"To calculate the final value of Maria's shares, we'll apply the percentage changes to the initial value.

Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value is 8 * $8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we'll calculate 50% of the initial price and add it to the initial price. 
50% of $8 = 0.5 * $8 = $4
New price per share after the first year = $8 + $4 = $12
New total value after the first year = 8 * $12 = $96

In the second year, the price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we'll calculate 25% of the price after the first year and subtract it from that price.
25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
New price per share after the second year = $12 - $3 = $9
New total value after the second year = 8 * $9 = $72

Final value of all Maria's shares: $72"
"To solve this problem, we'll apply the principles of multiplication and subtraction. 

First, we know Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so we multiply Luke's hot dogs by 3 to find Thomas's total: 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

Next, John ate half the amount Thomas ate. To find John's total, we'll divide Thomas's hot dogs by 2: 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

Now, let's calculate the difference between John's and Luke's hot dog consumption by subtracting Luke's total from John's total: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide by 3:

x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

The smallest group has 60 students.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's use the variables c for the number of cows and h for the number of chickens.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
c + h = 60

We also know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write the equation:
h = 2c

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for c:
c + 2c = 60
Combine like terms:
3c = 60
Divide both sides by 3:
c = 20

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting c into the second equation:
h = 2(20)
h = 40

Now that we have the number of cows and chickens, we can calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs. 
Total legs = (number of cows * 4) + (number of chickens * 2)
Total legs = (20 * 4) + (40 * 2)
Total legs = 80 + 80
Total legs = 160

"To determine the number of balls Josh has when he starts juggling on stage, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball to his juggling act each week for 4 weeks. This means he adds a total of 4 balls to the initial 3.

3 (initial balls) + 4 (additional balls) = 7

So, Josh has 7 balls before the incident on stage. When he slips and drops 3 balls, he is left with:

7 - 3 = 4

However, 2 of the dropped balls are caught by the crowd, which means he gets those back. Therefore, the total number of balls Josh has when he starts juggling on stage is:

4 + 2 = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we can represent the weights of the animals using variables. Let's denote the weight of the pink frog as P, the blue beetle as B, the green toad as G, the yellow snake as Y, and the red bird as R.

We are given the following information:
1. P = B
2. P = G
3. P = Y - 10
4. P = R + 20
5. P = 50

From equations 1 and 2, we know that B = G = P = 50.

Using equation 3, we can find the weight of the yellow snake:
Y = P + 10
Y = 50 + 10
Y = 60

Using equation 4, we can find the weight of the red bird:
R = P - 20
R = 50 - 20
R = 30

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals and the container (which weighs 20 pounds):
Total weight = P + B + G + Y + R + container
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
Total weight = 260

"To determine the total distance covered by Tyson in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance. The coach's advice is to run 1/5 times more meters, which translates to a 20% increase. 

To find 20% of 5000 meters, we multiply 5000 by 0.20, which equals 1000 meters. Adding this to the original distance, we get 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day.

Since June has 30 days, we multiply the daily distance by 30 to find the total distance covered in June: 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

"To determine the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we need to first establish the prices of each. 

Juice Box A is 4 dollars. 
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so its price is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so its price is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we can calculate the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B by subtracting the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

"To calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we'll apply the fundamental principles of multiplication and addition.

First, we'll determine the number of legs for the tables with 4 legs. This is a straightforward multiplication problem: 40 tables multiplied by 4 legs per table, which equals 40 * 4 = 160 legs.

Next, we'll calculate the number of legs for the tables with 3 legs. Again, we'll use multiplication: 50 tables multiplied by 3 legs per table, resulting in 50 * 3 = 150 legs.

Now, we'll add the number of legs for both types of tables to find the total. This is a simple addition problem: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband, then subtract that from the total number of cookies in the bag.

First, let's calculate the cookies eaten by her son. Since he eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, we multiply the number of cookies per day by the number of days: 4 cookies/day * 5 days = 20 cookies.

Next, we calculate the cookies eaten by her husband. He eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so we multiply the number of cookies per day by the number of days: 1 cookie/day * 7 days = 7 cookies.

Now, we add the cookies eaten by her son and husband to find the total: 20 cookies + 7 cookies = 27 cookies.

Finally, we subtract the total cookies eaten by her son and husband from the total cookies in the bag: 36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies.

"To calculate the amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts, we first need to find the total cost before the discount. Since each shirt costs $30, we multiply the cost by 2.

2 shirts * $30/shirt = $60

Next, we calculate the discount amount by converting the discount percentage to a decimal (40% = 0.40) and multiplying it by the total cost.

Discount = $60 * 0.40 = $24

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Davos paid.

$60 - $24 = $36

"To determine the percentage increase in daily earnings, we need to calculate the difference in daily earnings and then divide it by the original daily earnings.

First, let's calculate the original daily earnings when the factory made tractors. They sold 10 tractors a day at $100 per tractor, resulting in daily earnings of:

10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

Now, let's calculate the current daily earnings from selling silos. They sell 5 silos a day at $220 per silo, resulting in daily earnings of:

5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

The difference in daily earnings is:

$1100 - $1000 = $100

To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the original daily earnings and multiply by 100:

Percentage increase = ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

The factory is now making 10% more per day than they did when they made tractors.

"To calculate the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we'll break it down step by step.

First, let's find the monthly cost of food. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly cost of food ($25) by 4. As a multiplication expert, I can tell you that 25 * 4 = 100. So, the monthly cost of food is $100.

Next, we add the monthly costs of treats ($20) and medicine ($100) to the monthly cost of food. Using my addition expertise, I get: $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220. This is the total monthly cost.

"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots required by the school and subtract that from the number she purchased.

First, let's calculate the total number of plant pots needed. The school requires 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. To find the number of plant pots needed for the roses, we multiply the number needed for the daisies by 2: 30 * 2 = 60. Now, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and roses: 30 + 60 = 90.

April purchased 100 plant pots. To find the number of plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number needed from the number purchased: 100 - 90 = 10.

"To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we need to first calculate the total time he spent on his vacation. We know that he spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. The total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

Additionally, he watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours. The total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours. Combining this with the time spent boating and swimming, we get a total of 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are given that this time accounts for 30% of his total time spent on vacation. To find the total time, we can set up the equation:
15 = 0.3x, where x is the total time spent.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:
x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

So, the total time spent on vacation is 50 hours.

Now, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing, which accounts for 40% of the total time:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20

"To determine how much Annabelle still needs to save for the phone, we'll calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add that to her initial savings.

Annabelle's first job pays $10 per hour, and she worked 20 hours, so her earnings from that job are 10 * 20 = $200. At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and worked 15 hours, resulting in earnings of 5 * 15 = $75.

Combining these earnings with her initial savings of $80, Annabelle's total savings are now 80 + 200 + 75 = $355.

Since the phone costs $400, we subtract Annabelle's total savings from the cost of the phone to find out how much more she needs to save: 400 - 355 = $45.

"To determine how much money Dean has left, we'll start by calculating the total cost of the toys he purchased. 

First, we'll find the total cost of the toy cars. Since each toy car costs $2 and Dean bought 6, we multiply the cost per toy car by the number of toy cars: 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, we'll find the total cost of the teddy bears. Each teddy bear costs $1, and Dean bought 5, so we multiply the cost per teddy bear by the number of teddy bears: 5 * $1 = $5.

Now, we add the total cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears to find the overall cost of the toys: $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. To find out how much money he has left after buying the toys, we subtract the total cost of the toys from the initial amount: $28 - $17 = $11.

Finally, Dean's mother gave him an extra $10, so we add this to the amount he had left: $11 + $10 = $21.

4 * 25 cents = 100 cents = $1

Now, let's subtract her daily expenditure from her daily pocket money to find her daily savings:

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, the total change he had must have been 2 * 2 = $4.

Now, we know Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is 10 - 4 = $6.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so to find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought, we'll divide the amount spent on candy by the cost per pound: 6 / 1.5 = 4.

"To determine the number of days the train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in one trip and then multiply it by the number of trips per day.

The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city and 100 miles from the second city to the third city. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles. Since the train makes 3 trips per day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find the number of days the train goes between services, we divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20

The train goes 20 days between services.

"To determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, we must first calculate the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. This is done by adding the amount of stuffing for both beds and dividing by 2. 

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. Therefore, the average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

For the chihuahua beds, we multiply the number of beds by the amount of stuffing per bed: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

For the collie beds, we multiply the number of beds by the amount of stuffing per bed: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Finally, we add the amount of stuffing needed for both types of beds to find the total: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To determine the total time of John's trip, we'll break it down into two segments: the trip to his friend's house and the return trip.

First, let's calculate the time taken to reach his friend's house. The total distance for this segment is 200 miles (initial distance) + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles. Given that John drives at a speed of 70 mph, we can use the formula Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken.

Time to friend's house = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

Next, we'll calculate the time taken for the return trip. The distance for this segment is 240 miles, and John's speed is 80 mph. Using the same formula, we get:

Time back home = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add the time taken for both segments to find the total time.

Total time = Time to friend's house + Time back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of people kicked out for other reasons as x. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, minus 5. This can be expressed as 4(3) - 5 = 7. 

Furthermore, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which is 3(7) = 21. 

We are given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + x (other reasons) = 50

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

31 + x = 50

x + 14 = 3(8)

Now, let's simplify the equation:

x + 14 = 24

To isolate x, we'll subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:

x = 24 - 14
x = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14.

"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we'll break down the costs into categories and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors, so the total cost of the frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to add the cost of etching the logo onto each frame. The etching cost is 20% of the frame's cost, which is 0.2 * $20 = $4 per frame. For 44 frames, the total etching cost is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the picture frames with etching: $880 (frames) + $176 (etching) = $1056.

Moving on to the pins, 2 seniors will receive pins at $5 each, so the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, we have the cords for the officers. 1/4 of the 44 seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 seniors. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep. Now, let's calculate the milk from each half.

The first half (15 sheep) yields 1 kg of milk per sheep. Using my expertise in multiplication, I can tell you that 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk.

The other half (15 sheep) yields 2 kg of milk per sheep. Again, applying my multiplication skills, I get 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk.

Now, let's add the milk from both halves. As an expert in addition, I can assure you that 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To determine the number of pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we'll start by calculating the number of rolls left after feeding her children. Since she began with a dozen, or 12, rolls and gave one to each of her 6 children, we can find the remaining rolls by subtracting the number of children from the total number of rolls: 12 - 6 = 6 rolls.

Now, we know that each of these remaining rolls was broken into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of remaining rolls by the number of pieces per roll: 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we'll break down the information step by step.

First, we know that half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in total, half of them would be 40 * 0.5 = 20 pupils who like blue.

The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we're told that one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. To find this, we'll calculate 20 * 0.25 = 5 pupils who like green.

Now, to find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils: 20 - 5 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we'll start by analyzing the information given. We know that Lucy sells apples at $4 per piece and that she sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56. We can use this information to find the number of apples picked on Monday.

Let's divide the total amount earned on Monday ($56) by the price per apple ($4) to find the number of apples sold:
56 ÷ 4 = 14 apples

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

Next, we're told that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. Then, on Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday. To find the number of apples picked on Wednesday, we'll multiply the number of apples picked on Tuesday by 2:
12 × 2 = 24 apples

Now, we'll add the number of apples picked each day to find the total number of apples picked over the three days:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed. Since she washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair contains 2 socks, the total number of socks in pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

In addition to the pairs, Lindsay also washed 15 loose socks. To find the total number of socks washed, we add the number of socks in pairs to the number of loose socks: 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Now, we subtract the total number of socks washed from the total number of socks that need washing to find the number of socks Lindsay has missed: 50 - 35 = 15.

"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we'll first calculate the total number of cookies she had initially. This can be done by adding the cookies she bought to the cookies Janet gave her.

Total cookies = Cookies bought + Cookies given
Total cookies = 23 + 42
Total cookies = 65

Next, we'll subtract the number of cookies her brother ate from the total number of cookies.

Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten
Cookies left = 65 - 44
Cookies left = 21

"To calculate the monthly payment, we'll first determine the total interest Karan owes. The interest can be calculated using the formula: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time. Since the interest rate is 10% per year, we'll convert the time period to years. Five months is equivalent to 5/12 years.

Interest = $3,650 * 10% * (5/12)
= $3,650 * 0.10 * 0.4167
= $152.08

Now, we'll add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan needs to pay.
Total amount = Principal + Interest
= $3,650 + $152.08
= $3,802.08

To find the monthly payment, we'll divide the total amount by the number of months.
Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
= $3,802.08 / 5
= $760.42

"To determine the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe, we must first calculate the distance each of them covered. 

Cho's distance can be calculated by multiplying the speed (14 km/h) by the time (8 hours). This is a straightforward application of the multiplication principle, where the product of the speed and time yields the distance. Thus, Cho's distance is 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km.

Similarly, Chloe's distance can be calculated by multiplying her speed (9 km/h) by her time (5 hours), resulting in 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km.

Now, to find the difference in their distances, we apply the subtraction principle. By subtracting Chloe's distance from Cho's distance, we get 112 km - 45 km = 67 km.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. To find the total number of pesos he has, we simply add these two amounts together: 50 + 80 = 130 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the number of pesos Anna has. We know she has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so we multiply Axel's silver pesos by 2: 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so we add 40 to Axel's gold pesos: 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos. To find Anna's total, we add her silver and gold pesos: 100 + 120 = 220 pesos.

Finally, we add the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have: 130 + 220 = 350.

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total revenue, total cost, and then divide her total profit by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups. Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be: 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18, so her total profit will be: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells 4 cups per hour, the total number of hours she spends running the stand is: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can calculate her profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation representing the situation. Let's denote the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had as x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can express this as an equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To isolate x, we need to get rid of the fraction (2/5) on the left side. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of (2/5), which is (5/2).

(5/2) * (2/5)x = (5/2) * 12.8

This simplifies to:

x = (5/2) * 12.8
x = 5 * 6.4
x = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we first need to find the number of female choir members. Since the choir has 52 members, with 50% being girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52
= 0.5 * 52
= 26

However, half of the female choir members couldn't make it to the show due to a bus breakdown. To find the number of girls who attended, we divide the total number of girls by 2:

Number of girls who attended = 26 / 2
= 13

The choir's 3 teachers also decided to sing with the girls. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the number of girls who attended and the number of teachers:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who attended + Number of teachers
= 13 + 3
= 16

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

First, let's calculate the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 * 66
To multiply a whole number by a fraction, we multiply the whole number by the numerator (1) and then divide by the denominator (3).
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1 * 66) / 3
= 66 / 3
= 22

Now, we can add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages.

Total number of messages = Number of messages to Ms. Thompson + Number of messages to Mr. Yu
= 66 + 22
When adding whole numbers, we simply combine the values.
Total number of messages = 88

"When dealing with ratios, it's essential to understand the relationship between the parts and the whole. In this case, the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.

To find the total number of parts, we add the parts of the ratio: 5 + 6 = 11. This total represents the entire distribution of popsicles between Betty and Sam.

Given that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can divide this total by the total parts to find the value of 1 part:
165 ÷ 11 = 15

Now that we know the value of 1 part, we can multiply this value by the number of parts each person has to find the total number of popsicles they each have. Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

"To determine the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services he's opting for. 

First, let's consider the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. Normally, each service costs $10 a month, but Tim saves 20% by bundling them. To find the discount, we calculate 20% of the combined cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

Now, subtract the discount from the original cost to find the bundled price of Hulu and Disney Plus:
$20 - $4 = $16

Next, add the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month, to find the total cost of the streaming services:
$16 + $10 = $26

Finally, subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package to find the amount of money saved:

"To determine the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to calculate the total time she spent on the song and then find the proportion of time spent editing.

First, let's break down the time spent on each task:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: Half of 4 hours, which is 2 hours
- Editing: 90 minutes, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours

Now, we can find the total time spent on the song by adding the time spent on each task:
Total time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we'll divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100:
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100 = 20%

"To determine the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica had initially. She made 20 cards herself, and her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, the total number of cards she had initially is:
20 (cards she made) + 2 * 15 (cards from her dad) = 20 + 30 = 50

Next, we'll calculate the total number of cards she passed out. She gave 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, for a total of:
24 + 5 = 29

Now, let's subtract the cards she passed out from the total cards she had initially:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark, then subtract that from the total number of slices and also subtract the slices Jenny ate.

First, let's find out how many slices Jenny gave to Bill. Since Bill received 1/3 of the pizza, we multiply 12 slices by 1/3. To do this, we can multiply 12 by the numerator (1) and divide by the denominator (3): 12 * 1 / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4 slices.

Next, let's find out how many slices Jenny gave to Mark. Since Mark received 1/4 of the pizza, we multiply 12 slices by 1/4. To do this, we can multiply 12 by the numerator (1) and divide by the denominator (4): 12 * 1 / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark: 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny also ate 2 slices. To find the total number of slices taken, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark to the slices Jenny ate: 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices taken from the total number of slices: 12 - 9 = 3 slices.

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully follow the order of operations and apply the given information step by step.

First, we know that Nancy saw 90 spiders. Then, we are told that the number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as spiders. To find the number of millipedes, we multiply the number of spiders by 1/3:

Number of millipedes = (1/3) * 90

= 30

Next, we are given that the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. To find the number of stink bugs, we multiply the number of millipedes by 2 and then subtract 12:

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12
= 60 - 12

"To solve this problem, we can set up a series of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote Alice's age as A, Beth's age as B, and Erica's age as E.

We know that Erica is 30 years old, so E = 30.

We also know that Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so B = E + 5. Substituting E = 30, we get B = 30 + 5 = 35.

Finally, we know that Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so A = B + 7. Substituting B = 35, we get A = 35 + 7 = 42.

Now, we need to find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, which is A - E = 42 - 30 = 12.

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we'll start by calculating the total amount of each ingredient required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour, so for a quadruple batch, Mark needs 3 * 4 = 12 cups of flour. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we can divide the total amount of flour needed by the amount in each bag: 12 ÷ 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Similarly, the normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk, so for a quadruple batch, Mark needs 1 * 4 = 4 cups of milk. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we can divide the total amount of milk needed by the amount in each bottle: 4 ÷ 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of cannolis as C and the initial number of corns as X. We are given that there is twice as much corn as cannolis, so we can write an equation:

X = 2C

We are also given that Allan has a total of 40 cannolis in his house, so C = 40. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

X = 2(40)
X = 80

So, Allan initially has 80 corns.

Now, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the total number of cannolis becomes:
C = 40 + 60
C = 100

He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, which means he bought:
X_new = 100 - 40
X_new = 60

The total number of corns now becomes:
X_total = 80 + 60
X_total = 140

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read the book and then add the travel time to the airport. 

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long, and it averages 200 words per page. So, the total number of words in the book is:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we'll calculate the time it takes Toby to read the book. Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find the time it takes him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, let's calculate the total amount paid to each employee in a month. The employees work 40 hours a week and are paid $15 per hour, so their weekly earnings are $15 * 40 = $600. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, their monthly earnings are $600 * 4 = $2400.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, so the total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. To find the number of employees who left, we calculate 1/4 of 40, which is 40 * 0.25 = 10. Therefore, the number of employees remaining in June is 40 - 10 = 30.

The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

Now, we can find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months by adding the total amount paid in May and June: $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent during her trip to the seashore.

First, let's analyze the taffy purchase. The offer is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs half of that, which is $3 * 0.5 = $1.50. The total cost of the 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we add the cost of the mixed bag of seashells, which is $1.50, and the cost of the 4 magnets. Since each magnet costs $0.25, we multiply the cost per magnet by the number of magnets: 4 * $0.25 = $1. The total cost of the magnets is $1.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items Sally purchased: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To calculate the total amount spent by Tim, we'll start by determining the cost of the fireworks packages. The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice that amount, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The combined cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200. Since Tim receives a 20% discount on these packages, we'll calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Subtracting the discount from the total cost of the packages gives us $1200 - $240 = $960. Finally, adding the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, we get $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we'll start by calculating her total cookie requirements for 30 days. Since she consumes 2 cookies per night, we multiply the number of cookies per night by the number of nights: 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies.

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies this corresponds to. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we'll divide the total number of cookies by 12: 60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen.

"To calculate the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events. Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of each event.

The probability of a candle exploding is 1% (since 99% are guaranteed not to explode), and the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 5% of the more dangerous candles (which are the ones that explode). 

First, let's find the probability of a candle both exploding and smelling like wet dog:
Probability of exploding = 1% = 0.01
Probability of smelling like wet dog given that it's a more dangerous candle = 5% = 0.05

Since the events are independent, we multiply the probabilities:
Probability of exploding and smelling like wet dog = 0.01 * 0.05 = 0.0005

Now, let's find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode:
Number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode = Probability of exploding and smelling like wet dog * Total number of candles
= 0.0005 * 50000
= 25

"To calculate the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to determine the discount amount for each blouse. Given that the regular price is $20 and the discount is 30%, we can find the discount amount by multiplying the regular price by the discount percentage.

Discount amount = 30% of $20
= 0.3 * $20
= $6

Now, we can find the discounted price of each blouse by subtracting the discount amount from the regular price.

Discounted price = Regular price - Discount amount
= $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we can find the total cost by multiplying the discounted price by the number of blouses.

Total cost = Discounted price * Number of blouses
= $14 * 4
= $56

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as x.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees (2 * 30 = 60 apples) and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees (3 * 15 = 45 apples). She doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Joanne's apples + Sister's apples = 500
(30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500

Combine like terms:

(45 + x) + 105 = 500

Combine constants:

150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

x = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.

We know that the total number of heads (or animals) is 180, so we can write the equation:
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Since there are 304 humps in total, we can write the equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now, we can substitute c = 124 into the first equation to find d:
124 + d = 180
d = 56

The number of dromedaries is 56."
"To calculate the total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip, we'll break down the information into manageable segments.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days. Since Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

Next, we need to find the distance traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. To calculate this, we'll find 30% of 800 km, which is 0.3 * 800 = 240 km.

On the 7th day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance covered on that day is 0 km.

Now, let's move on to the second week. Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, resulting in a total distance of 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

To find the total distance traveled during the two-week-long trip, we'll add up the distances: 
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratios to set up a series of proportional relationships. Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as T, Zack's locker as Z, and Peter's locker as P.

We know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so we can write the ratio as Z = (1/2)T or T = 2Z.

We also know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so we can write the ratio as P = (1/4)Z or Z = 4P.

Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can use the second ratio to find the size of Zack's locker: Z = 4P = 4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches.

Now, we can use the first ratio to find the size of Timothy's locker: T = 2Z = 2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches.

"To determine the distance Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to first establish the comb's current elevation. Since the comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's original elevation of 10,000 feet, we can calculate the comb's elevation as follows:

Comb's elevation = Stanley's original elevation - Distance the comb fell
Comb's elevation = 10,000 - 4,000
Comb's elevation = 6,000 feet

Now, to find the distance Oliver must climb, we subtract his current elevation from the comb's elevation:

Distance Oliver must climb = Comb's elevation - Oliver's current elevation
Distance Oliver must climb = 6,000 - 3,000
Distance Oliver must climb = 3,000 feet

"To determine Mr. Josue's current capital, we'll start by calculating the amount he received from the second bank. Since they gave him twice as much as the first bank, we'll multiply the first bank's contribution by 2. 

$4000 * 2 = $8000

Now, we'll add the amounts from both banks to find the total amount he received. 

$4000 + $8000 = $12000

Finally, we'll add this total to his initial capital of $5000.

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps. 

First, we need to find out how many cats were taken away by the boats. Since four boats came and each took 5 cats, we multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each took: 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats on the rock: 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, we're told that 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3 and then divide by 5: (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. To find the number of cats left on the rock, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the number of cats remaining after the boats left: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the time period into segments based on the varying rates.

First, let's calculate the cost for the introductory period of 6 months at $8 per month.
6 months * $8/month = $48

Next, we calculate the cost for the period at the normal rate of $12 per month. Since the introductory period is 6 months and the increased rate starts after 8 months of the normal rate, the normal rate period is 8 months.
8 months * $12/month = $96

Now, we need to find the remaining time at the increased rate of $14 per month. 2 years is equivalent to 24 months. Subtracting the introductory and normal rate periods from the total duration gives us the time at the increased rate.
24 months - 6 months - 8 months = 10 months
10 months * $14/month = $140

Finally, we add the costs of all three periods to find the total cost of 2 years of the service.
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation representing the relationship between the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as J and the original price of the tattered jeans as T. We know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can write an equation:

J = T - 6

We also know that Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the savings from the jogger jeans as Sj and the savings from the tattered jeans as St. We can write the following equations:

Sj = (1/3) * 6
St = 6 - Sj

Simplifying the first equation, we get:

Sj = 2

Now, we can find St:

St = 6 - 2
St = 4

We know that the sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and the sale price of the tattered jeans is $28. We can set up the following equations:

J - Sj = 22
T - St = 28

Substituting the values of Sj and St, we get:

J - 2 = 22
T - 4 = 28

Solving for J and T, we get:

J = 24
T = 32

Now, we can find the difference between the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans:

T - J = 32 - 24
T - J = 8

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, the answer will be negative.

"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we'll calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then add those capacities together.

First, we'll calculate the capacity of the buses. Since there are 4 buses, each with a capacity of 60 employees, we multiply 4 by 60, which equals 240 employees.

Next, we'll calculate the capacity of the minibuses. With 6 minibuses, each holding 30 employees, we multiply 6 by 30, resulting in 180 employees.

Lastly, we'll calculate the capacity of the minivans. There are 10 minivans, each with a capacity of 15 employees, so we multiply 10 by 15, which equals 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities of all the vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150. This equals 570.

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders separately.

First, let's consider the homemade feeders. Each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, which attract 20 birds each. So, the number of birds attracted by each homemade feeder is 20 + 10 = 30. Since Lillian built 3 homemade feeders, the total number of birds they attract is 3 * 30 = 90.

Next, we'll calculate the number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders. Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, and Lillian bought 3 of them. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

Now, we can find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see by adding the number of birds attracted by the homemade and store-bought feeders: 90 + 60 = 150.

"To calculate the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we'll start by determining the cost of each item. The bagel costs $4. 

The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which equals $1. Adding this to the cost of the bagel, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel. To find half of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.5, which equals $2.

Now, we add the cost of all items: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's say Kenny started with x Pokémon cards. Since he kept 1/3 of them, he sold 2/3x cards.

We know that he sold each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he made from selling his cards is 1.5 * (2/3x). We also know that he spent $100 on the ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so the total amount of money he made is $150.

We can set up the equation:

1.5 * (2/3x) = 150

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3/2 to eliminate the fraction:

1.5x = 150 * (3/2)
1.5x = 225

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.5 to solve for x:

x = 225 / 1.5
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 Pokémon cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. The caterer initially prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared for 18 guests to have two hotdogs each and 18 guests to have one hotdog each.

The total number of hotdogs prepared can be calculated as follows:
- 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs
- 18 guests * 1 hotdog/guest = 18 hotdogs
Total hotdogs prepared = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26. 

Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. Let's denote the number of letters in Indras' name as I and the number of letters in her sister's name as S.

We know that Indras has 6 letters in her name, so I = 6.

The problem states that her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. We can represent this as an equation:

S = (1/2)I + 4

Substituting the value of I, we get:

S = (1/2)(6) + 4
S = 3 + 4
S = 7

Now that we know the number of letters in both names, we can find the total number of letters by adding I and S:

Total letters = I + S
Total letters = 6 + 7
Total letters = 13

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

First, we know Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Prince Arthur slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. To find the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew, we multiply 100 by 3/4.

(3/4) * 100 = 75

So, Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons.

Next, Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. To find the number of dragons Prince Walter slew, we multiply 75 by 2.

2 * 75 = 150

Now, Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. To find the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we multiply 150 by 1/5.

"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed, we'll start by dividing the total amount of gas (15 gallons) by the number of containers (5). This yields 15 ÷ 5 = 3 gallons per container.

Since Josey requires 1/4 of a container, we'll multiply the amount in each container (3 gallons) by 1/4. This can be expressed as 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon.

Now, we'll convert 3/4 gallon to pints. Given that 1 gallon is equivalent to 8 pints, we can multiply 3/4 by 8. This results in (3/4) * 8 = 6 pints.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations with two variables: the number of bags of chips (c) and the number of candy bars (b). We know that chips cost 40 cents and candy bars cost 75 cents. George spent $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents, and had 1% of his money left, so he spent 99% of $5, or 495 cents.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total amount spent:

40c + 75b = 495

We also know that George bought 3 bags of chips, so we can substitute c = 3 into the equation:

40(3) + 75b = 495

Simplifying the equation, we get:

120 + 75b = 495

Subtracting 120 from both sides, we get:

75b = 375

Dividing both sides by 75, we get:

b = 5

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we'll start by determining the weight of each piece. Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces, we'll divide the total weight by the number of pieces. This is a classic division problem, and the solution is straightforward:

20 ounces ÷ 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece

Now, we know that Rory and her mom each have a piece, so they've consumed a total of 2 pieces. To find the weight of the eaten cake, we'll multiply the number of pieces eaten by the weight of each piece:

2 pieces × 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces

"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

First, we calculate the total cost of the onions. Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, we add the total cost of the onions and the total cost of the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients. $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Finally, we divide the total cost of the ingredients by the number of servings to find the cost per serving. The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the time it takes Wayne to get to the theater as W and the time it takes Bernadette as B. We know that B = 4W, since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's drive.

We are also given that W = 4 minutes. Substituting this value into the equation B = 4W, we get B = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she should leave earlier by the difference in their travel times plus the extra 5 minutes. This can be represented as B - W + 5.

Substituting the values of B and W, we get 16 - 4 + 5 = 17 minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, we can make the conversion as follows:

Length (in feet) = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Next, we can use the given area of 360 square feet to find the width of the room. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

Area = Length * Width

Rearranging this formula to solve for the width, we get:

Width = Area / Length
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

"To determine how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought. 

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, for a total of 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads. 
Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads, for a total of 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads.

Since each pack contains 20 beads, we multiply the number of packs by 20 to find the total number of beads:
Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads.
Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters. To do this, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number:

"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we'll break down the problem into two distinct phases: the temperature increase due to baking and the subsequent decrease after opening the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase from baking. The oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees per hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. The total temperature increase can be found by multiplying the rate of increase (5 degrees per hour) by the duration of baking (3 hours): 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees. Adding this increase to the initial temperature of 40 degrees, we get 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Next, we'll calculate the temperature decrease after opening the window. The house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, we can divide this time into three 10-minute intervals. The total temperature decrease is then 2 degrees * 3 intervals = 6 degrees. Subtracting this decrease from the temperature after baking (55 degrees), we find the final temperature: 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"To determine James' run time, we'll first calculate Jon's total time and then deduce James' time for the swim and bike ride.

Jon's total time is the sum of his swim, bike ride, and run: 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike ride) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, we'll calculate 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from his swim time. 10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. Therefore, James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon, so his bike ride time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Given that Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time: 180 - (36 + 85) = 180 - 121 = 59 minutes.

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. To find the length of Movie B, we simply add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C.

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can express this relationship as a fraction: 1/4. To find the length of Movie A, we multiply the length of Movie B by this fraction.

Movie A = (1/4) * Movie B
Movie A = (1/4) * 80 minutes
Movie A = 20 minutes

Next, we calculate the distance the horse runs using the formula distance = speed * time. Given the horse's speed is 32 miles per hour and the time is 0.5 hours, the distance is 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

Now, we find out how much hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, we multiply the distance (16 miles) by 0.5 bails per mile to get 16 * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay.

The cost of the hay is 8 bails * $3 per bail = $24.

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30. To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6.

"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she has and then divide that by the number of eggs needed per tray.

Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs, which is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, she has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass needs 5 eggs and each tray holds 5 glasses, the total number of eggs needed per tray is 5 * 5 = 25 eggs.

Now, let's divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per tray: 50 ÷ 25 = 2.

"To determine by how many points Joey is winning, we need to calculate the points for both Joey and Marcy after their turns.

First, let's calculate Joey's points: 214 (initial points) + 26 (points scored) = 240 points.

Next, let's calculate Marcy's points: 225 (initial points) + 10 (points scored) = 235 points.

Now, to find the difference, we subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points: 240 - 235 = 5.

"To determine the salesman's profit, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, so the revenue from this sale is:

17 sneakers * $20/sneaker = $340

Next, we'll calculate the revenue from the rest of the week. The salesman had 48 sneakers initially and sold 17 on Monday, leaving him with:

48 sneakers - 17 sneakers = 31 sneakers

These 31 sneakers were sold for $25 each, so the revenue from the rest of the week is:

31 sneakers * $25/sneaker = $775

Now, we'll find the total revenue by adding the revenue from Monday and the rest of the week:

$340 + $775 = $1115

The salesman's cost was $576 for the case of 48 sneakers. To find the profit, we'll subtract the cost from the total revenue:

$1115 - $576 = $539

"To determine the total number of colors of crayons Beatrice bought, we'll break down the problem into two parts: the packets with 8 pieces of colors each and the packets with 16 pieces of colors each.

First, let's calculate the total number of colors in the packets with 8 pieces each. Since there are 6 packets, we multiply 6 by 8, which gives us 6 × 8 = 48.

Next, we calculate the total number of colors in the packets with 16 pieces each. There are 4 packets, so we multiply 4 by 16, resulting in 4 × 16 = 64.

Now, we simply add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the regular price of popcorn as 'x'. We know that the super ticket option costs $20 + $1 = $21, and the regular ticket option costs $12 (ticket) + $3 (soda) + x (popcorn).

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket option is $21 - $2 = $19. We can set up an equation to represent this:

12 + 3 + x = 19

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

15 + x = 19

Subtract 15 from both sides to isolate x:

x = 4

The regular price of popcorn is $4.

"To solve this problem, we need to employ proportional reasoning and unit cost analysis. 

First, we establish the original cost per balloon by dividing the total cost of filling 20 balloons ($900) by the number of balloons (20). This yields a unit cost of $900 ÷ 20 = $45 per balloon.

Next, we account for the price increase of $20 per balloon, which brings the new unit cost to $45 + $20 = $65 per balloon.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price by multiplying the number of balloons (170) by the updated unit cost ($65). This results in a total cost of 170 × $65 = $11,050.

"To calculate the average speed of the car during the trip, we can use the concept of weighted averages. The car's speed is not constant throughout the trip, so we need to take into account the time spent at each speed.

Let's break it down:

- The car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles.
- The car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, covering a distance of 30 * 1 = 30 miles.

The total distance traveled is 120 + 30 = 150 miles, and the total time taken is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we can use the formula:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 150 miles / 3 hours
= 50 mph

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph.

"To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies she possesses after the trade.

Initially, Jenna has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, leaving her with 5 sapphires and acquiring 2 rubies.

Now, let's calculate the value of her jewels:
- The value of the 5 sapphires is 5 * $800 = $4000
- The value of the 2 rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400

To find the total value of her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and rubies: $4000 + $2400 = $6400

"The art of multiplication is a wondrous thing. Let's apply it to this delightful problem. We have Marin and Nancy, each enjoying 4 apples a day. To find the total number of apples they devour in 30 days, we must first determine their daily apple consumption.

Since Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, their combined daily total is 4 + 4 = 8 apples.

Now, we multiply this daily total by the number of days: 8 apples/day * 30 days. This is a classic multiplication problem, and the solution is straightforward.

8 * 30 = 240

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the volume of the raised beds. Each bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall, so the volume of each bed is 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet. 

Since there are 10 raised beds, the total volume is 32 cubic feet * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Given that each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, we can calculate the number of bags needed by dividing the total volume by the volume per bag: 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet = 160 bags.

Finally, with the cost of each bag being $12, the total cost is 160 bags * $12 = $1920.

"To calculate the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can find this by taking 60% of the number of red cards and adding it to the number of red cards.

Number of red cards = 15
Number of green cards = 15 + (60% of 15)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards. This is a simple application of set theory, where the number of elements in the union of two disjoint sets is the sum of the number of elements in each set.

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards.

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

First, we start with the initial 50 fairies Katelyn saw.

Next, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn, which is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. To find the total number of fairies after this point, we add the initial 50 fairies to the 25 that joined them: 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

Finally, 30 fairies flew away. To find the number of fairies remaining, we subtract 30 from the total of 75: 75 - 30 = 45.

"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

First, let's find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. Therefore, the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

Next, we'll find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100:

Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
= (7 / 20) * 100
= 0.35 * 100
= 35%

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we must first calculate the total weight of the feed. 

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds. 

He buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

The main diet of the horses consists of hay, and the farmer buys 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

To supplement the hay, the farmer buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds. The total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the feed by adding the weights of all the items: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the farm truck: 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Since 2 trips will be enough to carry 4500 pounds of feed, the farmer will need 2 trips.

"To calculate Grayson's earnings from recycling in a four-week month, we'll break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate her earnings from aluminum cans. Since she drinks 3 cans per week and each can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents. To find her monthly earnings from cans, we multiply this by 4: 6 * 4 = 24 cents.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from plastic bottles. She drinks 5 bottles per week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents, so her weekly earnings from bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents. To find her monthly earnings from bottles, we multiply this by 4: 15 * 4 = 60 cents.

Now, we add her monthly earnings from cans and bottles to find her total monthly earnings: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

"To determine the number of plants Shondra has, we'll start by calculating the number of plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can find 60% of 10.

60% of 10 = 0.6 * 10 = 6

Now, we add this 60% increase to Frederick's 10 plants to find Toni's total:
10 + 6 = 16

Toni has 16 plants. Given that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, we subtract 7 from Toni's total:
16 - 7 = 9

"To track Finley's position changes, we can use positive and negative integers. A positive integer represents moving ahead, while a negative integer represents falling behind.

Finley started in 1st place. We can represent her initial position as 1.

She fell back 5 spots, which we can represent as -5. Adding this to her initial position, we get 1 + (-5) = -4. Since we're tracking position, we'll convert this to a positive integer by adding 5 to the initial number of participants (100) and then taking the absolute value of the result: |100 + (-4)| = 96, but since we are looking for her position, we add 1 to the result and get 96 + 1 = 97, but that is not correct. We simply add 5 to the 1 and get 6.

She then moved ahead 2 spots, which we can represent as +2. Adding this to her current position, we get 6 + 2 = 8.

Next, she fell behind 3 spots, which we can represent as -3. Adding this to her current position, we get 8 + (-3) = 5.

Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot, which we can represent as +1. Adding this to her current position, we get 5 + 1 = 6.

"To determine the number of students Miss Maria has, we need to follow a series of steps. 

First, we calculate the total number of basketball cards by multiplying the number of decks by the number of cards in each deck: 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 cards.

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of cards in each box: 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 cards.

Now, we add the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards to find the overall number of cards Miss Maria has: 150 cards + 200 cards = 350 cards.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, we subtract this from the total number of cards to find the number of cards given to her students: 350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards.

Finally, we divide the total number of cards given to the students by the number of cards each student receives to find the number of students: 300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students.

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, let's identify the number of each laundry item per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforter: 1
- Pillow cases: Since there are twice as many pillow cases as sheets, we multiply the number of sheets by 2. So, 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
- Towels: There are twice as many towels as pillow cases. Multiply the number of pillow cases by 2: 4 * 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of laundry items per room by adding the quantities of each item:
2 (sheets) + 1 (comforter) + 4 (pillow cases) + 8 (towels) = 15

Finally, to find the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, multiply the total number of laundry items per room by the number of rooms:

- 5 pairs on Monday: 5 * 2 = 10 shoes
- 15 pairs on Wednesday: 15 * 2 = 30 shoes
- 30 pairs on Friday: 30 * 2 = 60 shoes

Now, let's add the shoes he received to his initial total:
200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps.

First, we need to find the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year. Since there are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils, we can calculate the total pencils as follows:

Total pencils = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

Next, we're told that after two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find the number of pencils used, we'll multiply the total pencils by 1/5:

Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils

Now, we need to find the number of pencils remaining after two months. We can do this by subtracting the pencils used from the total pencils:

Remaining pencils = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

Finally, we're told that at the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find the number of pencils left, we'll multiply the remaining pencils by 1/3:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. Since he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, the total number of cookies he gets is (x/2) + 2.

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:

(x/2) + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we first subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with 'x':

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. Given that it's three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight using the fraction 3/4.

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48

To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator (3) by the whole number (48) and keep the denominator (4) the same. Then, we simplify the result.

Weight of 2010 penny = (3 * 48) / 4

First, multiply 2 by 60: 2 * 60 = 120. 
Then, divide the result by 5: 120 / 5 = 24.

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he gave up $10 for each orange, the total amount he gave up is 24 * $10 = $240.

$240"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of Jillian's handbag as 'b' and the cost of her shoes as 's'. We know that her shoes cost $80, so s = 80.

The problem states that Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes. We can represent this as an equation:

b = 3s - 20

Substitute the value of s into the equation:

b = 3(80) - 20
b = 240 - 20
b = 220

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total hours James runs a week, we need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week and then divide that by his hourly running speed.

First, we multiply the miles James runs per day by the number of days he runs per week:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Now, we divide the total miles James runs per week by his hourly running speed to find the total hours he runs per week:
60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we'll calculate the daily oat consumption per horse. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, the daily consumption per horse is 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

Next, we'll find the total daily oat consumption for all four horses. With 4 horses consuming 10 pounds/day each, the total daily consumption is 10 pounds/day * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

Now, we'll calculate the total oat consumption for five days. The total consumption over this period is 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Finally, we'll determine the number of bags needed by dividing the total oat consumption by the weight of oats in one bag (50 pounds). The number of bags required is 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

"To find the number of girl Pomeranians Jana has, we'll apply the given fractions step by step.

First, we know Jana has 27 puppies, and two thirds of them are Pomeranians. To find the number of Pomeranians, we multiply 27 by 2/3. 

(2/3) * 27 = (2 * 27) / 3 
= 54 / 3 
= 18

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we're told that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we multiply the number of Pomeranians by 1/3.

(1/3) * 18 = (1 * 18) / 3 
= 18 / 3 
= 6

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"To calculate the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to add the temperatures and divide by the number of countries. 

The temperatures are -48 degrees Fahrenheit for Southlandia, 21 degrees Fahrenheit for Northlandia, and -3 degrees Fahrenheit for Midlandia. 

First, we add the temperatures: 
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

Now, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

"To determine the number of days it will take the child to save the remaining amount, we must first calculate the remaining amount needed. This is achieved by subtracting the child's current savings from the cost of the toy car.

Remaining amount = Cost of toy car - Child's savings
= $12 - $4
= $8

Now, we can find the number of days it will take to save the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by the child's daily savings.

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings

"To determine the number of eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the trays, we need to calculate the total number of eggs the trays can hold and subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

First, we multiply the number of trays by the number of eggs each tray can hold to find the total capacity of the trays. In this case, Jaime has 2 trays, and each tray can hold 24 eggs, so the total capacity is:
2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Now, we subtract the total capacity from the total number of eggs Jaime has:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

"To determine the total amount Sally spent, we'll first calculate the cost of the family-size pizza by multiplying the cost of the small pizza by 3. This is a classic example of multiplication in real-world application.

The cost of the small pizza is $8. Multiplying this by 3, we get:
$8 × 3 = $24

Now, we'll add the cost of the small pizza to the cost of the family-size pizza. This is a straightforward addition problem:
$8 (small pizza) + $24 (family-size pizza) = $32

"To determine the cost of each individual razor, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors after the discount and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free offer, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be:

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have a total of 8 razors. 

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor:

$2.00 ÷ 8 razors = $0.25 per razor

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

$0.25 * 100 = 25 cents

"To calculate the total height of the human pyramid, we need to add the heights of the girls in each level. 

The bottom level has 4 girls, each 64"" tall, so their total height is 4 * 64"" = 256"". 
The middle level has 3 girls, each 64"" tall, so their total height is 3 * 64"" = 192"". 
The top level has 2 girls, each 64"" tall, so their total height is 2 * 64"" = 128"". 
The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, add the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 636"" / 12 = 53 feet.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Angela's current age as 'A'. In four years, Angela's age will be A + 4, and this will be three times Brett's current age, which is 14.

We can write the equation as:
A + 4 = 3 * 14

Now, let's simplify the equation:
A + 4 = 42

To isolate 'A', we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:
A = 42 - 4
A = 38

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we'll break it down into two parts: the cost of morning rides and the cost of afternoon rides.

First, let's calculate the cost of morning rides. Since Paul drove in the morning for 14 days, and each morning ride costs $6, we multiply the number of days by the cost per ride: 14 days * $6/day = $84.

Next, we calculate the cost of afternoon rides. With 14 days of afternoon rides at $2 per ride, we multiply the number of days by the cost per ride: 14 days * $2/day = $28.

Now, we add the cost of morning rides and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent: $84 + $28 = $112.

"To determine the total number of oranges, we first calculate the number of oranges Ashley brought. Since she has 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box: 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so we add 20 to Ashley's total: 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Now, we find the combined total of oranges by adding Ashley's and Brianne's oranges: 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Given that one Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie: 120 ÷ 3 = 40 pies.

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up a linear equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want the costs to be equal, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for x by isolating the variable on one side of the equation. Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x

Next, divide both sides by 20 to solve for x:

x = 200 / 20
x = 10

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations with three variables. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B, the number of insects David found as D, and the number of insects Lily found as L.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43, so we can write the equation:
L + D + B = 43

We also know that Lily found 7 more insects than David, so we can write the equation:
L = D + 7

Finally, we know that David found half the number of insects that Bodhi found, so we can write the equation:
D = B/2

We can now solve this system of equations. First, we can substitute the expression for D from the third equation into the first equation:
L + (B/2) + B = 43

Next, we can substitute the expression for L from the second equation into this new equation:
(D + 7) + (B/2) + B = 43
((B/2) + 7) + (B/2) + B = 43

Combine like terms:
2B/2 + 7 = 43
B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
B = 36

Now that we know B, we can find D:
D = B/2
D = 36/2
D = 18

Now that we know D, we can find L:
L = D + 7
L = 18 + 7
L = 25

The number of insects Lily found is 25."
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the yards used by Mariah. Since she used 1/4 of a skein, we multiply 1/4 by the total yards in a skein, which is 364. This can be calculated as (1/4) * 364 = (1 * 364) / 4 = 364 / 4 = 91 yards.

Next, let's calculate the yards used by her grandma. Since she used 1/2 of a skein, we multiply 1/2 by the total yards in a skein, which is 364. This can be calculated as (1/2) * 364 = (1 * 364) / 2 = 364 / 2 = 182 yards.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma: 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards.

"The art of addition is a wondrous thing, and I'm delighted to apply my expertise to Cherrie's gift-giving conundrum. Let's break it down with precision.

First, we have 2 friends who desire 5 gifts each. A simple multiplication yields 2 × 5 = 10 gifts. Next, 3 friends wish for 2 gifts each, resulting in 3 × 2 = 6 gifts. Now, we add these two quantities together to find the total number of gifts for Cherrie's friends: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

However, Cherrie's generosity doesn't stop there. She decides to surprise her friends with 10 additional gifts. To find the grand total, we simply add these extra gifts to the previous total: 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a series of steps. Let's denote the width of the chair as C, the width of the rug as R, and the length of the couch as L.

We are given that the chair is 3 feet wide, so C = 3. We are also given that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so R = C + 5. Substituting the value of C, we get R = 3 + 5 = 8.

Next, we are given that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. We can express this as L = 2R + 2. Substituting the value of R, we get L = 2(8) + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18.

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations. Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 's'. We know that Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost of strawberry gum is 2s.

We also know that she bought one pack of grape gum for $2 and one pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1. The total cost of these two packs is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid $7 in all, we can set up the equation:

2s + 3 = 7

To solve for 's', we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2s = 7 - 3
2s = 4

Now, we can divide both sides by 2 to find the value of 's':

s = 4 / 2
s = 2

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, we need to allocate Frederick's budget of $24 optimally between the two types of wood. Let's analyze the cost-effectiveness of each option.

The 2 x 4 wood yields 200 sticks at a cost of $4, resulting in a cost per stick of $4/200 = $0.02 per stick. In contrast, the 2 x 8 wood provides 400 sticks at a cost of $6, leading to a cost per stick of $6/400 = $0.015 per stick.

Clearly, the 2 x 8 wood is the more cost-effective option. To determine the optimal allocation, we'll divide Frederick's budget by the cost of the 2 x 8 wood:

$24 / $6 = 4

This means Frederick can purchase 4 units of 2 x 8 wood. Since each unit yields 400 sticks, the total number of sticks he can produce is:

4 * 400 = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"

Now, we multiply the number of pairs per dog by the total number of dogs. In this case, 2 pairs/dog * 6 dogs = 12 pairs of snowshoes.

The final step is to multiply the total number of pairs by the cost per pair. With each pair costing $12.00, we have 12 pairs * $12/pair = $144.

2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

Now, let's calculate the total cost of these bus trips. Each trip costs $2.20, so we multiply the number of trips by the cost per trip:
10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To determine how much Janet would save by buying this pass, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips:

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and use it to determine the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo.

First, let's establish the number of cows at the zoo. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

Next, we'll determine the number of sheep at the farm. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep. Therefore, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at each location:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Let's analyze the quantities Rose bought: 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought, we can set up a proportion to find the number of onions Sophia bought:

Rose's onions = 4 × Sophia's onions
12 = 4 × Sophia's onions
Sophia's onions = 12 ÷ 4
Sophia's onions = 3

Similarly, since Rose bought 4 times the number of potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up another proportion:

Rose's potatoes = 4 × Sophia's potatoes
4 = 4 × Sophia's potatoes
Sophia's potatoes = 4 ÷ 4
Sophia's potatoes = 1

Now, we can find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by adding the quantities:

Total = Sophia's onions + Sophia's potatoes
Total = 3 + 1

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x' and the cost of the house as 'y'. We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation:

x + y = 120,000

We are also given that the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write another equation:

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the relationships between the rates at which each person can pick strawberries.

First, we know that Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. Since Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, we can calculate Bobby's rate by subtracting 1 from Tony's rate: 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Next, we're told that Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby. To find Kathy's rate, we multiply Bobby's rate by 2: 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.

Finally, Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy. We can calculate Ricky's rate by subtracting 2 from Kathy's rate: 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now that we have each person's rate, we can find the total number of quarts of strawberries they can pick per hour by adding their individual rates together: 6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29.

"To determine the number of loaves left, we'll start by calculating the total number of loaves sold. This involves adding the morning and afternoon sales.

Total loaves sold = 93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132

Next, we'll subtract the total loaves sold from the total loaves baked to find the number of loaves remaining before the return.

Loaves remaining before return = Total loaves baked - Total loaves sold
Loaves remaining before return = 200 - 132
Loaves remaining before return = 68

Finally, we'll add the returned loaves to the loaves remaining before the return to find the total number of loaves left.

Loaves left = Loaves remaining before return + Loaves returned
Loaves left = 68 + 6
Loaves left = 74

"To find the total number of rows, we need to determine how many rows of red tulips and blue tulips Jackson can plant.

For the red tulips, we divide the total number of tulips (36) by the number of tulips per row (6). Since 6 is a factor of 36, we can easily divide:
36 ÷ 6 = 6 rows of red tulips.

For the blue tulips, we divide the total number of tulips (24) by the number of tulips per row (8). Since 8 is a factor of 24, we can easily divide:
24 ÷ 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
6 rows (red) + 3 rows (blue) = 9 rows.

"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to find out how many cups of raisins she will use for the cookies. Since she is dividing the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, she will use 1/3 of the raisins for the cookies.

1/3 of 27 cups is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we can divide 9 by 3/4. To do this, we can multiply 9 by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3.

9 * 4/3 = 36/3 = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her energy consumption before and after adding the new device.

First, let's establish Ada's daily energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh). Her initial daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the hourly consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption:
12 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 288 kWh/day

After adding the new device, which consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, Ada's new daily consumption becomes:
(12 + 2) kWh/hour * 24 hours = 14 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 336 kWh/day

Now, we calculate the weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7:
Weekly consumption before: 288 kWh/day * 7 = 2016 kWh
Weekly consumption after: 336 kWh/day * 7 = 2352 kWh

Given the cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour, we can calculate the weekly cost:
Weekly cost before: 2016 kWh * $1.50 = $3024
Weekly cost after: 2352 kWh * $1.50 = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is the difference between the two weekly costs:
$3528 - $3024 = $504

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of work rates. Let's analyze the given information:

One person can paint half a house in 5 days. This means that one person's work rate is half a house in 5 days. To find the work rate per day, we can divide the work done by the time taken:

Work rate per day = (1/2) house / 5 days = 1/10 house per day

Since we want to find the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to find the combined work rate of 5 people. If one person's work rate is 1/10 house per day, then 5 people's work rate is:

Combined work rate = 5 * (1/10) house per day = 1/2 house per day

Now, we can use the combined work rate to find the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house:

Time = Total work / Combined work rate
= 1 house / (1/2) house per day
= 2 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert the time from days to hours:

Time (in hours) = 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'c' and the number of chairs Jenna has as '3c', since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.

We know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, and she has 20 sofas. So, we can write an equation for Ophelia's chairs: c = 20 + 2.

Solving for c, we get c = 22.

Now, we know Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs:
Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the cost of the headphone set. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as x. We know that the total cost of the CD and the headphone set is $48, and the cost of the CD is $4. We can set up the equation:

4 + x = 48

To find the value of x, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 48 - 4
x = 44

Now that we know the cost of the headphone set, we can determine how many CDs Tom could have bought with the same amount of money. Since each CD costs $4, we can divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of a CD:

Number of CDs = 44 / 4
Number of CDs = 11

However, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set. Since he already bought 1 CD, we can subtract 1 from the total number of CDs he could have bought:

Number of additional CDs = 11 - 1
Number of additional CDs = 10

"To calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to break down his workout routine into different time periods.

Josh worked out for 8 weeks, with a standard routine of 4 hours per week. However, there were exceptions. He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks and 6 hours in one week. Let's calculate the hours spent in each period.

First, we calculate the hours spent in the weeks with the standard 4-hour routine. Since there were 8 weeks in total, and 2 weeks with 5 hours and 1 week with 6 hours, the number of weeks with the standard routine is 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 weeks. The total hours spent in these 5 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

Next, we calculate the hours spent in the 2 weeks with 5 hours each. The total hours spent in these 2 weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Finally, we add the hours spent in the week with 6 hours, which is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, we add up the hours spent in all the weeks: 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

Total hours spent working out:

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 passengers.

At the same stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus. Now the total number of passengers is 40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80.

On the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers.

At the same stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer is 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get on the bus. Now the total number of passengers is 59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66.

The number of passengers after the second stop is 66."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote Jame's current age as J and his cousin's current age as C.

We know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22. This gives us the equation:

J = 22

We also know that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. In 8 years, Jame's age will be J + 8, and his cousin's age will be C + 8. This gives us the equation:

C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5

Substituting J = 22 into this equation, we get:

C + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5
C + 8 = 2(30) - 5
C + 8 = 60 - 5
C + 8 = 55

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

C = 47

Now, we can find the difference in their current ages:

Difference = C - J
= 47 - 22
= 25

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of one monitor as 'm' and the cost of the printer as 'p'. We know the cost of the computer is $1,100.

We are given that Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, so we can write an equation based on this information:
p = 1100 - 400
p = 700

We also know the total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. We can write another equation based on this information:
1100 + p + 2m = 2400

Now that we know the value of 'p', we can substitute it into the second equation:
1100 + 700 + 2m = 2400

Combine like terms:
1800 + 2m = 2400

Subtract 1800 from both sides:
2m = 600

Divide both sides by 2:
m = 300

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that there are 20 kids divided into two equal groups of boys and girls. This means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each. To find the total number of shells brought by the boys, we multiply the number of boys by the number of shells each boy brought: 10 * 60 = 600.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shells brought by the girls. The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be represented as: 
Total shells brought by girls = Total shells brought by boys + (4 * Total shells brought by boys)
Total shells brought by girls = 600 + (4 * 600)
Total shells brought by girls = 600 + 2400
Total shells brought by girls = 3000

Since there are 10 girls, we can find the number of seashells brought by each girl by dividing the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 
3000 / 10 = 300

We are also given that Nick had twice as many candies as George. Let's represent the number of candies Nick has as N. We can set up an equation based on the relationship between the number of candies Nick and George have:

N = 2 * (number of candies George has)
N = 2 * 8
N = 16

So, Nick has 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"The art of calculating ages. Let's break it down step by step. We know Chenny is 10 years old, and Alyana is 4 years younger. To find Alyana's age, we simply subtract 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4 years
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6 years

Now, we're told Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. To find Anne's age, we add 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2 years
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8 years

"To calculate the total thickness of the four books, we'll first determine the thickness of each book. 

The first book is 31 mm thick, and the second book is 50 mm thick. Since the third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, we subtract 5 from 50 to get 45 mm. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so we multiply 31 by 2 to get 62 mm.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together: 
31 + 50 = 81

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125. In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half in order to hit his target.

Let's assume Elvis saves 'x' dollars per day in the first half. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2x dollars per day in the second half.

April has 30 days. The first half of the month is 15 days, and the second half is also 15 days. The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half. The total savings should be equal to his target of $1125.

We can set up the equation as follows:

15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Combine like terms:
15x + 30x = 1125
45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So, Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2x = 2 * 25 = 50 dollars per day in the second half.

"This problem is a classic example of a geometric sequence. In a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant, known as the common ratio.

In this case, the common ratio is 3, since each family calls 3 other families. The first term is also 3, since Ali calls 3 families initially.

To find the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to find the fourth term of the sequence. The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:

an = ar^(n-1)

where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.

Plugging in the values, we get:

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during the 3 months and then add it to his final weight. Since we're dealing with multiplication of the weight lost per month and the number of months, let's start with that.

Weight lost per month: 10 pounds
Total months: 3
Total weight lost = Weight lost per month * Total months
Total weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day. We are given that when the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. 

Twice as long as 16 minutes is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes. Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim in hot water, we will assume that the time for warm water is the same as the time for hot water, which is 34 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. 

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes. So, 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Octavia's and Juan's coffee consumption. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, which is 4 cups. Therefore, Octavia drinks 4 / 2 = 2 cups.

The problem states that Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks. This can be represented as 10 * 2, where 2 is the number of cups Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks 10 * 2 = 20 cups.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current consumption and the recommended amount. This can be calculated as 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we'll first calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately, then add them together.

We have 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30. 

Next, we have 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 30 + 15 = 45.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first determine each of their weights. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so we subtract 20 from Mark's weight to find Susan's weight: 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Next, we find Bob's weight, which is twice as much as Susan's. We multiply Susan's weight by 2 to find Bob's weight: 130 * 2 = 260 pounds.

Now that we have the weights of all three friends, we can find the total weight by adding their individual weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

Finally, to find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3: 540 ÷ 3 = 180 pounds.

"To determine the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we must consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the angular velocity of the sun.

The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when viewed from Sahir's house. The sun is moving at a constant angular velocity of 5 degrees per hour, straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house. Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, we can calculate the additional angle it covers in 10 hours by multiplying the angular velocity by the time elapsed: 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.

Now, to find the total angle from the ground to the sun, we add the initial angle of the pyramid to the angle the sun has moved: 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.

"To determine the total number of candles James needs, we'll add the ages of his two sons. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. Now, let's add their ages: 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Next, we'll divide the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack to find out how many packs James needs: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Now, we'll multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total cost: 4 packs * $3/pack = $12.

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the total time Judy spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, the total time is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Given Judy's reading speed of 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate her reading rate as 2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 4/3 pages per minute. Now, we can find the number of pages she read in the first week by multiplying her reading rate by the total time:
105 minutes * (4/3 pages/minute) = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
140 pages + 100 pages = 240 pages.

"To determine the number of sandwiches left, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor. 

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 12 * (1/3) = 4 sandwiches. 
Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 12 * (1/4) = 3 sandwiches.

The total number of sandwiches eaten is 4 + 3 = 7. 

Now, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial number of sandwiches to find the number of sandwiches left: 
12 - 7 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation. Let's denote the nephew's current age as 'x'. In 7 years, Shiloh will be 51 years old, and he will be three times as old as his nephew at that time. 

Since the nephew's age in 7 years will be 'x + 7', we can set up the equation:
51 = 3(x + 7)

Now, let's solve for 'x'. First, distribute the 3 to the terms inside the parentheses:
51 = 3x + 21

Next, subtract 21 from both sides to isolate the term with 'x':
30 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for 'x':
x = 10

So, the nephew is 10 years old today.

"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the problem into its components and calculate each part separately.

First, Sharon received $5.00 for the first tooth she lost.

Next, she received $1.00 for each of the next three teeth, resulting in a total of 3 x $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that amount is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. Therefore, for the last two teeth, she received 2 x $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon by adding the amounts together: $5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00.

$9.00"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna as R, M, and A, respectively.

We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write an equation:
R = M + 20

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write another equation:
R = A + 45

We are given that Richie scored 80 goals, so we can substitute this value into the equations:
80 = M + 20
80 = A + 45

Now, we can solve for M and A:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we have the values of M and A, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding their individual scores:
Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate his daily expenditure and then find out how many action figures he can buy with that amount.

First, we'll find Peter's daily expenditure by dividing his total money by the number of days in a week. He has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for 7 days. 

$70 ÷ 7 days = $10 per day

Now, let's calculate the number of wooden action figures he can buy from Sunday through Wednesday. Each wooden action figure costs $5, and he spends $10 per day.

$10 per day ÷ $5 per action figure = 2 wooden action figures per day

Since he buys wooden action figures for 4 days, the total number of wooden action figures is:

2 wooden action figures per day × 4 days = 8 wooden action figures

Next, we'll calculate the number of plastic action figures he can buy from Thursday to Saturday. Each plastic action figure costs $2, and he spends $10 per day.

$10 per day ÷ $2 per action figure = 5 plastic action figures per day

Since he buys plastic action figures for 3 days, the total number of plastic action figures is:

5 plastic action figures per day × 3 days = 15 plastic action figures

Finally, we add the number of wooden and plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week:

8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures

"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total number of roses ordered per week by 4 to get the total number of roses ordered per month:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Next, we calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Now, let's subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month to find the shortage:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

"To determine the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. The food truck sells 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each, resulting in a total revenue of:

10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

Next, we'll calculate the total cost. The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost of bread per 10 sandwiches is $3.00. Additionally, the cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. The total cost is the sum of these two costs:

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
= $3.00 + $30.00
= $33.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $70.00 - $33.00
= $37.00

The net profit of the food truck is $37.00."
"To calculate the total amount of money Kate can make, we need to first determine the total number of crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes with 64 crayons in each, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box.

3 boxes * 64 crayons per box = 192 crayons

Now, we know that each muffin requires 8 small pieces of crayons. To find the total number of muffins Kate can make, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per muffin.

192 crayons ÷ 8 crayons per muffin = 24 muffins

Finally, we multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin to find the total amount of money Kate can make.

24 muffins * $1.50 per muffin = $36

"To accurately estimate the total cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom, we need to consider the costs of the carpet, padding, removal of the old carpet, and installation of the new carpet.

First, let's calculate the area of the bedroom. The room measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the total area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

Now, let's break down the costs:

- The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot. For 216 square feet, the total cost is 216 * $12 = $2592.
- The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot. For 216 square feet, the total cost is 216 * $2 = $432.
- The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot. For 216 square feet, the total cost is 216 * $4 = $864.
- The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot. For 216 square feet, the total cost is 216 * $34 = $7344.

To find the total cost, we add up the individual costs: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

"To evaluate the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). Let's denote the starting value as 'x'. The expression can be written as:

((x + x/2) / 5) * (x - 12)

Now, let's simplify the expression step by step:

1. Combine the terms inside the parentheses: (x + x/2) = (2x + x)/2 = 3x/2
2. Rewrite the expression: ((3x/2) / 5) * (x - 12)
3. Simplify the division: (3x/2) / 5 = (3x/2) * (1/5) = 3x/10
4. Rewrite the expression: (3x/10) * (x - 12)
5. Multiply the terms: (3x/10) * (x - 12) = (3x^2 - 36x)/10

Now, substitute the given starting value x = 20 into the expression:

(3(20)^2 - 36(20))/10

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we need to first find the percentage by which her oven is off. Given that the oven is set to 450 but the actual temperature is 468, we can calculate the percentage off as follows:

Percentage off = ((Actual temperature - Set temperature) / Set temperature) * 100
= ((468 - 450) / 450) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Now that we know the oven is off by 4%, we can set up an equation to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. Let x be the temperature she should set her oven to. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x), which should equal 520.

x + 0.04x = 520

Combine like terms:
1.04x = 520

Divide both sides by 1.04:
x = 500

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

"To determine the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we'll convert each movie's duration into minutes and then add them together.

First, let's convert the duration of the first movie. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, the total time for the first movie is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

Next, we'll convert the duration of the second movie. Converting the hours to minutes:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, the total time for the second movie is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, we'll add the time for both movies:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

"To determine the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value, which is $76,000. 

First, we find 30% of $76,000 by multiplying $76,000 by 0.3. 
$76,000 * 0.3 = $22,800

Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house.
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we can calculate the combined value of the two houses by adding the value of Herb's house to the value of Juan's house.
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We'll start by defining the variables. Let's say the number of cups Judy bought is C and the number of dishes she bought is D.

We know that Judy bought a dozen cups, so C = 12. We also know that she bought twice as many dishes as cups, so D = 2C. Substituting the value of C, we get D = 2 * 12 = 24.

Now, let's consider Judy's friend. We know that her friend brought 40 cups, but we don't know the exact number of dishes she brought. However, we do know that she brought 20 more dishes than Judy. So, the number of dishes her friend brought is D + 20 = 24 + 20 = 44.

Now, we can calculate the total number of utensils:

Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36
Her friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84
Total utensils: 36 + 84 = 120

"To determine the cost of each pair of contacts, we'll need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts, taking into account the 10% discount, and then divide it by the total number of contacts.

First, let's calculate the cost of 1 box after the discount:
Original price = $100.00
Discount = 10% of $100.00 = 0.10 * $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price per box = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Now, we'll find the total cost of 2 boxes:
Total cost = 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Since 1 box contains 90 contacts, 2 boxes will contain:
Total contacts = 90 * 2 = 180 contacts

Since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the total number of pairs is:
Total pairs = 180 contacts / 2 = 90 pairs

Now, we can calculate the cost of each pair of contacts by dividing the total cost by the total number of pairs:
Cost per pair = $180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00

"To determine how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their total earnings. 

First, let's calculate Jill's total hours worked. She worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours are 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate John's total hours worked. Since John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, we multiply Jill's Saturday hours by 2: 2 * 2 = 4 hours. On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill, so we multiply Jill's Sunday hours by 3: 3 * 1 = 3 hours. John's total hours are 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now that we have their total hours, we can calculate their earnings. They are paid $10 an hour, so Jill's earnings are 3 * $10 = $30 and John's earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, let's calculate the total calories burned during her workout. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics at 500 calories/hour, so the calories burned from aerobics are 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

Next, she spends 1 hour running at 600 calories/hour, so the calories burned from running are 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities to find the total calories burned: 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned, we'll divide the total calories burned by 200 to find the number of 200-calorie increments: 1600 calories / 200 calories = 8 increments.

Finally, we multiply the number of increments by the amount of water needed per increment (100 ml) to find the total amount of water needed: 8 increments * 100 ml/increment = 800 ml.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B. Since the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B. The jar also contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide by 3:

B = 1500

Now we can find the number of red jelly beans (0.99B) and the number of green jelly beans (1.01B):

Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:

To find the average, we add the three measurements together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156. Then, we divide the sum by the number of measurements, which is 3.

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3

"To determine the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over the specified period.

First, let's consider the Cheerios option. Since Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week, the total weight loss over 5 weeks is 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

Now, let's consider the donuts option. Since Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week, the total weight gain over 5 weeks is 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

To find the difference in weight between the two options, we subtract the weight loss from the weight gain: 8.75 - (-6.25) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we can model the height of the beanstalk using an exponential function. Let's denote the initial height as 'a' (4 feet) and the growth factor as 'r' (2, since the height doubles every day). The height of the beanstalk on day 'n' can be represented as:

h(n) = a * r^n

We want to find the smallest value of 'n' for which h(n) > 20 feet (the height of Mark's window).

Substituting the given values, we get:

h(n) = 4 * 2^n > 20

Now, we can solve for 'n' by trial and error or by using logarithms. However, since the growth factor is 2, we can easily try different values of 'n' to find the solution.

For n = 1, h(1) = 4 * 2^1 = 8 feet (too short)
For n = 2, h(2) = 4 * 2^2 = 16 feet (still too short)
For n = 3, h(3) = 4 * 2^3 = 32 feet (taller than the window)

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, but since the beanstalk is 16 feet on the 3rd day and 32 feet on the 4th day, the correct answer is 4 days.

The ratio of protein to mushroom weight is 3 grams of protein per 100 grams of mushrooms. To find the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms, we can multiply this ratio by 2, as 200 grams is twice 100 grams.

3 grams/100 grams * 2 = 6 grams of protein per 200 grams of mushrooms

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms daily, he consumes 6 grams of protein per day. To calculate his weekly protein intake, we multiply his daily intake by 7.

6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week

"To solve this problem, we can start by letting 'x' represent Jerry's current age. The given information states that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. We can express this as an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

This equation represents the relationship between Jerry's current age and his age 5 years ago. To solve for 'x', we can start by distributing the 2 on the right side of the equation:

x = 2x - 10

Next, we can subtract 'x' from both sides of the equation to isolate the variable term on one side:

-x + x = 2x - x - 10
0 = x - 10

Now, we can add 10 to both sides of the equation to solve for 'x':

0 + 10 = x - 10 + 10
10 = x

This tells us that Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find his age in 3 years, we simply add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to pay for the dental work, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the total cost of the implants. Since George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000, the total cost for the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

Next, we add the cost of the porcelain crown, which is $500, to the total cost of the implants. This gives us $4000 + $500 = $4500.

Now, we subtract the deposit George has already made, $600, from the total cost. This leaves us with $4500 - $600 = $3900 still to be paid.

Finally, to find out how many hours George needs to work to cover the remaining cost, we divide the amount he still owes by his hourly wage of $15. This gives us $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

Since we are looking for the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we can see that 3x is the largest angle.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine the number of gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total value of his coins. 

First, let's evaluate the quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, we multiply the number of quarters by its value: 8 * 25 = 200 cents.

Next, we assess the dimes. With each dime valued at 10 cents, we multiply the number of dimes by its value: 6 * 10 = 60 cents.

Moving on to the nickels, each nickel is worth 5 cents. We multiply the number of nickels by its value: 14 * 5 = 70 cents.

Lastly, we consider the pennies. Since each penny is worth 1 cent, we multiply the number of pennies by its value: 15 * 1 = 15 cents.

Now, we add the values of all the coins to find the total amount of money Colby has: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Given that each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many Colby can buy: 345 / 5 = 69.

"To calculate the total number of legs of the pets in the store, we'll apply the principles of multiplication and addition.

First, we'll calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet by multiplying the number of pets by the number of legs each pet has. 

Dogs have 4 legs each, and there are 5 dogs, so the total number of legs for dogs is 5 * 4 = 20.
Cats have 4 legs each, and there are 2 cats, so the total number of legs for cats is 2 * 4 = 8.
Birds have 2 legs each, and there are 10 birds, so the total number of legs for birds is 10 * 2 = 20.

Now, we'll add the total number of legs for each type of pet: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

"To determine the weight Jamaal now uses, we'll first calculate the 50% increase. A 50% increase is equivalent to multiplying the original weight by 1.5. 

Original weight: 8 pounds
Increased weight: 8 pounds * 1.5 = 12 pounds

However, Jamaal finds this weight too heavy and decides to use a weight 2 pounds lighter. To find the new weight, we subtract 2 pounds from the increased weight.

New weight: 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

"To calculate the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we'll break down the problem into manageable parts.

Initially, Steve receives 5 games with his console on his birthday. Each year, he also receives 5 games for Christmas. So, over 3 years, he gets 5 (birthday) + 5 * 3 (Christmas) = 20 games.

Now, let's calculate the number of games Steve buys each year. In the first year, he buys 1 game per month, resulting in 12 games. In the second year, he buys 2 games per month, totaling 24 games. In the third year, he buys 4 games per month, which equals 48 games. The total number of games Steve buys is 12 + 24 + 48 = 84 games.

To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we add the games he received as gifts to the games he bought: 84 (bought) + 20 (gifts) = 104 games.

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of unit rates. The plane's speed is the unit rate at which it covers distance. We can calculate this rate by dividing the distance traveled (1200 miles) by the time taken (3 hours).

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now that we know the plane's speed, we can use it to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles. We can set up a proportion to relate the distance and time:

Distance / Speed = Time
2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = Time
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine Ruiz's hourly rate of chocolate production. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, we divide the total amount by the time to find the rate: 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.

Next, we calculate Marissa's hourly rate, which is 3/4 times Ruiz's rate over two hours. However, since we already have Ruiz's hourly rate, we can directly compare it to find Marissa's rate. Marissa's rate is 3/4 * 60 pounds per hour = 45 pounds per hour.

Now that we have both rates, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. Ruiz's total production is 60 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds. Marissa's total production is 45 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260.

"The art of multiplication and subtraction. Let's break down Howard's arcade expenses with precision.

On Monday, Howard spent a modest $8. The following day, his expenses doubled, which means we multiply the initial amount by 2. This results in 2 × $8 = $16 spent on Tuesday.

Now, Wednesday's expenses are where things get interesting. We're told he spent 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday. To calculate this, we multiply Tuesday's expenses by 4, yielding 4 × $16 = $64.

To find the total amount spent, we add the expenses from each day: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Initially, Howard had $100. To determine how much he has left, we subtract his total expenses from the initial amount: $100 - $88 = $12.

"To calculate Patrick's total earnings from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first 4 hours and the earnings from the next 2 hours.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the first 4 hours. Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup. To find the total number of cups sold in 4 hours, we multiply the number of cups sold per hour by the number of hours: 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups. Now, we multiply the total number of cups by the price per cup: 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next 2 hours. Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup. To find the total number of cups sold in 2 hours, we multiply the number of cups sold per hour by the number of hours: 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups. Now, we multiply the total number of cups by the price per cup: 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

Finally, we add the earnings from the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours to find the total earnings: $30 + $12 = $42.

"To determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can set up a proportion to relate the given information. We know that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles per month.

First, let's find the number of rotations per mile:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations/mile

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles per month, we can multiply this by 12 to find the miles driven per year:

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Now, we can multiply the miles driven per year by the rotations per mile to find the rotations per year:

4800 miles/year * 362.5 rotations/mile = 1,740,000 rotations/year

We are given that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can divide the total number of rotations by the rotations per year:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

"To determine the cost of each pump, we first need to establish the total number of pumps in the bottle. Given that 2 pumps yield 120 washings, we can infer that 1 pump yields 120 / 2 = 60 washings. However, this information isn't directly necessary for our calculation.

The crucial piece of information is that 2 pumps give 120 washings. Since we're interested in the cost per pump, we can simply divide the total number of washings by 2 to find the number of washings per pump, but what we really need is the total number of pumps. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and we want to know the cost per pump, we can simply consider the total number of pumps as 120 * 2 = 240 pumps (this is the total number of pumps if you were to use 2 pumps per wash for 120 washings).

Now, we can proceed to calculate the cost per pump. The cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents. 

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = 2400 cents / 240 pumps
Cost per pump = 10 cents

"To calculate the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase, we first need to determine the total cost of the outfit before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Next, we calculate the discount amount. Since there is a 30% off sale, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage: 0.3 * $60 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost: $60 - $18 = $42.

Finally, we subtract the final cost from the initial $50 to find out how much money Joe will have left: $50 - $42 = $8.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two phases: the initial 5 months and the remaining months.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000. This can be expressed as a monthly funding of $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months. The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial monthly funding, which is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the remaining months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

To find the total cost of the research, we add the initial funding to the cost of the remaining months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"To calculate the total cost of water for Gary's laundry in a year, we'll break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year. Since he does laundry twice a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year:

2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year

Next, we calculate the total amount of water used in a year. Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so we multiply the number of loads per year by the amount of water per load:

104 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year

Now, we need to convert the total amount of water used from gallons to a cost. Since each gallon of water costs $0.15, we multiply the total amount of water used by the cost per gallon:

"To calculate the total number of cars towed that week, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the number of cars towed in the first three days and the number of cars towed in the remaining days.

First, let's consider the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars per day for 3 days, resulting in a total of 10 * 3 = 30 cars.

Next, we'll calculate the number of cars towed in the remaining days. Since there are 7 days in a week, the remaining days would be 7 - 3 = 4 days. The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day during this period, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the remaining days is 6 * 4 = 24 cars.

"To determine the number of years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to establish the height difference between his current height and the required height. The required height is 4 feet, which is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Given that Adam's current height is 40 inches, we can calculate the height difference as follows:
48 (required height) - 40 (current height) = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can set up a proportion to find the number of years it will take for him to grow 8 inches:
8 inches / 2 inches/year = x years

Solving for x, we get:
x = 8 / 2
x = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To calculate James' commission, we need to determine the profit made by the company on each car and then find the total profit. 

First, let's calculate the cost price of each car. The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire the cars. Given the selling price is $25,000, the cost price is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500.

Next, we calculate the profit on each car by subtracting the cost price from the selling price: $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

We are given that the price of the diamond jewel is $2000, so we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the price of the gold jewel:
G = (4/5)(2000)
G = 1600

Now, we can substitute the value of G into the second equation to find the price of the silver jewel:
S = 1600 - 400
S = 1200

Finally, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
Total price = D + G + S
Total price = 2000 + 1600 + 1200
Total price = 4800

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step. 

First, we know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. Next, we're told he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, to find the number of truck stamps, we add 3 to the number of snowflake stamps:
Number of truck stamps = 16 + 3 = 19

Now, we're given that Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. To find the number of rose stamps, we subtract 9 from the number of truck stamps:
Number of rose stamps = 19 - 9 = 10

Finally, we add the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps:
Total number of stamps = 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of relative speed. Since Bob and Tom are moving in the same direction, we'll subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed to find the rate at which Tom is catching up.

Let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up as 't' hours. In this time, Tom will cover a distance of 70t miles, and Bob will cover a distance of 55t miles. Since Tom needs to cover the initial 75-mile gap, we can set up the equation:

70t = 55t + 75

Now, let's solve for 't':

70t - 55t = 75
15t = 75
t = 75 / 15
t = 5

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. We know that Naomi caught 17 fish, and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi. To find Darren's catch, we subtract 6 from Naomi's catch.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find Tommy's catch. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we add 3 to Darren's catch.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss, we need to establish the threshold at which the cost per class exceeds $10. Given that the total cost of the classes is $60 and there are 10 classes in total, we can calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can attend before the cost per class surpasses the $10 limit.

First, let's calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can attend within the $10 per class limit:
Maximum number of classes = Total cost / Maximum cost per class
Maximum number of classes = $60 / $10
Maximum number of classes = 6

Since Manny can attend a maximum of 6 classes within the $10 per class limit, we can now calculate the number of classes he can miss:
Number of classes he can miss = Total number of classes - Maximum number of classes
Number of classes he can miss = 10 - 6
Number of classes he can miss = 4

"To solve this problem, we can start by establishing the ratio of Julie's processing speed to Jewel's processing speed. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, the ratio of Julie's speed to Jewel's speed is 2:1.

Given that Jewel processes 50 customers daily, we can use the ratio to find Julie's daily production. Since Julie is twice as fast, she processes twice as many customers as Jewel. Therefore, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

Now, we can find the total daily production by adding Julie's and Jewel's daily production: 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the total daily production by 7 (the number of days in a week): 150 * 7 = 1050.

"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables. Let's say Lynn ran x miles. We know that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles. So, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. This can be represented as an equation:

Reggie's miles = Lynn's miles + 3 miles
20 = x + 3

To find the value of x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 3
x = 17

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the cost of one apple as A and the cost of one orange as O.

We know that four apples cost $5.20, so we can write the equation:
4A = 5.20

We also know that three oranges cost $3.30, so we can write the equation:
3O = 3.30

To find the cost of one apple (A) and one orange (O), we can solve these equations by dividing both sides of each equation by the respective coefficient.

A = 5.20 / 4
A = 1.30

O = 3.30 / 3
O = 1.10

Now that we have the cost of one apple and one orange, we can find the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges by multiplying the cost of each item by the respective quantity and adding them together.

Total cost = 5A + 5O
= 5(1.30) + 5(1.10)
= 6.50 + 5.50
= 12.00

"To determine the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to calculate the volume of the hole and then multiply it by the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot of earth.

The volume of a rectangular prism, such as the hole in this case, is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth. Given the dimensions of the hole (6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep), we can calculate the volume as follows:

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we know that Bob can shovel a cubic foot of earth in 3 seconds. To find the total time it will take him to dig the hole, we multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot of earth:

Time = volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

First, we start with the base price of the truck, which is $30,000. The king cab upgrade costs an additional $7,500. 

Next, we calculate the cost of the leather seats, which is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade. To find one-third of $7,500, we divide $7,500 by 3: $7,500 ÷ 3 = $2,500.

The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats. To find the cost of the running boards, we subtract $500 from $2,500: $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500. 

Now, we add the costs of all the features to the base price: 
$30,000 + $7,500 = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck, excluding the towing package, is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to find 5% of his current salary and add it to his current salary.

5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Since the bonus is half a month's salary, the bonus will be:
Bonus = $21,000 / 2 = $10,500

Total income for the year = ($21,000 * 12) + $10,500
Total income for the year = $252,000 + $10,500

"To determine the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we'll break down the calculation into manageable steps.

First, we'll calculate the cost of the suits. Since James buys 10 suits at $750 each, the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7,500.

Next, we'll find the cost of the dress pants. Given that the dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit, we can calculate the cost of one pair of dress pants as $750 / 5 = $150. Since James buys 10 pairs, the total cost of the dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1,500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits, so he buys a total of 3 * 10 = 30 dress shirts. At $60 per shirt, the total cost of the dress shirts is 30 * $60 = $1,800.

Finally, we'll add the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts to find the total cost: $7,500 + $1,500 + $1,800 = $10,800.

"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we'll start by determining the monthly output of each website. 

The news website publishes 20 articles daily, so in 28 days, it will publish 20 * 28 = 560 articles. This is a straightforward multiplication problem, where we're essentially adding 20 together 28 times.

The sister company publishes 10 articles daily, so in 28 days, it will publish 10 * 28 = 280 articles. Again, this is a basic multiplication problem, where we're adding 10 together 28 times.

Now, to find the combined total, we simply add the monthly output of both websites: 560 + 280. When adding these numbers, it's helpful to line them up and add the hundreds and tens places separately. In this case, 560 + 280 = 840.

"To calculate the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we'll apply the fundamental principles of multiplication and addition.

First, we'll determine the distance each of them covered. Since distance equals speed multiplied by time, we can calculate their individual distances as follows:

Alisa's distance = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 12 * 4.5 = 54 miles

Stanley's distance = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 10 * 2.5 = 25 miles

Now, we'll add their distances to find the total miles biked. This is a straightforward addition problem:

Total miles biked = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

"To determine the time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time spent digging through soil and clay separately, then sum those times.

First, let's calculate the time spent digging through soil. Bill's rate through soil is 4 feet/hour, and he needs to dig 24 feet. We can use the formula: time = distance / rate. 

Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Next, we'll calculate the time spent digging through clay. Since Bill digs half as fast through clay, his rate is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

Now, we add the time spent digging through soil and clay to find the total time.

Total time to dig the well = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know Fishio received 2000 likes initially. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. To find the number of likes after 4 weeks, we multiply the initial number of likes by 70.

2000 * 70 = 140000

However, this is 70 times the initial number of likes, not the total number of likes after 4 weeks. To find the total number of likes after 4 weeks, we need to add the initial number of likes to the result.

140000 + 2000 = 142000

Now, we are told that Fishio received 20000 more new likes recently. To find the total number of likes, we add these new likes to the total number of likes after 4 weeks.

"To determine the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day.

First, let's consider Clara's purchase on Tuesday. She bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, resulting in a total cost of 20 * $20 = $400. After applying the $2 discount, her final price is $400 - $2 = $398.

Now, let's analyze Sheila's purchase the next day. The price per pomegranate increased to $30, and she bought 20 pomegranates. The total cost would be 20 * $30 = $600. However, the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. To calculate the discount, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage: 0.1 * $600 = $60. Therefore, the final price Sheila paid is $600 - $60 = $540.

To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we subtract Clara's final price from Sheila's final price: $540 - $398 = $142.

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps. First, we need to find the total sales from green hats. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount earned from selling green hats, we can set up a simple equation.

Let's denote the sales from green hats as G. We know that the sales from red hats are $400, which is half of G. So, we can write:

400 = 1/2 * G
To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:
G = 400 * 2
G = 800

Now that we have the sales from green hats, we can find the total sales for the first month by adding the sales from red hats and green hats:
Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales for the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales for the first month = 1200

Next, we need to find the total sales for the second month, which were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To do this, we multiply the total sales for the first month by 3/4:
Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * Total sales for the first month
Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales for the second month = 900

Finally, we find the total amount Ariadne made in two months by adding the total sales for the first and second months:
Total amount she made in two months = Total sales for the first month + Total sales for the second month
Total amount she made in two months = 1200 + 900
Total amount she made in two months = 2100

Now, we know that 1 egg makes 2 deviled egg halves. To find the number of eggs needed, we can divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2, which is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal of 2 (1/2).

48 deviled egg halves * (1/2) = 24 eggs

Finally, since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide the number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens needed.

"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables. Let's use R for the time it takes to cook rice, P for the time it takes to cook pork, and B for the time it takes to cook beans.

We know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, so R = 30.

We also know it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so P = R + 20. Substituting R = 30, we get P = 30 + 20 = 50.

The problem states that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. We can express this as B = (P + R) / 2. Substituting P = 50 and R = 30, we get B = (50 + 30) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40.

"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the given information as equations. Let's denote Aurelia's amount as A, Kassidy's amount as K, and Rayna's amount as R.

We know that Aurelia has $120, so A = 120.

We also know that Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, which can be represented as K = (3/4)A.

Substituting the value of A into the equation for K, we get K = (3/4)(120) = 90.

We are also given that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so R = K + 60. Substituting the value of K into this equation, we get R = 90 + 60 = 150.

Now that we have the amounts for each person, we can add their money together: A + K + R = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total by 3: 360 / 3 = 120.

"To determine the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate 30% of the 20% of the total employees who are management.

First, we find 20% of the total employees:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees

Now, we find 30% of the 10 employees who are management:
30% of 10 = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees

The number of employees who oversee the company is 3."
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we'll first calculate the amount required for a single muffin. 

For one muffin, Svetlana needs 5 tablespoons of flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 0.25 tablespoons of salt. To find the total dry ingredients for one muffin, we add these amounts together: 
5 (flour) + 3 (sugar) + 0.25 (salt) = 8.25 tablespoons

Now, we'll multiply the total dry ingredients for one muffin by the number of muffins Svetlana wants to make, which is 16:
8.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons

"To determine the amount of candy each person would have when sharing equally, we must first calculate the total amount of candy. This is achieved by adding the individual amounts of candy Robert, Cindy, and Aaron have.

Robert's candy: 3 pounds
Cindy's candy: 5 pounds
Aaron's candy: 4 pounds

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Now, to find the amount of candy each person would have when sharing equally, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of people, which is 3.

Candy per person = Total candy / Number of people
Candy per person = 12 / 3
Candy per person = 4

"To determine the change Adam received, we must first calculate the total cost of the candies. 

The cost of 7 candies of type A is found by multiplying the number of candies by the cost per candy: 7 * $0.5 = $3.50.

The cost of 10 candies of type B is found by multiplying the number of candies by the cost per candy: 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

Now, we add the costs of both types of candies to find the total cost: $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the amount Adam paid to find the change: $15.00 - $11.00 = $4.00.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to analyze the given information. Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days. The first 8 days were good, and the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. 

Since the first 8 days were good, that leaves 12 - 8 = 4 good days in the remaining 22 days of the first 30 days. The next 8 days were bad, and the next 8 days were neutral, so there are no good days in those 16 days. 

The remaining 6 days of the first 30 days (30 - 8 - 8 - 8 = 6) must contain the 4 good days. Now, we know that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. So, the good days left in the month are 2.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as 2x + 3 = 21.

Our goal is to isolate the variable 'x'. To do this, we'll start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, which gives us 2x = 18.

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in x = 9.

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches and then set up an equation to find the number of days it will take to reach 600 inches.

First, let's convert 20 feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can multiply 20 feet by 12 inches per foot.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day. Let's represent the number of days it will take to reach 600 inches as 'x'. We can set up an equation based on the information:

Initial height + (growth rate * number of days) = target height
240 + 30x = 600

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 240 from both sides of the equation:

30x = 600 - 240
30x = 360

Now, divide both sides by 30:

x = 360 / 30
x = 12

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, James initially has 4 dogs and 4 toys. Then, 8 more dogs arrive, bringing the total number of dogs to 4 + 8 = 12.

When James returns, he finds that the number of dogs has doubled. To find the new total, we multiply the previous number of dogs by 2: 12 * 2 = 24.

However, 3 dogs have left the shelter, so we subtract 3 from the total: 24 - 3 = 21.

Since each dog requires one toy, James needs a total of 21 toys.

"To determine Skyler's investment, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is $1200. To find Dylan's investment, we multiply the total amount by 2/5:

Dylan's investment = 2/5 * $1200 = (2 * $1200) / 5 = $2400 / 5 = $480

Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:

Remaining amount = $1200 - $480 = $720

Next, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. To find Frances' investment, we multiply the remaining amount by 2/3:

Frances' investment = 2/3 * $720 = (2 * $720) / 3 = $1440 / 3 = $480

Finally, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find Skyler's investment:

Skyler's investment = $720 - $480 = $240

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of signatures the sisters have collected so far and then find out how many more they need to reach their goal.

First, let's calculate the total number of signatures they have collected. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44. To find the total, we add these two numbers together: 20 + 44 = 64.

Now, we know the sisters want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer. To find out how many signatures they need to collect, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal: 100 - 64 = 36.

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 signatures to reach their goal.

"The art of multiplication is a wondrous thing. Let's apply it to this problem, shall we?

First, we need to determine Karen's hourly wage. Since she earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, we can multiply Lorie's wage by 2 to find Karen's wage: $10 × 2 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of hours Karen works in two days. She works 3 hours per day, so we multiply the number of hours she works per day by the number of days: 3 hours/day × 2 days = 6 hours.

Now, we can find Karen's total earnings in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the total number of hours she works: $20/hour × 6 hours = $120.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish a proportion between the given quantities. We know that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns. Let's use this information to find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes.

First, we'll set up a proportion to represent the relationship between potatoes and hash browns:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6x = 96 * 36

Now, we'll simplify the equation:

6x = 3456

Next, we'll divide both sides by 6 to isolate x:

x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can yield 576 hash browns.

"To determine the excess weight, we must first calculate the total weight of the adults in the elevator. Since there are 9 adults (Jack and 8 others) and each adult weighs an average of 80 kg, we can find the total weight by multiplying the number of adults by the average weight per adult.

Total weight = Number of adults * Average weight per adult
Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult
Total weight = 720 kg

Now, we subtract the maximum load of the elevator (700 kg) from the total weight to find the excess weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"Let's denote the number of cookies each person has as follows: Katarina (K), Max (M), Cookie Monster (C), and Summer (S). We are given the following information:

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: K = M - 5
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: M = C + 12
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: S = M + 23
4. Katarina has 68 cookies: K = 68

We can use substitution to solve for the number of cookies each person has. From equation (4), we know K = 68. Substituting this into equation (1), we get:

68 = M - 5
M = 68 + 5
M = 73

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has using equation (2):

73 = C + 12
C = 73 - 12
C = 61

Finally, we can find the number of cookies Summer has using equation (3):

S = M + 23
S = 73 + 23
S = 96

Now, we can add up the total number of cookies:
K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation representing the situation. Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. 

When Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, the new length becomes 1.5 times the original length (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 times the original). 

So, the length after extension is 1.5x. 

She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length is 140cm. So, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable. Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for x:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

"To calculate the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we can use the concept of weighted averages. Since Chris mowed half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode, we can assign a weight of 0.5 to each mode.

Time taken in turtle mode to mow the entire lawn = 60 minutes
Time taken in rabbit mode to mow the entire lawn = 40 minutes

Weighted average time = (0.5 * 60) + (0.5 * 40)
Weighted average time = 30 + 20

Now, we need to find the total number of cookies they both baked. This is a simple addition problem: 30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90 cookies.

However, they don't put all 90 cookies in the box. They eat 10 cookies while they're cooling. To find the number of cookies left, we subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total: 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations. Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation:

T = t + 7

We know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, so the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages are 44, so we can write another equation:

2T + 3t = 44

Now, we can substitute the expression for T from the first equation into the second equation:

2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

2t + 14 + 3t = 44

Combine like terms:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

t = 6

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin:

T = t + 7
T = 6 + 7
T = 13

"To determine the amount of time John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on homework and subtract it from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's convert the 3 hours before dinner to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes per hour, which equals 180 minutes.

Next, we add up the time John spends on each subject:
- 20 minutes of math homework
- 40 minutes of reading homework
- 20 minutes of history homework
Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner:
Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Total homework time
Time for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes
Time for nap = 100 minutes

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of one candy as 'c'. We know that 5 lollipops cost $0.40 each, so the total cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. We also know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20 in total.

We can set up the equation: 
2.00 + 4c = 3.20

Now, we can solve for 'c' by subtracting 2.00 from both sides of the equation:
4c = 3.20 - 2.00
4c = 1.20

Divide both sides by 4 to find the cost of one candy:
c = 1.20 / 4
c = 0.30

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
10 lollipops cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00
10 candies cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00
The total cost is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of coins Rong and Neil have saved over a period of 10 years.

First, let's analyze Rong's savings. He saves 20 coins per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, his annual savings can be calculated as 20 coins/month * 12 months/year = 240 coins/year. Over 10 years, Rong's total savings would be 240 coins/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Now, let's calculate Neil's savings. It's given that Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong per month. To find the number of coins Neil saves per month, we need to calculate 2/5 of Rong's monthly savings and add it to Rong's monthly savings. 2/5 of 20 coins is (2/5) * 20 = 8 coins. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. His annual savings would be 28 coins/month * 12 months/year = 336 coins/year. Over 10 years, Neil's total savings would be 336 coins/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have after 10 years, we add their individual savings: 2400 coins (Rong) + 3360 coins (Neil) = 5760 coins.

"To determine how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total bill for his dog's vet visit. The dog requires 2 vaccines, each costing $20, so the total cost of the vaccines is $40.

We're also told that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is then 0.6x. Since the total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write the equation:
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we'll isolate x on one side of the equation. Subtracting 0.6x from both sides gives us:
0.4x = $40

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for x:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so to find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
$125 - $100 = $25

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To find the total area of Brittany's comforter, we need to determine the number of each color of squares and add them together.

First, we know there are 14 red squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, we can calculate the number of blue squares by adding 4 to the number of red squares: 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

Next, we're told there are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, we add 6 to the number of blue squares: 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

Finally, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. To find the number of white squares, we subtract 12 from the number of green squares: 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we can find the total area of the comforter by adding the number of each color of squares together: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

Now, we can find the total number of chairs available by adding the number of regular chairs and high chairs:

Total number of chairs = Number of regular chairs + Number of high chairs
Total number of chairs = 40 + 8
Total number of chairs = 48

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of people:

30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Next, we are told that Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Therefore, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that there are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females. We also know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.

Let's denote the number of dumplings each female ate as x. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, the number of dumplings each male ate is x + 1.

We are given that each female ate 3 dumplings, so x = 3. Therefore, each male ate x + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

Now, we can calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females: 6 females * 3 dumplings per female = 18 dumplings.

We can also calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males: 8 males * 4 dumplings per male = 32 dumplings.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and females: 18 + 32 = 50.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine Gerald's share of the $100 based on the 3:2 ratio. 

The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5. 
Gerald's share is 3/5 of $100, which is (3/5) * 100 = 60.

Now, we need to subtract the $10 Gerald spent on a book from his initial amount. 
60 - 10 = 50.

"To solve this problem, we can establish a ratio between the speed of Martha's cat and her turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can express this as a ratio of 5:1.

Given the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can use this ratio to find the turtle's speed. Let's set up a proportion:

Cat's speed : Turtle's speed = 5 : 1
15 : x = 5 : 1

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

15 = 5x
x = 15 / 5
x = 3

So, the turtle's speed is 3 feet/second.

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we must first establish their hourly fundraising rate. Given that they raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can calculate this rate by dividing the total amount raised by the number of hours.

Hourly fundraising rate = Total amount raised / Number of hours
Hourly fundraising rate = $2100 / 3 hours
Hourly fundraising rate = $700 per hour

Now, we can find the total number of hours required to reach their goal of $6300 by dividing the goal by the hourly fundraising rate.

Total number of hours = Goal / Hourly fundraising rate
Total number of hours = $6300 / $700 per hour
Total number of hours = 9 hours

"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to break down the information provided.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Then, we're told that 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes. To find the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes, we multiply the percentage used by the city (40%) by the percentage used for industrial purposes (80%): 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 40% - 32% = 8%.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the rates of production for each flavor of ice cream. Let's define the variables:

c = quarts of chocolate ice cream produced per hour
v = quarts of vanilla ice cream produced per hour

We know that the factory produces 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours, so the rate of production for chocolate ice cream is:

c = 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour

Similarly, the factory produces 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours, so the rate of production for vanilla ice cream is:

v = 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour

Now, we can find the total quarts of ice cream produced per hour by adding the rates of production for each flavor:

Total quarts per hour = c + v
= 50 + 12.5
= 62.5 quarts per hour

To find the total quarts of ice cream produced in 48 hours, we can multiply the total quarts per hour by the number of hours:

Total quarts in 48 hours = Total quarts per hour * 48
= 62.5 * 48

"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should buy, we need to analyze the deal and her budget. The ice cream parlor offers a 2:1 ratio, where buying 2 scoops gets you 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost of one set of 3 scoops (2 paid + 1 free): 2 scoops * $1.50 = $3.00.

Now, we'll divide Erin's budget ($6.00) by the cost of one set ($3.00) to find out how many sets she can afford: $6.00 / $3.00 = 2 sets.

Since each set contains 3 scoops, Erin can buy 2 sets * 3 scoops = 6 scoops.

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we'll first calculate the total amount of candy each of them eats during that period. 

Since there are 14 days in two weeks, we'll multiply the number of pieces each eats per day by 14. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces in two weeks. Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces in two weeks.

Now, we'll subtract the amount of candy each of them eats from their initial amount. Ginger starts with 100 pieces, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left. Amy starts with 100 pieces, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

The difference in the amount of candy they have left is 58 - 44 = 14.

"To determine the number of mosaic tiles needed, we must first calculate the area of the bathroom that Mr. Boarden wants to cover. This area is two thirds of the total area, which is 36 sq ft. 

To find two thirds of 36, we multiply 36 by the fraction 2/3. When multiplying a whole number by a fraction, we multiply the whole number by the numerator (2) and then divide by the denominator (3). 

So, (2/3) * 36 = (2 * 36) / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24 sq ft.

Now that we know the area to be covered is 24 sq ft, we can find the total number of mosaic tiles needed. Since 24 tiles are required per square foot, we multiply the area by the number of tiles per square foot: 24 * 24 = 576.

"To determine the amount James saved by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we need to calculate the total cost of each option.

First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries:
Initial cost: $20
Cost per pound: $1.5
Total pounds picked: 30
Total cost of picking: $20 + ($1.5 * 30) = $20 + $45 = $65

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store:
Cost per pound: $2.5
Total pounds: 30
Total cost of buying: $2.5 * 30 = $75

Now, we can find the amount James saved by subtracting the total cost of picking from the total cost of buying:
Amount saved = Total cost of buying - Total cost of picking
Amount saved = $75 - $65
Amount saved = $10

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid for the computers at the new prices, we first need to determine the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, and it increased by 10%. 

To find the price increase, we multiply the original price by the percentage increase (10% or 0.10): 700 * 0.10 = 70. 

Now, we add the price increase to the original price to get the new price: 700 + 70 = 770.

With the new price of each computer being $770, we can now calculate the total amount paid by multiplying the new price by the number of computers: 770 * 500 = 385,000.

"To calculate the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to break down the problem into two stages: the time with her arms raised and the time with her arms at her sides.

In the first stage, with her arms raised, Helga taps 200 times per minute with each foot. Since this stage lasts for 2 minutes, the total number of taps in this stage is:
2 minutes * 200 taps/minute * 2 feet = 800 taps

In the second stage, with her arms at her sides, Helga taps 300 times per minute with her right foot and 250 times per minute with her left foot. The combined rate for both feet is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. Since this stage lasts for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total number of taps in this stage is:

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, let's use the given information that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can represent this as an equation, where x is the length of one of Bobby's shoes:

9x + 10 = 100

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

We are also given that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, which can be represented as F = 2D + 8.

Lastly, Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so M = F - 4.

Now, we can substitute the value of D into the equation for F:
F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38

Next, we can find the value of M by substituting the value of F:

First, let's find the number of votes candidate A got. Since candidate A received 20% of the votes, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of voters (100) by 20% (or 0.2). 

Votes for candidate A = 100 * 0.2 = 20 votes.

Next, we need to find the number of votes candidate B got. Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. To calculate this, we can find 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's total votes.

50% of candidate A's votes = 20 * 0.5 = 10 votes.
Votes for candidate B = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we can find the total number of votes candidates A and B received by adding their individual votes.

Total votes for A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Since there were 100 voters, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes for A and B from the total number of voters.

Votes for candidate C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces. This is a straightforward multiplication problem, where we multiply the number of cubes by the amount of water each cube uses.

Next, we'll calculate the water used for the medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces. Again, this is a simple multiplication problem.

Finally, we'll calculate the water used for the small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces. This multiplication problem involves a fraction, but the process is the same.

Now, we know that the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball is B + K = 10 + 5 = 15.

Since there are 50 students in total, the number of students who like to play video games or play music is 50 - 15 = 35.

We can represent this as:
V + M = 35

Substituting the value of M, we get:
V + 10 = 35

Now, we can solve for V:
V = 35 - 10
V = 25

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of birds that were scared away. Since 1/3 of the birds were scared away, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of birds by 3. 

12 birds / 3 = 4 birds

So, 4 birds were scared away. To find the number of birds that remained, we subtract the number of birds scared away from the total number of birds.

12 birds - 4 birds = 8 birds

Later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. To find the total number of birds now, we simply add the number of birds that joined to the number of birds that remained.

8 birds + 20 birds = 28 birds

"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the given information: two classes have a total of 80 students, and each class has the same number of students. We can represent the number of students in each class as x. Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x, which equals 80.

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 40

So, each class has 40 students. Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls, we can multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4 (which is the same as 40%).

Number of girls = 40 * 0.4 = 16

Since the remaining students are boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

Number of boys = 40 - 16 = 24

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

First, Mara starts with 2 slices of cake on the plate and adds 3 more. This gives us a total of 2 + 3 = 5 slices.

Next, Mara triples the number of slices she currently has. To do this, we multiply 5 by 3, resulting in 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

After tripling the slices, Mara eats 2 of them. We subtract 2 from 15, giving us 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Finally, Mara's friend steals 5 slices from the plate. We subtract 5 from 13, leaving us with 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

"To determine Mark's profit from buying and selling the old magic cards, we need to calculate his total cost and total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Mark bought 3 packs at $1800 each, so his total cost is:

3 packs * $1800/pack = $5400

Next, we'll calculate the total revenue. Mark obtained two high-value cards worth $4000 and $1000, respectively, and 30 additional cards with an average value of $50 each. The total revenue from these cards is:

$4000 (high-value card 1) + $1000 (high-value card 2) + (30 cards * $50/card) = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

Now, we can calculate Mark's profit by subtracting his total cost from his total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $6500 - $5400
Profit = $1100

"To determine the cost savings of choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park. The cost for 2 adults is 2 * $26 = $52, and the cost for 2 children is 2 * $12 = $24. The total cost for the first park is $52 + $24 = $76.

Next, we'll calculate the total cost for the second amusement park. The cost for 2 adults is 2 * $14 = $28, and the cost for 2 children is 2 * $10 = $20. The total cost for the second park is $28 + $20 = $48.

Now, we can find the cost difference by subtracting the cost of the second park from the cost of the first park: $76 - $48 = $28.

"The art of subtraction and multiplication. Let's apply these fundamental operations to the problem at hand.

First, we need to calculate the daily savings. To do this, we'll find the difference in cost per day. The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. The original cost per tomato was $.5, so the original daily cost is 500 * $.5 = $250. The new cost per tomato is $.4, so the new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

Now, let's subtract the new daily cost from the original daily cost to find the daily savings: $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we'll multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and use it to establish the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

Let's start by using the information that Sean has 56 marbles and that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. This means that Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean. We can express this relationship as:

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

Next, we are given that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. We can express this relationship as:

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

Now that we have found the number of marbles each person has, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined by adding the number of marbles each of them has:

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

- Weekends (2 days): 100 chairs/day * 2 days = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 chairs + 200 chairs = 500 chairs

Since we're interested in a two 4-week period, we need to calculate the total number of weeks:

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and break it down into manageable steps.

First, let's establish the conversion rates:
- 1 large sticker = 1 large button or 3 small buttons
- 1 small sticker = 1 small button
- 1 large button = 3 small stickers

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.9, which equals 27. Since 3 small stickers are worth 1 large button, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Now, she has 3 small stickers left (30 - 27 = 3) and 9 large buttons.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

At this point, she has 3 small stickers, 9 large buttons (from the first trade), and 20 large buttons (from the second trade), and 20 large stickers left.

She then trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's summarize her current possessions: 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons (9 + 20), and 60 small buttons.

To find the total number of buttons, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons and add them to the small buttons. Since 1 large button = 3 small buttons, 29 large buttons = 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons. However, we must also consider the 3 small stickers she has left. Since 1 small sticker = 1 small button, we can convert the small stickers to small buttons. So, she has 3 + 60 + 87 = 150 small buttons.

The final answer is: 150"

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and each member votes either in favor or against. Therefore, the total number of votes is equal to the sum of votes in favor and against, which is x + 2x = 3x.

Since the total number of council members is 33, we can set up the equation 3x = 33.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 33 / 3
x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:
Votes in favor = 2x
Votes in favor = 2 * 11
Votes in favor = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and perform the required calculations step by step.

First, we know that 11 students need size extra-small shirts. Next, we're told that twice as many students need size small as extra small. This means we need to multiply the number of extra-small students by 2 to find the number of small students: 11 * 2 = 22.

Now, we're informed that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. To find this, we subtract 4 from the number of small students: 22 - 4 = 18.

Moving on, we're told that half as many students need size large as size medium. This means we need to divide the number of medium students by 2 to find the number of large students: 18 / 2 = 9.

Finally, we know that six more students need size extra-large than large. To find this, we add 6 to the number of large students: 9 + 6 = 15.

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people

Next, we find the remaining people who don't think horse #2 will win. 
Remaining people = 50 - 10 = 40 people

Then, we find 60% of the remaining people who think horse #7 will win. 
60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people

Now, we subtract the people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total to find the people who think horse #12 will win.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of cases of shingles needed for each house. Let's denote the number of cases needed for the first house as x.

Given that the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the second house needs 2x. The third house needs double the first, so it needs 2x.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total number of cases needed, which is 250. The sum of the cases needed for each house is x + 2x + 2x = 250.

Combine like terms to simplify the equation: 5x = 250.

"To determine the total duration of Jack's trip, we'll break it down into its components: driving time and time spent at the museum.

First, let's calculate the driving time. Since Jack drives to the museum and back, we'll find the one-way driving time and then double it. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack's speed is 75 miles per hour. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

Time = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since Jack makes a round trip, we'll multiply the one-way driving time by 2:

Total driving time = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now, let's add the time Jack spends at the museum, which is 6 hours. The total duration of his trip is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into its components. Let's denote the driving time as 't' hours and the hiking time as 1.5 hours (given). The total time is 6 hours, so we can set up the equation:

t + 1.5 = 6

Solving for 't', we get:
t = 6 - 1.5
t = 4.5 hours

Now, we know the driving time is 4.5 hours. Given the average driving speed is 50 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance driven:

Distance driven = Speed * Time = 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles

Next, we need to find the hiking speed. The problem states that the hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, the hiking speed is:

Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the distance hiked:

Distance hiked = Speed * Time = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 225 + 30 = 255 miles

"To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to set up an equation representing the situation. Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as 'x', the number of berries she collects as 'y', and the time left on the timer when she finishes the level as 'z'.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 'x + 8' enemies. She collects 3 more berries than Emma, so she collects 'y + 3' berries. Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she has 'z - 4' seconds left on the timer.

The scoring system awards 10 points for every enemy jumped on, 5 points for each berry collected, and 30 points for every second left on the timer. We can set up the equations for their scores as follows:

Emma's score = 10x + 5y + 30z
Ava's score = 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(z - 4)

To find the difference between their scores, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's score:

Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
= [10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(z - 4)] - (10x + 5y + 30z)
= 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30z - 120 - 10x - 5y - 30z
= 80 + 15 - 120
= -25

The final answer is: -25"
"The art of subtraction and division. Let's apply these fundamental operations to solve the problem at hand.

We know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we'll subtract the cost of the two known pizzas from the total cost.

Total cost of all four pizzas: 64 dollars
Cost of the two known pizzas: 30 dollars (not 2 x 30, as that would be the cost of four pizzas at 30 dollars each)

Now, let's perform the subtraction:
64 - 30 = 34 dollars

This result represents the combined cost of the other two pizzas. Since they cost the same amount, we'll divide the result by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

34 ÷ 2 = 17 dollars

"The art of multiplication and addition. Let's break down the problem with precision.

Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. To find the total number of rides on these days, we multiply the number of days by the number of rides per day:
5 days * 3 rides/day = 15 rides

Now, on the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual times. Since they usually ride thrice a day, we multiply this by 2 to get the new number of rides per day:
3 rides/day * 2 = 6 rides/day

We then multiply this new number of rides per day by the number of days:
2 days * 6 rides/day = 12 rides

To find the total number of rides in a week, we add the rides on the usual days to the rides on the other two days:
15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'y'. We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we can write the equation:

x + y = 17

We also know that after adding the new fish to his pond, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Since he already had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish, the total number of orange fish is now 3 + y, and the total number of white fish is 4 + x. We can write the equation:

3 + y = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + y = 8 + 2x
y = 5 + 2x

Now, we can substitute this expression for y into the first equation:

x + (5 + 2x) = 17

Combine like terms:

3x + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3x = 12

Divide by 3:

x = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the weekly fuel cost for Andy's commute, we'll need to calculate the total distance driven and the corresponding fuel consumption.

First, let's establish the daily commute distance. Since the one-way distance between Andy's home and office is 5 miles, the round-trip distance is 2 x 5 = 10 miles per day.

With a 5-day workweek (Monday to Friday), the total weekly distance driven is 10 miles/day x 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Given Andy's car fuel efficiency of 10 MPG, we can calculate the weekly fuel consumption as follows: 50 miles/week ÷ 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Now, let's calculate the weekly fuel cost. With a regular gas price of $3/gallon, the total weekly fuel cost is 5 gallons/week x $3/gallon = $15/week.

"To calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent for lunch, we need to determine the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Since Carrie spent all 140 quarters and each quarter is worth $0.25, we can multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Carrie spent 3/5 of the 10 twenties. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3 and then divide by 5:
(10 * 3) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6

Since each twenty is worth $20, we multiply the number of twenties spent by the value of each twenty:
6 * $20 = $120

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount spent:
$35 + $120 = $155

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first determine the combined fraction of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. Since one-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, this can be represented as 1/4. Similarly, one-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, which is 1/8.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which in this case is 8. We can rewrite 1/4 as 2/8, and then add it to 1/8, resulting in 2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8.

This means that 3/8 of the total sales are either smart TVs or analog TVs. To find the number of these TVs sold, we multiply 3/8 by the total number of TVs sold, which is 40. 

3/8 * 40 = (3 * 40) / 8 = 120 / 8 = 15

Since 15 out of 40 TVs are either smart TVs or analog TVs, the remaining TVs are OLED TVs. To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we subtract 15 from the total number of TVs sold.

40 - 15 = 25

"The art of subtraction. Let's break it down with precision. We have a total cost of $300 for the trip. The school has graciously offered to cover half of this amount. To find the school's contribution, we simply divide the total cost by 2:

$300 ÷ 2 = $150

Now, we know the school is covering $150. To find out how much John is missing, we subtract both the school's contribution and John's available funds from the total cost:

$300 (total cost) - $150 (school's contribution) = $150
$150 - $50 (John's money) = $100

The result is clear: John is missing $100."
"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we must first calculate the nighttime temperature. Given that it's 33 degrees colder at night, we subtract 33 from the daytime temperature of 45 degrees.

45 (daytime temperature) - 33 (temperature difference) = 12 degrees (nighttime temperature)

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, we need to find the temperature rise required to reach 32 degrees.

32 (minimum safe temperature) - 12 (nighttime temperature) = 20 degrees (temperature rise needed)

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find the number of logs required, we divide the temperature rise needed by the heat provided by each log.

20 (temperature rise needed) ÷ 5 (heat per log) = 4

Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps. 

First, we need to find the number of groups. Since there are 90 people and each group has 9 people, we can find the number of groups by dividing the total number of people by the number of people per group:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Now, we know that 3/5 of the groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. To find the number of groups that brought seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

Number of groups that brought seashells = Total number of groups * 3/5
= 10 * 3/5
= 6

Since each group has 9 members, the total number of people who brought seashells is:

Number of people who brought seashells = Number of groups that brought seashells * Number of people per group
= 6 * 9
= 54

Each of these people brought 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells is:

Total number of seashells = Number of people who brought seashells * Number of seashells per person
= 54 * 2
= 108

172 - 47 = 125

Next, 13 people get on the train at the same stop, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

Then, at the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, the number of people on the train is 100.

"Calculating overtime pay can be a bit complex, but I'm here to break it down for you. Let's dive into Jamie's situation.

Jamie earns a regular hourly rate of $20 for 8 hours of work each day. If she needs to work additional hours, her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular rate. To calculate this, we multiply her regular rate by 1.5:
$20/hour * 1.5 = $30/hour

Now, let's calculate her earnings for the day. She worked a total of 11 hours, with 8 hours at her regular rate and 3 hours at the overtime rate. Her earnings for the regular 8 hours are:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

Her earnings for the additional 3 hours at the overtime rate are:

Initial employees: 200
New employees per month: 20
Total new employees after 3 months: 20 * 3 = 60
Total employees after 3 months: 200 + 60 = 260

Now, we can calculate the total monthly salary for all employees:

Total employees: 260
Monthly salary per employee: $4000
Total monthly salary: 260 * 4000 = $1,040,000

To find the total amount paid over three months, we multiply the total monthly salary by 3:

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 
Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all of her stuffed animals, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is x. 
The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

"When dealing with relative speed problems, it's essential to understand the concept of relative motion. In this scenario, we have two cars moving in the same direction, and we're interested in finding the distance between them after a certain period.

Let's break it down step by step. We know the speeds of both cars: the first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Since they're moving in the same direction, we can find the relative speed between them by subtracting the speed of the first car from the speed of the second car:
Relative speed = Speed of second car - Speed of first car
Relative speed = 70 miles/hour - 60 miles/hour
Relative speed = 10 miles/hour

Now, we need to find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours. We can use the formula:
Distance = Relative speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 20 miles

- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders' pass rate, which is 2 * (40/100) = 80%. So, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, or 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700.

The total number of students is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

"To determine the length of Milo's mosaic, we need to establish the total number of square inches he can cover with the available glass chips. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has 2 bags, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144.

Given that 12 chips are required to cover 1 square inch, we can calculate the total square inches by dividing the total chips by 12. This gives us 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Now, we know the mosaic's height is 3 inches, and we want to find the length. We can set up a ratio of length to height, where the area (12 square inches) is equal to the product of length and height. So, length * 3 = 12. To find the length, we divide both sides by 3, resulting in length = 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

The total amount of tea consumed is the sum of these two amounts:
6 + 32 = 38 quarts

Now, we add the remaining amount of tea (10 quarts) to the total amount consumed:

"When dealing with exponential growth, it's essential to understand the compounding effect of the growth rate over time. In this scenario, the number of students doubles every month, which represents a 100% monthly growth rate.

To calculate the total number of students at the end of May, we can use the formula for exponential growth:

A = P * (1 + r)^n

where:
A = Total number of students at the end of May
P = Initial number of students (10)
r = Monthly growth rate (100% or 1)
n = Number of months (5, from January to May)

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = 10 * 2^5
A = 10 * 32
A = 320

Now, to find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:

Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Now that we know Felix climbed a total of 420 branches, we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing this total by the number of days in a week (7).

Average branches climbed per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches climbed per day = 420 / 7

"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we'll start by calculating the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. Adding the 3 marshmallows they dropped on the ground, we get a total of 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows.

Now, let's subtract the total marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows in the bag. This is where my expertise in subtraction comes in handy.

Marshmallows left = 35 (initial) - 21 (used and dropped) = 14

Since there are 2 kids, we'll divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have. As a division expert, I can assure you that this calculation is accurate.

S'mores per kid = 14 ÷ 2 = 7

"To determine the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the number of quarters each person uses and then add them up.

First, let's find out how many quarters Jack uses. Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter, and they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. To find the number of quarters Jack uses, we divide the total minutes played by the minutes per quarter: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

Next, we'll calculate the number of quarters used by Jack's two friends who are significantly worse. They can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. To find the number of quarters they use, we divide the total minutes played by the minutes per quarter: 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters. Since there are two friends, we multiply the result by 2: 24 quarters * 2 = 48 quarters.

Now, let's calculate the number of quarters used by Jack's friend who is significantly better. This friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. To find the number of quarters they use, we divide the total minutes played by the minutes per quarter: 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

Finally, we add up the number of quarters used by each person: 12 quarters (Jack) + 48 quarters (two friends) + 8 quarters (one friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'x'. Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also 'x'. 

We know that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of salt is '2x'. Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also '2x'. 

Finally, she uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is '4x'. 

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can set up the equation:

x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10

Combine like terms:
10x = 10

Divide both sides by 10:
x = 1

Now, we know the amount of oil is 4x, so:
4 * 1 = 4

The amount of oil Tanya uses is 4 ounces.

"To determine the total amount John spent, we'll first calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows, then add these two amounts together.

The cost of the goats is a straightforward multiplication problem: 3 goats at $500 each is 3 × $500 = $1500.

Similarly, the cost of the cows is another multiplication problem: 2 cows at $1500 each is 2 × $1500 = $3000.

Now, we simply add these two amounts together to find the total: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

"To determine the number of cupcakes Paul should buy, we'll first calculate the total number of cupcakes he already has. This can be done by adding the number of chocolate cupcakes to the number of toffee cupcakes.

Total cupcakes available = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, we'll subtract the total cupcakes available from the total cupcakes needed to find out how many more Paul should buy.

Number of cupcakes to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Total cupcakes available

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many cars Joe has initially. We know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe's initial number of cars is 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, we calculate the number of cars Joe sells, which is 20% of his total cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2 (since 20% is equivalent to 0.2). This gives us 40 * 0.2 = 8 cars sold.

Now, we determine the number of cars Joe gives away to his mother. We're told that he gives away twice as many cars as he sold. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Finally, to find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

"To determine the amount each student raised, we must first isolate the total amount raised by the students. This is achieved by subtracting the amount contributed by organizations from the total charity funds. 

Total charity funds: $175,000
Amount from organizations: $50,000
Amount raised by students: $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find the individual contribution.

"The art of multiplication and addition. Let's break down this problem with precision.

First, we establish the number of hours Sandy walked on the first day, which is 8 hours. On the second day, she walked half as many hours, so we multiply 8 by 1/2 or 0.5. This gives us 8 * 0.5 = 4 hours.

Now, we add the hours walked on both days: 8 hours (first day) + 4 hours (second day) = 12 hours.

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. Thus, 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

"The art of multiplication is a wondrous thing. Let's apply it to John's situation. We know he completes 30 cycles of work per day, with each cycle comprising 5 tasks that pay $1.20 apiece. To calculate his daily earnings, we multiply the number of tasks per cycle by the payment per task, then multiply the result by the number of cycles.

5 tasks/cycle * $1.20/task = $6/cycle
$6/cycle * 30 cycles = $180/day

Now, to determine his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week.

$180/day * 7 days = $1260

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game, we can find Julie's score by subtracting 4 from Sasha's score: 14 - 4 = 10 points.

Next, we're told Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. We already know Julie scored 10 points in the first game, so we subtract 6 from that: 10 - 6 = 4 points.

Now, we have Sasha's scores for both games: 14 points in the first game and 4 points in the second game. To find the total points Sasha scored, we simply add these two scores together: 14 + 4 = 18 points.

"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food Kimberly bought, we need to first calculate the total number of tins of each type of food.

The total number of tins of cat food can be found by multiplying the number of packages by the number of tins per package. In this case, 8 packages of cat food with 11 tins per package results in 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Similarly, the total number of tins of dog food is found by multiplying the number of packages by the number of tins per package. Here, 6 packages of dog food with 6 tins per package results in 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, to find the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

And the number of cards Becca has:
Becca has 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards

The number of cards Becca has is 153."
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and apply the concepts of ratios and sums.

First, we know Cindy has 5 green eggs. The number of blue eggs is twice the number of green eggs, so we can calculate the number of blue eggs as 2 * 5 = 10.

Next, we are told that Cindy has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is 10 - 1 = 9.

Now, let's find the number of yellow eggs. We know that Cindy has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. To calculate this, we divide the number of pink eggs by 3: 9 / 3 = 3.

"To determine the amount of money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund amount.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost per pound is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. Additionally, the company charges $0.08 per mile, and the distribution center is 20 miles away, so the cost per mile is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, let's calculate the refund amount. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32. To find 75% of $32, we multiply $32 by 0.75, resulting in a refund amount of $24.00.

Now, let's calculate the total loss. The total loss is the book cost minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost. Therefore, the total loss is $32 - $24.00 + $3.00 = $11.00.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount she spent. She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so we multiply the cost of one pair by 2:
2 x $30 = $60

She also bought a bag for $20. To find the total amount she spent, we add the cost of the jeans and the bag:

"To determine the production for the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and subtract that from the total monthly production.

Boris produces 8,000 bars in the first week. In the second week, he produces half as much, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 
8,000 + 4,000 = 12,000
12,000 + 24,000 = 36,000

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:

"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we'll break down her activities and calculate the time spent on each.

First, let's calculate the time spent recording videos. Britany records 18 videos per week, each lasting 4 minutes. 
18 videos/week * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
72 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 288 minutes/month

Next, we'll calculate the time spent writing songs. Britany spends 2 hours per week writing songs. 
2 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 hours/month
To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
8 hours/month * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/month

Lastly, let's calculate the time spent on makeup. Britany spends 15 minutes per day, 6 days a week, on makeup.
15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
Again, we multiply the weekly total by 4 to get the monthly total:
90 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 360 minutes/month

Now, we add up the time spent on each activity:
288 minutes/month + 480 minutes/month + 360 minutes/month = 1128 minutes/month

To make the answer more readable, we can convert the total minutes to hours and minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
1128 minutes/month ÷ 60 = 18.8 hours/month

"To calculate the total cost of the installation, we need to break down the items into those included in the base price and those that incur an additional charge.

The base price of $129.00 includes the installation of 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that need to be installed.

First, let's calculate the number of additional items: 
- Mirrors: 6 (Angela's) - 4 (included) = 2 additional mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 (Angela's) - 1 (included) = 1 additional chandelier
- Pictures: 20 (Angela's) - 10 (included) = 10 additional pictures

The additional charge is $15.00 per item. Therefore, the total additional cost is:
2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00
Total additional cost = $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Now, we add the base price to the total additional cost to get the final total:

"To solve this problem, we'll work our way up the chain of mountain-lifting abilities, starting with Pompei. Given that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, we can establish the following relationships:

1. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay's limit is 12 * 1 inch = 12 inches.
2. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami's limit is 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.
3. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto's limit is 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.

Now, to convert inches to feet, we'll divide the total inches by 12, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, Naruto's mountain-lifting limit in feet is:

480 inches / 12 = 40 feet

"The art of multiplication and addition is at play here. Let's break it down with precision. 

First, we have Mason's speed, a steady 8 miles per hour. He travels for 4 hours, so we multiply his speed by the time to find the distance: 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles. This is a straightforward application of the multiplication principle, where the product of his speed and time yields the distance traveled.

Next, Mason takes a break and then continues his journey for another 6 hours. Again, we apply the multiplication principle: 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles. This gives us the distance he traveled in the second leg of his journey.

Now, to find the total distance, we add the distances traveled in each leg: 32 miles + 48 miles. This is a simple addition problem, where the sum of the two distances gives us the total distance traveled.

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of distance, rate, and time. Let's denote the distance across the highway as D, the speed of a kangaroo as R, and the time it takes for one kangaroo to cross the highway as T.

We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, so we can set up the equation:

3R * 18 = D

Since we want to find the time it would take four turtles to cross the highway, we need to find the speed of a turtle. We are given that a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of a turtle is R/2.

Now, we can set up an equation for one turtle crossing the highway:

(R/2) * T = D

We can equate the two equations, since the distance D is the same in both cases:

3R * 18 = (R/2) * T

Simplifying the equation, we get:

54R = (R/2) * T

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

108R = RT

Dividing both sides by R, we get:

108 = T

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, the time it would take them to cross the highway would be the same as the time it would take one turtle, which is 108 hours.

The final answer is: 108"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the number of clay dishes Kora made as x. We know that Kora made 20 dishes, so x = 20.

Since Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, the number of dishes Rory made is x + 20. Substituting x = 20, we get Rory's dishes as 20 + 20 = 40.

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so the number of dishes Jada made is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we can find the total number of clay dishes made by adding the number of dishes each person made: 
Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140

"The art of calculating the unknown amount in Erika's purse. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in. The original price is $600, but Erika gets a $200 discount, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Erika has from her part-time job and her mom's contribution. She earned $150 from her job and received $80 from her mom, so the total amount from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.

We know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has $400 - $50 = $350.

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to subtract the amount she got from her job and her mom from the total amount she has. So, $350 - $230 = $120.

"To determine the number of apple slices left, we must first calculate the total number of slices Adam had initially. 

We know that a large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Given that Adam sliced 3 large and 5 small apples, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

Number of slices from large apples = 3 (large apples) * 5 (slices per large apple) = 15
Number of slices from small apples = 5 (small apples) * 3 (slices per small apple) = 15

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to find the total number of slices initially:
Total number of slices = 15 (large) + 15 (small) = 30

Since Adam ate 15 slices, we subtract the slices eaten from the total to find the number of slices left:
Number of slices left = 30 (initial slices) - 15 (slices eaten) = 15

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each glue stick that is used and subtract it from the original length. 

First, let's find the length of each glue stick that is used. 

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used up. To find the length used, we multiply 5/6 by the original length of 12 mm: 
5/6 * 12 mm = (5 * 12) / 6 mm = 60/6 mm = 10 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used up. To find the length used, we multiply 1/3 by the original length of 12 mm: 
1/3 * 12 mm = (1 * 12) / 3 mm = 12/3 mm = 4 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used up. To find the length used, we multiply 1/2 by the original length of 12 mm: 
1/2 * 12 mm = (1 * 12) / 2 mm = 12/2 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add up the lengths of the glue sticks that are used: 
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

"To tackle this problem, we'll break it down into manageable parts. Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as 's' and the number of dishes Jack has as 'd'. We're given that Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so we can express this relationship as d = 2s.

We're also told that Jack collected 60 dishes, so d = 60. Substituting this value into the equation d = 2s, we get 60 = 2s. Solving for 's', we find s = 60 / 2 = 30.

Now, let's consider Peter's belongings. We know Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks. Additionally, Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, which means Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the individual quantities:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

Finally, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is the sum of the total socks and total dishes:

First, we find the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students good at math only and English only, we can find the number of students good at both subjects by subtracting the sum of students good at math only and English only from the total number of students.

Students good at both math and English = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)

"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and the time taken by each group.

First, let's convert the concert duration from hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes. Since there's a 10-minute intermission, we subtract this from the total concert time to find the time available for performances: 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time taken by each group, which includes getting on stage (2 minutes), performing (6 minutes), and exiting the stage (2 minutes). So, the total time per group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

Now, we divide the total time available for performances (110 minutes) by the time taken by each group (10 minutes): 110 minutes / 10 minutes = 11.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to determine the interest earned per year and then multiply it by the number of years.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. To find the interest earned per year, we multiply the original amount ($300) by the interest rate (3/4).

Interest per year = $300 * (3/4) = $225

Since it's simple interest, the interest earned each year remains constant. To find the total interest earned in 3 years, we multiply the interest per year by the number of years.

Total interest earned = $225 * 3 = $675

Now, we add the total interest earned to the original amount to find the total amount after 3 years.

Total amount after 3 years = Original amount + Total interest earned
= $300 + $675
= $975

"To determine the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars, we must first calculate each subset.

The store has 40 white shirts, and half of them have collars. This means 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts have collars, and the remaining 20 have no collars.

The store also has 50 floral shirts, with 20 of them having buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total: 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts with no buttons.

Now, we calculate the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars: 30 - 20 = 10.

"To determine the farmer's earnings, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray to find the number of trays. This is a classic division problem, where we're essentially grouping the eggs into sets of 30.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs ÷ Number of eggs per tray
= 900 ÷ 30
= 30

Now, we can multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find the total earnings. This is a straightforward multiplication problem, where we're scaling the price per tray by the number of trays.

Total earnings = Number of trays × Price per tray
= 30 × $2.5
= $75

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two farms, Farm X and Farm Y, with 55 and 45 goats, respectively. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, leaving him with:
55 - 10 = 45 goats in Farm X

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats. To find the number of goats left in Farm Y, we subtract 20 from the initial number of goats:
45 - 20 = 25 goats in Farm Y

Now, we simply add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70

"The art of division. In this case, we're tasked with finding the average cost of each pair of shoes James purchases. To do so, we must first determine the total number of pairs he buys annually. Since James acquires 2 pairs of shoes per month, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of pairs is calculated as follows:

2 pairs/month × 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, we know James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we simply divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:

$2640 ÷ 24 = $110

"The art of multiplication and subtraction. Let's break down the problem with precision.

First, we'll calculate the cost of the green food baskets. Since each basket costs $25, we multiply the cost by the number of baskets: 3 * $25 = $75.

Next, we'll determine the cost of the red food baskets. The original price is $18 per basket, so we multiply that by the number of baskets: 3 * $18 = $54.

Now, we need to account for the discount. We receive $2 off for each basket of red food, so we multiply the discount by the number of baskets: 3 * $2 = $6. To find the discounted price, we subtract the total discount from the original cost of the red food baskets: $54 - $6 = $48.

Finally, we add the cost of the green food baskets to the discounted cost of the red food baskets to find the total: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we can start by determining the number of rooms that represents. Since there are 90 rooms, one-half of the rooms is 90 * (1/2) = 45 rooms.

Now, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time to clean 45 rooms is 45 * 20 minutes = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we'll break down the problem step by step.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. Using my expertise in multiplication, I can calculate this as 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

Now, let's find the total number of homes built in the first two years by adding the homes built in each year: 12 + 36 = 48 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built. This means they will build 2 * 48 = 96 new homes in the third year.

To find the total number of homes built over the three years, we add the homes built in the first two years (48) to the homes built in the third year (96): 48 + 96 = 144.

The final answer is: 144"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables: let B be the brother's age, S be the sister's age, Y be your age, and M be your mom's age.

We are given the following information:

1. You are three years younger than your brother: Y = B - 3
2. You are 2 years older than your sister: Y = S + 2
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: M = 3B - 1
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: B + Y + S + M = 87

We can use substitution to simplify the equations. From equation (1), we can express Y in terms of B. From equation (2), we can express S in terms of Y, and then substitute Y from equation (1) to get S in terms of B.

Y = B - 3
S = Y - 2 = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5

Now, substitute Y and S in terms of B into the equation (4):

B + (B - 3) + (B - 5) + M = 87

Substitute M from equation (3):

B + (B - 3) + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:

5B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:

5B = 96

Divide by 5:

B = 19.2

Since B must be a whole number, we round it to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we will try both 19 and 20 to see which one works.

If B = 19:
Y = B - 3 = 19 - 3 = 16
S = Y - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14
M = 3B - 1 = 3(19) - 1 = 56

B + Y + S + M = 19 + 16 + 14 + 56 = 105 (not 87)

If B = 20:
Y = B - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17
S = Y - 2 = 17 - 2 = 15
M = 3B - 1 = 3(20) - 1 = 59

B + Y + S + M = 20 + 17 + 15 + 35 = 87 (this works)

So, your age is 17.

"To determine the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. With 27 students and 2 glue sticks per student, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8. This gives us 54 / 8 = 6.75. However, as Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and wants to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Rounding 6.75 up to the nearest whole number gives us 7. Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we'll break it down step by step. 

First, we'll determine the amount of water after the initial doubling. Since the amount doubles, we'll multiply the initial amount by 2. 

Initial amount of water: 4000 gallons
Amount after the first increase (doubled): 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons

Next, we'll add the increase on the third day to the doubled amount. 

Increase on the third day: 6000 gallons
Total amount of water passing through the river: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons

"Modeling the spread of the plague as a discrete-time exponential growth process, we can calculate the number of infected individuals after three days.

Let's denote the initial number of infected people as I0 = 10 and the number of new infections per infected person per day as r = 6. The number of infected people after one day (I1) is given by I1 = I0 + I0 * r = 10 + 10 * 6 = 70.

For subsequent days, we can use the recurrence relation: In = In-1 + In-1 * r, where In is the number of infected people after n days.

Applying this relation, we get:
I2 = I1 + I1 * r = 70 + 70 * 6 = 490 (after two days)
I3 = I2 + I2 * r = 490 + 490 * 6 = 3430 (after three days)

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430."
"To calculate the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips, we first need to determine the amount Rafaela received. Since each of the 40 customers gave Rafaela a $20 tip, we multiply the number of customers by the tip amount.

40 customers * $20 per customer = $800

Next, we calculate the amount Julieta received, which is 10% less than Rafaela's amount. To find 10% of $800, we multiply by 0.1.

$800 * 0.1 = $80

Now, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total.

$800 - $80 = $720

Finally, we add the amounts received by Rafaela and Julieta to find the total.

$800 + $720 = $1520

"To solve this problem, we can establish the ratio of badges earned by each girl relative to Claire. Claire earns 1 badge per month, so we can use this as our baseline.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, which means she earns badges at half the rate of Claire. Therefore, the ratio of Amber's badges to Claire's badges is 1:2.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so the ratio of Wendy's badges to Claire's badges is 3:1.

Now, let's express these ratios in terms of a common multiple. Since we're comparing the number of badges earned in a year, we can use 12 months as our common multiple. Claire earns 12 badges in a year, so:

- Amber earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges in a year (since she earns at half the rate of Claire)
- Wendy earns 12 * 3 = 36 badges in a year (since she earns three times the rate of Claire)

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year:

36 (Wendy's badges) - 6 (Amber's badges) = 30

"To calculate the total amount raised, we need to determine the number of hours Paige baked, the number of loaves she baked, the number of slices per loaf, and the price per slice.

First, let's calculate the time interval from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. This is a 5-hour interval.

Since Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour, the total number of loaves she baked is 5 hours * 2 loaves/hour = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Finally, each slice is sold for $0.50. To find the total amount raised, multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of burritos eaten and then subtract that from the total number of burritos ordered.

First, we calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students. Since there are 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, we multiply the number of students by the number of burritos per student:
50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

Next, we add the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George to the total number of burritos eaten by the students:
500 burritos + 20 burritos = 520 burritos

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos:

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and set up a system of equations. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the bumper car rink has 12 red cars. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so the number of green cars can be represented as 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 times 10, which equals 30.

Now, let's denote the number of yellow cars as Y. We are given that the total number of cars in the rink is 75. We can set up an equation to represent this:

12 (red cars) + 10 (green cars) + 30 (blue cars) + Y (yellow cars) = 75

Combine the constants on the left-hand side:

52 + Y = 75

Subtract 52 from both sides to isolate Y:

Y = 23

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations with three variables. Let's denote the number of books Anne has as A, Sofie as S, and Fawn as F.

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write an equation based on this information:
S = A + 25

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write another equation:
A = F - 12

Lastly, we know that the total number of books the three have together is 85, so we can write a third equation:
A + S + F = 85

Now, we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for F. First, substitute S = A + 25 into the third equation:
A + (A + 25) + F = 85

Combine like terms:
2A + F + 25 = 85

Now, substitute A = F - 12 into this equation:
2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85

Expand and combine like terms:
2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84

Divide by 3:
F = 28

Fawn has 28 books."
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we must first establish the weight of the sweet potatoes.

x = (3 * $21.00) / 7
x = $9.00

For the water:
4 bottles / $8.00 = 2 bottles / y
We can cross-multiply and solve for y:
4y = 2 * $8.00
y = (2 * $8.00) / 4
y = $4.00

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two main steps: calculating the profit from selling the rope and then finding out how much money is left over after buying the new rope.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and Sarah's friend is willing to pay $2 per meter. To find the total amount of money Sarah will receive, we multiply the length of the rope by the price per meter: 20 meters * $2/meter = $40.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and since Sarah is buying a rope of the same length (20 meters), we multiply the length by the price per meter: 20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the chicken. Since 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of 1 pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2. Given that each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of 1 packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Therefore, the total cost of 6 packets of chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

Next, we calculate the cost of the fruits. The 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, resulting in a total cost of $4 * 3 = $12. The 7 packs of apples are priced at half the cost of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Thus, the total cost of 7 packs of apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: 
- 5 packs of bacon: $10
- 6 packets of chicken: $24
- 3 packs of strawberries: $12
- 7 packs of apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x represent the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts in minutes. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the runtime of the final concert (excluding the encore) is 2x minutes. Adding the 15-minute encore, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 minutes.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. This allows us to set up a linear equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To isolate the variable x, we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 15 from both sides:

2x + 15 - 15 = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, we need to get rid of the coefficient of x (which is 2). We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

(2x) / 2 = 50 / 2
x = 25

Therefore, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"The art of subtraction. Let's apply it to Argo's situation. We know he started with 200 toys and gave some away to his friends. To find out how many toys he has now, we need to subtract the total number of toys he gave away from his initial amount.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys Argo gave away: 40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150 toys.

Now, let's perform the subtraction:
200 (initial toys) - 150 (toys given away) = 50

Argo has 50 toys now."
"To calculate the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we'll start by adding the number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Since the number of chimichangas made on both days is the same, we can simply multiply the number by 2.

Number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays and Wednesdays = 2 * 125 = 250

Now, we know that the number of chimichangas made on Fridays is twice the number made on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. So, we multiply the number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays (or Wednesdays) by 2.

Number of chimichangas made on Fridays = 2 * 125 = 250

Finally, we add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays and Wednesdays to the number made on Fridays.

Total number of chimichangas made = 250 + 250 = 500

"To determine the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to find out how many microphones were left out. Since 20% of the microphones didn't find any space, we calculate 20% of the total number of microphones.

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

This means 10 microphones were left out. Now, we subtract these from the total number of microphones to find the number of microphones that were arranged in pairs.

Number of microphones arranged in pairs = 50 - 10 = 40

Since the microphones are arranged in pairs, we divide the number of arranged microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

"To find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to calculate the number of birds in each category and add them together.

First, we have 6 birds nesting in the bushes. Next, we have 2/3 of 6 birds flying overhead. To find 2/3 of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and then divide by 3. This gives us (6 * 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4 birds flying overhead.

Now, let's consider the birds feeding. We have 3 groups of 8 birds each. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group: 3 * 8 = 24.

Finally, we add the number of birds in each category to find the total:
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

"To determine the number of cookies in each jar, we'll first calculate the number of cookies Lani has left after eating 5. This is a straightforward subtraction problem. 

Total cookies = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies eaten = 55 - 5 = 50

Now that we know Lani has 50 cookies left, we'll divide this number by the number of jars to find out how many cookies are in each jar. This is a simple division problem.

Number of jars = 5
Cookies in each jar = Remaining cookies / Number of jars = 50 / 5 = 10

"To determine the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids, we must first calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower. 

The orchids have 5 flowers, each with 5 petals. Using my expertise in multiplication, I can calculate the total number of petals for the orchids: 5 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 25 petals.

Similarly, the daisies have 4 flowers, each with 10 petals. Again, applying my knowledge of multiplication, I find the total number of petals for the daisies: 4 flowers * 10 petals/flower = 40 petals.

Now, to find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids, I will subtract the number of petals of the orchids from the number of petals of the daisies. Using my expertise in subtraction, I calculate: 40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals.

"To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we need to first determine the number of flowering plants. 

We know that one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants. So, the number of indoor plants is 1/4 * 100 = 25.

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 2/3 * 75 = 50.

Now, the number of flowering plants is the remaining plants minus the outdoor plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the speeds of the whirligig, whatchamacallit, and thingamabob. We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. We can express this relationship as:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now, we know that the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob. We can express this relationship as:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"To solve this problem, we can set up a simple equation. Let's denote the cost of one carrot as 'c'. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price, which is $3.

The total cost of Ellen's daily food is the sum of the cost of two carrots, the salad, and the yogurt. We can represent this as:

2c + 6 + 3 = 11

Combine the constants on the left side:

2c + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides to isolate the term with 'c':

2c = 2

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'c':

c = 1

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we'll first calculate his new hourly wage. His original wage was $10 per hour, and he received a $2 raise. Using my expertise in addition, I can confidently say that his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. By applying my knowledge of multiplication, I can calculate the total hours worked: 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we'll multiply Mark's hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: 40 hours/week * $12/hour = $480/week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into a system of linear equations. We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Let's denote the amount she made from lemonade sales as L and the amount she made from mowing lawns as M.

We can set up the following equation based on the given information:

L + M = 80

We also know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, and she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6 for one mowing, we can assume that's the rate for one mowing. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as J.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

Kamala's lawn: 3J * 6 = 18J
Alba's lawn: 5J * 6 = 30J
Joe's lawn: J * 6 = 6J

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is the sum of the amounts she made from mowing each lawn:

M = 18J + 30J + 6J
M = 54J

Since we know that J = 1 (she mowed Joe's lawn once), we can substitute this value into the equation:

M = 54(1)
M = 54

Now we can substitute the value of M into the first equation:

L + 54 = 80

Subtracting 54 from both sides gives us:

L = 26

Therefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

"To determine Harry's weight, we'll follow a step-by-step approach, utilizing our expertise in multi-step addition and subtraction.

First, we establish Martin's weight as the base: 55 kg. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's, so we add 16 kg to Martin's weight.

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight. We add 8 kg to Carl's weight to find Christian's weight.

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight. We subtract 5 kg from Christian's weight to find Harry's weight.

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

"To calculate John's profit, we must first determine his total earnings from renting out his car. Since he rents it out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, we can find the total hours by multiplying the number of rentals by the hours per rental: 10 x 3 = 30 hours.

Next, we multiply the total hours by his hourly rate of $25 to find his total earnings: 30 hours x $25/hour = $750.

Now, to find his profit, we subtract his car payment of $500 from his total earnings: $750 - $500 = $250.

"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the information given. Martha initially had some notebooks, then bought 5 more, and ended up with a total of 7 notebooks. This means she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

We are also told that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Let's represent Martha's initial number of notebooks as M. Then, Joseph's number of notebooks is 3M. Since Martha initially had 2 notebooks, we can set up the equation:

3M = 3(2)
3M = 6

This tells us that Joseph had 6 notebooks.

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's total from Martha's total: 7 - 6 = 1.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first determine the distance Anis rowed. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate this by finding 1/5 of Dijana's distance and adding it to her total.

Dijana rowed 50 miles. To find 1/5 of 50, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is the same as dividing by 5. So, 50 * 1/5 = 50 / 5 = 10 miles. This means Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana.

Now, we add the extra distance to Dijana's total to find Anis' distance: 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Finally, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to get the total distance: 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles.

Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now that we know there are 96 cookies remaining, we can divide this number by the number of nephews (6) to find out how many cookies each nephew will receive. This is a simple division problem.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the total number of bowls consumed by the family and then find the remaining amount.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, we can express the total capacity of the pot as 8 child bowls.

The family consists of 2 adults (Calvin and his wife) and 2 children. The 2 adults will consume 2 * 2 = 4 child bowls, and the 2 children will consume 2 child bowls. The total number of bowls consumed is 4 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

Now, let's calculate the leftover soup by subtracting the total number of bowls consumed from the pot's capacity: 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, we can divide the leftover soup (2 child bowls) by the number of children (2) to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch: 2 ÷ 2 = 1.

"To determine the total material needed, we can set up a system of equations based on the given ratios.

Let's define the number of sets of small masks as 'x' and the number of sets of large masks as 'y'. We know that Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material and 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.

For the small masks, we need 5 sets to make 20 masks (20 / 4 = 5). For the large masks, we need 2.67 sets to make 8 masks (8 / 3 = 2.67), but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll use the ratio to find the total material needed.

The total material needed for the small masks is 2x, and the total material needed for the large masks is 2.25y. We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

2x = material for small masks
2.25y = material for large masks

We know that x = 5 (since we need 5 sets of small masks) and y = 2.67 (since we need 2.67 sets of large masks, but we'll use 8/3 to maintain the ratio). However, to simplify the calculation, we can multiply the number of large masks by the material needed per set and divide by 3 to maintain the ratio.

Material for small masks = 2 * 5 = 10 yards
Material for large masks = (8/3) * 2.25 = 6 yards

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and set up an equation. Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8, and four years ago, Adam's age was A - 4. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:

60 = 2A

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

A = 30

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find his age in 8 years, we simply add 8 to his current age:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach. First, we'll determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm, and then we'll add it to the size of Farmer Brown's farm.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that. To find the size of Farmer Smith's farm, we'll multiply the size of Farmer Brown's farm by 2 and then add 100.

Size of Farmer Smith's farm = 2 * Size of Farmer Brown's farm + 100
Size of Farmer Smith's farm = 2 * 200 + 100
Size of Farmer Smith's farm = 400 + 100
Size of Farmer Smith's farm = 500 acres

Now that we know the size of both farms, we can find the total number of acres by adding them together.

Total miles driven in a month = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles driven in a month = 100 * 30
Total miles driven in a month = 3000 miles

Now, we need to divide the total miles driven by the miles required for a tune-up, which is 1000 miles.

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven in a month / miles required for a tune-up

"To determine the amount Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount they spent on the birthday surprise and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items they purchased. The cake costs $11. Since 1 dozen balloons contain 12 balloons and the balloons are sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons, we can calculate the cost of 1 dozen balloons as follows: 12 / 2 * $0.5 = 6 * $0.5 = $3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's find the total amount spent by adding the costs of the cake, balloons, and ice cream: $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we'll break down the information step by step.

First, Larry has 3 cats. Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, we can calculate the number of dogs by multiplying the number of cats by 3. This gives us 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, we subtract 2 from the number of dogs to find the number of rabbits: 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Moving on to the fish, Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. We multiply the number of rabbits by 3 to find the number of fish: 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

Finally, Larry's collection of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish he has. To find the number of gerbils, we divide the number of fish by 3: 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

"To determine the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the combined daily bread consumption of Abby and Josh. Abby's daily consumption is 2 slices, while Josh's is twice that amount, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

Now, let's add their daily consumption: 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices per day.

Next, we'll divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by their combined daily consumption (6 slices) to find the number of days the loaf will last.

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"The art of multiplication is at play here. To determine the total number of shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we must first establish the number of months she's been collecting. Since she started at 5 years old and will stop at 10, that's a span of 5 years.

Now, we multiply the number of years by the number of months in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we have:

5 years * 12 months/year = 5 * 12 = 60 months

Since Martha collects 1 shell per month, the total number of shells she'll have collected by her 10th birthday is equal to the number of months she's been collecting. Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea. Lana has 27 cups in total and uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea. 

The number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea can be found by subtracting the cups used for cinnamon tea from the total number of cups: 27 - 15 = 12 cups.

Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows, we can divide the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea (12) by the number of rows (3) to find the number of cups in each row: 12 ÷ 3 = 4 cups per row.

As there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we can divide the number of cups in each row by 2 to find the number of cups of mint tea in each row: 4 ÷ 2 = 2 cups.

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to consider the total time available (8 hours) and the time required for each trip (4 hours). 

Given that each trip takes 4 hours, the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.

Now, we need to divide the total number of berries the sloth wants to collect (24) by the number of trips (2). This will give us the minimum number of berries he must collect per trip to meet his goal.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. First, we need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate this by dividing the total amount of water in the pool (10000 gallons) by 2.

10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons

This means the tank is initially filled with 5000 gallons of water. Next, we need to calculate the amount of water emptied from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so we can multiply this rate by the number of days to find the total amount of water emptied.

500 * 6 = 3000 gallons

Now, we subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the amount of water remaining.

5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons

"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for his previous expenses.

Colby's monthly budget is $150. He has already spent money on the following items:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays at $10 each: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days at $7 each: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy at $2 each: 4 * $2 = $8

Total expenses so far: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Subtracting his total expenses from his monthly budget, we get:
$150 - $130 = $20

Since Colby wants to get a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2) tonight, we need to subtract these costs from his remaining budget:
$20 - $8 - $2 = $10

Now, we need to find out how many movies he can see with his remaining $10. Since it's a Friday, the movie ticket costs $10. Therefore, he can see 1 more movie.

"To determine the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the calories in a mini cinnamon roll. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, we can calculate the calories in a mini cinnamon roll by dividing the calories in a normal cinnamon roll by 3. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Next, we'll find the total calories from the 200 mini cinnamon rolls Andrew baked. We can do this by multiplying the number of mini cinnamon rolls by the calories in each: 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Now, let's calculate the calories in a mini blueberry muffin. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

We'll find the total calories from the 300 mini blueberry muffins by multiplying the number of mini blueberry muffins by the calories in each: 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we'll add the total calories from the cinnamon rolls and the blueberry muffins to find the total calories of all the pastries: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To determine the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we'll first calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five-day period. 

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs each day. Thursday's total was 48 Junebugs, and Friday's total was 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed:
Monday: 39
Tuesday: 78
Wednesday: 78
Thursday: 48
Friday: 57
Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300

To find the average, we'll divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days, which is 5.
Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 300 / 5

"To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled. As an expert in multiplication, I can assure you that the key to solving this problem lies in accurately multiplying the speed of each vehicle by the time it traveled.

The bus's distance can be calculated by multiplying its speed (60 miles per hour) by the time it traveled (5 hours). This results in a distance of 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

Similarly, the car's distance can be calculated by multiplying its speed (30 miles per hour) by the time it traveled (8 hours). This results in a distance of 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

Now, to find the difference in distance, we simply subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance. As an expert in subtraction, I can confidently perform this calculation: 300 - 240 = 60.

"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we need to calculate the total number of toys excluding the bouncy balls and then subtract that from the total number of toys.

First, let's add the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings: 
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we know the total number of toys, including the bouncy balls, is 62. To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the total number of toys excluding the bouncy balls from the total number of toys:
62 (total toys) - 48 (toys excluding bouncy balls) = 14

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as L, and John's age as J.

We know that:
1. P + L + J = 100 (combined age is 100 years)
2. L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can simplify equation 2 to express L in terms of J. Then, we can substitute this expression into equations 1 and 3 to reduce the number of variables.

Substituting L = J + 10 into equation 3:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute L = J + 10 and P = 2J + 10 into equation 1:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know J, we can find L:
L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10
L = 30

Now that we know L and J, we can find P:
P = L + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The age of Peter is 50 years.

"To calculate the total number of balloons, we'll break it down into two parts: the initial number of balloons and the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

First, let's find the initial number of balloons. Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so the total number of balloons her friends had was 4 * 2 = 8. Adding Maria's 1 balloon, the initial total is 8 + 1 = 9.

Next, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total additional number of balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we simply add the initial and additional balloons to find the total: 9 + 15 = 24.

"To determine the number of new tables the charity group needs, we must first calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

The total number of boxes donated is found by multiplying the number of people (10) by the number of boxes each person donates (5), which equals 10 * 5 = 50 boxes.

Adding the 10 boxes they already have, the total number of boxes becomes 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since each table can hold 2 boxes, we divide the total number of boxes (60) by the number of boxes per table (2), which equals 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

Given that they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables needed is found by subtracting the number of tables they own from the total number of tables required, which equals 30 - 15 = 15.

"To determine the difference in earnings between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the monthly production rate of each machine and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the daily production rate of each machine. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour, so in 24 hours, it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets per day. The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour, so in 24 hours, it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets per day.

Next, let's calculate the monthly production rate of each machine. Assuming a 30-day month, the Widgeteer 3000 will make 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets per month, and the WidgetMaster 9000 will make 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets per month.

Now, let's calculate the monthly earnings of each machine. Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 will make 43200 * 6 = $259200 per month, and the WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32400 * 6 = $194400 per month.

The difference in monthly earnings between the two machines is $259200 - $194400 = $64800.

"To determine the cost savings, we need to calculate the total cost of Cameron's stay using both options.

First, let's analyze the duration of his stay. Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. 
The additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) would cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. We know that each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Amount each sheep needs = 2 * 5 - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 10 - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 7 pounds

Now that we know the amount each sheep needs, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep. We have 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, so the total amount of hay needed for the goats is:

Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75 pounds

We have 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay, so the total amount of hay needed for the sheep is:

Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84 pounds

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed by adding the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159 pounds

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate John's total earnings. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 * 6 = 300 dollars

Next, we'll subtract his expenses. He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has:
300 - 50 = 250 dollars left

He also wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we'll subtract that amount as well:
250 - 100 = 150 dollars left

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pencils. He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends:
5 * 10 = 50 dollars

We'll subtract this amount from his remaining balance:
150 - 50 = 100 dollars left

Finally, we'll determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with his remaining balance. To do this, we'll divide the remaining amount by the cost of a pen:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig and his brother. 

First, let's find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig. Since Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word.
Craig's total letters = 20 words * 15 letters/word = 300 letters.

Now, we know that Craig's brother spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. To find the brother's total letters, we add 50 to Craig's total letters.
Brother's total letters = 300 + 50 = 350 letters.

Finally, we calculate the total number of letters in the words they've spelled by adding Craig's total letters and his brother's total letters.
Total letters = 300 + 350 = 650 letters.

"To determine the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to break down the costs into three components: the visit charge, labor cost, and parts cost.

The visit charge is a flat rate of $40. The labor cost is calculated at $35 per hour, or part thereof. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we round up to the nearest hour, resulting in a labor cost of 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

The parts cost for the job is $60. Now, we can calculate the total charge by adding the visit charge, labor cost, and parts cost:

Total charge = Visit charge + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60
Total charge = $205

Since James got a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150 and subtract it from the total cost to find the amount he paid. 
40% of $150 is 0.4 * $150 = $60.
The amount he paid is $150 - $60 = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, let's calculate the distance James swims at his initial pace. Since he swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, we can find the distance by multiplying 20 miles by 0.6, which gives us 12 miles. To find the time taken to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour, we can use the formula time = distance / rate. Plugging in the values, we get time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. Since he swam for 6 hours, he rests for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim. Since he swam 12 miles out of the 20-mile distance, the remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, James swims at half his initial speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. To find the time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed, we can use the formula time = distance / rate. Plugging in the values, we get time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

Finally, we can find the total time taken by adding the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

10 copies of the Wall Street Journal at $15 per copy is 10 * $15 = $150.

Next, we'll calculate the commission for each newspaper. 
The commission rate for the New York Times is 10%, so the commission is $30 * 0.10 = $3.
The commission rate for the Wall Street Journal is 8%, so the commission is $150 * 0.08 = $12.

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Deanna is 26 years old and Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna. This allows us to set up an equation for Marcus' age: Marcus = Deanna - 5. Substituting Deanna's age, we get Marcus = 26 - 5 = 21.

Next, we are given that Marcus is half of Leo's age. We can represent this relationship as an equation: Marcus = (1/2)Leo. Since we already know Marcus' age, we can substitute this value into the equation: 21 = (1/2)Leo.

To solve for Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us: 2 * 21 = Leo. Therefore, Leo's age is 42.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations with three variables. Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D.

We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored, so we can write an equation: B = A + 20.

We also know that Bahati's points were 10 more than Dinar's points, so we can write another equation: B = D + 10.

Lastly, we know that the total points scored by the three is 45, so we can write the equation: A + B + D = 45.

Now, we can solve this system of linear equations. Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10, which simplifies to A = D - 10.

Substituting A = D - 10 into the equation A + B + D = 45, we get (D - 10) + (D + 10) + D = 45.

Combine like terms to get 3D = 45.

Divide both sides by 3 to get D = 15.

Now that we have D, we can find A using the equation A = D - 10, so A = 15 - 10 = 5.

"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the relationship between the physical dimensions of the book and the page count. Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick and there are 100 pages to the inch, we can establish a baseline for our calculation.

However, it's crucial to account for the fact that each paper is printed on both sides, effectively doubling the page count per inch. Therefore, we have 100 pages per inch * 2 (to account for both sides) = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we can multiply the total number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book to find the total number of pages. 

Total number of pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches
Total number of pages = 300 pages

"To determine the total number of reports stapled, we first need to calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. The time elapsed from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 15 hours to minutes by multiplying:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the total number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes, we divide:
900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Given that Vince staples 30 reports per interval, we can calculate the total number of reports stapled by multiplying the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

"To determine the total minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep duration and subtract the time spent sleepwalking and waking up early.

Kim's usual sleep schedule is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, on this particular day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so we subtract those 5 minutes from her total sleep time: 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

Additionally, Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is a duration of 23 minutes. To find this duration, we can calculate the difference between the two times: 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has in relation to his measuring cups. We are given that he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups.

Let's denote the number of measuring cups as C and the number of measuring spoons as S. We know that Jonathan has 2 dozen cups, so C = 2 * 12 = 24.

We are also given that S = (2/3)C. Substituting the value of C, we get S = (2/3) * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16.

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is S - 6 = 16 - 6 = 10.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the number of cups and the number of measuring spoons: C + (S - 6) = 24 + 10 = 34.

"To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the initial number of occupied and unoccupied beds. Given that 1/5 of the hospital's 1000 beds are occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied beds as follows:

Number of occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 0.2 * 1000 = 200 beds

Now, we can find the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the occupied beds from the hospital's capacity:

Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Next, we'll calculate the number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks. With 50 patients admitted each day, the total number of new patients in 14 days is:

Number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Since these new patients will occupy beds, we'll add them to the initial number of occupied beds:

Total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Finally, we can find the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks by subtracting the total occupied beds from the hospital's capacity:

Total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of non-work emails. Since Robyn sends 16 emails a day and 7 are work emails, the number of non-work emails is:
16 (total emails) - 7 (work emails) = 9

Next, we're told that two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. To find the number of emails to family, we'll multiply the non-work emails by 2/3:
(2/3) * 9 = 6

Now, we need to find the number of emails to others, including her boyfriend. Since 6 out of the 9 non-work emails are to family, the remaining emails are:
9 (non-work emails) - 6 (emails to family) = 3

Finally, we're told that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. To find the number of emails to her boyfriend, we'll multiply the remaining emails by 1/3:
(1/3) * 3 = 1

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps. 

First, we know Aliya's age, which is 3 years. We also know Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. To find Shawna's age, we multiply Aliya's age by 3. 

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age. Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we multiply Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the 20% decrease from the number Courtney reported. 

First, find 20% of 48: 
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from the number Courtney reported to find the actual number of people who attended the concert:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Since the number of people must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number.

The final answer is: 38"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the number of balls each boy carried. Let's say Jeffrey carried x balls. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls. Given that Jason carried 2 balls, we can set up the equation 2x = 2. Solving for x, we find x = 1.

Now that we know Jeffrey carried 1 ball, we can find the number of balls Jordan carried. Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

To find the total number of balls, we add the number of balls each boy carried: 
Jeffrey's balls + Jason's balls + Jordan's balls = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7

Total number of balls: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the pirates at the end of the third day. They dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they also filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is:

10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 8 (third day) - 2 (filled in) = 29

Now, we are told that the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:

4 * 10 = 40

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day:

40 (end of fourth day) - 29 (end of third day) = 11

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of corn chips Amora and Lainey received as x. Since Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora and Lainey, Collins received x + 15 corn chips.

We are given that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, so we can set up the equation x = 70.

Now, we can find the number of corn chips Collins received by substituting x into the expression x + 15: 
70 + 15 = 85

To find the total number of corn chips, we add the amount each person received: 
70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225

"To determine the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of supplies and then add that amount to the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. Since 50% is equivalent to 0.5, we multiply the cost of supplies by 0.5. 

Cost of supplies = $400
50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200

Now, we add the 50% amount to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel.

Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Cost of travel = $400 + $200
Cost of travel = $600

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught as 'x', the number of Pokémon Stan has caught as 'y', and the number of Pokémon Alex has caught as 'z'.

We know that the total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so we can write the equation:
x + y + z = 339

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write the equation:
z = y + 5

Additionally, we know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write the equation:
y = 4x - 13

Now we have a system of three equations with three variables. We can substitute the expression for z from the second equation into the first equation:
x + y + (y + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
x + 2y + 5 = 339

Subtract 5 from both sides:
x + 2y = 334

Now, substitute the expression for y from the third equation into the equation above:
x + 2(4x - 13) = 334

Expand and simplify:
x + 8x - 26 = 334

Combine like terms:
9x - 26 = 334

Add 26 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon Stan has caught:
y = 4x - 13
y = 4(40) - 13
y = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To determine the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to establish the total number of episodes. Given that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can calculate the number of episodes by dividing the minutes per episode by 2. 

Minutes per episode: 20
Number of episodes: 20 / 2 = 10 episodes

Now, we can find the total minutes by multiplying the number of episodes by the minutes per episode. This is a straightforward multiplication problem.

Total minutes = Number of episodes * Minutes per episode
Total minutes = 10 * 20
Total minutes = 200

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we'll break down the journey into its three segments and calculate the distance traveled in each.

First, the bird flies south at 30 miles per hour for 10 hours, covering a distance of:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

Next, the bird changes direction and flies north at 18 miles per hour for 2 hours, covering a distance of:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance will be subtracted from the total distance traveled south.

Finally, the bird changes direction again and flies south at 22 miles per hour for 5 hours, covering a distance of:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we add the distances traveled south and subtract the distance traveled north:
Total Distance = Distance traveled south in the first leg + Distance traveled south in the third leg - Distance traveled north in the second leg
Total Distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Total Distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To determine the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had initially and then subtract the number of brownies eaten.

First, let's calculate the total number of brownies. Greta made 1 dozen brownies, which is equivalent to 12 brownies. Her office gave her 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies (since 1/2 * 12 = 6). Her friends gave her 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

Now, let's add these values together: 
12 (Greta's brownies) + 6 (office brownies) + 48 (friends' brownies) = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. To convert this to a numerical value, we multiply 1 1/2 by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12). 
1 1/2 * 12 = 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Now, let's subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies: 
66 (total brownies) - 18 (brownies eaten) = 48 brownies.

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

To find Nani's sister's age, we need to calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from his age. 
25% is equivalent to 1/4, so we can calculate 1/4 of 8, which is 8 / 4 = 2 years.
So, Nani's sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we can calculate the total age of all three family members:
Nani's age: 8 years
Nani's brother's age: 16 years
Nani's sister's age: 6 years
Total age: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years

"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them up.

First, let's calculate the time for each type of string:
- Synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
- Polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
- Hybrid sets: Since a hybrid set is half synthetic gut and half polyester string, we can assume the time for a hybrid set is the average of the two. However, the problem statement already provides the time for a hybrid set as 18 minutes, so we will use that. 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, let's add up the time for all the racquets:
Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

"A delightful problem in multiplication and addition. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we have the full-price phones for John and his wife, which amounts to 2 * $600 = $1200.

Next, we have the half-price phones for the 2 kids. To calculate this, we multiply the number of phones by the discounted price: 2 * ($600 / 2) = 2 * $300 = $600.

Now, we simply add the costs of the full-price and half-price phones to get the total: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

Number of players in Zeke's team = 13 + 7
= 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team:

Total number of players = 20 + 13

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet.

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since the perimeter represents the total length of fencing, and Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we can find the total number of slats by multiplying the perimeter by 2.

Total slats = 2 * 50
Total slats = 100

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

First, let's find the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought. Since she bought 12 boxes, and each box contains 20 oranges, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box:
12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

Next, we need to find out how many oranges she gave away. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. To find the total number of oranges she gave away, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box:
4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, we subtract the number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought to find out how many oranges she has left:
240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges

The problem states that Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges. To find 1/4 of 160, we multiply 160 by 1/4:
160 oranges * 1/4 = 160 oranges / 4 = 40 oranges

Since she kept 40 oranges, we subtract this from the remaining oranges to find out how many oranges she sold:
160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of states in India. We are given that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Let's denote the number of states in the USA as x. Since the USA has 50 states, x = 50.

Now, we can calculate the number of states in India. Half the number of states in the USA is x/2, and 4 more than that is x/2 + 4. Since x = 50, the number of states in India is 50/2 + 4 = 25 + 4 = 29.

Now that we know the number of states in both countries, we can find the total number of states. The total number of states is the sum of the number of states in the USA and India, which is 50 + 29 = 79.

"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the books. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. To find the total cost, we add these amounts together:

$18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find out how much more he needs:

$39 - $14 = $25

Now, we know Tyler needs to earn $25 more to afford his books. He earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5):

$25 ÷ $5 = 5

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Richard, Jerry, and Robert are sharing 60 cherries. Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as R, Jerry has as J, and Robert has as 30 (since we already know this).

We are also given that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so we can write an equation based on this information:

R + 10 = 30

Solving for R, we get:

R = 20

Now we know Richard has 20 cherries. Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries, we can find the number of cherries Jerry has:

J = 60 - 50
J = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

Difference = Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries
= 30 - 10

"To tackle this problem, let's break it down step by step. We'll start by defining the variables:

Let Gs be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
Let Gd be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
Let Ps be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
Let Pd be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

We're given the following information:

1. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so Gs = 10.
2. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so Gd = Gs + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.
3. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie, so Pd = 15.
4. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so Ps = Pd - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11.

Now, we can calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold:

Total gingerbread = Gs + Gd = 10 + 15 = 25
Total apple pie = Ps + Pd = 11 + 15 = 26

The cost of each box of gingerbread is $6, and the cost of each box of apple pie is $15. To find the total amount earned, we multiply the total number of boxes by their respective costs:

Total earnings from gingerbread = 25 * $6 = $150
Total earnings from apple pie = 26 * $15 = $390

Adding these amounts together, we get the total amount Sunny earned:

$150 + $390 = $540

Given the price of the blue car is $100, we can find the discount on the red car by calculating 40% of $100. This is done by multiplying $100 by 0.4, which equals $40. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car: $100 - $40 = $60.

Finally, we add the price of the blue car to the price of the red car to find the total cost: $100 + $60 = $160.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's current age as D, and his brother's current age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This can be represented as:
24 = (D + 5) / 2

We can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
48 = D + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:
D = 43

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This can be represented as:
24 = 2(B + 5)

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
12 = B + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:
B = 7

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother:
Sum = D + B
Sum = 43 + 7

"To calculate the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we need to determine the total pounds of crawfish he caught.

First, let's calculate the amount he caught on Friday, which is 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday. Since he caught 3 pounds on Thursday, we multiply 3 by 4 to get 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.

Next, we calculate the amount he caught on Saturday, which is half the amount of his Friday's catch. To find half of 12, we multiply 12 by 1/2 or divide 12 by 2, resulting in 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, we add the pounds of crawfish he caught on each day: 3 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) + 6 (Saturday) = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds by 3 to find the total number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To determine the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members in Mr. Roper's class.

First, we'll find the number of football players by calculating 20% of the total number of students in the class, which is 30. To do this, we multiply 30 by 0.20 (the decimal equivalent of 20%).

30 * 0.20 = 6

So, there are 6 football players in the class.

Next, we'll find the number of remaining students by subtracting the number of football players from the total number of students.

30 - 6 = 24

Now, we'll calculate the number of cheerleaders and band members, which is 25% of the remaining students. To do this, we multiply 24 by 0.25 (the decimal equivalent of 25%).

24 * 0.25 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders and band members.

Finally, we'll add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders and band members to find the total number of students leaving early.

Charlie's boot size = 5 * 5 = 25

Now, we can find the total size of their shoes by adding Sophie's boot size to Charlie's boot size.

Total size = 5 + 25 = 30

Finally, we can calculate the average size of their shoes by dividing the total size by 2.

Average size = 30 / 2 = 15

"To determine the total cost of filling the flower bed, we need to calculate the number of flowers required and then multiply that by the cost per flower.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, as the width of the flowers is given in inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches.

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Each plant takes up 12 inches, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space each plant takes up is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space each plant takes up.

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants. However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

Next, we calculate the soil used for the carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, we add the soil used for both sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Since they started with 30 pounds of soil, we subtract the soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Given that each rose requires 1 pound of soil, we can now find the number of roses they can plant:

"To determine the number of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we'll first calculate the amount she sets aside each month for fancy shoes. Given that she earns $2,000.00 per month and allocates 25% of her income towards shoes, we can find the monthly allocation as follows:

Monthly income: $2,000.00
Percentage allocated: 25% or 0.25
Monthly allocation: $2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

Next, we'll calculate the total amount she sets aside in a year by multiplying the monthly allocation by 12:

Total yearly allocation: $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we'll divide the total yearly allocation by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many shoes she can buy in a year:

Cost per pair: $1,000.00
Number of shoes: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Emily to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to cook the shrimp separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the time it takes Emily to peel the shrimp. We know she can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we can divide the total number of shrimp by her peeling rate: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes Emily to cook the shrimp. We know she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find her cooking rate, we can divide the number of shrimp by the time: 30 shrimp / 10 minutes = 3 shrimp/minute. Now, we can divide the total number of shrimp by her cooking rate to find the time it takes her to cook 90 shrimp: 90 shrimp / 3 shrimp/minute = 30 minutes.

The total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the peeling time and the cooking time: 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

"To determine the final temperature difference, we must consider the cumulative effect of the varying cooling and warming rates over time.

First, we'll calculate the temperature change during the 3 hours the air conditioner ran on low, cooling the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour. This results in a temperature decrease of 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.

Next, we'll calculate the temperature change during the 4 hours the air conditioner ran on high, cooling the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour. This results in a temperature decrease of 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is the sum of these two periods: 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours, resulting in a temperature increase of 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.

To find the net temperature change, we subtract the warming effect from the total cooling effect: 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information given. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Now, let's focus on Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time. According to the problem, Bill was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Now, we know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. This means that Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it for the second time. To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we subtract 75 from his age when he saw it for the second time: 90 - 75 = 15.

"The art of calculating the total number of checks Buford writes per year is a straightforward yet elegant exercise in multiplication and addition. Let's break it down with precision.

First, we have the monthly checks for the electric bill and the gas bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of checks per month by 12. This gives us 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year for each of these bills. So, we have 12 checks/year for the electric bill and 12 checks/year for the gas bill.

Next, we have the church checks, which are written twice a month. Again, we multiply the number of checks per month by 12, resulting in 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year.

Lastly, we have the quarterly checks for the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, we multiply the number of checks per quarter by 4, giving us 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks with the finesse of a master mathematician:
12 (electric bill) + 12 (gas bill) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52

"To solve this problem, let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as F. We know that the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. We can set up the equation:

44 = F/2

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

88 = F

So, the first plane makes 88 flights.

Since the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, we can calculate the number of flights to Greece as:

Flights to Greece = (3/4)F
= (3/4)(88)
= 66

The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights, which are split equally between France and Germany. Let's denote the number of flights to France as x. We can set up the equation:

x + x = 22 (since the flights are split equally between France and Germany)

Combine like terms:

2x = 22

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 11

So, the number of flights to France is 11.

"The harmonious howls of the three little wolves. Let's break down the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias's howl lasts 20 seconds. Chikote's howl, being twice as long as Tobias's, can be calculated by multiplying 20 by 2, which equals 40 seconds. Now, Igneous's howl is the sum of Tobias's and Chikote's howls, so we add 20 + 40, resulting in 60 seconds.

To find the combined length of time, we add the durations of all three howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide 120 by 60 to convert the time to minutes, yielding 2 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam's mother gave him $6 for the trousers. His father, being the generous one, gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, let's add the amounts given by both parents to find the total amount Adam received: $6 (from mother) + $12 (from father) = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children. We also know the ages of Akbar (3 years old) and Alessandro (4 years old).

We can write the equation for the total age as:
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:
H + W = 13

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Since there are 4 children, the average age is the total age divided by 4, which is 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now we can substitute H = 10 into the equation H + W = 13:
10 + W = 13

Subtract 10 from both sides:
W = 3

"To determine the lawyer's contribution, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. This can be found by adding the $500 collected from the neighbors to the $1500 collected from the online fund.

$500 + $1500 = $2000

The lawyer's contribution is three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. We can find this by multiplying the total amount collected by 3.

$2000 * 3 = $6000

"To determine the number of people in the church next door, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to find the total number of cookies brought by the guests. Since each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, we can calculate the total number of cookies as follows:

Total number of cookies = Number of guests * Number of cookies per guest
Total number of cookies = 100 * 15
Total number of cookies = 1500

Next, we need to find the number of cookies given to the church. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church, so we'll multiply the total number of cookies by 1/2:

Number of cookies given to the church = 1/2 * Total number of cookies
Number of cookies given to the church = 1/2 * 1500
Number of cookies given to the church = 750

Now, we know that each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we'll divide the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

Number of people in the church next door = Number of cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
Number of people in the church next door = 750 / 15
Number of people in the church next door = 50

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We have a family of 6, consisting of 2 adults and 4 kids, who are dividing a watermelon. Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

Now, let's find the total number of slices. We can represent the total number of slices as the sum of the parts: 4 kids' slices (4x) and 2 adults' slices (2 * 2x = 4x). The total number of slices is 4x + 4x = 8x.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices each adult gets (2x) by the total number of slices (8x) and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (2x / 8x) * 100
= (1/4) * 100
= 25%

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine the time Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds. With 9 inpatients at 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time spent on rounds is 9 * 20 = 180 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time spent on appointments. With 10 appointments at 30 minutes per appointment, the total time spent on appointments is 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments to get the total time spent on these tasks: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours.

Finally, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time spent at the clinic: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we subtract the total time from the target serving time of 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

The latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation using the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Since Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, the total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes. We know that they sold 64 chocolate bars together. 

We can set up the equation as follows: 8x = 64, where 'x' is the number of chocolate bars in a box.

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 8.

x = 64 / 8
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to break down the costs and revenue.

First, let's calculate the revenue per session. The studio earns $25 for renting the space and $1.50 per student. With 10 students, the revenue from students is $1.50 * 10 = $15. Adding the rent, the total revenue per session is $25 + $15 = $40.

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly revenue is $40 * 3 = $120.

To find the monthly revenue, we multiply the weekly revenue by the number of weeks in a month. Assuming a 4-week month, the monthly revenue is $120 * 4 = $480.

"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as P and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as M. We are given that Peter has 4 boxes and Martha has 7 boxes.

We can set up the following system of linear equations based on the given information:

4P = 64
7M = 56

To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we can solve for P and M by dividing both sides of each equation by the respective number of boxes.

P = 64 / 4
P = 16

M = 56 / 7
M = 8

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha. This can be calculated as:

Difference = P - M

"To determine the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

Now, we know there are 30 female porcupines. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. To find the total number of babies born in a month, we multiply the number of female porcupines by 4.

30 * 4 = 120

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of babies born in a month by 12 to find the total number of babies born in a year.

120 * 12 = 1440

To find the total number of porcupines after a year, we add the initial population to the number of babies born in a year.

50 + 1440 = 1490

"To calculate the volume of the pool, we'll use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length times width times height. Given the dimensions of the pool - 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep - we can plug these values into the formula.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 25 * 14 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the gallons of water needed. Let's perform this calculation.

Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260

Now, to find the cost of filling the pool at $0.10 per gallon, we'll multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = gallons * $0.10
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down step by step. Let's start by identifying the information given:

- Number of red sticks: 9
- Number of blue sticks: 5 more than the number of red sticks
- Number of yellow sticks: 3 less than the number of blue sticks

We can represent the number of blue sticks as 9 + 5, since it's 5 more than the number of red sticks. Similarly, the number of yellow sticks can be represented as (9 + 5) - 3, since it's 3 less than the number of blue sticks.

Now, let's calculate the number of blue and yellow sticks:
Number of blue sticks: 9 + 5 = 14
Number of yellow sticks: 14 - 3 = 11

To find the total number of sticks, we simply add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:

"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate Matteo's distance by multiplying his speed (55 miles per hour) by the time he traveled (4 hours). This is a straightforward multiplication problem: 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Next, we'll calculate Shandy's distance by multiplying her speed (45 miles per hour) by the time she traveled (10 hours). Again, this is a simple multiplication problem: 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

Now that we have the distances, we can find the difference by subtracting Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance. This is a basic subtraction problem: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.

"To find the total number of female students, we need to calculate the number of male students and subtract that from the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students over 16 years old. Since half of the students are over 16, we can calculate this as 3000 * (1/2) = 1500 students.

Next, we'll find the number of male students over 16. Since one-fourth of the students over 16 are male, we can calculate this as 1500 * (1/4) = 375 students.

Now, let's find the number of students under 16 years old. Since the remaining half of the students are under 16, we can calculate this as 3000 * (1/2) = 1500 students.

Then, we'll find the number of male students under 16. Since one-half of the students under 16 are male, we can calculate this as 1500 * (1/2) = 750 students.

The total number of male students is 375 + 750 = 1125.

To find the total number of female students, we subtract the total number of male students from the total number of students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days.

First, let's calculate the amount of water Wanda pumped on the first day. Since she filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, we multiply the tank's capacity by 1/4: 18000 * 1/4 = 18000 / 4 = 4500 gallons.

Next, we calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the first day. Since she pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, we multiply Wanda's amount by 3/4: 4500 * 3/4 = 4500 * 0.75 = 3375 gallons.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water Wanda pumped on the second day. Since she pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, we multiply her previous amount by 2/3: 4500 * 2/3 = 4500 * 0.67 = 3000 gallons.

Finally, we calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the second day. Since she pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, we multiply her previous amount by 1/3: 3375 * 1/3 = 3375 * 0.33 = 1125 gallons.

Now, we add up the total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days: 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge of the power bank. 

First, we know that the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours. This means that the charge before this period was 28% (the final charge) + 21% (the total loss during the 3 hours), which equals 49%.

Next, we need to account for the loss of 9% of the total capacity each hour for 5 hours. This means that the charge before this period was 49% + 45% (the total loss during the 5 hours), which equals 94%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we'll first calculate her total hourly earnings. She makes $10 an hour from wages and an additional $15 an hour from tips, resulting in a total of $25 per hour.

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 per hour * 40 hours per week = $1000 per week.

The down payment for the $10000 car is 20% of the car's price. To calculate 20% of $10000, we multiply $10000 by 0.20, which equals $2000.

Now, we'll divide the down payment amount by Janet's weekly earnings to find out how many weeks she needs to work to save the down payment: $2000 / $1000 per week = 2 weeks.

"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased and subtract that from the $10 he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits purchased:
3 peaches at $.5 each = 3 * .5 = $1.5
4 pears at $.5 each = 4 * .5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each = 2 * 1 = $2
5 apples at $.75 each = 5 * .75 = $3.75

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total:
$1.5 + $2 = $3.5
$3.5 + $2 = $5.5
$5.5 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has spent $9.25 on fruits so far. To find out how much he has left, we subtract this amount from the $10 he had initially:
$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Now that we know Jamaar has $0.75 left, we can divide this amount by the cost of a plum ($.25) to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 ÷ $.25 = 3

"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we first need to determine the number of pictures in each album. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures (72) by the number of albums (8).

Let x be the number of pictures in each album. Then, we can set up the equation:

8x = 72

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 8:

x = 72 / 8
x = 9

Now that we know there are 9 pictures in each album, we can find the total number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, we can multiply the number of albums by the number of pictures per album:

Number of selfies = 3 * 9 = 27
Number of portraits = 2 * 9 = 18

Finally, we can find the total number of portraits and selfies by adding the two values:

Total number of portraits and selfies = 27 + 18

"To determine the number of points Aries is sure to get, we'll first calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the 60-item quiz.

Given that 40% of the questions are easy, we can find the number of easy questions as follows:
40% of 60 = (40/100) * 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

The remaining 60% of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions. To find the number of average and difficult questions, we can calculate:
60% of 60 = (60/100) * 60 = 0.6 * 60 = 36 questions.
Since these are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S.

We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation based on this relationship:

S = 2L

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is $12. The total earnings from the sales is $120, so we can set up another equation based on this information:

4S + 12L = 120

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

S = 2L
4S + 12L = 120

We can substitute the expression for S from the first equation into the second equation:

4(2L) + 12L = 120

Simplify the equation:

8L + 12L = 120

Combine like terms:

20L = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

L = 6

Now that we have found L, we can find S by substituting L into one of the original equations:

S = 2L
S = 2(6)
S = 12

The number of small stuffed animals sold is 12."

"To determine how much money Suzanne has left from her earnings, we'll start by calculating her total earnings. She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80. She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, resulting in earnings of 60 * $4 = $240.

Now, let's find her total earnings by adding the earnings from cookies and cupcakes: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her, so the total amount she gave away is 2 * $10 = $20.

To find out how much money she has left, we'll subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

"The art of subtraction is a wondrous thing. Let's apply it to this delightful Easter egg hunt conundrum.

We know the Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs. The Smith twins, those egg-finding prodigies, each discovered 30 eggs. So, their combined total is 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

Now, to find out how many eggs the friends found, we'll subtract the eggs found by the Smith twins and the 10 eggs that remained hidden from the total number of eggs. This can be represented as:

100 (total eggs) - 60 (eggs found by the Smith twins) - 10 (eggs not found) = ?

Performing the subtraction, we get:

100 - 60 = 40
40 - 10 = 30

"To determine the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we establish the baseline: one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 

Next, we calculate the amount of ore the same dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe, which is twice as much as with his bare hands. This is calculated as 12 pounds/day * 2 = 24 pounds/day.

Then, we calculate the amount of ore the dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe, which is 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. To find 50% of 24 pounds, we multiply 24 by 0.5, which equals 12 pounds. Adding this to the amount mined with an iron pickaxe, we get 24 pounds + 12 pounds = 36 pounds/day.

Now, we multiply the amount each dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe by the number of dwarves and the number of days in a month (30 days): 36 pounds/day * 40 dwarves * 30 days = 43,200 pounds.

"To determine the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the unit rate, or price per sandwich, of the given packages. 

The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3. We can find the price per sandwich by dividing the total cost by the number of sandwiches: $3 ÷ 2 = $1.50 per sandwich.

The second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6. Similarly, we can find the price per sandwich: $6 ÷ 4 = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich remains constant across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich for the third package is also $1.50.

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.50 * 8 = $12.

"To determine the monthly payment, we first need to calculate the remaining amount Tom owes after using the $1000 from selling his old bedroom set.

The initial cost of the bedroom set is $3000, and he received $1000 from selling his old set. To find the remaining amount owed, we subtract the amount received from the initial cost:

$3000 (initial cost) - $1000 (amount received) = $2000 (remaining amount owed)

Now, we need to calculate 10% of the remaining amount owed to find the monthly payment. To do this, we multiply the remaining amount by 0.10 (which is equivalent to 10%):

$2000 (remaining amount owed) * 0.10 = $200

"To determine the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Since 40% of the 25 red balloons burst, we'll find 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, the number of red balloons that burst is 10, leaving Sally with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

The green balloons were unaffected, so Sally still has 7 green balloons.

Next, we'll calculate the number of yellow balloons Sally released. Since she released half of the 12 yellow balloons, we'll divide 12 by 2, which equals 6. This means Sally released 6 yellow balloons, leaving her with 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Now, let's consider the blue balloons. Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her collection. To find 75% of 8, we'll multiply 8 by 0.75, which equals 6. So, Sally added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Finally, we'll add up the number of balloons Sally has: 
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"To determine the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the various scenarios and their corresponding probabilities.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The probability that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework is 50% or 0.5.
2. If the normal teacher comes in (with a probability of 0.5), there are two possible outcomes:
   a. The teacher gives everyone an extension (with a probability of 0.4). The probability of this scenario is 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.
   b. The teacher doesn't give an extension (with a probability of 0.6). In this case, there are two possible outcomes:
      i. Marcus can't convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment (with a probability of 0.8). The probability of this scenario is 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24.
      ii. Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and gets a personal extension (with a probability of 0.2). The probability of this scenario is 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.06.

Now, let's calculate the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow. This is the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus not getting a personal extension: 0.24.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.24 * 100 = 24%.

"To determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive, we need to first calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family. 

The Fine Arts Center has a capacity of 6000 people. We subtract the seats reserved for graduates (950) and faculty (300) from the total capacity to find the available seats.

Available seats for friends and family = Total capacity - (Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty)
Available seats for friends and family = 6000 - (950 + 300)
Available seats for friends and family = 6000 - 1250
Available seats for friends and family = 4750

Now, we divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive. Since 950 seats are reserved for graduates, we can assume that the number of graduates is 950.

Tickets per graduate = Available seats for friends and family / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans and Grandpa's eating capacity. We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we can set up a ratio of large beans to medium beans as 1:2. This means for every 1 large bean, he can eat 2 medium beans. Therefore, the number of medium beans he can eat is 2 * 75 = 150.

Next, we are given that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. This sets up another ratio of small beans to medium beans as 3:1. To find the number of small beans he can eat, we can multiply the number of medium beans by 3, as the ratio indicates that 3 small beans are equivalent to 1 medium bean. Therefore, the number of small beans he can eat is 150 * 3 = 450.

"To determine Melissa's hourly rate after expenses, we need to calculate her total compensation and total expenditures, then subtract her expenditures from her compensation and divide by the total hours worked.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked. Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, resulting in a total of 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

Next, we'll calculate her total compensation. She earns $15 per day for 3 days, totaling 15 * 3 = $45.

Now, let's factor in her daily expenses. Melissa pays $3 per day for parking, resulting in a total expenditure of 3 * 3 = $9.

To find her take-home pay, we subtract her total expenses from her total compensation: $45 - $9 = $36.

Finally, we calculate her hourly rate after expenses by dividing her take-home pay by the total hours worked: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

Total number of apples = 40 * 2
Total number of apples = 80

Now, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in one pack to find the number of packs.

Number of packs = Total number of apples / Number of apples in one pack
Number of packs = 80 / 8

"To determine how much money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased and subtract that amount from her initial cash.

First, we'll find the cost of the Parmesan cheese. Since it's $11 per pound and Amor bought 2 pounds, the total cost is 2 * $11 = $22.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese. At $6 per pound, 3 pounds will cost 3 * $6 = $18.

Now, we add the costs of both types of cheese to find the total cost: $22 + $18 = $40.

"To determine the time it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of loans and the total amount of lost income.

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans. Since Jim receives $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, the total amount of loans is:

$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, we'll calculate the total amount of lost income. Jim had a $25,000 per year job before college, and he didn't work for 4 years. Therefore, the total amount of lost income is:

$25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000

The total amount Jim needs to earn is the sum of the total amount of loans and the total amount of lost income:

$200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

After graduating, Jim's college degree triples his income, resulting in a new annual income of:

$25,000 * 3 = $75,000

To calculate the time it would take Jim to earn the total amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years

"To calculate the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we must first determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide, and the fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

The length of the fabric is the bed's length plus 2 feet, which equals 6 + 2 = 8 feet. The width of the fabric is the bed's width plus 2 feet, which equals 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric by multiplying the length by the width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two identical pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

First, we know the post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

Next, we need to find the number of letters delivered on Tuesday, which is 17 more than one-fifth of the number delivered on Monday. To calculate one-fifth of 425, we'll divide 425 by 5, since one-fifth is equivalent to 1/5.

425 ÷ 5 = 85

Now, we add 17 to this result to find the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:

85 + 17 = 102

Moving on to Wednesday, we're told the post office delivered 5 more than twice as many letters as they did on Tuesday. To calculate twice the number delivered on Tuesday, we'll multiply 102 by 2.

102 × 2 = 204

Finally, we add 5 to this result to find the number of letters delivered on Wednesday:

204 + 5 = 209

Now that we have the number of letters delivered each day, we can find the total by adding them up:

425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5. We can represent this as -$5.

2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11. We can represent this as +$11.

3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50. We can represent this as -$16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
-$5 (lost) + $11 (won) - $16.50 (lost) = -$10.50.

Since there were 3 races, the average amount lost is -$10.50 / 3 = -$3.50.

However, the question asks for the amount lost, which is the absolute value of the average. Therefore, the average amount lost is $3.50.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

We know that the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

Since the total amount is $1920, we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine x terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team in a day. Since the team worked 3/8 of a day, we'll convert this fraction to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

3/8 * 24 hours = (3 * 24) / 8 = 72 / 8 = 9 hours per day

Next, we'll calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the team worked for:

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, we can find the total hours worked by the team in 21 days:

9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Finally, to find the total hours worked by each painter, we'll divide the total hours worked by the team by the number of painters:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the first set as x, the second set as y, and the third set as z.

We know that Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, so we can write an equation:
x = y + 4

We also know that he retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second set, so we can write another equation:
z = y/2

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up a third equation:
x + y + z = 19

Now, we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for y:
(y + 4) + y + y/2 = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2(y + 4) + 2y + y = 38

Expand and combine like terms:
2y + 8 + 2y + y = 38

Combine like terms:
5y + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5y = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
y = 6

Now that we know y (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:
x = y + 4
x = 6 + 4
x = 10

The number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is 10."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Becky ate 10 slices, and she ate 3 more slices than Jake. We can represent Jake's slices as 'J'. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can express Becky's slices as J + 3. We are given that Becky ate 10 slices, so we can set up the equation:

J + 3 = 10

Now, we can solve for J by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

J = 10 - 3
J = 7

So, Jake ate 7 slices.

We are also given that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. We can express Silvia's slices as 2J. Since we know J = 7, we can find Silvia's slices:

Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31 slices.

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote Donovan's part as x minutes and Betsy's part as y minutes. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so we can write an equation based on this information:

y = x + 18

We also know that the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, which is the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's parts. This gives us another equation:

x + y = 98

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can substitute the expression for y from the first equation into the second equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we have found x, we can find y by substituting x into one of the original equations. We'll use the first equation:

y = x + 18
y = 40 + 18
y = 58

So, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to break down each component and calculate its respective cost.

First, the fixed cost of the cast is $200.

Next, the doctor's visit is billed at $300 per hour, but the visit only lasts 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to calculate the cost for half an hour. This can be done by multiplying the hourly rate by 0.5 (30 minutes / 60 minutes). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is calculated by multiplying the number of pills (30) by the cost per pill ($4), resulting in $4 * 30 = $120.

Lastly, the parking cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours (2) by the hourly rate ($6), giving us $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

"To determine the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to find the number of emails that don't require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require a response, we'll calculate 20% of 80 emails. To do this, we'll multiply 80 by 0.2 (which is equivalent to 20%).

80 * 0.2 = 16

This means 16 emails don't require a response. To find the number of emails James responds to in a day, we'll subtract 16 from the total number of emails.

80 - 16 = 64

Now that we know James responds to 64 emails in a day, we can find the total number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week by multiplying 64 by 5.

64 * 5 = 320

"To calculate the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we'll start by determining the number of classes that visited on Tuesday and Wednesday, as these are dependent on the number of classes that visited on Monday.

On Monday, 32 classes visited. 
On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
Monday: 32
Tuesday: 64
Wednesday: 96
Thursday: 30
Friday: 25

Now, let's add these numbers together:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

"Calculating averages is my specialty, and I'm happy to help with this one. To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to add up all his scores and divide by the number of tests.

First, let's calculate the total score. John scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so the total score for those tests is 3 x 100 = 300. Adding the 80 he scored on his 4th test, we get a total score of 300 + 80 = 380.

Now, to find the average, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 ÷ 4 = 95.

"To determine the number of pizzas left, we'll calculate the number of pizzas eaten by each group and subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

First, let's consider the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7, which equals 14. This means the glee club ate 14 pizzas, leaving 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas.

Next, we'll calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. The football team ate 80% of their pizzas, which is 40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas. Therefore, the football team has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

To find the total number of pizzas left, we add the number of pizzas left from the glee club and the football team: 6 + 8 = 14.

"The art of multiplication and addition is at play here. Let's break it down with precision.

First, we have 700 small coupons, each costing 5 cents to mail. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of coupons by the cost per coupon:
700 * 0.05 = 35 dollars

Now, we have twice as many big coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so we multiply the number of big coupons by the cost per coupon:
1400 * 0.15 = 210 dollars

With these two costs in hand, we can now add them together to find the total cost of postage:
35 + 210 = 245 dollars

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully follow the sequence of events.

First, we determine the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. Since Sidney ordered 3 less than ten, we calculate this as 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Next, we find the total number of meatballs in these 7 sub sandwiches. Given that each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, we multiply the number of sub sandwiches by the number of meatballs per sub sandwich: 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.

However, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, so we need to find the number of sub sandwiches remaining. We subtract the number of sub sandwiches Mark ate from the initial number: 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches.

Then, Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total to 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches.

Finally, we calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches by multiplying the number of sub sandwiches by the number of meatballs per sub sandwich: 6 * 4 = 24 meatballs.

The final answer is: 24"
"To calculate the total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that successfully delivered their cargo. Since a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures, we can calculate this as follows:

1/4 * 20 trucks = 20/4 trucks = 5 trucks

This means 5 trucks were unable to deliver, so we subtract this from the total number of trucks:
20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Now, we multiply the number of successful trucks by the tons of fertiliser each truck was carrying:
15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 15 * 20 tons = 300 tons

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers:

"To calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion: buy one pound of butter, get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay full price for one pound and half price for the other.

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can divide this into three pairs of two pounds each. For each pair, he'll pay full price for one pound ($4.00) and half price for the other ($2.00). The total cost for each pair is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since there are three pairs, the total cost is 3 * $6.00 = $18.00.

"To calculate the total cost of the party, we need to determine the number of guests and then find the additional cost beyond the initial 20 guests.

First, let's find the total number of guests invited: 
25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the actual number of guests is: 
45 - 4 = 41

The initial fee covers 20 guests, so the additional guests are: 
41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is: 
21 * $6 = $126

The total cost of the party is the initial fee plus the cost for the additional guests: 
$125 + $126 = $251

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to calculate the amount each of them spent and then subtract that from their initial amount.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * $60. To find one-quarter of $60, we can multiply $60 by 0.25 (since 1/4 = 0.25). This gives us $60 * 0.25 = $15. Now, we subtract the amount Maggie spent from her initial amount: $60 - $15 = $45.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * $60. To find one-third of $60, we can multiply $60 by 0.33 (since 1/3 = 0.33). This gives us $60 * 0.33 = $20. Now, we subtract the amount Riza spent from her initial amount: $60 - $20 = $40.

The total amount of money they have left is the sum of their remaining amounts: $45 + $40 = $85.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. 

First, we need to find out the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day. Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, we divide the total number of bananas by 7 to get the daily consumption. 

315 ÷ 7 = 45 bananas per day

Now, let's find out how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat in a day. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a day, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption. 

45 (total daily consumption) - 24 (bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys) = 21 bananas

The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the pieces placed from the first puzzle and the pieces placed from the second puzzle.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces placed from the first puzzle. Since Teddy finished half of the 500-piece puzzle, we can find this by dividing 500 by 2. This is a simple division problem, and the result is 500 ÷ 2 = 250 pieces.

Next, we know that Teddy finished the entire second 500-piece puzzle. So, the number of pieces placed from the second puzzle is simply 500.

Now, to find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to add the pieces from both puzzles. This is a basic addition problem, and the result is 250 + 500 = 750.

"To determine the number of quarters Jenny leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and the change she receives.

First, let's find the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we can calculate the cost of 12 roses and add the cost of the remaining 3 roses. The cost of 12 roses is $15, and the cost of 3 more roses is 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny pays with 5 $5 bills, totaling 5 * $5 = $25.

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the change is given in quarters, and each quarter is $0.25, we can find the number of quarters by dividing the change by the value of a quarter: $4 / $0.25 = 16.

"To calculate the total amount of money Terry makes, we'll start by multiplying the number of each item sold by its respective price.

First, we'll calculate the total from the milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33. This is a straightforward multiplication problem, where we multiply the number of milkshakes by the price per milkshake.

Next, we'll calculate the total from the burger platters: 9 burger platters * $11 = $99. Again, we multiply the number of platters by the price per platter.

Finally, we'll calculate the total from the sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30. This is another simple multiplication problem, where we multiply the number of sodas by the price per soda.

"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to break down the sequence of events and calculate the elapsed time between each event.

First, the first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. This means it will depart 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after the initial time.

Next, the second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train's departure. So, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train's stay duration is a quarter of the first train's stay, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the second train departs at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

Then, the third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train's departure. This puts the third train's arrival time at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after arrival, its departure time is also 125 minutes.

Finally, the fourth train, which Paul will board, arrives 20 minutes after the third train's departure. Thus, the fourth train's arrival time is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Paul's waiting time is the time elapsed between the initial time (0 minutes) and the fourth train's arrival. Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to calculate the number of toothpicks she still needs and then divide that by the number of toothpicks she saves each week.

First, let's find out how many toothpicks Melanie has already collected. She saves 10 toothpicks per week and has been doing so for 12 weeks. We can calculate this by multiplying the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks.

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks needed to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Finally, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect 200 toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to analyze the sequence of transactions.

First, Mr. Rogers purchased the watch at 75% of its original price of $2000. This means he paid:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. This translates to:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to calculate the percentage discount obtained by the friend from the original price. To do this, we find the difference between the original price and the price the friend paid:
$2000 - $1800 = $200

To express this discount as a percentage of the original price, we use the formula:
(Difference / Original Price) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100
= 10%

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

We are also given that Binkie's score is 90. We can substitute this value into the equation:

F = 2(90) + 15

Now, let's solve for F:

- Back home: 2 miles
- Total distance to the store (after the round trip): 2 miles + 2 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Given James' walking speed is 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time:

Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour

"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and the cost of buying them in bunches, then find the difference.

First, let's find the total number of bananas Jenny bought. Since she bought 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, we multiply the number of bunches by the number of bananas per bunch: 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. The cost per banana is $0.80, so we multiply the number of bananas by the cost per banana: 40 * $0.80 = $32.

Next, we calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. The cost per bunch is $3.00, so we multiply the number of bunches by the cost per bunch: 10 * $3.00 = $30.

Finally, we find the amount of money Jenny saved by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32 - $30 = $2.

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

"To determine the crocodile's growth in 13 years, we can establish a proportion based on the given information. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so we can set up a ratio of growth to time: 8 inches / 4 years.

We can then use this ratio to find the growth in 13 years by setting up a proportion:

8 inches / 4 years = x inches / 13 years

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

x = 104 / 4
x = 26

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

"To calculate Marcel's total earnings from selling bicycles, we need to determine the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, we know that Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes, with half of them being Trekking bikes. This means he sold 300 * 0.5 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, we know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find the number of BMX bikes sold, we multiply 300 by 0.15 (which is equivalent to 15%): 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total to find the number of MTB bikes sold: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the price of each type of bike. We know the price of an MTB is $500, and a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $500 / 2 = $250. The price of a Trekking bike is given as $450.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

"To find the total hours John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and extra learning time, then convert it to hours.

John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. To find the extra learning time, we can set up an equation. Let's call the total weekly minutes 'x'. Then, the extra learning time is (1/16)x, and the class time is 1600 minutes. The total weekly minutes 'x' is the sum of class time and extra learning time:

x = 1600 + (1/16)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 16:

16x = 25600 + x

Subtract x from both sides:

15x = 25600

Divide both sides by 15:

x = 25600 / 15
x = 1706.67

Now, we can convert the total weekly minutes to hours:

Total hours per week = x / 60
Total hours per week = 1706.67 / 60
Total hours per week = 28.44

"To determine the height of the ball on its second bounce, we can apply the concept of a geometric sequence. The initial height is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet. Since the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its previous height with each bounce, we can express this as a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2/3.

The height of the ball on the first bounce is 72 * (2/3) = 48 feet. To find the height on the second bounce, we multiply the height of the first bounce by the common ratio: 48 * (2/3) = 32 feet.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from the second child's height: 74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to the third child's height: 69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards, starting with the last piece of information provided. The group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. Since they ate half of what was left, we can infer that there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat before the Allosaurus ate.

Now, we know that the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means that the 540 kilograms of meat was half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. To find the weight of the triceratops after the T-Rex ate, we multiply 540 by 2, which gives us 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: x / 2 = 1080, where x is the original weight of the triceratops. Solving for x, we get x = 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

First, let's calculate the area of the north and south walls. Each wall measures 10 x 8 feet, so the area of each wall is 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

Next, we'll calculate the area of the east and west walls. Each wall measures 5 x 8 feet, so the area of each wall is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Given that a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we can calculate the number of gallons required by dividing the total area by the coverage of a single gallon: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Finally, we can determine the total cost by multiplying the number of gallons required by the cost per gallon: 12 * $12 = $144.

"To determine the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we'll calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

First, let's consider the train traveling at 60 miles per hour. Using the formula Distance = Speed * Time, we can calculate the distance it has traveled:
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

Next, we'll calculate the distance the second train has traveled. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the first train, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. Using the same formula, we get:
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

As the trains are moving in opposite directions, we add the distances they've traveled to find the total distance between them:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To determine the total number of people Billy helps, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of people he helps per day.

First, let's find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to calculate 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2 (which is equivalent to 20%). This gives us 50 * 0.2 = 10 days off.

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works: 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Next, we need to find the number of people Billy helps per day. He helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we multiply the number of people he helps per hour by the number of hours he works per day: 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Finally, we multiply the number of people Billy helps per day by the number of days he works: 6 * 40 = 240 people.

"To determine the total number of people inside the church, we must first calculate the number of people who arrived in cars and buses. 

The number of people who arrived in cars can be found by multiplying the number of cars (20) by the number of people each car carried (3). This results in 20 * 3 = 60 people.

Next, we calculate the number of people who arrived in buses by multiplying the number of buses (12) by the number of people each bus carried (35). This gives us 12 * 35 = 420 people.

Now, we add the number of people who arrived in cars (60) to the number of people who arrived in buses (420) to find the total number of people. This results in 60 + 420 = 480 people.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote Jeff's age as J, Martha's age as M, and Mike's age as K.

We know that Mike is 24 years old, so we can write:
K = 24

We also know that Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so we can write:
M = K - 4

Substituting K = 24 into the equation above, we get:
M = 24 - 4
M = 20

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so we can write:
J = M + 10

Substituting M = 20 into the equation above, we get:
J = 20 + 10
J = 30

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

"To determine the time difference between riding the biggest waterslide and the second biggest waterslide, we need to calculate the time it takes to ride each slide. 

The time it takes to ride the biggest waterslide can be calculated by dividing its length (300 feet) by the speed at which people slide down (60 feet/minute). This gives us 300 / 60 = 5 minutes.

Similarly, the time it takes to ride the second biggest waterslide is found by dividing its length (240 feet) by the speed at which people slide down (80 feet/minute), resulting in 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.

The difference in time between the two slides is then calculated by subtracting the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

"To calculate the total time of Bobby's lunches and breaks, we need to determine the daily time spent on these activities and then multiply it by the number of days.

Bobby's daily lunch break is 30 minutes, and he takes two 15-minute breaks, which adds up to 30 minutes. Therefore, the total daily time spent on lunches and breaks is 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total daily time is 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on lunches and breaks over 5 days:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first determine the total miles run by Amber and Micah. 

We know Amber ran 8 miles. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, we can calculate Micah's miles by multiplying 8 by 3.5. 

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we can find the total miles run by Amber and Micah by adding their individual miles. 
Total miles run by Amber and Micah = 8 + 28 = 36 miles.

To find Ahito's miles, we subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three. 
Ahito's miles = Total miles - miles run by Amber and Micah = 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we'll break down the transactions step by step.

First, we subtract the returned item from the initial charge: 
$85.00 (initial charge) - $15.00 (return) = $70.00

Next, we calculate the discounted prices of the new purchases:
Frying pan: 20% off $20.00 = $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) 
= $20.00 - $4.00 
= $16.00

Set of towels: 10% off $30.00 = $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) 
= $30.00 - $3.00 
= $27.00

Now, we add the discounted prices of the new purchases: 
$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

Finally, we add the new purchases to the balance after the return: 
$70.00 (balance after return) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the given outcome. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color under the UV light, and these are a third of the large jellyfish. This means that the total number of large jellyfish is 3 times 6, which is 18.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of jellyfish. Let x be the total number of jellyfish. Then, 1/5 of x is equal to 18. We can write this as:

(1/5)x = 18

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5:

x = 18 * 5
x = 90

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. We know that Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris. This means we can calculate Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2.

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age. Since Caroline is three times older than Ben, we can calculate her age by multiplying Ben's age by 3.

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how many years it will take her to reach that goal.

Lauren's retirement savings goal is to live on 40% of her current annual salary for 20 years. 40% of $100,000 is $40,000 per year. For 20 years, she will need:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000

Since Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck, and assuming she gets paid bi-weekly (26 pay periods per year), her annual savings is:

$100,000 per year * 0.20 = $20,000 per year

To calculate how many years it will take her to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the goal by her annual savings:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to reach her goal. Since she wants to retire in 20 years, we need to subtract the number of years she has already worked from the total number of years.

Unfortunately, the problem doesn't specify how many years Lauren has already worked. However, we can calculate the number of years she needs to work from now to reach her goal.

Assuming she has already saved some amount, the amount she needs to save from now is still $800,000. However, since she wants to retire in 20 years, the amount she will save in the next 20 years is:

$20,000 per year * 20 years = $400,000

This means she has already saved:

$800,000 - $400,000 = $400,000

However, this is not the question. The question is how many more years she needs to work.

Since she needs to save a total of $800,000 and she will save $400,000 in the next 20 years, she has already saved $400,000. To save this amount, she must have worked:

$400,000 / $20,000 per year = 20 years

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We want to know how many more years she needs to work from now.

Since she has already worked for 20 years and she wants to retire in 20 years, the number of years she needs to work from now is equal to the number of years she needs to work to save the remaining amount, which is the same as the number of years she wants to work before retiring.

"To determine the length of each final cut, we must first establish the total number of cuts. Since Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts, and each of these parts must be divided into 5 equal parts, we can calculate the total number of cuts as follows:

4 parts * 5 cuts per part = 20 cuts

Now, we can divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of cuts to find the length of each final cut:

100 cm ÷ 20 = 5 cm

"To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total number of students. Given that 40% of the population is 240 boys, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of students.

Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. We know that 40% of 'x' is 240. We can express this as:

40% of x = 240
0.4x = 240

To find 'x', we'll divide both sides by 0.4:
x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys (240) from the total:
Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final amount spent by your mom at the gardening shop is $38."
"Calculating the average height of heels at the party is a straightforward process. We have two groups of women: three wearing 4-inch heels and three wearing 2-inch heels.

First, we calculate the total height of heels for each group. For the women wearing 4-inch heels, the total height is 3 * 4 = 12 inches. For the women wearing 2-inch heels, the total height is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

Next, we add the total heights of both groups to find the overall total height of heels: 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

Since there are six women in total, we divide the overall total height by the number of women to find the average height of heels: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine the additional miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we'll start by calculating her daily mileage requirement. With a goal of 9,300 miles in 30 days, we divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad plans to hike twice a day, we'll divide the daily mileage by 2:

310 miles / 2 = 155 miles per hike

Given that she currently plans to hike 125 miles per time, we'll find the difference to determine the additional miles needed per hike:

155 miles - 125 miles = 30 miles

Soledad must hike 30 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Blue balls: 11 * $5 = $55
Green balls: 25 * $3 = $75

Now, we'll add these amounts together to find the total.

$27 + $55 = $82
$82 + $75 = $157

"To find out how many kilograms James (Jacques) will have left, we need to determine the total amount taken by Peter (Pierre) and Paul.

Peter (Pierre) wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples: 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg
Paul wants 1/3 of the 12 kg of apples: 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg

To find the total amount taken, we need to add these two fractions. To do this, we need a common denominator, which is 12 in this case. 

We can rewrite 3 kg as 9/12 (since 3 * 3 = 9 and 4 * 3 = 12) and 4 kg as 16/12 (since 4 * 3 = 12 and 4 * 4 = 16, but we need to keep the denominator the same, so we use 16/12 = 4 * 3/3 * 3 = 16/12 = 4 * 4/4 * 3 = 16/12). However, we can simplify this by converting 3 kg to 9/12 and 4 kg to 16/12, but we can also convert 4 kg to 12/12 * 4/3 = 16/12 = 4 * 4/3 = 16/12 = 4 * 3/3 = 12/3 = 4 kg = 48/12 = 4 * 12/3 = 16/4 = 4

"To determine the temperature in the morning, we need to apply the rules of integer addition and subtraction. 

The initial temperature is 2 degrees Celsius. The temperature dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight, which is a decrease, so we subtract 8 from 2. 
2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius

Then, the temperature increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning, which is an increase, so we add 3 to -6. 
-6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius

The final answer is: -3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Raymond has after saving $11 from his allowance. To do this, we add the money he initially had ($21) to the money he saved ($11). 

$21 (initial money) + $11 (money saved) = $32

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money Raymond spent. He spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle. 

$5 (comic book) + $19 (puzzle) = $24

Finally, we subtract the total amount of money spent from the total amount of money he had. 

$32 (total money) - $24 (total money spent) = $8

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information. Anna started with a budget of $16 and had already spent $4, leaving her with $16 - $4 = $12.

After buying the 2 books, Anna had $2 left in her budget. This means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2.

$10 ÷ 2 = $5

The final answer is: $5"
"To calculate the number of students enrolled this year, we need to find 20% of the original number of students and add it to the original number. 

First, we find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.20 (which is the decimal equivalent of 20%). 

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

Now, we add the 20% increase (10 students) to the original number of students (50):
50 + 10 = 60

"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion to relate the number of blinks to the time in minutes. Let's use the given information to create a proportion.

We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We want to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times. Let's represent the unknown time as x minutes.

We can set up the proportion as follows:

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 459 blinks / x minutes

Now, we can cross-multiply to solve for x:

255x = 459 * 5
255x = 2295

Next, we can divide both sides by 255 to isolate x:

x = 2295 / 255
x = 9

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

"To determine the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes in Tate's garden pond, we need to calculate the total number of each.

First, let's calculate the total number of male fishes. Initially, there were 4 male guppies and 3 male goldfishes, which gives us a total of 4 + 3 = 7 male fishes. Tate then bought 2 male guppies and 2 male goldfishes, adding 2 + 2 = 4 more male fishes. So, the total number of male fishes is 7 + 4 = 11.

Next, let's calculate the total number of female fishes. Initially, there were 7 female guppies and 5 female goldfishes, which gives us a total of 7 + 5 = 12 female fishes. Tate then bought 1 female guppy and 3 female goldfishes, adding 1 + 3 = 4 more female fishes. So, the total number of female fishes is 12 + 4 = 16.

Now, to find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes, we subtract the number of male fishes from the number of female fishes: 16 - 11 = 5.

"To calculate the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to complete their chores, we need to determine the time each person spent on their task.

Amalia spent 4 hours mowing the lawn. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so her dog-walking task took 4 + 2 = 6 hours. Dior's laundry task took 4 hours longer than Amalia's lawn-mowing task, which is 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the time each person spent on their task: 
4 hours (Amalia) + 6 hours (Megan) + 8 hours (Dior) = 18 hours.

"To determine the total miles driven per month, we'll first calculate the distance of the round trip. Since John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to drive one way, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time

For a one-way trip, the distance is:
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles

Since John makes a round trip, we'll multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Distance for round trip = 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles

Given that John visits his parents twice a month, the total miles driven per month is:
Total miles per month = 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in seven days. Since Sofie walks 10 miles per day, we can multiply the number of days by the number of miles she walks per day. 

7 days * 10 miles/day = 70 miles

Now, we know that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. To find the distance Brian will walk, we can divide the total distance Sofie walks by 2.

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that the manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift. This means that the total number of toys produced in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

We also know that 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. Let's calculate the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers in 10 hours.

The 2 workers producing 6 toys an hour will produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours. The 2 workers producing 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours. The total number of toys produced by these 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Now, let's find out how many toys the fifth worker produced in 10 hours. Since the total number of toys produced in 10 hours is 380, and the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find the rate at which the fifth worker produces toys, we divide the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of Elijah's dogs first. 

Since Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, we can express this as a fraction: 1/4 * 60 pounds. To find the weight of Elijah's first dog, we multiply the numerator (1) by the weight of Kory's dog (60 pounds) and then divide by the denominator (4). This gives us 1 * 60 / 4 = 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, which can be expressed as 1/2 * 60 pounds. To find the weight of Elijah's second dog, we multiply the numerator (1) by the weight of Kory's dog (60 pounds) and then divide by the denominator (2). This gives us 1 * 60 / 2 = 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs: 
Kory's dog: 60 pounds
Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds
Elijah's second dog: 30 pounds
Total weight: 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds

"Let's break down the problem step by step, working backwards to find the initial number of stickers Seth had.

We know Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had a total of 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Since Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris, Luis must have had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris. However, Luis used half of the stickers, which means Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers initially.

Now, we know Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. To find the initial number of stickers Seth had, we need to multiply the number of stickers Luis received by 2. Therefore, Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers in the beginning.

30 (ounces) * 30 (M&M's per ounce) = 900 M&M's

Now, to find out how many small bags John can make, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag. 

The calculation is as follows: 
900 (M&M's) ÷ 10 (M&M's per small bag) = 90

First, let's calculate half of the earth's circumference: 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Now, we'll divide the half circumference by Alfie's daily flying distance of 400 km. This can be represented as 20,000 km ÷ 400 km/day.

Using my expertise in division, I can confidently calculate this as 20,000 ÷ 400 = 50.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. This means we can multiply the speed of the average car by 5 to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car: 120 * 5 = 600 miles per hour.

Next, we're told the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the fastest car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25: 600 * 1.25 = 750 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation. Let's denote Vince's current age as V. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old, and Vince's age two years ago was V - 2.

We are given that two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. This can be represented by the equation:

14 = 2(V - 2)

Now, let's solve for V:

14 = 2V - 4
14 + 4 = 2V
18 = 2V
V = 18 / 2
V = 9

Therefore, Vince is 9 years old now.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations. Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so C + S = 30.

Additionally, we know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so C = S + 12.

Lastly, we know that the total number of eggs painted is 56, so A + M + C + S = 56.

Since A = M, we can rewrite the last equation as 2A + C + S = 56.

Now we have three equations:

1. C + S = 30
2. C = S + 12
3. 2A + C + S = 56

We can solve equations 1 and 2 simultaneously. Substitute C from equation 2 into equation 1:

(S + 12) + S = 30

Combine like terms: 2S + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18

Divide both sides by 2: S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C using equation 2: C = 9 + 12 = 21

Now we know C and S, so we can substitute them into equation 3:

2A + 21 + 9 = 56

Combine constants: 2A + 30 = 56

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2A = 26

Divide both sides by 2: A = 13

Since A = M, M is also 13.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs.

The difference is 21 - 13 = 8

"To determine the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we'll first calculate the weight of the crayons. Since Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces.

Next, we'll calculate the weight of the boxes. Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, so we'll divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes: 200 crayons / 8 crayons/box = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.

Now, we'll add the weight of the crayons and boxes to find the total weight in ounces: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we'll divide by 16, since there are 16 ounces in a pound: 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

"To determine the total amount John makes from selling the planks, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to find the usable portion of the tree, which is 80% of the total length. To do this, we multiply the total length by 0.8 (which is equivalent to 80%):

80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

This means John can make logs out of 64 feet of the tree.

Next, we divide the usable portion by the length of each log to find the total number of logs:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Now that we know John can make 16 logs, we multiply this number by the number of planks he can cut from each log:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank to find the total amount John makes:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. To find her brother's monthly earnings, we multiply Valerie's earnings by 2. 

Brother's monthly earnings = 2 * $5000 = $10,000

Next, we calculate their combined monthly earnings by adding Valerie's and her brother's earnings.

Combined monthly earnings = $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Now, we know their mother earns twice their combined monthly earnings. To find her monthly earnings, we multiply their combined earnings by 2.

Mother's monthly earnings = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual monthly earnings.

Total monthly earnings = $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of distance, rate, and time. We know that Grandma walks 3 miles every day, with 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.

Let's denote the time it takes for Grandma to walk on the beach as 't' minutes. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach, her rate of speed on the beach is 2 miles / t minutes.

We are given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, so t = 40 minutes. However, we can use this information to find her rate of speed on the beach:

Rate on beach = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 1/20 miles per minute

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her rate of speed on the sidewalk is 2 * (1/20 miles per minute) = 1/10 miles per minute.

We know that Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, so we can find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk:

Time on sidewalk = Distance / Rate
Time on sidewalk = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute)
Time on sidewalk = 10 minutes

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk is the sum of the time she spends on the beach and the time she spends on the sidewalk:

Total Time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total Time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes
Total Time = 50 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Jane has saved so far. Since she saves $4 per week and has been doing so for 8 weeks, we can calculate her total savings by multiplying the amount she saves per week by the number of weeks:

$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we know Jane wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract her current savings from her goal:

$60 - $32 = $28

Since Jane saves $4 per week, we can divide the amount she still needs to save by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:

$28 ÷ $4/week = 7 weeks

x + 24 = 60

To solve for x, we can subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So Bob initially has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, he will have:

36 - 10 = 26

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of weighted averages. Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water are mixed, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can set up the following inequality to represent this situation:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides of the inequality by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

4 * 33 + x ≥ 200

Next, we can simplify the left-hand side of the inequality by multiplying 4 and 33:

132 + x ≥ 200

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 132 from both sides of the inequality:

x ≥ 200 - 132
x ≥ 68

Since the temperature of the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees, we can conclude that the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

"To calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we'll start by determining the number of cows and chickens added over this period.

The farm receives 20 cows per day from Milkie Cows Limited. Since there are 21 days in three weeks, the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Similarly, the farm receives 10 chickens per day from Broilers Limited. Over 21 days, the total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, we'll add these numbers to the initial number of animals on the farm. The farm started with 50 cows and 20 chickens. 

The total number of cows after three weeks is 50 (initial cows) + 420 (added cows) = 470 cows.
The total number of chickens after three weeks is 20 (initial chickens) + 210 (added chickens) = 230 chickens.

Finally, we'll find the total number of animals on the farm by adding the total number of cows and chickens: 470 (total cows) + 230 (total chickens) = 700.

"To determine the cost of each single bagel, we'll need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels after the discount and then divide it by the total number of bagels.

First, let's find the original cost of the 4 packs of bagels. Since each pack costs $10.00, the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Next, we'll apply the 10% discount. To do this, we'll find 10% of $40.00 by multiplying $40.00 by 0.10, which equals $4.00. Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now that we have the discounted cost, let's find the total number of bagels. Since each pack contains 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Finally, we'll divide the total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost of each single bagel: $36.00 ÷ 36 = $1.00.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations to represent the given information. Let's define the variables:

- x: number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate
- y: number of potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes

From the problem, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so we can write an equation for x:
x = 23 - 5

We also know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's rewrite this information as an equation:
3y = 2(6 - 3)

Now, we can simplify the equations:
x = 18
3y = 2(3)
3y = 6
y = 2

However, the value of y we found is not the number of potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, but rather the number of potatoes it takes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find the number of potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we can divide y by 2, but in this case, we can directly use the value of y to find the number of potatoes Gomer ate.

Since y is the number of potatoes it takes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can multiply y by the number of times 2 scoops fit into 18 scoops, which is 9 (18 / 2 = 9). Then, we multiply this result by the number of potatoes it takes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes:
9 * 2 * (3) = 9 * 6 = 54 / 2 = 27

"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we'll break down his egg consumption into two periods: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. Since he eats 3 eggs a day, we multiply the number of eggs per day by the number of days:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Next, we calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days. He increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day, so we multiply the new number of eggs per day by the number of days:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods to find the overall number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since we're asked to find the number of dozens of eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (the number of eggs in a dozen):
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

84 ÷ 14 = 6

Now that we know one part is equal to 6, we can multiply this value by the number of parts representing women (9) to find the initial number of women on the bus:

9 × 6 = 54

So, there were initially 54 women on the bus. If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, we can subtract this number from the initial number of women to find the number of women who remained:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: individual sunflowers and bouquets of sunflowers.

Let's denote the number of individual sunflowers sold per day as 's' and the number of bouquets sold per day as 'b'. We know that each sunflower costs $2 and each bouquet costs $8.

We are given that Faraday earned $26 from individual sunflowers and $56 from bouquets per day. We can set up the following equations based on this information:

2s = 26 ... (Equation 1)
8b = 56 ... (Equation 2)

Solving Equation 1 for 's', we get:
s = 26 / 2
s = 13

Solving Equation 2 for 'b', we get:
b = 56 / 8
b = 7

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets per day is:
12b = 12 * 7
= 84

Now, we need to find the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days. We multiply the number of individual sunflowers per day and the number of sunflowers in bouquets per day by 3:
Total individual sunflowers = 13 * 3 = 39
Total sunflowers in bouquets = 84 * 3 = 252

Finally, we add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in bouquets:
Total sunflowers = 39 + 252
= 291

"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate his total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we can divide his total money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Adam's total cost is the number of rocks multiplied by the cost per rock, which is $100.

Now, let's calculate the number of rocks Adam sells. He sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks:

20 rocks * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Adam sells each rock for $7, so his total revenue is:

12 rocks * $7 = $84

To find out how much money Adam loses, we subtract his total revenue from his total cost:

$100 (total cost) - $84 (total revenue) = $16

"To determine the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days for each type of picture scene and then find the most efficient way to combine them.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since Lauren can work on different scenes in a single day, we can try to combine the days. 

One possible combination is:
- 6 days for medium-sized scenes (completing 36 medium-sized scenes)
- During these 6 days, she can also work on 6 * 5 = 30 large-sized scenes (leaving 15 large-sized scenes)
- During these 6 days, she can also work on 6 * 7 = 42 small-sized scenes (leaving 7 small-sized scenes)
- The remaining 15 large-sized scenes can be completed in 3 days
- The remaining 7 small-sized scenes can be completed in 1 day, but she can do them in the 3 days that she is doing the last 15 large-sized scenes

So, the total number of days is 6 + 3 = 9 days.

"To calculate the average speed, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours and then an additional 140 miles in 3 hours. 

First, we calculate the total distance traveled: 
110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, we calculate the total time taken: 
2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula: 
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

"When dealing with independent events, the probability of both events occurring is found by multiplying their individual probabilities. In this case, we have two lottery tickets. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.20 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60, or 60%.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply their individual probabilities:
0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.12 * 100 = 12%

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We'll start by defining the variables: let C be the number of seashells Carlos collected, J be the number of seashells Jim collected, and Y be the number of seashells Carrey collected.

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so we can write an equation based on this information: J = C + 5. We also know that Jim collected 27 seashells, so we can substitute this value into the equation: 27 = C + 5.

Solving for C, we get C = 27 - 5 = 22.

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so we can write another equation: C = 2Y. Since we know C = 22, we can substitute this value into the equation: 22 = 2Y.

Solving for Y, we get Y = 22 / 2 = 11.

Now that we know the number of seashells each person collected, we can find the total number of seashells: J + C + Y = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60.

Finally, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got: 60 / 3 = 20.

We have 5 weekdays, and Mason eats 4 carrots each day. A simple multiplication problem: 5 days * 4 carrots/day = 20 carrots.

On weekends, he eats 5 carrots each day, and there are 2 weekend days. Another straightforward multiplication: 2 days * 5 carrots/day = 10 carrots.

Now, to find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the weekday and weekend totals: 20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots.

"To determine the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and then add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. 
The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the additional time, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes, which is 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes.
So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, we simply add the lengths of the two songs to find the total time of the cassette: 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

"To calculate Linus' profit, we need to determine the total cost and total revenue from the sale of the mobile devices.

First, let's calculate the total number of devices purchased. Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices is 2 + 4 = 6.

The cost of each device is $20, so the total cost is 6 * $20 = $120.

Since Linus sells each device for twice the original price, the selling price per device is 2 * $20 = $40. Therefore, the total revenue is 6 * $40 = $240.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $240 - $120 = $120.

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step, using proportional reasoning to find the length of Carl's cane.

First, we know Isabel's height, which is 7 feet. Since Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, we can find Ned's height by subtracting 2 from Isabel's height: 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Next, we're told that Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned. To find Carl's height, we add 1 foot to Ned's height: 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. This is a proportional relationship, where the length of the cane is directly proportional to Carl's height. To find the length of the cane, we can multiply Carl's height by 1/2 or divide it by 2: 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To calculate the number of additional bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce, we first need to determine the total number of bottles required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy needs, we can calculate the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy needs as follows:

100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person

Now, to satisfy 100% of 2300 people's daily energy needs, we multiply the number of bottles per person by the total number of people:

5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles

Hortex already produces 4200 bottles per day, so the number of additional bottles needed is:

11500 - 4200 = 7300

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we can use the concept of conditional probability. Let's break down the information:

Carla has 8 babies, with 3/4 wearing purple and 1/4 wearing blue. This means 6 babies wear purple and 2 wear blue.

Now, we're told that all blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. We can represent this as:

- Blue-wearers with bows: 2 (since all 2 blue-wearers have bows)
- Purple-wearers with bows: 1/3 * 6 = 2

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4.

We want to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be represented as P(Purple|Bow). Using the formula for conditional probability:

P(Purple|Bow) = P(Purple and Bow) / P(Bow)

We know that P(Purple and Bow) = 2/8, since 2 out of the 8 babies are wearing both purple and bows. We also know that P(Bow) = 4/8, since 4 out of the 8 babies are wearing bows.

Now, we can plug in the values:

P(Purple|Bow) = (2/8) / (4/8) = 2/4 = 1/2

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(1/2) * 100 = 50%

To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we'll subtract the combined total of Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the overall weekly total.

First, let's calculate the combined total of Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
1907 (Monday and Tuesday) + 2136 (Thursday and Friday) = 4043

"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, let's calculate the amount of land Abraham sold in each transaction. He started with 80 square meters of land and sold half of it, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters, for $50.

Next, he sold 1/4 of his original land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30.

Now, let's find out how much land he has left. He initially had 80 square meters, sold 40, and then sold 20 more. So, the remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

Abraham sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter. To find the total amount he earned from this sale, we multiply the area of the land by the price per square meter: 20 * 3 = $60.

Finally, we add the amounts he earned from each sale to find the total: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a simple equation. Let's denote Geb's age as G and Haley's age as H. We are given that Haley is 26 years old, so H = 26. We are also told that Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley, which we can express as G = (1/2)H - 10.

Substituting the value of H into the equation, we get G = (1/2)(26) - 10. To solve for G, we first calculate half of 26, which is 13. Then, we subtract 10 from 13.

G = 13 - 10
G = 3

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found and subtract it from the total number of eggs hidden.

First, let's determine the total number of eggs hidden. Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we multiply 3 by 12 (the number of eggs in a dozen) to get 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs found by each person. Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so we multiply 5 by 2 to get 5 * 2 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so we subtract 2 from 10 to get 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so we divide 8 by 2 to get 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4. To calculate this, we add the numbers together: 5 + 10 = 15, then 15 + 8 = 23, and finally 23 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Now, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To determine John's weekly earnings, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and then multiply that by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

First, we find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes: 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6, which equals 240. Since the last complex is 60% bigger, we add 240 to the combined total of the first two complexes: 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

He gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is 3120 * 0.40 = 1248.

"To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the number of fruits produced by the avocado tree each year. 

Let's denote the initial amount of fruits produced by a 5-year-old tree as 'a'. Then, we have:
- Year 5: a = 50 fruits
- Year 6: 3a = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 7: 7a = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 10: 20a = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits (since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount)

Now, we know that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. So, the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Since the 8-year-old tree produces 800 fruits, which is 16 times the initial amount (16 * 50 = 800), we can establish a pattern in the number of fruits produced each year:
- Year 5: a
- Year 6: 3a
- Year 7: 7a
- Year 8: 16a
- Year 9: 0 (no fruits)
- Year 10: 20a

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced in 10 years:
a + 3a + 7a + 16a + 0 + 20a = 47a
Since a = 50, the total number of fruits produced in 10 years is:

"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables. Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is y - 7. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4(y - 7).

We know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6y = 72

Divide by 6:
y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
Red rope = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4(5) = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information given and apply our knowledge of ratios and fractions.

First, let's establish the initial amounts of money Ronnie and Rissa received. Ronnie was given $5, while Rissa received thrice as much, which is 3 * $5 = $15.

Next, we're told that each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister. Let's denote this amount as x. After giving x dollars to their sister, Ronnie is left with $5 - x, and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

The key piece of information is that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original amount. We can set up an equation to represent this:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides gives us:

-x = -$3

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = $3

Now that we know they each gave $3 to their little sister, we can find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

$5 - $3 = $2

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. We know that the mural has four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. The amount of red, white, and purple paint is equal, and half the mural is yellow.

Let's start by finding the amount of yellow paint. Since half the mural is yellow, we can calculate it as follows:

Yellow paint = 1/2 * Total paint
Yellow paint = 1/2 * 12
Yellow paint = 6 pints

Now, we know that the remaining half of the mural is divided among red, white, and purple. To find the total amount of paint used for these three colors, we subtract the amount of yellow paint from the total paint:

Non-yellow paint (red, white, purple) = Total paint - Yellow paint
Non-yellow paint = 12 - 6
Non-yellow paint = 6 pints

Since the amount of red, white, and purple paint is equal, we can divide the non-yellow paint by 3 to find the amount of red paint:

Red paint = 1/3 * Non-yellow paint
Red paint = 1/3 * 6
Red paint = 2 pints

"To determine the total area of Tom's house, we'll break down the calculation into manageable steps. 

First, we'll calculate the area of one bedroom, which is a rectangle with dimensions 20 feet by 12 feet. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula length * width. So, the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, we multiply the area of one bedroom by 4 to find the total area of the bedrooms: 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

Next, we'll calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. Therefore, the area of the living room is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

Finally, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house (which is 1000 square feet) to find the total area: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

So, the special size box contains 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Given that the special size box costs $12, we can find the cost per pod by dividing the total cost by the number of pods.
$12 / 120 pods = $0.1 per pod.

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

First, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. To find the number of 20 dollar bills, we divide the total amount by the value of each bill: 1000 / 20 = 50.

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Then, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 left.

The value of the remaining 20 dollar bills is 20 * 20 = 400 dollars.

Thomas then triples his money, resulting in 400 * 3 = 1200 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

First, let's analyze the first half of the soccer match. Team A scores 4 goals, while team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A. To find team B's score, we subtract 2 from team A's score: 4 - 2 = 2 goals for team B.

Now, let's move on to the second half. Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, we multiply 2 by 4 to find team B's score in the second half: 2 * 4 = 8 goals.

Next, we need to find team A's score in the second half. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. To find team A's score, we multiply team B's score by 1/4: 8 * 1/4 = 2 goals.

Now that we have the scores for both teams in both halves, we can calculate the total number of goals scored in the match. Team A's total goals are 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. Team B's total goals are 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals. Finally, we add the total goals scored by both teams to find the total number of goals scored in the match: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate the amount of chalk used and the amount remaining.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk and uses 45% of it on Monday. To find 45% of 5 inches, we multiply 5 by 0.45, which equals 2.25 inches. Therefore, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

The teacher's daily usage is 20% of the original 5 inches, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch per day. However, since the chalk is not full, we will use the remaining length to calculate the number of days.

We will calculate the number of days until the chalk is less than 2 inches, at which point the teacher will recycle it. 

The teacher has 2.75 inches left and uses 1 inch per day. 
2.75 - 1 = 1.75 inches after the first day.
1.75 - 1 = 0.75 inches after the second day.

Since 0.75 inches is less than 1 inch, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after the second day of using 20% of the original chalk length per day.

However, the question asks for the number of days before he has to recycle the chalk. Therefore, the answer is 2 days before he has to recycle the chalk on the third day.

Now, we know Johnny bought 2 more than that. To find the total number of face masks Johnny bought, we add 2 to 15.

15 + 2 = 17

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow a step-by-step approach. 

First, we establish the total number of teeth James has, which is 30. The dentist performs two procedures: drilling and capping. The dentist drills 4 teeth. Additionally, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the number of teeth capped is 4 (drilled) + 7 = 11.

Now, we calculate the total number of teeth the dentist fixes by adding the number of teeth drilled and capped: 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

"To calculate the refund amount, we first need to determine the total cost of the milk sold. This can be found by multiplying the total gallons of milk by the cost per gallon.

Total gallons of milk sold = 4000 gallons
Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost = 4000 * $3.5 = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date, we can calculate the number of gallons of sour milk by multiplying the total gallons by 2/5.

Number of gallons of sour milk = 2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Now, we multiply the number of gallons of sour milk by the cost per gallon to find the refund amount.

Refund amount = 1600 * $3.5 = $5600

"To solve this problem, we'll start by defining variables for Wendy's and Colin's current ages. Let W represent Wendy's current age and C represent Colin's current age.

We're given two pieces of information. First, Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

The second piece of information states that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we have a system of two equations with two variables. To solve for C, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

To simplify, multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Next, subtract 3C from both sides to isolate the variable term on one side:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Finally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for C:

C = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that 100 books cost $500, so we can find the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500) and then multiplying by 100.

Total books = ($27000 ÷ $500) × 100
Total books = 54 × 100
Total books = 5400

Now that we know Bob can buy 5400 books in total, we can find out how many books he can buy per school by dividing the total number of books by the number of schools (3).

Books per school = Total books ÷ 3
Books per school = 5400 ÷ 3
Books per school = 1800

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of events and keep track of the number of apples Newton has at each step.

Initially, 2 apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up and put 1 in his pocket, leaving 1 apple to throw at the tree. This means he has 1 apple in his pocket.

When the thrown apple caused 5 more apples to fall, Newton picked them up and put all but 1 in his pocket. So, he now has 1 (initial apple) + 4 (new apples) = 5 apples in his pocket.

The remaining 1 apple was thrown at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall. Newton picked them up, adding them to the 5 apples already in his pocket. Therefore, he now has 5 + 6 = 11 apples.

So, Newton brought home a total of 11 apples.

"The art of multiplication is at play here. To calculate the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to determine the number of 50 kg bags in 850 kg. This is a simple division problem, but the end goal is to multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

First, let's find the number of bags: 850 kg ÷ 50 kg = 17 bags.

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per unit: 17 bags × $18 per bag = $306.

"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we'll calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese slices eaten. Since each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 cheese slices, we multiply 6 friends by 6 slices per friend, which gives us 6 × 6 = 36 cheese slices. Now, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per cheese pizza, which is 12. This gives us 36 ÷ 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of pepperoni slices eaten. Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 pepperoni slices, so we multiply 6 friends by 4 slices per friend, resulting in 6 × 4 = 24 pepperoni slices. Now, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pepperoni pizza, which is 8. This gives us 24 ÷ 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

In total, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To calculate the total miles Sam ran this week, we'll first determine the miles run on each set of days. 

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Using the multiplication principle, we multiply the miles run per day (3 miles) by the number of days (3 days), which gives us 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles. Again, applying the multiplication principle, we multiply the miles run per day (5 miles) by the number of days (2 days), resulting in 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, to find the total miles run this week, we simply add the miles run on each set of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider Jay's snowball-building rate and the rate at which the snowballs melt. Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the melting rate per minute, we divide 2 by 15: 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the net rate at which Jay gains snowballs. To do this, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate. To perform this calculation, we need a common denominator, which is 15 in this case. We can rewrite 1/3 as 5/15, and then subtract 2/15 from it: 
(5 - 2) / 15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate to find the time it will take: 
60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

The final answer is: 300"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age difference between John and Jim. We know that John is currently 28 years old and that Digimon had its 20th anniversary. This means we can calculate John's age 20 years ago.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up a simple equation to find Jim's age at that time.

Let's denote Jim's age 20 years ago as x. Then, John's age 20 years ago (which is 8) is equal to 2 times Jim's age 20 years ago (2x). So, we have:

8 = 2x
x = 8 / 2
x = 4

This means Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. To find Jim's current age, we simply add 20 years to his age at that time.

Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"The art of addition is a wondrous thing, and I'm delighted to apply my expertise to this delightful problem. Let's break it down with precision.

Doxa, the apple slicer extraordinaire, ate 1 slice. Her sister, with a slightly heartier appetite, ate 1 more than Doxa, which brings her total to 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Now, her brother, with the most voracious appetite of the trio, ate 1 more than his sister, resulting in 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

With these individual totals in hand, we can now add them together to find the grand total. The sum is: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that on the third day, the nurses ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, at the end of the third day, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

However, it's given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means that they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the previous days.

Now, let's analyze the second day. They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

Since they had 3 bandages left from the previous days at the end of the third day, and they used 28 bandages on the second day, we can set up an equation to find the initial number of bandages. Let x be the initial number of bandages.

We know that the bandages left at the end of the first day (12) minus the bandages used on the second day (28) plus the initial number of bandages (x) equals the bandages left from the previous days at the end of the third day (3). However, this equation won't work because they can't have negative bandages. So, we need to rethink this.

Let's try another approach. We know that the bandages left at the end of the first day (12) plus the initial number of bandages (x) minus the bandages used on the second day (28) equals the bandages left from the previous days at the end of the third day (3). This equation also doesn't work.

However, we can try to find the initial number of bandages by adding the bandages used on the second day (28) to the bandages left from the previous days at the end of the third day (3) and the bandages left at the end of the first day (12). This will give us the total bandages they had at the start of the second day. 

28 (used on the second day) + 3 (left from the previous days) = 31. 
31 + 12 (left at the end of the first day) = 43. 
However, they ordered 50 bandages on the first day. So, the total bandages they had at the start of the first day is 50 (from the bulk pack) + 43 - 50 (since 50 was ordered) = 43.

"To calculate the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to determine the cost of the haircut and add it to the cost of the color. 

First, let's find out how many inches were cut off. This can be done by subtracting the final length from the initial length: 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

Now, we multiply the number of inches cut off by the cost per inch to find the cost of the haircut: 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40. 

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color: $60 + $40 = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we'll break it down step by step. 

First, let's determine her total hours worked in a week. Since Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days worked per week: 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week.

Next, we'll calculate her total hours worked in April. Given that there are exactly 4 weeks in April, we multiply her weekly hours by the number of weeks: 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours.

Now, let's calculate her total earnings from hours worked. We multiply her total hours worked by her hourly rate of $1.5: 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270.

Lastly, since Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week and she has complete attendance for all 4 weeks in April, we add the total attendance bonus to her earnings: $270 + $10 * 4 weeks = $270 + $40 = $310.

Next, Jason did his laundry once, earning him $3.00.

Then, he took the trash out twice at $0.75 each. Again, applying the multiplication principle, we get 2 * $0.75 = $1.50.

Lastly, Jason cleaned his room once, earning him $1.50.

Next, we're told that twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in later. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, we multiply this number by 2: 2 * 40 = 80. Now, we add this new group to the previous total: 90 + 80 = 170.

Finally, we're informed that an additional 3 times as many people as the initial group entered the restaurant by evening. The initial group consisted of 50 people, so we multiply this number by 3: 3 * 50 = 150. Adding this new group to the previous total, we get: 170 + 150 = 320.

"The art of multiplication and addition. Let's break it down with precision. Alain's mom purchased 5 packs of red pens, with each pack containing 5 pens. To find the total number of red pens, we multiply the number of packs by the number of pens per pack: 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Now, let's move on to the black pens. Since Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, we multiply the number of packs of red pens by 2: 5 packs * 2 = 10 packs of black pens. With each pack containing 5 pens, we multiply the number of packs by the number of pens per pack: 10 packs * 5 pens/pack = 50 black pens.

Next, we calculate the number of bottles of cognac John purchased, which is twice the number of scotch bottles: 10 bottles * 2 = 20 bottles.

Now, we find the cost per bottle of cognac, which is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. To calculate this, we find 50% of $60: $60 * 0.5 = $30. Then, we add this amount to the cost per bottle of scotch: $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

We then calculate the total cost of the cognac: 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1800.

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch to the total cost of the cognac to find the overall amount spent: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to break down the information provided.

First, let's analyze the number of trees planted on the first day. Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted on the first day: 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60.

Moving on to the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees, making the total number of White Oak trees 20 + 10 = 30. For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than the number planted on the first day. To find 1/4 of 40, we multiply 40 by 1/4 or 0.25, which gives us 40 * 0.25 = 10. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted on the second day: 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80.

"To determine the total amount of water removed from the air, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

First, let's analyze the low setting, which removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on this setting, the total amount of water removed is 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

Next, we'll examine the medium setting, which removes twice as much water per day as the low setting. This means it removes 2 * 1 liter/day = 2 liters/day. After running the dehumidifier for 3 days on this setting, the total amount of water removed is 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

Finally, let's consider the high setting, which removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting. This translates to 2 * 2 liters/day = 4 liters/day. With the dehumidifier running for 5 days on this setting, the total amount of water removed is 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $300 + $6
Total Amount = $306

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, we can calculate the total amount paid in the first 11 months.
Total Paid in 11 Months = Monthly Payment * Number of Months
Total Paid in 11 Months = $25 * 11
Total Paid in 11 Months = $275

To find the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the total amount paid in the first 11 months from the total amount owed.
Amount Paid in 12th Month = Total Amount - Total Paid in 11 Months
Amount Paid in 12th Month = $306 - $275
Amount Paid in 12th Month = $31

"To determine the number of diapers Jordan changes per day, we must first calculate the total number of diaper changes required for both children. Since each child needs 5 diaper changes daily, we multiply the number of children by the number of diaper changes per child.

2 children * 5 diaper changes/child = 10 diaper changes

Given that Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we can find the number of diapers Jordan changes by dividing the total number of diaper changes by 2.

10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes

"To determine the accuracy of Tim's guess, we need to calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans and compare it to the true number.

First, we calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume of the jar is the base area multiplied by the height, which is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

However, the jelly beans do not fill the jar perfectly due to packing inefficiencies. We are given that the packing efficiency is 80%, so the actual volume of jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Next, we divide the actual volume of jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean (0.15 cubic inches) to find the total number of jelly beans. This gives us 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to find the estimated number of red jelly beans. This gives us 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference between the true number and the estimated number, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 864 = 36.

"To determine the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the bus has a capacity of 200 people and initially had 20 people on board. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total to 20 + 40 = 60.

Next, at the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station boarded the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, we calculate 3/4 of 40 as (3/4) * 40 = 30. Adding these passengers to the existing total, we get 60 + 30 = 90.

Then, at the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. To find the new total, we multiply 90 by 2, resulting in 90 * 2 = 180.

Finally, to find the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current total from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first 5 years. The cost per visit is $2, and Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. So, the annual cost is 2 * 3 = $6. To find the total cost for 5 years, we multiply the annual cost by 5: 6 * 5 = $30.

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the next 3 years. The cost per visit has increased by 150%, which means the new cost is the original cost plus 150% of the original cost. To find the new cost, we calculate 150% of $2, which is 2 * 1.5 = $3. Adding this to the original cost, we get 2 + 3 = $5 per visit. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the new annual cost is 5 * 3 = $15. To find the total cost for 3 years, we multiply the new annual cost by 3: 15 * 3 = $45.

Finally, we add the total cost for the first 5 years and the total cost for the next 3 years to find the overall amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum: 30 + 45 = $75.

"To determine the total time required for all students to try the escape room, we need to calculate the number of groups and then multiply that by the time interval per group.

First, we find the total number of students participating. Since there are 4 grades (4-7) and 10 students per grade, we multiply the number of grades by the number of students per grade: 4 * 10 = 40 students.

Next, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group (8) to find the number of groups: 40 ÷ 8 = 5 groups.

Now, we multiply the number of groups by the time interval per group (45 minutes) to find the total time required: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The answer is: 225"
"To calculate the total amount Ali has to pay John, we'll start by determining the cost of the tables. Since John manufactured 4 tables at $20 each, we can use multiplication to find the total cost: 4 * $20 = $80.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the roof frames. With 2 frames at $10 each, the total cost is 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we'll add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay John: $80 + $20 = $100.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms to simplify the equation:

5x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 8

Since we are looking for the length of the longer piece, we can multiply x by 4:

4x = 4 * 8 = 32

"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of seasoning needed. Let's start by identifying the given information:

- 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat
- 16 meatballs per pound of meat
- Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs

First, we need to find the number of pounds of meat Aiden will use. We can set up a proportion using the ratio of meatballs to pounds of meat:

16 meatballs / 1 pound = 80 meatballs / x pounds

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

16x = 80
x = 80 / 16
x = 5 pounds

Now that we know Aiden will use 5 pounds of meat, we can find the amount of seasoning needed using the ratio of seasoning to pounds of meat:

2 tablespoons / 1 pound = x tablespoons / 5 pounds

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2 * 5 = x
x = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we'll break it down into two segments: the initial 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

The initial 16 minutes are charged at $0.25 per minute. So, the cost for this segment is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

The remaining 20 minutes are charged at the reduced rate of $0.20 per minute. So, the cost for this segment is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

To find the total cost of the 36-minute call, we add the costs of the two segments:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'. We are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so we can set up the equation:

b = 3c - 2

We also know that each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people, so the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can set up another equation:

c + b = 10

Now we have a system of two equations:

b = 3c - 2
c + b = 10

We can substitute the expression for b from the first equation into the second equation:

c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4c = 12

Divide by 4:

c = 3

The number of cupcakes Carly made is 3."
"To calculate the total cost of Karen's salon visit, we'll start by determining the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure. The combined cost of these services is $35 (manicure) + $40 (pedicure) = $75. 

Since the salon offers a 20% discount for getting both services, we'll calculate the discount amount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost of the manicure and pedicure: $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the nail art. With 10 fingers and a cost of $3 per nail, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, add the cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art to find the total cost: $60 + $30 = $90.

"To calculate the total number of magazines Susan receives every year, we'll start by multiplying the number of magazines that send 12 issues a year by the number of issues they send. This gives us 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

Next, we'll consider the magazine that sends 6 issues a year. As it is, this magazine contributes 6 issues to the total count.

Now, let's focus on the last magazine. Since it sends 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine, we can find the number of issues it sends by multiplying 6 by 4, which equals 24 issues.

To find the total number of magazines Susan receives every year, we simply add the issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

"To solve this problem, we can use linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of paintings Samantha, Shelley, and Kim have.

Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as K. Since Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, the number of paintings Shelley has is K + 8.

We also know that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so the number of paintings Samantha has is (K + 8) - 12. We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(K + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

K - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

K = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To determine the price of the toy after the discount in January, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, we'll calculate the price increase in December. The toy's price rose by 80% of its original price of $40. To find the increase, we multiply $40 by 80% (or 0.8).

$40 * 0.8 = $32

Now, we add the increase to the original price to get the new price in December.

$40 + $32 = $72

Next, we'll calculate the price decrease in January. The price dropped by 50% of the December price. To find the decrease, we multiply $72 by 50% (or 0.5).

$72 * 0.5 = $36

Finally, we subtract the decrease from the December price to get the price in January.

$72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider both his standard rate lessons and the discounted rate lessons for the veteran.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard rate lessons. Charlie charges $80 per hour and has 4 1-hour lessons at this rate. The total earnings from these lessons are:
4 hours * $80/hour = $320

Next, we'll calculate the earnings from the lessons with the veteran. Charlie reduces his rate by 25% for these lessons, which means he earns 75% of his standard rate. To find the discounted rate, we multiply the standard rate by 0.75:
$80 * 0.75 = $60 per hour
Charlie has 2 1-hour lessons with the veteran, so the total earnings from these lessons are:
2 hours * $60/hour = $120

"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps.

First, let's calculate the number of apples Walter ate. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 apples, we multiply 60 by 2/5:

60 * (2/5) = (60 * 2) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

Now, we subtract the number of apples eaten from the total:

60 - 24 = 36 apples

Next, we need to find 25% of the remaining apples to determine how many Walter gave to his sister. To do this, we multiply 36 by 25% (or 0.25):

36 * 0.25 = 9 apples

We subtract the number of apples given to his sister from the remaining apples:

36 - 9 = 27 apples

Finally, we multiply the number of apples Walter sold to his uncle by the price per apple ($3) to find the total amount of money he received:

27 * 3 = 81 dollars

"To find the number of novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a proportion using the given information. Since 9 novels represent 3 quarters of the total, we can express this as 9 = (3/4)x, where x is the total number of novels written this year.

To isolate x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3. This gives us x = 9 * (4/3).

Now, we can simplify the right-hand side by multiplying 9 by 4 and then dividing by 3. This yields x = 36/3 = 12.

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To determine the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we need to first calculate the total distance he traveled. Given his average speed of 50 km/hr and the duration of his trip (3 days), we can calculate the total hours he spent traveling.

There are 24 hours in a day, so the total hours Michael traveled is:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the distance covered, we will divide the distance covered by the total distance (6000 km) and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100

"To determine the initial number of grapes, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps. 

First, we know Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of juice. So, the number of grapes her brother used is 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

Next, we find the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother, which is 6 (Madeline's grapes) + 30 (her brother's grapes) = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Now, we add the total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother to find the initial number of grapes. This is 36 (Madeline and her brother's grapes) + 48 (their mother's grapes) = 84 grapes.

Now, we can find the total cost per week by adding the individual costs: $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to multiply the total cost per week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the task, we divide the total time by 5:

1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes per day

Next, we convert the 8-hour workday to minutes:

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning by dividing the daily cleaning time by the total daily time and multiplying by 100:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of books one bookcase can hold. 

First, let's consider the middle shelves. Since there are 2 middle shelves, and each can hold 10 books, the total capacity of the middle shelves is 2 * 10 = 20 books.

Next, we'll determine the capacity of the bottom shelf. It can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

Now, let's calculate the capacity of the top shelf. It can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, which means it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

To find the total capacity of one bookcase, we add the capacities of all the shelves: 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

Finally, we need to determine how many bookcases Elly needs to hold 110 books. We can do this by dividing the total number of books (110) by the capacity of one bookcase (55).

"To determine Rose's profit, we need to calculate her total cost and total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since she purchased five dozens, we multiply 5 by 12 (the number of eggs in a dozen): 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the eggs. The cost per dozen is $2.40, so we multiply 5 dozens by $2.40: 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Now, let's calculate Rose's total revenue. She sells 3 eggs for $1, so we divide the total number of eggs by 3 to find the number of sets she can sell: 60 ÷ 3 = 20 sets. Then, we multiply the number of sets by the price per set: 20 * $1 = $20.

Finally, we calculate Rose's profit by subtracting her total cost from her total revenue: $20 - $12 = $8.

"To determine the number of white hats, we'll break down the information step by step.

First, we know that half of the 100 hats are red. This means 50% of the hats are red, which is equivalent to 0.5 * 100 = 50 red hats.

Now, we need to find the number of blue hats. Since 50 hats are red, the remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50. We're told that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find 3/5 of 50, we can multiply 50 by 3 and then divide by 5: (50 * 3) / 5 = 150 / 5 = 30 blue hats.

The rest of the hats are white. We've already accounted for 50 red hats and 30 blue hats, so the number of white hats is 100 - (50 + 30) = 100 - 80 = 20.

"To find the cost per stick of jerky, we'll start by calculating the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original cost per bag is $18.00, and the discount is $3.00. To find the total cost after the discount, we'll subtract the discount from the original cost.
$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we need to convert the total cost from dollars to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we can multiply the total cost in dollars by 100 to get the total cost in cents.
$15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents

Next, we'll divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks in a bag to find the cost per stick. There are 30 sticks in a bag.

We know that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write an equation based on this information:

b = 5s - 4

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up another equation:

s + b = 116

Now, we can substitute the expression for b from the first equation into the second equation:

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of events and apply the principles of subtraction and set theory.

Initially, Brendan has a set of 10 marbles. When he drops half of them, we can represent this as a subtraction of half the original set. Since half of 10 is 5, we subtract 5 from the original set, leaving Brendan with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles.

Next, Brendan finds 3 more marbles, which we can represent as the union of the remaining marbles and the newly found marbles. This results in a new set of 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

However, upon closer inspection, Brendan realizes that one of the marbles is actually a bead, which is not part of the original set of marbles. We can represent this as the removal of an element from the set, leaving Brendan with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Therefore, Brendan ends up with 7 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of telephone calls, the number of customers visiting the dealership, and the number of cars sold. We are given two key ratios:

1. 25 telephone calls : 1 customer visiting the dealership
2. 2 customers visiting the dealership : 1 car sold

We can start by using the second ratio to find the number of customers Jason needs to attract to sell 15 cars. Since 2 customers result in 1 car sale, we multiply the number of cars he needs to sell by 2:

15 cars * 2 customers/car = 30 customers

Now, we use the first ratio to find the number of telephone calls required to attract 30 customers. Since 25 calls result in 1 customer, we multiply the number of customers by 25:

30 customers * 25 calls/customer = 750 calls

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to calculate each type separately.

First, let's calculate the total number of flashlights. Since there is a flashlight for every person, and there are 4 people, we have 4 flashlights. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms, so we multiply 8 rooms by 2 flashlights per room, which equals 16 flashlights. The total number of flashlights is the sum of these two values: 4 + 16 = 20.

Next, let's calculate the total number of candles. The house has 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each, while the other half have 5 medium candles each. To find the number of rooms in each category, we divide the total number of rooms by 2: 8 / 2 = 4. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other 4 have 5 medium candles each. The total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16, and the total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20. The total number of candles is the sum of these two values: 16 + 20 = 36.

Finally, we add the total number of flashlights and candles to get the final answer.

"The art of division. In this scenario, we're tasked with dividing a total of 110 chips among 5 family members. To achieve this, we'll employ the fundamental concept of division, where we distribute a certain quantity into equal parts.

First, let's establish the total number of chips: 2 bags with 55 chips each results in a total of 2 * 55 = 110 chips.

Now, to determine the number of chips each person receives, we'll divide the total number of chips (110) by the number of family members (5). This operation can be represented as:

110 ÷ 5 = 22

Thus, each family member will receive 22 chips.

"To determine the total time required to complete the Rubik's cube, we'll break down the time for each side. 

The first side takes 5 minutes. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first, so they take 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each. The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's calculate the total time by adding up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The answer is: 30"
"Let's analyze the given information. We know that the number of helmets is 20, and the number of helmets is half the number of footballs. This can be represented as a ratio of helmets to footballs: 1:2 or 1/2. To find the number of footballs, we can multiply the number of helmets by 2.

Number of footballs = 2 * Number of helmets
Number of footballs = 2 * 20
Number of footballs = 40

Now, we are also given that the number of robots is half the number of helmets. This can be represented as a ratio of robots to helmets: 1:2 or 1/2. To find the number of robots, we can divide the number of helmets by 2.

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

To find the total number of items, we simply add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

"To determine the number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he spends at work and then divide that by the time it takes to deal with a call.

First, let's convert the hours Tim spends at work per day into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 6 hours by 60 minutes per hour to get 6 * 60 = 360 minutes per day.

Next, we multiply the daily minutes by the number of days in his work week: 360 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1800 minutes per week.

Now, we divide the total weekly minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call, which is 15 minutes. This gives us 1800 minutes per week / 15 minutes per call = 120 calls per week.

"To determine the time difference, we need to calculate the time it takes for the old varnish and the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings. Since it takes 7 minutes for the coat to dry on one painting, the total time for 6 paintings would be 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes.

Next, we'll calculate the time for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings. With a drying time of 12 minutes per painting, the total time for 6 paintings would be 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes.

Now, let's find the difference in time: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we'll calculate the water required for each group and then add them together.

First, let's consider the 4 plants that need half a cup of water each. Since half a cup is equivalent to 1/2, we multiply 4 by 1/2, which equals 4 * 1/2 = 4/2 = 2 cups of water.

Next, the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each will require 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water.

Now, let's find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the remaining plants are 20 - 12 = 8. Since they need a quarter of a cup of water each, which is equivalent to 1/4, we multiply 8 by 1/4, resulting in 8 * 1/4 = 8/4 = 2 cups of water.

Finally, we add the water needed for each group: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water.

"To determine the time it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we need to calculate the time spent hopping on land and swimming through water, then add them together.

Given that Phineas is 200 yards away from home, with half the distance (100 yards) on land and the other half (100 yards) in water, we can proceed with the calculations.

Phineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute. To find the time spent on land, we divide the distance by the speed: 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

He swims through water at a speed of 10 yards per minute. To find the time spent in water, we divide the distance by the speed: 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on land and in water to find the total time: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

"To calculate the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the main phone and the additional phones. Given that the main phone costs $20 and it's twice as much as each additional phone, we can deduce that each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so we multiply the cost of one additional phone by 4: 4 * $10 = $40.

Finally, we add the cost of the main phone to the cost of the additional phones to get the total cost of the phone plan: $20 + $40 = $60.

"To determine the total amount of money Derrick makes in June, we need to perform a series of calculations involving multiplication and unit conversion.

First, we convert the number of doughnuts made per day from dozens to individual units. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, Derrick's bakery makes 10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts per day.

Next, we calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June by multiplying the daily production by the number of days in June. June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts made in June is 120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts.

Finally, we multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut to find the total amount of money Derrick makes in June. 3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200.

"To calculate Alicia's total dry-cleaning expenses over 5 weeks, we'll first determine her weekly costs. 

She drops off 5 blouses at $5 each, so that's 5 * $5 = $25. 
She also drops off 2 pairs of pants at $8 each, which is 2 * $8 = $16. 
Lastly, she drops off 1 skirt at $6, so that's 1 * $6 = $6. 

Now, let's add up her weekly costs: $25 + $16 + $6 = $47. 

Since we need to find her total expenses over 5 weeks, we multiply her weekly costs by 5: $47 * 5 = $235.

"To determine the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to calculate his new speaking speed and the total number of words he needs to speak.

First, let's find John's new speaking speed. Since his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed of 150 WPM, we can multiply his original speed by 2.5:
New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Next, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. With 450 words per page, we can multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page:
Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed. To do this, we'll divide the total number of words by his new speaking speed:
Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 minutes

"To determine the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, let's calculate the number of people present on each of the first three days. On the first day, there were 50 people. The next day, 20 more people were present, so the total for the second day is 50 + 20 = 70 people. On the third day, the number of people increased to twice the number on the second day, which is 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, we'll find the total number of people for the first three days by adding the number of people for each day:
50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people

For the remaining 4 days of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people per day. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we multiply the average by the number of days:
60 * 4 = 240 people

Finally, we add the total number of people for the first three days and the rest of the week to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:
260 + 240 = 500 people

Total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:

"To determine the total number of popped kernels, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we establish the initial popping rate: 20 kernels in the first 30 seconds.

Next, we calculate the number of kernels popped in the subsequent 30-second intervals:
- In the next 30 seconds, the kernels pop at three times the initial rate: 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
- Then, the kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate: 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
- After that, the popping slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds: 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

Now, we add up the kernels popped in these intervals: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

Finally, we account for the additional kernels that popped from residual heat – a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds: 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Adding these to the total, we get: 200 + 10 = 210

"To tackle this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. First, let's establish the ratio of lemons to lemon juice. We know that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. This ratio will be crucial in determining the total number of lemons needed.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of lemon juice required for the regular 4 gallons of lemonade. Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, we'll need 4 cups of juice in total. Using the established ratio, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for the regular lemonade: 4 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons.

Now, let's consider the extra gallon of lemonade that needs to be twice as tart. This means it will require twice the amount of lemon juice, which is 2 cups. Again, using the established ratio, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon: 2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons.

Finally, we add the lemons needed for the regular lemonade and the extra gallon to find the total number of lemons required: 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons.

"To determine the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we'll start by calculating the daily consumption of each breed. 

The daily consumption of the 3 German Shepherds is 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms. 
The daily consumption of the 2 Bulldogs is 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms. 

Now, we'll add these amounts to find the total daily consumption: 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we'll multiply the total daily consumption by 7 to find the total weekly consumption: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we'll start by calculating the total number of legs. 

First, we'll find the total number of legs for the 2-legged animals. Since there are 10 animals with 2 legs each, we multiply 10 by 2, which equals 20 legs.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of legs for the 4-legged animals. With 15 animals having 4 legs each, we multiply 15 by 4, resulting in 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of animals: 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs.

Since each pair of legs consists of 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the total number of pairs: 80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a simple linear equation. Let's denote the number of red blocks as 'r'. We know that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, and it consists of 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks.

Number of blue blocks: 4
Number of yellow blocks: 2 * 4 = 8

The total number of blocks can be represented as the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks. So, we can write the equation as:

4 (blue blocks) + 8 (yellow blocks) + r (red blocks) = 32

Combine the constants:
12 + r = 32

Now, isolate 'r' by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:
r = 32 - 12
r = 20

"To determine the distance Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled west and then subtract the total distance he traveled east, as the eastward journey is in the opposite direction.

First, we calculate the distance traveled west: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance traveled west = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, we calculate the distance traveled east: 
Distance traveled east = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, the net eastward distance is the difference between the eastward and westward distances. 
Net eastward distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west
Net eastward distance = 144 miles - 90 miles
Net eastward distance = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles east of his house.

"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we'll apply the depreciation for each year sequentially.

First, we'll calculate the depreciation for the first year, which is 30% of the initial value of $9000.
Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Next, we'll calculate the depreciation for the second year, which is 30% of the value after the first year.
Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Finally, we'll calculate the depreciation for the third year, which is 20% of the value after the second year.
Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, we need to first establish the quantities of the other colors. We know there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, we can calculate the number of orange candies by multiplying the number of red candies by 2: 54 * 2 = 108.

Next, we find the number of yellow candies, which is half the number of red candies. We calculate this by dividing the number of red candies by 2: 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we add the quantities of red, orange, and yellow candies to find their total: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Given that the bag contains 232 candies in total, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

"To calculate the total cost of Helen's trip, we'll first determine the cost of her hotel stay. Since she booked the hotel for 3 nights at $80 per night, we multiply the number of nights by the nightly rate: 3 * $80 = $240.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of her bus rides. Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. To find 10% of $80, we multiply $80 by 0.1: $80 * 0.1 = $8. Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, we multiply the cost per ride by the number of rides: 7 * $8 = $56.

Now, we add the cost of the hotel stay and the cost of the bus rides to find the total cost of Helen's trip: $240 + $56 = $296.

"To calculate the total cost, we'll first determine the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns, then add them together.

The cost of the tickets is found by multiplying the number of adult tickets by the cost per adult ticket and adding the cost of the child ticket. So, 2 adult tickets at $12 each is 2 * $12 = $24. Adding the $8 child ticket gives us a total ticket cost of $24 + $8 = $32.

Next, we calculate the cost of the popcorns by multiplying the number of popcorns by the cost per popcorn. In this case, 2 popcorns at $3 each is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, we add the total ticket cost to the total popcorn cost to find the overall total. So, $32 (tickets) + $6 (popcorns) = $38.

"To determine the force required to move the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and the two children. 

The weight of the car is 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children weigh 75 pounds each. So, the total weight of the children is 2 * 75 = 150 pounds. 

Now, let's add these weights together: 
1200 (car) + 250 (luggage) + 150 (children) = 1600 pounds.

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate this force by multiplying the total weight by 0.01 (which is equivalent to 1%). 

Force = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds.

"Calculating the perimeter of a rectangle is a straightforward process, and I'd be happy to help James determine how much crepe paper he needs for his birthday party.

To find the perimeter, we need to add the lengths of all four sides of the rectangular fence. Since opposite sides of a rectangle are equal, we can simply add the length and width, then multiply by 2.

Given the length (L) is 20 feet and the width (W) is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(L + W)
Perimeter = 2(20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2(35)
Perimeter = 70

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to decorate his backyard fence.

"To determine the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs, we'll start by calculating the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of hot dogs per guest.

20 (guests) * 2 (hot dogs per guest) = 40 hot dogs

John already has 4 hot dogs, so we subtract those from the total required to find out how many more he needs.

40 (required) - 4 (already has) = 36 hot dogs

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, we divide the number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack.

"To solve this problem, we can analyze the situation step by step, focusing on the pattern of children joining the group.

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck. On the second street, each of these 5 children is joined by another child, effectively doubling the number of children. This results in 5 * 2 = 10 children.

On the third street, each child in the existing group of 10 is joined by 2 more children. This means each of the 10 children is now part of a group of 3 (the original child and the 2 new ones). Therefore, the total number of children becomes 10 * 3 = 30.

However, the original 5 children then decide to leave the group. To find the final number of children following the truck, we need to subtract the original 5 from the total of 30. This gives us 30 - 5 = 25.

Charisma practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga, 5 days a week, which equals 60 * 5 = 300 minutes per week. In 4 weeks, she practices yoga for 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we add the total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

To convert the total time to hours, we divide by 60: 2040 / 60 = 34 hours.

The final answer is: 34"
"To calculate the total square feet of the quilt, we'll start by multiplying the number of each type of shirt by its respective square footage. 

First, we'll calculate the square footage of the small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet. This is a straightforward multiplication problem, where we're simply adding 3 together 11 times.

Next, we'll calculate the square footage of the medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet. Again, this is a basic multiplication problem, where we're adding 4 together 8 times.

Finally, we'll calculate the square footage of the large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet. This is another simple multiplication problem, where we're adding 6 together 6 times.

Now that we have the square footage of each type of shirt, we can add them together to find the total square footage of the quilt: 33 + 32 + 36. To do this, we'll start by adding 33 and 32, which gives us 65. Then, we'll add 36 to 65, which gives us a total of 101.

"To find the total number of sunflower seeds, we first need to determine the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is 12, 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To calculate this, we find 50% of 36, which is 0.5 * 36 = 18. Then, we add this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we simply add the seeds of the small and large sunflower to find the total number of seeds: 36 + 54 = 90.

"To determine the number of pens Sarah has, we must first establish the number of pens Timothy owns. Given that George has 18 pens and Timothy has three times that amount, we can calculate Timothy's pens by multiplying George's pens by 3. 

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Now, since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can find her total by dividing Timothy's pens by 2.

Sarah's pens = Timothy's pens / 2
Sarah's pens = 54 / 2
Sarah's pens = 27

"To solve this problem, we'll start by using the information that Albert is 36"" tall and Anne is twice his size. We can express Anne's height as 2 * Albert's height. 

Let's denote Albert's height as A, Anne's height as An, and Jackie's current height as J. We know that A = 36"", An = 2A, and J = An - 2.

Substituting the value of A into the equation for An, we get An = 2 * 36"" = 72"". Now, we can find Jackie's current height by subtracting 2"" from Anne's height: J = 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we can find her height before summer by subtracting 3"" from her current height. Let's denote Jackie's height before summer as Jb. Then, Jb = J - 3"" = 70"" - 3"" = 67"".

"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we'll break down the costs of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt ($8) and 50% off for the second T-shirt. The discount on the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4. So, the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 - $4 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price is $40, and it's 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 0.4 * $40 = $16. Now, subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price: $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends: $12 + $24 = $36.

"To determine the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings from completing his chores and then subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for completing his chores. Since he did his chores for 3 weeks, his total earnings are $6 * 3 = $18.

The cost of ice cream cones for Ryan and his 3 friends is $1.25 per cone. Since there are 4 of them, the total cost is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, subtract the cost of ice cream cones from Ryan's total earnings: $18 - $5 = $13.

Ryan has $13 left to spend on movie tickets, which cost $6.50 each. To find out how many tickets he can buy, divide the amount of money he has by the cost of a ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

"To determine the profit from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the total cost of production and subtract it from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of the ingredients per jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Now, we can find the total cost per jar by adding the costs of the individual ingredients:
$12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Next, we'll calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
$44 * 10 = $440

The total revenue from selling 10 jars at $50 each is:
$50 * 10 = $500

Finally, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

"The art of calculating the total value of coins in a jar. A task that requires precision and a keen understanding of multiplication and addition. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we have 32 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply 32 by $0.25 to get the total value of the quarters: 32 * $0.25 = $8.

Next, we have 95 dimes, each worth $0.10. Multiplying 95 by $0.10 gives us the total value of the dimes: 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.

Moving on to the nickels, we have 120 of them, each worth $0.05. The total value of the nickels is: 120 * $0.05 = $6.

Lastly, we have 750 pennies, each worth $0.01. Multiplying 750 by $0.01 gives us the total value of the pennies: 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values together to get the total dollar amount in the jar:
$8 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31

"Let's break down the problem step by step, using my expertise in addition and subtraction.

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. To find the total number of cookies, we simply add these numbers together:

9 (oatmeal) + 4 (chocolate chip) + 5 (sugar) = 18 cookies

Now, Randy eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. We subtract 1 from each type of cookie:

Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

The total number of cookies after the snack is:
8 + 3 + 4 = 15 cookies

Next, Randy eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. We subtract 2 from the oatmeal cookies:
Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6
Chocolate chip: 3 (no change)
Sugar: 4 (no change)

The total number of cookies after lunch is:
6 + 3 + 4 = 13 cookies

Then, Randy gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. We subtract 2 from the sugar cookies:
Oatmeal: 6 (no change)
Chocolate chip: 3 (no change)
Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

The total number of cookies after giving to friends is:
6 + 3 + 2 = 11 cookies

Finally, Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. We add 4 to each type of cookie:
Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

The total number of cookies after baking is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. Since the dog digs 6 holes per day and Nate is away for 14 days, the total number of holes is:

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes per day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes every night. To find the net number of holes filled per day, we subtract the number of holes dug from the number of holes filled:

9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = 3 holes/day

Now, we can calculate the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes by dividing the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:

84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Finally, to find the number of weeks it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the number of days by 7:

28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables:

T = number of test tubes gathered
P = number of Petri dishes gathered
B = number of beakers gathered

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.

We also know that he gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation:
T + P + B = 29

Substituting the values of T and P, we get:
8 + 16 + B = 29

Combine like terms:
24 + B = 29

Subtract 24 from both sides:
B = 5

However, we are asked to find the number of beakers Igor lost, not the number he gathered. Since he was supposed to gather 7 beakers, the number of beakers he lost is:
7 - B = 7 - 5 = 2

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations using ratios and proportions. Let's denote the time it takes Vanessa to run one mile as 'v' and the time it takes Aaron to run one mile as 'a'. We are given that Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we can write the equation:

a = v/2

We are also given that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron must have run half that distance, which is 2 miles. We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

2a = 16

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'a' from the first equation into the second equation:

2(v/2) = 16

Simplifying the equation, we get:

v = 16

This means that it takes Vanessa 16 minutes to run 2 miles. Since Vanessa actually ran 4 miles, we can multiply the time by 2 to find the total time it took her to complete her part of the race:

4 miles * 16 minutes/2 miles = 32 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and establish the relationships between the ages of John, James, Dora, and John's youngest son.

First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. This means her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that John was 19 years old when James was born. This implies that the age difference between John and James is 19 years.

Now, we can find John's current age by adding the age difference to James' current age: 18 + 19 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the age difference between John and his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so we can write another equation:

2c + 4w = 70

To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. We can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' in both equations the same:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
