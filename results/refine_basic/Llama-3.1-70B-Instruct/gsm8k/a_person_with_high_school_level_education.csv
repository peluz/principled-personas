"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to figure out how many eggs she sells. 

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs she uses for herself. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins, so that's 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

Since her ducks lay 16 eggs per day, she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left to sell.

Now, we know she sells each egg for $2. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells (9) by the price per egg ($2). 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

The total number of bolts is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

First, let's find the total cost. Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. So, the total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 2.5 times the original value of the house. To find the new value, we multiply the original value by 2.5. 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

Now, let's find the profit. The profit is the selling price minus the total cost. The selling price is $200,000, and the total cost is $130,000. So, the profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sprints he runs and multiply it by the distance of each sprint.

Since James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week, the total number of sprints per week is 3 * 3 = 9 sprints. 

Now, we multiply the total number of sprints by the distance of each sprint, which is 60 meters. 

Total meters per week = 9 sprints * 60 meters per sprint = 540 meters

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we need to calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day. Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed needed. This gives us 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to consider the price of each pair. Since every second glass costs 60% of the original price, we can calculate the price of the second glass by multiplying $5 by 0.6, which gives us $3.

Now, let's find the cost of one pair of glasses. The first glass costs $5, and the second glass costs $3, so the total cost of one pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide them into 8 pairs. The cost of 8 pairs would be 8 * $8 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to start with the information given about Seattle. Seattle has 20 sheep.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we multiply the number of sheep in Seattle by 4 to find the number of sheep in Charleston. 
4 * 20 = 80 sheep in Charleston.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so we multiply the number of sheep in Charleston by 2 to find the number of sheep in Toulouse. 
2 * 80 = 160 sheep in Toulouse.

Now, we add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes Carla to download the file, let's break it down step by step.

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before Windows forces a restart. To find 40% of 200 GB, we multiply 200 by 0.4, which gives us 80 GB. Carla can download 2 GB per minute, so to download 80 GB, it takes her 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, which takes 20 minutes, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. So, she downloads the entire 200 GB file. Since she can download 2 GB per minute, it takes her 200 / 2 = 100 minutes to download the whole file.

Now, let's add up the time it took for the initial download (40 minutes), the time for the restart (20 minutes), and the time for the complete download (100 minutes). The total time is 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

"To find out how far John is from home, we need to figure out how far he traveled in the 4 hours after he turned around.

First, let's look at the time he spent driving. He was stuck in traffic for 2 hours, so that doesn't count. Then, he drove for half an hour at 30 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

After that, he drove for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5) at 80 miles per hour. Let's calculate the distance:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

So, in the 4 hours after turning around, he traveled a total of 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

Now, let's think about the distance he traveled before turning around. He drove for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour, so the distance is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since he was trying to get back home, we subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the distance he traveled before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the extra 5 hours.

For the first 40 hours, Eliza earns $10 per hour. So, her pay for 40 hours is 40 * $10 = $400.

For the extra 5 hours, Eliza earns 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. So, her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

Now, let's add her regular pay and overtime pay to find her total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460.

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. So, we multiply 60 by 3 to get 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180. We can do this by multiplying 180 by 0.3, which gives us 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Since Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen, the total cost of the donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. She bought 2 dozen at $80 per dozen, so the total cost of the cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes. Toula bought 6 dozen at $55 per dozen, so the total cost of the cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs of all the pastries together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) plus the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree ($3 per year). The total revenue is the annual revenue from selling lemons (7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year).

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.5
Year 2: Total cost = $93 + $3 = $96, Total revenue = $10.5 * 2 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 + $3 = $99, Total revenue = $10.5 * 3 = $31.5
Year 4: Total cost = $99 + $3 = $102, Total revenue = $10.5 * 4 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 + $3 = $105, Total revenue = $10.5 * 5 = $52.5
Year 6: Total cost = $105 + $3 = $108, Total revenue = $10.5 * 6 = $63

Since the total revenue is still less than the total cost in year 6, we need to calculate for more years.

Year 7: Total cost = $108 + $3 = $111, Total revenue = $10.5 * 7 = $73.5
Year 8: Total cost = $111 + $3 = $114, Total revenue = $10.5 * 8 = $84
Year 9: Total cost = $114 + $3 = $117, Total revenue = $10.5 * 9 = $94.5
Year 10: Total cost = $117 + $3 = $120, Total revenue = $10.5 * 10 = $105
Year 11: Total cost = $120 + $3 = $123, Total revenue = $10.5 * 11 = $115.5
Year 12: Total cost = $123 + $3 = $126, Total revenue = $10.5 * 12 = $126
Year 13: Total cost = $126 + $3 = $129, Total revenue = $10.5 * 13 = $136.5

In year 13, the total revenue ($136.5) is more than the total cost ($129). Therefore, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. We know Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after visiting the three houses. Before that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, before the orange house, she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners.

Before the orange house, she had 2 more vacuum cleaners than after the red house. So, after the red house, she had 10 - 2 = 8 vacuum cleaners.

Before the red house, she had sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the number of vacuum cleaners she started with 'x'. Then, the number of vacuum cleaners she had after the green house is x - x/3 = 2x/3.

We know that after the green house, she had 8 + 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners. So, we can set up the equation:
2x/3 = 10

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3/2:
x = 15

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since there are 20 students in total, we can calculate the number of students in contemporary dance as follows:

20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

Now, we subtract the number of students in contemporary dance from the total number of students to find the remaining students:

20 - 4 = 16 students

Next, we know that 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. We can calculate the number of students in jazz dance as follows:

25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Now, we subtract the number of students in jazz dance from the remaining students to find the number of students in hip-hop dance:

16 - 4 = 12 students

Finally, we can calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by dividing the number of students in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiplying by 100:

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To figure out which option is more profitable, we need to calculate the increase in value for each.

The jewelry is worth $5,000 and is expected to go up by 2.5%. To find the increase in value, we multiply $5,000 by 2.5% (or 0.025). This gives us $5,000 * 0.025 = $125.

The electronic gadgets are worth $8,000 and are expected to go up by 1.2%. To find the increase in value, we multiply $8,000 by 1.2% (or 0.012). This gives us $8,000 * 0.012 = $96.

Since $125 is more than $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to calculate the distance traveled on both days. 

On the first day, both trains traveled 80 miles westward. On the second day, they traveled 150 miles northward. Since the directions are different (west and north), we can't directly add these distances to find the total distance between the starting and ending points. However, we can find the total distance each train traveled.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of the distances traveled on both days. So, we add the distance traveled on the first day (80 miles) to the distance traveled on the second day (150 miles).

Total distance = 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate how much she makes from teaching and coaching, then add those amounts together.

First, let's look at her teaching job. She makes $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. So, her weekly pay from teaching is $20 * 35 = $700. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual pay from teaching is $700 * 50 = $35,000.

Next, let's look at her coaching job. She makes $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. So, her weekly pay from coaching is $30 * 15 = $450. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual pay from coaching is $450 * 50 = $22,500.

Now, let's add her annual pay from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to do some calculations. First, we need to figure out how many days are in 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 weeks by 7 days per week, which gives us 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Now, we know Claire eats 3 eggs every day, so we multiply the number of days by the number of eggs she eats per day: 28 days * 3 eggs/day = 84 eggs.

Since we want to know how many dozens of eggs that is, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12, because 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs. So, 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the 12-mile trail. We can do this by dividing the total distance by the average speed.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, we need to find the time left for her to complete the remaining 6 miles.

Time left = Total time - Time already taken
Time left = 3 hours - 2 hours
Time left = 1 hour

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance by dividing the remaining distance by the time left.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water and we have 10 liters of it initially, but we spill 1 liter, we are left with 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink. To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we multiply the amount of orange drink left by 2/3. 

So, the amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink. The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, and we have 15 liters of it. To find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we multiply the amount of pineapple drink by 3/5.

So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to figure out how old Raymond is now and then subtract his son's age from it.

Since Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, and Samantha is 31 years old now, we can calculate Raymond's age by adding 6 to Samantha's age. 
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

Now, we know that Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age.
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

"To find the original price of the book, we need to figure out what number, when multiplied by 75% (or 0.75), equals $19.50. This is because Kyle got a 25% discount, so he paid 75% of the original price.

Let's set up an equation to solve for the original price. We'll call the original price 'x'. The equation is:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for 'x', we need to get 'x' by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

Now, divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's current age = 11x

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate each friend's guess and then find the average.

The first friend's guess is 80.

The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first one. To find half of 80, we divide 80 by 2, which is 40. Then, we add 20 to get 60.

The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first one. To find 25% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.25, which is 20. Then, we add 20 to 80 to get 100.

Now, we add up the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the sum by the number of guesses. There are 3 guesses, so we divide 240 by 3.

Combine the 'x' terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Now, subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

So, the number of silver coins is 40. To find the number of gold coins, we add 30 to this number: 40 + 30 = 70.

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we need to figure out how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold his lego sets for $15 each, and he had 13 of them. So, he made a total of 13 * 15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, which cost him 8 * 20 = $160. He also had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left is $160 + $5 = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, that means he didn't spend the money from all 13 lego sets. The amount he didn't spend is $195 - $165 = $30.

Since each lego set is $15, the number of lego sets he didn't sell is $30 / $15 = 2.

So, John still has 2 lego sets.

"To find John's running speed, we need to know the total distance he runs and the total time he runs. We already know the distance, which is 60 miles. Now, let's calculate the total time.

John runs 3 hours on the first day. On the other two days, he runs half as much, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. So, the total time is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate John's running speed using the formula: Speed = Distance / Time. Plugging in the values, we get:
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to find Dana's running and walking speeds, then calculate the distance she can travel in 6 hours.

We know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. So, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she can travel in 2 hours while running is 2 * 6 = 12 miles.
The distance she can travel in 4 hours while walking is 4 * 1.5 = 6 miles.

The total distance she can travel in 6 hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

"To find Brandon's iPhone age, we need to start with Suzy's iPhone, which is 1 year old. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we multiply Suzy's age by 2. So, Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Now, we know Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's. To find Brandon's iPhone age, we multiply Ben's age by 4. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how far Polly can throw the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, and then subtract the distance of the dragon's flames.

First, let's calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone. We know she can throw it 400 feet without the gemstone, and with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. So, we multiply 400 by 3 to get 1200 feet.

Now, we need to find out how far outside the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon. To do this, we subtract the distance of the dragon's flames (1000 feet) from the total distance Polly can throw the javelin (1200 feet). 

1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to calculate the total number of pieces Grandma Jones had and then subtract the number of pieces left over.

Since each pie was cut into 8 pieces and there were 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 x 8 = 40.

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

"To figure out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to start by finding out how many calories you have left for the day. You've already eaten 1800 calories, and your daily target is 2000 calories. 

So, let's subtract the calories you've already eaten from your daily target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Now, we know that the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. To find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories, we'll divide 200 by 250. This gives us 0.8 servings.

The bag of chips is 300g and has 5 servings. To find out how many grams are in one serving, we'll divide 300g by 5. This gives us 60g per serving.

Since you can eat 0.8 servings, we'll multiply 60g by 0.8. This gives us 48g.

The answer is: 48"
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate how much he spends on supplies and how much he makes from selling the candles.

Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Now, let's find out how much he makes from selling the candles. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to figure out how many articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the time it takes to write an article, which is 4 hours.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. That's a given.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find out how many more articles that is, we multiply 5 by 2/5, which is 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. That's 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. Then, she bought a package of Post-it notes, but we don't know how many were in the package. Let's call the number of Post-it notes in the package ""x"".

After buying the package, Candice had a total of 80 + x Post-it notes.

At work, she used 220 Post-it notes. So, to find out how many Post-it notes she had left, we subtract 220 from the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package: (80 + x) - 220.

We know that Candice had 23 Post-it notes left, so we can set up an equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Now, let's solve for x. First, we can simplify the left side of the equation by combining the numbers:

-140 + x = 23

Next, we can add 140 to both sides of the equation to get:

x = 23 + 140
x = 163

So, the package of Post-it notes that Candice bought had 163 notes.

The final answer is: 163"
"To find the total amount John spent on ties, we need to break down the information given. 

First, we know John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we divide the total amount spent on blue ties ($200) by the cost of each blue tie ($40). This gives us 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we multiply the number of blue ties (5) by 2 to get the number of red ties. This gives us 5 * 2 = 10 red ties.

Now, we know the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. To find the cost of a red tie, we calculate 50% of the cost of a blue tie ($40) and add it to the cost of the blue tie. 50% of $40 is 0.5 * 40 = $20. So, the cost of a red tie is $40 + $20 = $60.

The total amount spent on red ties is the number of red ties (10) multiplied by the cost of each red tie ($60). This gives us 10 * 60 = $600.

Finally, to find the total amount spent on ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties ($200) to the amount spent on red ties ($600). This gives us 200 + 600 = $800.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to calculate the total number of units first. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor.

Total number of units = 15 * 8 = 120

Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4.

Number of occupied units = 120 * (3/4) = 90

Since the rest of the units are unoccupied, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Number of unoccupied units = 120 - 90 = 30

"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week from selling eggs, we need to calculate his daily earnings first. 

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 252 by 12.

252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozen eggs per day

Now that we know Lloyd sells 21 dozen eggs per day, and each dozen costs $2, we can calculate his daily earnings.

21 dozen eggs per day * $2 per dozen = $42 per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply Lloyd's daily earnings by 7 to find his weekly earnings.

$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now that we know the distance, we can find the time it takes him to get back at a rate of 6 miles per hour.

"Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. He has comic books that weigh 1/4 pound each and toys that weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, we can calculate the weight of the comic books he removed by multiplying the number of comic books by their weight: 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds of toys.

To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we can divide the weight of toys he needs to remove (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound or 0.5 pounds): 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. Since each truck tire costs $60 and each car tire costs $40, we can calculate the total revenue for Thursday. 
6 truck tires * $60 = $360
4 car tires * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic fixed 12 car tires and no truck tires. 
12 car tires * $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday = $480

Now, let's compare the total revenue for both days. Thursday's revenue ($520) is higher than Friday's revenue ($480). To find the difference, we subtract Friday's revenue from Thursday's revenue.
$520 - $480 = $40

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she worked 10 years after the 20-year mark (30 - 20 = 10). For those 10 years, she gets 5% of the full pension each year. So, we multiply 10 years by 5% to find the total percentage of the pension she gets.

10 years * 5% per year = 10 * 0.05 = 0.5 or 50%

This means Marcy gets 50% of the full pension. To find the amount, we multiply the full pension by 50%.

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-leveled sandcastle, we need to calculate the total square footage of all levels and then divide by the number of levels.

We know the top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage as the level below it, we can work our way down. The level below the top one will have twice the square footage, so that's 2 * 16 = 32.

The next level down will have twice the square footage of the 32 square foot level, which is 2 * 32 = 64. The level below that will have twice the square footage of the 64 square foot level, which is 2 * 64 = 128.

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first year.

First, let's calculate the amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 180 days. Since the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day, the total amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days is 180 cups.

After the first 180 days, the puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food per day. There are 365 days in a year, so the puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food per day for 365 - 180 = 185 days. The total amount of dog food consumed in the remaining 185 days is 185 * 2 = 370 cups.

Now, let's add the amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to find the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year. The total amount of dog food consumed is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total amount of dog food consumed by 110 to find the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year. The number of bags of dog food is 550 / 110 = 5 bags.

"To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the costs of the two options.

First, let's calculate the cost per flower for each package. For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.83 per flower. For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.50 per flower.

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.83 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. We can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each, which will cost 9 * $1 = $9.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the other price, he will need 6 packages of 3 flowers each, which will cost 6 * $2.50 = $15.

The amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is $15 - $9 = $6.

"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The groomer is offering a 30% discount, so we'll find 30% of the original price of $100.

30% of $100 is calculated by multiplying 0.3 by $100, which equals $30. This is the discount amount.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price. So, $100 - $30 = $70.

The cost of the grooming after the discount is $70."
"To find out how many liters of water were left, we need to calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy, then subtract that from the total amount of water.

First, let's find out how much water each girl got. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, we can calculate this by dividing 24 by 6, which equals 4 liters per girl. Since there are two girls, they got a total of 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken is 8 (girls) + 6 (boy) = 14 liters.

Now, we subtract the total amount of water taken from the initial amount of water. The initial amount of water was 24 liters, so the amount of water left is 24 - 14 = 10 liters.

"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he had initially and then subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used.

First, let's add up the total number of stickers Charlie had. He started with 10 stickers, bought 21 more, and got 23 for his birthday. So, the total number of stickers he had is 10 + 21 + 23 = 54.

Then, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card. So, the total number of stickers he gave away and used is 9 + 28 = 37.

Now, let's subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used from the total number of stickers he had: 54 - 37 = 17.

Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"To find their combined weights, we need to calculate Alex's weight first. We know Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Since Grace weighs 125 pounds, we multiply 125 by 4 to get 500 pounds. Then, we subtract 2 pounds from that to get Alex's weight: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, we add their weights together: 125 (Grace's weight) + 498 (Alex's weight) = 623 pounds.

"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes, the number of roses per bush, and the number of thorns per rose.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush to get the total number of roses. 
3 rose bushes * 25 roses per bush = 75 roses

Next, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose to get the total number of thorns.
75 roses * 8 thorns per rose = 600 thorns

"To find out how many games the football team won, we need to use the information given. We know they played 22 games in total and that they won 8 more games than they lost.

Let's say the number of games they lost is 'x'. Then, the number of games they won is 'x + 8'. Since the total number of games is 22, we can set up an equation:

x (games lost) + (x + 8) (games won) = 22

Combine the 'x' terms and the constants:
2x + 8 = 22

Now, subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the 'x' term:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2 to find 'x':
x = 7

This means the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to figure out how many vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene started going on vacations when he was 23 years old, and now he's 34. So, he's been going on vacations for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations every year, we multiply the number of years by the number of vacations per year. That's 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Each vacation has one shirt, and each shirt is one quilt block. So, the total number of quilt blocks is 44.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. The second time it rang for three times as long as the first time, so we multiply 4 by 3 to get 12. The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so we divide 12 by 2 to get 6.

Now, let's add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her new monthly salary after the 10% increase. 

First, we find 10% of her initial monthly salary: 10% of $600 is 0.10 * $600 = $60. 

Now, we add this increase to her initial monthly salary: $600 + $60 = $660. 

Since her annual salary is 12 times her monthly salary, we multiply $660 by 12: $660 * 12 = $7920.

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $7920.

$7920"
"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Harald sold 'x' copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

We know that together they sold 88,000 copies. So, we can write the equation as:
x + 10x = 88,000

Combine the 'x' terms:
11x = 88,000

Now, divide both sides by 11 to solve for 'x':
x = 88,000 / 11
x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To find out how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to figure out how many bags she'll need. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we can calculate the number of guests that will actually attend the party.

First, let's find 1/4 of the total number of guests: 1/4 * 16 = 4. This means 4 guests won't show up. So, the number of guests that will attend is 16 - 4 = 12.

Now, we know Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest. To find the total number of gift bags, we multiply the number of guests by 0.75: 0.75 * 12 = 9.

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be 9 * 2 = 18.

"To figure out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate how much each adult and child will eat. 

First, let's look at the adults. Since there are 20 adults and each adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad, we multiply the number of adults by the amount each adult eats: 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

Next, we look at the children. We know that children eat half as much as adults, so each child eats 10 / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad. There are 5 children, so we multiply the number of children by the amount each child eats: 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

"To find the total number of pets, we need to figure out how many pets each person has. We know Cindy has 4 pets. Since Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, we can calculate Marcia's pets by adding 2 to Cindy's total. So, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Now, we know Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. To find Jan's total, we multiply Marcia's total by 3. So, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Finally, we add up the number of pets each person has to find the total: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

"To find Jackson's age, we need to figure out the ages of the other kids first. We know James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Now, we know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Since Corey is 11, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

We also know Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. To find Jackson's age, we subtract 5 from Amy's age. So, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Jackson's age is 4."
"To find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet, we need to first figure out his original time. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and he's 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we add 2 seconds to Lee's time to get Gerald's original time.

Gerald's original time = Lee's time + 2 seconds
Gerald's original time = 38 + 2
Gerald's original time = 40 seconds

Now, we know Gerald's speed improved by 10% due to his new diet. This means his new time will be 90% of his original time. To find 90% of his original time, we multiply his original time by 0.9.

Gerald's new time = 0.9 * Gerald's original time
Gerald's new time = 0.9 * 40
Gerald's new time = 36 seconds

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to start by finding the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to get the number of cats. 

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Next, we add the number of dogs and cats to get the combined number of pet dogs and cats.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we subtract 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats.

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Finally, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats to get the total number of pets in the neighborhood.

Total number of pets = 168 + 60 + 120 = 348

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys. To find the number of boys, we multiply 200 by 2/5, which is the same as multiplying 200 by 0.4. So, the number of boys is 200 * 0.4 = 80.

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120.

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we multiply 120 by 2/3, which is the same as multiplying 120 by 0.67 (rounded to two decimal places). So, the number of girls in the girl scout is 120 * 0.67 = 80.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to 80.

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls. So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 120 - 80 = 40.

"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to first determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can calculate James' sleep by multiplying Harry's sleep by 2/3.

Harry slept 9 hours, so James slept (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find the difference between the hours Harry slept and the hours James slept by subtracting James' sleep from Harry's sleep: 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked into sauce, and Freda ended up with 32 ounces of sauce. Since the volume is halved, the original volume of the tomatoes must have been double the volume of the sauce. So, the original volume of the tomatoes was 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Now, we know that each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans Freda used, we divide the original volume of the tomatoes (64 ounces) by the volume of each can (16 ounces): 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Finally, we're told that each can contains 3 tomatoes. To find the total number of tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can: 4 * 3 = 12.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. Out of these, 5 cars took an exit to avoid the traffic jam. So, the number of cars that actually went through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. To find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that went through the traffic jam.

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to calculate the total number of plants she has and subtract the number of plants she's giving away.

First, let's find out how many plants she already has. Since she has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, we multiply 2 by 40, which equals 80 plants. She also received 18 new plants, so we add those to the total: 80 + 18 = 98 plants.

Now, let's calculate how many plants she's giving away. She's giving away 1 plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so that's 40 plants.

To find out how many plants she'll have left, we subtract the number of plants she's giving away from the total: 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this, we multiply 20 by 1/4, which is 5. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which is 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) = 175

"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read per day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he has to read. He has to read 4 pages from his Science textbook, 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook, 7 pages from his History textbook, and 8 pages from his Geography textbook.

So, the total number of pages is 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we subtract that from the total number of pages to find out how many pages are left. 39 - 15 = 24 pages.

Now, Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days. 24 ÷ 4 = 6 pages per day.

"To figure out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break it down. John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one more before bed. That's 4 glasses of water per day.

Since he does this every weekday, we multiply 4 glasses by 5 weekdays, which gives us 20 glasses of water. On weekends, though, he has a soda with dinner instead of water, so he only has 3 glasses of water per day on Saturday and Sunday. That's 3 glasses per day times 2 days, which is 6 glasses of water.

Now, we add the glasses of water he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 + 6 = 26. So, John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. To find the number of 3-mile sections, we can divide the total distance by the distance covered in 10 minutes: 42 miles / 3 miles = 14 sections.

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we multiply the number of sections by the time per section: 14 sections * 10 minutes/section = 140 minutes.

"To find the number of jigsaw pieces left, we need to calculate the number of pieces placed by Poppy and her mom, then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

First, let's find out how many pieces Poppy placed. Since she placed a quarter of the pieces, we multiply 1000 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing by 4. So, Poppy placed 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, we subtract the number of pieces Poppy placed from the total number of pieces to find the remaining pieces. 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Next, her mom placed a third of the remaining pieces. To find a third of 750, we multiply 750 by 1/3, which is the same as dividing by 3. So, her mom placed 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, we add the number of pieces placed by Poppy and her mom to find the total number of pieces placed. 250 + 250 = 500 pieces.

Finally, we subtract the total number of pieces placed from the total number of pieces to find the number of pieces left. 1000 - 500 = 500.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box first. The box's dimensions are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. 

Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length and width, and 2 inches from the height. 

So, the inner dimensions of the box are:
Length (L) = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Width (W) = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Height (H) = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box by multiplying the length, width, and height:
Inner volume of one box = L * W * H = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume:
Total inner volume of all 3 boxes = 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

Let's start by adding up the hours of TV Frankie watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

So, the total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Now, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1.5 hours is 1.5 x 60 = 90 minutes.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes per episode to find the number of episodes. 90 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. Let's call the number of cookies he baked last year ""x"". This means he wants to bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he ends up baking 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he actually baked is 2x + 15.

Unfortunately, he drops 5 cookies while putting them out to cool, leaving him with a total of (2x + 15) - 5 cookies. We can simplify this to 2x + 10 cookies.

We're told that this number is equal to 110, so we can set up an equation:

2x + 10 = 110

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable. First, we'll subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 100

Next, we'll divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To figure out how much the gas will cost after the cashback rewards, we need to do a couple of simple calculations.

First, we need to find out the total cost of the gas. The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons. So, we multiply the price per gallon by the number of gallons:

$3.00 per gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00

Next, we need to calculate the cashback amount. The app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons. So, we multiply the cashback per gallon by the number of gallons:

$0.20 per gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost of the gas to find out how much the person will actually pay:

$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

"To find the average number of roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them ate and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate. Since her roll-ups were 2 wide and 24 long, we multiply the width by the length to get the total number of roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48.

Next, we calculate the total number of roll-ups Marcell ate. His roll-ups were 3 wide and 14 long, so we multiply the width by the length: 3 * 14 = 42.

Now, we add the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice: 48 + 42 = 90.

Finally, to find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 (since there are two people): 90 / 2 = 45.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to figure out how far Julia rowed to reach the shore. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can find her rowing speed by dividing the distance by the time.

Rowing speed = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second

Since the shore was 64 seconds away, we can multiply the time by the speed to find the total distance.

Total distance = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Now, we know the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. To find the total amount of water, we need to divide the total distance by 10 to find the number of 10-foot intervals.

Number of intervals = 80 feet / 10 feet = 8 intervals

Finally, we can multiply the number of intervals by 2 to find the total amount of water.

Total water = 8 intervals * 2 liters/interval = 16 liters

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. We also know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. We can use this information to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

Let's divide 1800 by 6 to find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:
1800 ÷ 6 = 300

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

Next, we are told that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. We can set up an equation to represent this:
Number of birds * 50 = 300

To find the number of birds, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:
Number of birds = 300 ÷ 50
Number of birds = 6

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

"To find out how much profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate how much she spent on the lumber and how much she can sell it for.

First, let's calculate the cost price. Sasha bought 10 (2 x 4 x 10) boards for $10 each, so that's 10 * $10 = $100. She also bought 5 (4 x 4 x 10) boards for $16 each, so that's 5 * $16 = $80. The total cost price is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price. To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 1.5. For the (2 x 4 x 10) boards, the selling price is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board. For the (4 x 4 x 10) boards, the selling price is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

Now, let's calculate the total selling price. For the (2 x 4 x 10) boards, the total selling price is 10 * $15 = $150. For the (4 x 4 x 10) boards, the total selling price is 5 * $24 = $120. The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price. So, the profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to figure out how many parts of the total 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water are sugar. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means there are 7 parts sugar and 13 parts water, for a total of 20 parts.

Since 7 out of 20 parts are sugar, we can find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar by multiplying the total number of teaspoons by the fraction of sugar:

Number of teaspoonfuls of sugar = (7/20) * 120
= 0.35 * 120
= 42

So, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar.

"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the total number of shoes and multiply it by the cost of each shoe. Since John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, and each pair has 2 shoes, we can find the total number of shoes by multiplying 2 pairs by 2 shoes per pair and then by 3 children. 

So, 2 * 2 * 3 is 12 shoes. Now, we multiply the total number of shoes by the cost of each shoe, which is $60. 

12 * $60 is $720.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to figure out how many vehicles were already at the port from the first day. There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles.

The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day. To find the number of vehicles imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total: 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles from the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 ÷ 5 = 4.

The number of containers imported on the second day is 4."
"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the number of sheets he uses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is 2 * 30 = 60 sheets.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

"To find the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael have, we need to calculate the number of fruits each of them brought.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. So, the total number of fruits Morisette brought is 5 + 8 = 13.

Kael brought twice the number of apples Morisette brought, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. Kael also brought half the number of oranges Morisette brought, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, let's add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought. 13 (Morisette) + 14 (Kael) = 27.

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break it down day by day.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours. For the next two days, Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. That's a total of 6 + 6 = 12 hours for those two days.

For the rest of the week, Thursday to Sunday, she slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. Since there are 4 days from Thursday to Sunday, that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours for the entire week: 8 hours on Monday, 12 hours for Tuesday and Wednesday, and 28 hours for Thursday to Sunday. That's a total of 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts. 

First, let's calculate the distance she covers in the first 3 hours when she runs at 10 miles per hour. We can do this by multiplying her speed (10 miles per hour) by the time (3 hours). 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

After the first 3 hours, Rosie has 4 hours left (7 hours - 3 hours). In these 4 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. We can calculate the distance she covers in the next 4 hours by multiplying her speed (5 miles per hour) by the time (4 hours).

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, we add the distances she covers in the two parts to find the total distance she can run in 7 hours.

Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many letters were already stamped before Jennie started putting stamps on the other letters. We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters that needed stamps. 

One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. So, Jennie stamped 20 letters. Now, the total number of already-stamped letters is 30. To find out how many were in the pile when Jennie began, we subtract the number of letters she stamped from the total number of already-stamped letters.

30 (total already-stamped letters) - 20 (letters Jennie stamped) = 10

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Julia had a total of 12 spoons when she went to set the table. We also know that her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to her.

First, let's subtract the 5 spoons her husband bought from the total number of spoons Julia had. This will give us the number of spoons Julia had before her husband gave her the 5 new spoons.

12 (total spoons) - 5 (husband's spoons) = 7

However, we also know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, to find out how many spoons Julia had initially, we need to add the 3 spoons she used to the 7 spoons she had.

7 + 3 = 10

Therefore, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to determine the number of fish sausages he purchased. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages by adding 6 to the number of chicken sausages.

Number of chicken sausages = 38
Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6 = 44

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages.

Total number of sausages = 38 + 44 = 82

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange, which is $5 less than the cost of a watermelon. So, the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dillon needs to buy:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

Finally, we add up the costs of all the items to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To find the profit the hospital makes, we need to calculate the total cost of the doctors and the total revenue from the patients.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by the doctors. Since there are 500 patients and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, we multiply the number of patients by the time spent per patient. This gives us 500 * 24 = 12,000 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60. So, 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours.

The hospital pays the doctors $150 per hour, so the total cost of the doctors is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, so the total revenue from the patients is 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue. So, the profit is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

First, a third of the elves quit. Since a third is the same as 1/3, we can multiply 60 by 1/3 to find out how many elves quit. 60 * 1/3 = 20 elves. So, 60 - 20 = 40 elves are left after the first group quits.

Then, 10 more elves quit. So, we subtract 10 from 40. 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

"To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we need to calculate his expenditure for June and then add it to his expenditure for May.

Joseph's expenditure in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less, so we subtract $60 from $500 to get his June expenditure: $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, we add his expenditure for both months: $500 + $440 = $940.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides Pam and Fred took, then multiply that by the cost per ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides. 

Together, they took 4 + 6 = 10 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, we multiply the total number of rides by the cost per ride: 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to break down the information given. Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

So, Walt's total mileage for Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. We know his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total mileage for Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday.

41 (total mileage) - 28 (Monday and Tuesday mileage) = 13 miles.

"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we need to calculate the total cost. 

First, we find out how much he pays each month. Since he gets 4 car washes a month and each car wash costs $15, we multiply the number of car washes by the cost per car wash. 

4 car washes * $15 per car wash = $60 per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 to get the yearly cost.

$60 per month * 12 months = $720 per year

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does. So, we multiply Brian's original number of video games (25) by 3, then subtract 5.

First, multiply 25 by 3: 25 * 3 = 75
Then, subtract 5: 75 - 5 = 70

So, Bobby has 70 video games.

"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items first. 

She ordered 2 subs for $7.50 each, so that's 2 x $7.50 = $15.00. Then she got 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each, which is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00. She also ordered 2 cookies for $1.00 each, so that's 2 x $1.00 = $2.00. 

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

There's a 20% delivery fee, so we need to find 20% of $20.00. To do that, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20, which is $4.00. Now we add the delivery fee to the total cost: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Finally, Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip, so we add that to the total: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to figure out how many questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions.

Mark's rate is 5 questions per hour. For the first test, he had 8 hours, so he completed 8 * 5 = 40 questions. For the second test, he had 6 hours, so he completed 6 * 5 = 30 questions.

In total, Mark completed 40 + 30 = 70 questions. The total number of questions in both tests is 75 + 100 = 175 questions.

So, the number of questions Mark left incomplete is 175 - 70 = 105 questions.

"To find the number of worker bees, we need to understand the relationship between the different types of bees in the hive. We know there are 700 bees in total, and the number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees. Also, the number of baby bees is twice the number of queens.

Let's start by using variables to represent the number of each type of bee. We'll use Q for queens, B for baby bees, and W for worker bees.

Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, we can write B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Now, we can substitute B = 2Q into the equation W = 2B to get W = 2(2Q), which simplifies to W = 4Q.

We know the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into this equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms to get 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7 to get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W. Since B = 2Q, B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, since W = 4Q, W = 4(100) = 400.

The number of worker bees is 400.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply 2 hours by 7 days to get the total hours spent playing video games in a week. This comes out to be 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Now, if Jordan spent these 14 hours working at his part-time job, where he earns $10 an hour, we can multiply the total hours by his hourly wage to find out how much he would earn. This would be 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

"To find the total cost of everything John bought, we need to separate the items into food and non-food categories. The food items are milk and eggs, which cost $2 and $3, respectively. The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps, which cost $3, $3, and $4, respectively.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the food items: $2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) = $5.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the non-food items: $3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $10.

Since there's a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount: $10 * 0.10 = $1.

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of non-food items: $10 + $1 = $11.

Finally, we add the total cost of food items and non-food items to get the overall cost: $5 + $11 = $16.

"To find out how much profit Kim will make each week, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract that from his total income.

Kim has 3 current clients and is talking to 5 more, so let's assume he'll have 8 clients in total. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The bleach costs $2 per bottle, so 2 bottles will be 2 x $2 = $4. The cloths cost $5 per pack. So, the total cost per client is $4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9.

For 8 clients, the total cost will be 8 x $9 = $72. This is Kim's total expense.

Kim's total income is $92 per week. To find his profit, we subtract his total expenses from his total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to do a few calculations. 

First, we need to find out how many pineapples John has in total. Since John has 10 hectares of pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we multiply the number of hectares by the number of pineapples per hectare:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many times he can harvest in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we divide 12 by 3:
12 months/year / 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests/year

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, she sees half that many bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, after the first 12 hours, 30 bees left the hive, and 15 returned. That means 30 - 15 = 15 bees are still outside the hive.

In the next 6 hours, Debra sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave. Since 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours, two times that many is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find out how many bees are still outside the hive. We already know 15 bees were outside, and 60 more left, so that's 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

Finally, in the last 6 hours, every bee that left before and hadn't already returned comes back to the hive. Since there are 75 bees outside the hive, that's how many return.

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we multiply Dorothy's friends by 4.

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home.

First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet. Since there are 5280 feet in a mile, we can calculate the distance for each of them.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home by dividing the distance by their speed.

Steve's time: 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. However, this is incorrect as the times calculated show Tim is actually slower than Steve. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract Steve's time from Tim's time.

Waiting time: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires she inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire. 

First, let's find the total number of tires inflated. 5 people with bicycles had 2 tires each inflated, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 tires. 3 people with tricycles had 3 tires each inflated, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 tires. And 1 person with a unicycle had 1 tire inflated. 

So, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires. 

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, we multiply the total number of tires by the cost per tire. 20 x 25 cents = 500 cents. 

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

Now, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie, which is $0.10.

Total cost = 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. We know that after the raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, there were 6 fries left (5 that were left behind and 1 that the ants carried off). Since the raccoon stole 2/3 of the fries, that means 1/3 of the fries were left. So, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * (number of fries after pigeons) = 6

To solve for the number of fries after the pigeons, we can multiply both sides by 3:

number of fries after pigeons = 6 * 3
number of fries after pigeons = 18

Now, we know that the pigeons ate 9 fries, so the number of fries before the pigeons is:

number of fries before pigeons = 18 + 9
number of fries before pigeons = 27

The seagull ate 7 fries, so the number of fries before the seagull is:

number of fries before seagull = 27 + 7
number of fries before seagull = 34

Finally, Dave ate 14 fries, so the original number of fries is:

original number of fries = 34 + 14
original number of fries = 48

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to break it down. 

Kimo has classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. On each of these days, he has 3 classes that are 1 hour long. So, that's 3 hours per day for 3 days, which is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes that are 2 hours long. That's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day for 2 days, which is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

So, in a week, Kimo spends 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours attending classes.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we multiply the hours per week by the number of weeks: 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.

Next, we find the total length of the croissants. Each croissant is 6 inches long, so we multiply the number of croissants by the length of each croissant: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches. Converting to feet: 720 inches / 12 = 60 feet.

Lastly, we find the total length of the baguettes. Since each baguette is 2 feet long, we multiply the number of baguettes by the length of each baguette: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet.

Now, we add the lengths together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

First, let's find out how many bananas are needed per month. The monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas every month. 

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is: 
200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to multiply the total number of bananas needed per month by 2:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

The final answer is: 1400"
"To determine who ran the most and by how much, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake ran back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards each way), we can multiply the number of round trips by the distance per round trip to find the total distance. So, Blake ran 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly ran back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then, she ran to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each of these trips is 80 yards (40 yards each way). To find the total distance for these trips, we multiply the number of trips by the distance per trip: 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding this to her initial 200 yards, Kelly ran a total of 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Comparing the total distances, Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards. To find the difference, we subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the pens. Since Raphael bought 4 pens at $1.5 each, we multiply the number of pens by the cost per pen: 4 x $1.5 = $6.

Next, we calculate the cost of the notebooks. Raphael bought 2 notebooks at $4 each, so we multiply the number of notebooks by the cost per notebook: 2 x $4 = $8.

Finally, we add the cost of the pens, notebooks, and the rim of bond paper, which costs $20. The total amount spent is $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to consider the changes in the number of visible tadpoles. Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more come out of hiding, increasing the total number of visible tadpoles to 11 + 6 = 17.

However, 2 tadpoles then hide under a rock, reducing the number of visible tadpoles. To find the new total, we subtract 2 from 17: 17 - 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the tank's water depth on Wednesday, we need to calculate the depth on Tuesday first. The tank's initial depth on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, it had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Now, we need to find two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday. To do this, we multiply 24 by 2 and then divide by 3. This gives us (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16 feet.

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of fish each of them caught and then add those numbers together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. So, Anakin's total catch is 10 + 6 + 3 = 19.

Now, let's calculate Locsin's catch. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish. So, Locsin's total catch is 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.

Now, we add Anakin's and Locsin's catches to find the total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32.

"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every 2 months. The price increases by 20% of the original price every 2 months.

First, let's find the price increase every 2 months. 
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

Since the price increases every 2 months, we need to find the number of 2-month periods in 36 months. 
36 months / 2 months = 18 periods

Now, we can calculate the price after 36 months. 
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24
Price after 4 months = $24 + 20% of $24 = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
We can see a pattern here. The price is multiplied by 1.20 (100% + 20%) every 2 months.

So, we can calculate the price after 36 months by multiplying the initial price by (1.20)^18.
Price after 36 months = $20 * (1.20)^18 ≈ $532.39

"To find the total cost of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and add them up.

First, let's find the cost of the red cars. Since one red car costs $4, the cost of 5 red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.

Next, we'll find the cost of the action figures. Since one action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is 3 x $5 = $15.

Now, let's find the cost of the doll. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which is $15. We can also find this by adding the cost of one red car ($4) to the cost of 2 action figures (2 x $5 = $10), but since we already know the cost of 3 action figures, we can just use that.

Finally, let's add up the cost of all the toys: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

"To figure out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to think about what she'll lose if she does the taxes herself and what she'll pay if she hires someone.

If Jackie does the taxes herself, she'll miss out on 3 hours of freelance work. Since she makes $35 per hour, that's 3 * $35 = $105 in lost income.

On the other hand, if she hires the accountant, she'll pay $90.

So, the difference is $105 (lost income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories, then subtract that from her budget.

First, let's add up the cost of the computer and accessories. The computer costs €1090, the scanner costs €157, the CD burner costs €74, and the printer costs €102. 

So, the total cost is: €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423.

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget of €1500. 

€1500 - €1423 = €77.

"To figure out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she needs to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan: 15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs.

Now, we know Sandra gets 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs she needs by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job: 45 eggs / 9 eggs/job = 5 jobs.

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the current ages of Seth and Brooke. We'll call Brooke's age 'x'. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can represent Seth's age as 2x.

In 2 years, Brooke will be x + 2 years old, and Seth will be 2x + 2 years old. The problem states that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + 2 + 2x + 2 = 28

Combine the x terms and the constants: 3x + 4 = 28

Now, we need to isolate the variable 'x'. To do this, we'll subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 24

Next, we'll divide both sides by 3:

x = 8

So Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can find Seth's age by multiplying Brooke's age by 2:

Seth's age = 2 * 8 = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has. Since Ethel has $8, we multiply this by 2.

16 + 2 = 18

Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to break it down. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles a day. So, for 5 weekdays, he walks 5 * 20 = 100 miles.

On weekends, he walks 10 miles a day. For 2 weekend days, that's 2 * 10 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

First, the hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.

Next, we need to find the cost of the pants. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. So, ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Next, we calculate the number of legs for the insects. There are 90 insects with 6 legs each, so we multiply 90 by 6 to get 540 legs.

Lastly, we calculate the number of legs for the rare mutant invertebrates. There are 3 invertebrates with 10 legs each, so we multiply 3 by 10 to get 30 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210.

"To figure out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total minimum payment for her debts and then add 50% to that amount.

First, let's add up the minimum payments for her student loans, credit card, and mortgage. 
- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month
Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Now, we need to find 50% of $1000. To do this, we multiply $1000 by 0.5.
$1000 * 0.5 = $500

We add this amount to the total minimum payment to get the new monthly payment.
$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12 to get the yearly payment.

"To find the total time it takes Billy to prep the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each one, then multiply that by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's convert the time it takes to peel a potato into just minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 1 minute 30 seconds is equal to 1.5 minutes. The time to cut a potato is 5 seconds, which is 5/60 = 1/12 of a minute, or approximately 0.083 minutes.

Now, we add the time to peel and the time to cut: 1.5 minutes + 0.083 minutes = 1.583 minutes per potato.

Since Billy has 60 potatoes, we multiply the time per potato by 60: 1.583 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 95 minutes.

"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of making one gallon of lemonade. It costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Next, we need to find out how much they make from selling one gallon of lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Now, let's find out the profit per gallon by subtracting the cost from the revenue: $10 - $5 = $5 per gallon.

We know they made a total profit of $25, so we can divide this by the profit per gallon to find out how many gallons they made: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Finally, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost of lemons per gallon to find out the total amount spent on lemons: 5 * $3 = $15.

"To find out how much money Zaid will have left, we need to calculate his total expenses and donations.

First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500 dollars. He also spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000 dollars.

So, the total amount he spends on rent and car fuel is 1500 + 2000 = 3500 dollars.

Now, let's subtract this amount from his total salary to find out how much he has left: 6000 - 3500 = 2500 dollars.

Next, Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity. Half of 2500 is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250 dollars.

After donating 1250 dollars, he has 2500 - 1250 = 1250 dollars left.

Finally, he gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars, which is a total of 200 + 700 = 900 dollars.

So, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will have 1250 - 900 = 350 dollars left.

"To figure out how many red roses Sandra ordered, we need to start with the information about the pink calla lilies. We know there are 200 pink calla lilies, and that's five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's use a variable, x, to represent the number of white carnations. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation: 5x = 200. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5. This gives us x = 200 / 5, which equals 40. So, there are 40 white carnations.

Now, we know Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. To find the number of red roses, we multiply the number of white carnations by 4. 

Number of red roses = 4 * 40

"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of two different events and then compare them.

First, let's find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Out of these, 3 numbers are greater than 3: 4, 5, and 6. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3 out of 6, which is 1/2 or 0.5.

Next, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number is 3 out of 6, which is also 1/2 or 0.5. Since the die is rolled twice, we need to multiply the probabilities together: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. To do this, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Since there are 10 hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, the hamsters get a total of 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw. This means the rats get 140 - 50 = 90 pieces of straw.

We know that there are 3 cages of rats, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. To find the total number of rats, we divide the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats (90) by the number of pieces each rat gets (6). This gives us 90 / 6 = 15 rats.

Since there are 3 cages of rats, we divide the total number of rats (15) by the number of cages (3) to find the number of rats in each cage. This gives us 15 / 3 = 5 rats per cage.

Now, we subtract the carrots distributed from the total amount of carrots we have: 200 - 80 = 120.

So, the amount of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds.

"To find the number of kids in Soda, we need to subtract the total number of men and women from the total population.

First, let's add the number of men and women: 8417 + 9092 = 17509.

Now, we subtract this number from the total population: 23786 - 17509 = 6277.

So, the number of kids in Soda is 6277."
"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has, we need to break down the information given.

Elaine starts with 20 Pokémon cards. In the first month, she collects three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collects 20 fewer cards than in the first month. So, she collects 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collects twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up all the cards: the initial 20 cards, the 60 cards from the first month, the 40 cards from the second month, and the 200 cards from the third month. 
20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the amount he earns from each publisher and then add them together.

Mark edits 1000 sentences in total, and he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers. So, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so he earns 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence. Mark earns 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

The total amount Mark makes in a week is 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

"To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he collects and then multiply that by the number of liters in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon, so the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, we multiply the total number of pails by the number of liters per pail: 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

"To figure out how much John made that year, we need to break it down. First, let's calculate how much he made from his weekly salary. Since he makes $2000 a week and there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply those numbers together.

$2000 * 52 = $104,000

But, John got a 5% raise. To find out how much more he makes per week, we multiply his weekly salary by 0.05 (which is the same as 5%).

$2000 * 0.05 = $100

So, John's new weekly salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100. Now, we multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.

$2100 * 52 = $109,200

Finally, we add the one-time award of $5000 to his total salary.

$109,200 + $5000 = $114,200

"To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to do some simple math. 

First, we need to figure out how many tons of grapes her farm produces. Since she has 10 acres and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, we multiply the number of acres by the tons per acre. 

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Now that we know she produces 50 tons of grapes, we need to convert that to barrels. We're told that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. So, we multiply the tons by the barrels per ton.

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week, which is 7 days, and used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, the total slices used for lunch is 2 slices/sandwich * 7 sandwiches = 14 slices.

For breakfast, Carl had cheese and egg omelets for 3 days. He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. So, the total slices used for breakfast is 3 slices/omelet * 3 omelets = 9 slices.

For dinner, Carl used 8 slices of cheese in his macaroni and cheese.

Now, we add the slices used for each meal together: 14 slices (lunch) + 9 slices (breakfast) + 8 slices (dinner) = 31 slices.

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens she initially had and the number of pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag. So, the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 * 9 = 54.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag. So, the total number of red pens she bought is 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, we add the number of blue and red pens she bought: 54 + 12 = 66.

Finally, we add the initial number of pens to the number of pens she bought: 32 + 66 = 98.

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we need to calculate the total score she needs to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score. Since there are 6 tests and she can remove the lowest score, she needs to have a total of 5 scores that average to 93.

The total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 5 = 465.

Now, let's look at Brinley's scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We know the lowest score will be removed, which is 71. So, we add up the remaining scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

To find the required score on the 6th test, we subtract the total score of the remaining 4 tests from the total score required: 465 - 367 = 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the total distance Micheal rode his bike, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 4 weeks and the last 3 weeks.

In the first 4 weeks, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week. Since there are 4 weeks, he rode a total of 5 * 4 = 20 times. Each time he rode 25 kilometers, so the total distance covered in the first 4 weeks is 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

In the last 3 weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week. Since there are 3 weeks, he rode a total of 2 * 3 = 6 times. Each time he rode 60 kilometers, so the total distance covered in the last 3 weeks is 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances from the first 4 weeks and the last 3 weeks to get the total distance: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, we can multiply the number of chocolate bars by the weight of each chocolate bar: 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Next, we need to find the weight of the candied apples. We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so the weight of each candied apple is half the weight of a chocolate bar. To find the weight of a candied apple, we can divide the weight of a chocolate bar by 2: 40g / 2 = 20g.

Now that we know the weight of a candied apple, we can multiply the number of candied apples by the weight of each candied apple: 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Finally, we can add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, we multiply 12 by 5, which gives us 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

The total number of cakes Rose bought is 76."
"To find the cost of each cup, we need to first calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates and then subtract $1200 to get the total cost of 20 dozen cups.

Half a dozen plates is 6 plates, and each plate costs $6000. So, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Now, we subtract $1200 from the total cost of half a dozen plates to get the total cost of 20 dozen cups: $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since 1 dozen is 12, 20 dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups: $34800 / 240 = $145.

"To figure out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes she wants. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. 

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

The total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, Sara still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4). 

$40 / $4 = 10

So, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of red and white chickens. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can write an equation: w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up another equation based on this information. The total number of eggs is equal to the number of eggs produced by the red chickens (3r) plus the number of eggs produced by the white chickens (5w). So, the equation is: 3r + 5w = 42.

Now, we can substitute the first equation (w = r + 2) into the second equation (3r + 5w = 42). This gives us: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42.

Next, we can simplify the equation by multiplying the 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42.

Combine the like terms (3r and 5r): 8r + 10 = 42.

Now, subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32.

Finally, divide both sides by 8 to solve for 'r': r = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we need to calculate the distance he walks and then divide it by his speed.

The park is a rectangle, so we need to find the perimeter, which is the distance around the outside of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the length plus the width. In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 x 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now that we know the distance Gary walks, we can divide it by his speed to find the time. Gary walks at 3 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to calculate the total number of customers on the first two days and then subtract that from the total number of customers by the third day.

On the first day, there were 100 customers. On the second day, there were 50 more customers than the first day, so there were 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

We know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day: 500 - 250 = 250.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the amount of water in each pool. Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons.

Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, so in 4 minutes, they each lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons. 

Now, the small pool has x - 16 gallons, and the big pool has 2x - 16 gallons. According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can write this as an equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Expanding the right side of the equation gives us:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Now, let's solve for x. Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides gives us:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 24

So, the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

24 - 16 = 8

"To figure out how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we need to calculate the total cost of both items. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. 

First, we add the cost of the shoes and the belt to get the total cost:
$320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

Next, we need to divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage, which is $8.00. This will give us the number of hours she needs to work to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt:
$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

"To find out how much Janeth will still owe after 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she has to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 

The additional 10% is 10/100 * $2000 = $200. So the total amount she needs to pay back is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. To find out the total amount she will pay, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back to find the remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to first figure out their current ages. We know Harriet is 21 years old right now. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. So, Zack is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

We also know Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. So, Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. To do this, we add 3 years to each of their current ages:
- Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack's age in three years: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian's age in three years: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first calculate the points scored by Yuri and Brianna.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. To find half of Naomi's points, we divide 68 by 2, which equals 34. Then, we add 10 to that result, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so we add 17 to Naomi's 68 points, which gives us 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find Jojo's score: 251 - 197 = 54.

"To find the amount of water in the tank now, we need to follow these steps:

First, we need to calculate the amount of water left after Celine used 90 liters. We can do this by subtracting the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank.

Initial water = 120 liters
Water used = 90 liters
Water left = Initial water - Water used
Water left = 120 - 90
Water left = 30 liters

Next, we need to calculate the amount of rainwater collected. We are told that the amount of rainwater collected is twice as much as what was left in the tank. So, we multiply the amount of water left by 2.

Rainwater collected = 2 * Water left
Rainwater collected = 2 * 30
Rainwater collected = 60 liters

Finally, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the tank now. We can do this by adding the amount of water left and the amount of rainwater collected.

Total water now = Water left + Rainwater collected
Total water now = 30 + 60
Total water now = 90 liters

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to calculate the total number of cards and the number of water type cards after James loses some and buys more.

James initially had 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. He loses 8 water type cards, so he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards left. He also buys 14 more grass type cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards. So, the probability is 32 / 96, which is approximately 0.3333. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100, which gives us 33.33%. Rounding this to the nearest integer, we get 33%.

"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn visited the farm after two months. To find 30% of 120, we multiply 120 by 0.3. 

120 * 0.3 = 36

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find 3/4 of 84, we multiply 84 by 0.75 (since 3/4 is the same as 0.75).

84 * 0.75 = 63

So, Ashlyn harvested 63 more watermelons, leaving 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

Therefore, the number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21.

"To figure out how many vines Steve needs, we need to calculate how many tomatoes he and his girlfriend eat in a week. Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so in a week, he eats:

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, she eats half of what he eats. So, she eats 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week. 

Now, we add their weekly consumption together: 
42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

We know that one vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide their combined weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine:

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/week/vine = 21 vines

"To figure out how many pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of slices required. There are 20 friends, and each friend needs 4 slices, so we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices per friend:
20 friends * 4 slices/friend = 80 slices

Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, we can divide the total number of slices required by 8 to find the number of pizzas needed:
80 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas

John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to consider the initial pens and the pens he makes from the empty ones.

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens.

When the ink runs low in these 25 pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

Now, he has 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens.

We can see a pattern here. Every time the ink runs low, he can make 1/5 of the total pens into new pens. This is a geometric series where the first term is 25 and the common ratio is 1/5.

However, calculating this manually would be tedious. We can simplify this by realizing that the total number of pens Ram gets to have is the sum of an infinite geometric series.

The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula: S = a / (1 - r), where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio.

In this case, 'a' is 25 and 'r' is 1/5.

S = 25 / (1 - 1/5)

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to calculate the number of students who went out through exits A and B first.

First, let's find the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this by multiplying 1000 by 0.3.

1000 * 0.3 = 300

So, 300 students went out through exit A. Now, let's find the number of students remaining after exit A.

Next, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we can calculate this by multiplying 700 by 3/5.

(3/5) * 700 = 420

So, 420 students went out through exit B. Now, let's find the number of students remaining after exit B, which is the number of students who went out through exit C.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. So, to find out how many candies Robert has, we can divide John's candies by 2.

Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. We are told that James has 6 more candies than Robert.

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Finally, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We can do this by subtracting James' candies from John's candies.

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. They both read each other's books, in addition to their own.

Dolly will read her 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so she'll read a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books.

Pandora will read her 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so she'll also read a total of 1 + 2 = 3 books.

Since they're reading a combination of the same books, we can simply add the total number of unique books they're reading. There are 2 books from Dolly and 1 book from Pandora, making a total of 2 + 1 = 3 unique books.

However, since they're both reading all 3 books, the total number of books read is 3 (unique books) * 2 (people reading) = 6 books.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to figure out how many pages he writes and then calculate the time it takes him to write those pages.

First, we know Mike is pen pals with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he's left with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.

Each of these 3 pen pals sends him 2 letters a week, and Mike responds to each letter. That means he writes 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week. Since each letter is 5 pages long, Mike writes a total of 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.

We're told Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find the total time he spends writing, we multiply the number of pages he writes by the time it takes him to write a page: 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

He also had some extra calls that added up to 300 minutes. So, the total minutes he's used is the sum of these two:
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes he's used from his monthly limit of 1000 minutes:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. 

Since Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Next, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, Griffin is left with 9 - 2 = 7 fries.

We know that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we subtract the number of fries Griffin had before Ginger gave her some from the total number of fries Griffin had in the end. 

So, Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. One aquarium has 4 snails, and the other has 32 snails. The difference is 32 - 4 = 28.

The problem states that this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can say that the difference is twice the number of fish in one aquarium times 2 (because there are 2 aquariums). Let's call the number of fish in each aquarium ""x"". Then, the equation would be 2 * 2x = 28.

Simplifying the equation, we get 4x = 28. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 4, which gives us x = 28 / 4 = 7.

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To figure out how much Jean paid for the makeup artist, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many hours the makeup artist worked in total. The artist worked 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, for 5 weeks. So, the total hours worked per week is 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week. Since the movie took 5 weeks to finish, the total hours worked is 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Since the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 10% of $30,000 is 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

Since Isabelle is splitting the cost evenly with her two parents, we need to divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much each person paid.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

First, we find the total weight of the onions by multiplying the number of bags by the weight of each bag. Since the chef bought 4 bags, each weighing 50 pounds, the total weight is 4 * 50 = 200 pounds.

Next, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound, which is $1.50. So, the total cost is 200 * $1.50 = $300.

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total calories each of them ate.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate. We already know that - 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. 

Now, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate. On Monday, she ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, which is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, which is 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's find the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's sister: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue's sister: 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
Sue: 46 * 200 = 9200 calories

Now, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:
9200 - 3600 = 5600

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know there are 3 classes with 20 students each, so the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, we can divide the total number of students by 2 to find the number of boys and girls. This gives us 60 / 2 = 30 boys and 30 girls.

Now, let's look at the number of girls in each class. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls: 30 - 15 - 12 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls, we can find the number of boys by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in the class: 20 - 3 = 17.

"To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of animals he killed last night and today, then add them together.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. So, the total number of animals he killed last night is 10 + 15 = 25.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say he killed x cougars. Then, he killed 3x wolves. We also know that he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so x = 15 - 3 = 12.

So, today Rick killed 3x = 3 * 12 = 36 wolves and 12 cougars, for a total of 36 + 12 = 48 animals.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we'll calculate 30% of 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. Now, subtract 9 from 30 to find out how many times Anne went down the slide: 30 - 9 = 21.

Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4: 21 * 4 = 84.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. So, the total number of cows initially is 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

However, the problem states that Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls. This implies that there are actually 20 stalls, not 10. Since 10 stalls already have 20 cows each, the other 10 stalls must be empty.

Now, Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls. So, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

The 10 stalls that already had cows now have 20 + 2 = 22 cows each. The other 10 stalls now have 2 cows each.

We are asked to find the total number of cows in 8 stalls. Since we don't know which stalls are chosen, we'll assume the worst-case scenario where the 8 stalls chosen are the ones with the most cows. In this case, the 8 stalls would be the ones that initially had 20 cows each.

So, the total number of cows in 8 stalls is 8 * 22 = 176.

"To find the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and the dollar bills, then add them together.

First, let's start with the pennies. Since there are 100 pennies and each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 100 by $0.01 to get $1.

Next, we have 40 nickels. Each nickel is worth $0.05, so we multiply 40 by $0.05 to get $2.

Then, there are 20 dimes. Each dime is worth $0.10, so we multiply 20 by $0.10 to get $2.

Lastly, we have 40 dollar bills, which are worth $40.

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we need to calculate its total weight before the termites ate 30% of it. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 and multiplying by 400 pounds.

200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to find the weight after the termites ate 30% of the tree. To find 30% of 8000 pounds, we multiply 8000 by 0.3.

8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds
Weight after termites ate 30% = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find out how much Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the overdue books. Since each book costs $0.50 and there are 8 books, we multiply $0.50 by 8. This gives us $0.50 * 8 = $4.00.

Next, we add the flat fee of $2.00 to the cost of the overdue books. So, $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to figure out how many apples and bananas Andrea and Jamal have.

We know Andrea has 52 apples. Since she has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can find out how many apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from 52. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

The problem also states that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. Since Jamal has 44 apples, he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Now, we know Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. To find out how many bananas Andrea has, we can divide Jamal's bananas by 2. So, Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits:
Andrea has 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
Jamal has 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits
Total number of fruits = 76 + 92 = 168

66 / 12 = 5.5 dozen cookies

Now, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. To find the total amount of flour needed, we multiply 5.5 by 2.
5.5 * 2 = 11 cups

Then, we add the 20 marbles she received from her friend to the total marbles in the boxes. So, 250 + 20 = 270.

Maddison now has 270 marbles."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Chris has 6 trees in his yard. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, we can find the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard by dividing 6 by 2. This gives us 3 trees in Ferdinand's yard.

Next, we're told that Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. To find the number of trees in Harry's yard, we multiply the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard (3) by 2, which gives us 6. Then, we add 5 to this result, giving us a total of 11 trees in Harry's yard.

Finally, to find the difference in the number of trees between Harry's and Ferdinand's yards, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard (3) from the number of trees in Harry's yard (11). This gives us a difference of 8 trees.

"To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total price first. 

The house costs $350,000. On top of that, there's a brokerage fee of 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500. There's also a transfer fee of 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

Now, we add these fees to the selling price to get the total price: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, we subtract that from the total price to find out how much more the house costs: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he received and subtract the total amount he paid.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees and brokerage fee. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, which is $400,000. So, the transfer fees are 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000.

Now, let's add the transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount to find the total amount Mr. Tan paid. The total amount paid is $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

First, it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. To find 40% of 20 minutes, we multiply 20 by 0.4, which is 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees.

The total time to warm the oil is the sum of the time it takes to heat it to 300 degrees and the time it takes to heat it to 400 degrees. This is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. So, the cooking time is 48 - 5 = 43 minutes.

Finally, to find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we add the time it took to warm the oil and the time it took to cook. This is 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, we subtract the stitches we already know about from the total: 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break it down into three parts: the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene.

The solo song has 54 lines, so that's a given.

For the first scene, it has twice the number of lines as the song. So, we multiply 54 by 2 to get 108 lines. However, Sean only has to memorize a third of those lines, which is 108 divided by 3, equaling 36 lines.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so we add 6 to 54, getting 60 lines. Since four-fifths of those lines are his, we multiply 60 by 4/5, which equals 48 lines.

Now, we add up the lines for the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

Now, we subtract the cards with A from the total: 80 - 32 = 48. This means 48 cards didn't have the letter A.

Next, 1/2 of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B. To find 1/2 of 48, we divide 48 by 2: 48 / 2 = 24. So, 24 cards had the letter B.

We subtract the cards with B from the remaining: 48 - 24 = 24. This means 24 cards didn't have the letters A or B.

Then, 5/8 of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C. To find 5/8 of 24, we multiply 24 by 5 and divide by 8: (24 * 5) / 8 = 120 / 8 = 15. So, 15 cards had the letter C.

First, let's find the time for the small holes. Since it takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig a small hole, we multiply the time per hole by the number of holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes.

Next, we find the time for the large holes. It takes Matthew 10 minutes to dig a large hole, so we multiply the time per hole by the number of holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for the small holes and the large holes to get the total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up two equations based on the information given. Let's say Sam's current age is S and Ruby's current age is R.

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write the equation:
R = 6S

We also know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. So, we can write the equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second one:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation gives us:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides gives us:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we need to first figure out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2. 

A cobra has 70 spots, so a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we can find the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, so the total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800. There are 60 mambas, so the total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

The total number of spots on all snakes is 2800 + 2100 = 4900. To find half the number of spots, we divide this by 2.

Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories in the second week.
Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories in the second week.
Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories in the second week.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents. So, the total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and 2 rows of 6 stars. 

First, let's find the total number of stars in the 8-star rows: 3 rows * 8 stars per row = 24 stars. Then, let's find the total number of stars in the 6-star rows: 2 rows * 6 stars per row = 12 stars. 

Now, we add the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows: 24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars. 

Since the flag has 76 stars, we subtract the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars: 76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars. These 40 stars are in the 5-star rows.

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by the number of stars per row: 40 stars / 5 stars per row = 8 rows.

"To figure out how many trucks are needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and then divide that by the weight capacity of each truck.

First, let's find the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and there are 80 flagstones. So, the total weight is 80 * 75 = 6000 pounds.

Now, we know that each truck can carry 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we'll divide the total weight of the flagstones (6000 pounds) by the weight capacity of each truck (2000 pounds). 

6000 / 2000 = 3

So, the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip is 3."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles. 

First, we need to find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time. Plugging in the values, we get:

time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
time = 16 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many medals have been given out for counting. We know that Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less than Ali, which is 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

So, together Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals. Now, it's given that they have 10 times less medals than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have.

To find the total number of medals given out for counting, we multiply the number of medals Ali and Izzy have by 10. 

The total number of medals given out for counting is 10 * 39 = 390.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left after the adults get their share, and then divide that number by the number of children.

First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars. There are 8 packets, each containing 5 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 x 5 = 40.

Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars the adults will get. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get is 4 x 6 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

Finally, we divide the number of chocolate bars left by the number of children to find out how many each child will get: 16 ÷ 8 = 2.

"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so we subtract that from the total time. 

First, we convert the half-hour break to hours: 30 minutes / 60 minutes = 0.5 hours. Now, we subtract the break time from the total time: 
3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 2.5 hours to minutes: 
2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, so we divide the total minutes by 10: 
150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15

This means she earns $5 fifteen times. Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by her earnings per interval: 
15 * $5 = $75

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed, we need to calculate the points for each player first.

Mike has 21 points. Since Jim has 3 points less than Mike, we can find Jim's points by subtracting 3 from Mike's points: 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so we multiply Mike's points by 2: 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's see who gets an extra point in the fourth round. The rule is that every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets 1 extra point. Tony has 42 points, which is also over 20, so he gets 1 extra point too. Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points to each player's total points:
Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
Jim: 18 points (no change)
Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Finally, we add up the points of all three players to find the total: 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many oranges Will's sons washed. We know the oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest is half his age. So, the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Since each son washed as many oranges as their age, the total number of oranges washed is 8 (by the oldest son) + 4 (by the youngest son) = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, so to find out how many are left unwashed, we subtract the number washed from the total: 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity he did on both days and then add them together.

On the first day, Darren did 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. On the second day, he did 20 more pushups than on the first day, which is 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. He also did 10 fewer squats, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats. Lastly, he doubled the number of dumbbell presses, which is 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

Now, let's add the activities from both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To figure out how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate how much rice the household uses in a week.

Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat two meals a day (lunch and dinner). So, each person eats 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

There are 5 people in the household, so they eat 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the household eats 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg of rice per week.

Now, we can divide the total weight of the rice bag (42 kg) by the amount they eat in a week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last: 42 kg / 14 kg = 3 weeks.

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

First, let's add up the crates he sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates.

Then, we add the crates he sold over the weekend: 45 + 20 = 65 crates.

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total crates sold from the target: 120 - 65 = 55.

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target.

Carmen accepts the opening bid of $200. Then, 3 other people bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them. So, the bidding goes like this:
- The first person bids $250 ($200 + $50).
- Carmen bids $300 ($250 + $50).
- The second person bids $350 ($300 + $50).
- Carmen bids $400 ($350 + $50).

- Finally, Carmen bids $500 ($450 + $50) and wins the desk.

So, the desk costs Carmen $500."
"To figure out how much John pays for driving each year, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total miles John drives each day. Since he goes to work and back, that's 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles per day.

Since John goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total miles driven per year. John works for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles.

John gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost per year for miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000.

In addition to the cost per mile, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

To find the total cost per year for driving, we add the cost per mile and the bonus: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

"To figure out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to find out how many minutes he exercised on Sunday and Monday combined. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. 

So, we add the minutes from both days: 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the total time by 2. 

2 * 39 = 78 minutes

"To figure out how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, let's think about how the pages are arranged. When you fold the paper, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them up.

Imagine you're holding the tabloid and looking at the front and back covers. You'll see that page 1 is on the left back and page 32 is on the right back. When you open it, you'll see page 2 on the left front and page 31 on the right front. This pattern continues, with each pair of pages being printed on the same piece of paper.

Since each piece of paper has a front and a back, we can fit 4 pages on each piece of paper (2 on the front and 2 on the back). To find the total number of pieces of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 4.

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 4
= 32 / 4
= 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate how much she spent. 

First, she spent half of her $50 on food and snacks. Half of $50 is $50 / 2 = $25. 

In addition to the $25 spent on food and snacks, she also spent $10 on rides. So, the total amount spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to break down the information given. 

First, we know Elise started with 250 books and has 50 unsold books left. This means she sold a total of 250 - 50 = 200 books over the three years.

We also know that she sold 45 books this year and that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did this year. So, in the first year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books.

Now, we can find the number of books she sold in the second year by subtracting the books sold in the first and third years from the total number of books sold. This gives us 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books sold in the second year.

Since each book sells for 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300$.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so he works 50 hours per week. He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 50 * $10 = $500 per week.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so Watson's total earnings from his hourly wage are $500 * 4 = $2000. His total bonus for the month is $300 * 4 = $1200.

Watson's total earnings for the month are $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to figure out what 20% of 20 is, since he won 80% of the matches. If he won 80%, that means he lost 20%. 

First, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal. To do that, we divide by 100. So, 20 ÷ 100 = 0.20. 

Now, we multiply 0.20 by the total number of people he arm-wrestled, which is 20. 

0.20 * 20 = 4

So, John lost to 4 people.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know the bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. To find two-thirds of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and then divide by 3: (60 * 2) / 3 = 120 / 3 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total to find out how many are left: 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. To find half of 20, we divide by 2: 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how much weight Joey loses in a week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find out how much he loses in a week. 

8 / 4 = 2 pounds per week.

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a week, which is 2 pounds. So, in 4 weeks, Sandy loses 2 pounds.

We want to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes her to lose 2 pounds by 4 to find out how many weeks it will take her to lose 8 pounds.

It will take Sandy 4 * 4 = 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

First, let's look at the ice cream. The original price is $13, but it's now on sale for $11. So, the savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we're buying 2 tubs, the total savings from the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

Next, let's look at the milk. Each packet is discounted by $0.5. Since we're buying 4 packets, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Now, let's add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings: $4 + $2 = $6.

"To figure out how many new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow, we need to break it down into two parts: the number of new arms and the number of new legs.

First, let's look at the arms. Since a new arm grows every 3 days, we can divide the total number of days (15) by 3 to find out how many new arms will grow. 15 ÷ 3 = 5, so 5 new arms will grow.

Next, let's look at the legs. A new leg grows every 5 days, so we'll divide the total number of days (15) by 5. 15 ÷ 5 = 3, so 3 new legs will grow.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of new arms and new legs together. 5 (new arms) + 3 (new legs) = 8.

"To figure out how much Theo can spend on gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate how much he's already spent and how much he wants to save.

First, let's add up the cost of the business suits: 6 suits at $100 each is 6 x $100 = $600.

Next, we add the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each is 3 x $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. It costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that is 5 x $100 = $500. Adding the extra $700, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now we add up all his expenses: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Theo has a budget of $6000 and wants to save $2000. So, if we subtract his expenses and the amount he wants to save from his budget, we get: $6000 - $1950 = $4050, then $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

"To find the current population of Chile, we need to follow these steps:

First, we know Cera is 46 years old now. Six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, we can find Noah's age six years ago by dividing Cera's age six years ago by 2. So, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

We are also told that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. To find the current population, we multiply the population six years ago by 2. So, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"To find the number of players on the defense, let's break down the information given. We know there are 105 members in total. The offense has twice as many players as the defense, and the special teams have half the number of players as the defense.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is D. Then, the offense has 2D players, and the special teams have D/2 players.

Since the total number of players is 105, we can set up an equation:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To make it easier to work with, let's multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

Then, there are 3 families with 4 people each, which is 3 * 4 = 12 people. Adding these together, we get 12 + 12 = 24 people.

However, some people can't make it. 8 people are sick, and 1/4 of the number of people who are sick have previous commitments. To find 1/4 of 8, we multiply 8 by 1/4, which is 8 * 1/4 = 2. So, 8 people are sick and 2 people have previous commitments, for a total of 8 + 2 = 10 people who can't make it.

To find out how many people show up, we subtract the number of people who can't make it from the total number of people invited. That's 24 - 10 = 14.

"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. Let's say the number of electric poles is x. We can set up the proportion as follows:

1 pole / 3 wires = x poles / 45 wires

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3x = 45

Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to find x:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To find the number of women left at the party, we need to figure out how many people left in total, and then how many of those were women.

First, let's calculate the total number of people at the party. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people is 25 + 15 = 40.

We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left the party. To find out how many people that is, we multiply 40 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing by 4. So, 40 / 4 = 10 people left the party.

Now, we're told that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were 25 men initially, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

If 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men, then the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Finally, to find the number of women who stayed, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women. So, 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find the cost of the pen, we need to start by determining the cost of the magazine. We know that the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4. So, to find the cost of the magazine, we can divide the cost of the book by 2.

Cost of magazine = Cost of book / 2
Cost of magazine = $4 / 2
Cost of magazine = $2

Now that we know the cost of the magazine, we can find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so we can subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine.

Cost of pen = Cost of magazine - $1
Cost of pen = $2 - $1

"To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have, we need to add the number of pencils they each have. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils, so together they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

Since Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils, we can find out how many pencils are in the 3 boxes by subtracting the 2 loose pencils: 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in the boxes.

Now, we can find out how many pencils each box can hold by dividing the number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes: 24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box.

To find the number of boxes needed, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold: 72 / 8 = 9.

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider the effects of both the ice cubes and the added cream. 

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes: 65 / 13 = 5. 

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker. 

In addition to the ice cubes, Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee by another 15 milliliters. 

To find the total weakening, we add the weakening caused by the ice cubes (60 milliliters) and the weakening caused by the cream (15 milliliters): 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

So, we multiply 7 new records by 2 old records per new record: 7 * 2 = 14.

This means the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that there are 100 employees in the company. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. To find 2/5 of 100, we multiply 100 by 2 and then divide by 5. This gives us (100 * 2) / 5 = 200 / 5 = 40 junior programmers.

Since there are 100 employees in total and 40 are junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

We also know that junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their salary is $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month. This is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

Finally, to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the amount paid to junior and senior programmers. This is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

$224,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that at the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. This means the net change at the second stop is 8 - 7 = 1.

Before the second stop, there were some people who got on the bus at the terminal and 5 more who got in at the first stop. Let's call the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal ""x"". So, before the second stop, there were x + 5 people.

After the second stop, the total number of people is x + 5 + 1 (the net change). We are given that this total is 20. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 + 1 = 20

Combine the constants on the left side:

x + 6 = 20

Subtract 6 from both sides:

x = 14

"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, let's break down the events step by step.

First, Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school. This leaves him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes out 14 lollipops to his friends, so he now has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave 14 lollipops to his friends, he buys 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has a total of 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, Oscar eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he now has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find out how long it'll take to fully charge the phone, we need to figure out how much more charge it needs and then calculate the time.

The phone is at 60% right now, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%). Since it charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point every 3 minutes, we multiply the remaining percentage by 3 minutes.

40% * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

Now, we need to convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 120 minutes by 60.

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

"To figure out how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to calculate the rewards they earned and the total discount they received.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, so for every $20 they spent, they got $1 off their next purchase. Since $80 divided by $20 is 4, they earned 4 rewards of $1 each, which is a total of $4.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards, which is a $4 discount. They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since their rewards were worth $4, the coupon discount is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount is $4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12.

So, the customer paid $43 - $12 = $31.

"To figure out which job pays more, we need to calculate how much Nick will take home from each job after taxes.

Job A pays $15 an hour, and Nick will work 2000 hours a year. So, his total pay before taxes will be $15 * 2000 = $30,000. Since the state has a 20% tax rate, Nick will have to pay $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000 in taxes. This means he'll take home $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Job B pays $42,000 a year, but Nick will have to pay $6,000 in property taxes. So, his income before other taxes will be $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The state also has a 10% tax rate, so Nick will have to pay $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600 in taxes. This means he'll take home $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Since Job B pays more, we need to find the difference between the two jobs. To do this, we subtract the pay from Job A from the pay from Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we need to break down the information given. 

First, we know that 40% of the 220 castles are ruins. To find 40% of 220, we multiply 220 by 0.4. 

0.4 * 220 = 88

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland. Now, we're told that half of these ruined castles are unmanned. To find half of 88, we divide 88 by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost of each offer.

First, let's calculate the total cost of Furniture United's offer. They want an advance payment of $1,350 and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. So, the total cost of the monthly installments is 6 * $350 = $2,100. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer. They want an advance payment of $1,100 and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. So, the total cost of the monthly installments is 9 * $250 = $2,250. Adding the advance payment, the total cost is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

"To find the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

First, let's calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers. Since each batch requires 30 ounces of sugar, we multiply 8 by 30. This gives us 8 * 30 = 240 ounces of sugar.

Next, we calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge, which is 70 ounces.

Now, we add the amount of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge to get the total amount of sugar needed. This is 240 + 70 = 310 ounces.

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price increase and decrease.

Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the initial total value is 8 * $8 = $64.

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. To find the new price, we need to calculate 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4. So, the new price per share is $8 + $4 = $12. Now, the total value is 8 * $12 = $96.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we need to calculate 25% of $12, which is 0.25 * $12 = $3. So, the new price per share is $12 - $3 = $9. Now, the total value is 8 * $9 = $72.

The final value of all Maria's shares is $72."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many hot dogs each person ate. 

First, we know Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, we multiply the number of hot dogs Luke ate by 3 to find out how many Thomas ate. So, Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

Next, we know John ate half the amount Thomas ate. To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we divide the number of hot dogs Thomas ate by 2. So, John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. To do this, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate. So, 3 (John's hot dogs) - 2 (Luke's hot dogs) = 1.

"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's break it down step by step. We know there are 200 students in total, split into 3 groups. Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the third group (the smallest) has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups.

Let's call the number of students in the two equal groups ""x"". Then, the number of students in the smallest group is ""x - 10"".

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up an equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine the x terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides to get:

3x = 210

Now, divide by 3:

x = 70

So, the two equal groups have 70 students each. To find the number of students in the smallest group, subtract 10 from 70:

70 - 10 = 60

"To find the total number of legs of the animals, we need to know how many chickens and cows Farmer Brown has. We're told he has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's say the number of cows is x. This means the number of chickens is 2x.

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can set up an equation: x + 2x = 60. Combining like terms, we get 3x = 60. Solving for x, we find x = 20. This means there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Now, we can calculate the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs. So, the total number of legs is (20 * 4) + (40 * 2) = 80 + 80 = 160.

"To find the total weight of the container with all the animals, we need to determine the weight of each animal. We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, they also weigh 50 pounds each.

The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so its weight is 50 + 10 = 60 pounds. On the other hand, the red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so its weight is 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals and the container:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Adding these together, we get 9 + 6 = 15 hours spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows. This is 30% of the total time he spent.

To find the total time, we can set up an equation: 15 = 0.3x, where x is the total time spent. Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Height of the second tree = 6 feet + 5 feet
Height of the second tree = 11 feet

Now that we know the heights of the shortest and second trees, we can find their combined height:

Combined height = Height of the shortest tree + Height of the second tree
Combined height = 6 feet + 11 feet
Combined height = 17 feet

The problem states that the height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the other two trees. So, we can calculate the height of the tallest tree as follows:

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, the total change he had must have been twice the cost of the gumballs, which is $2 * 2 = $4.

Now, we know Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is the difference between the initial amount and the change: $10 - $4 = $6.

"To figure out how many days the train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance it travels in one trip and then multiply that by the number of trips it makes in a day.

The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, and then 100 miles from the second city to the third city. To find the distance from the third city to the first city, we need to subtract 50 miles from the combined distance of the first two trips. The combined distance is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, let's add up the distances of all three trips to find the total distance traveled in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so to find the number of days it goes between services, we'll divide 18,000 by 900.

First, let's calculate the time it took for John to get to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the total distance is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. Since he drives at a speed of 70 mph, we can find the time by dividing the distance by the speed: 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time it took for John to get back home. The distance is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. Again, we can find the time by dividing the distance by the speed: 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Finally, we add the time it took for John to get to his friend's house and the time it took for him to get back home: 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to first find the total number of boys. We know that there are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 of them are girls. 

So, the number of boys is the difference between the total number of students and the number of girls. 
Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls
Number of boys = 96 - 43
Number of boys = 53

Since 4 boys were absent on Friday, we subtract this from the total number of boys to find the number of boys present on Friday.
Number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of boys absent
Number of boys present = 53 - 4
Number of boys present = 49

"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to determine the number of boys and add it to the number of girls. Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2.

Number of girls = 6
Number of boys = 2 * 6 = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of girls and boys together.

Total number of kids = 6 + 12 = 18

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we need to calculate the total points she has already scored and subtract that from the total points required to pass.

Jane scored 15 points on her first test and 18 points on her second test. So, the total points she has scored so far is 15 + 18 = 33.

Since she needs a total of 42 points to pass, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total required: 42 - 33 = 9.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. Then, we're told that a number equal to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. So, we calculate that as 4 times 3 (which is 12), minus 5, which equals 7.

Next, we're told that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting, we multiply that by 3 to get 21.

Now, we add up the people kicked out for these three reasons: 3 (masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31.

We're told that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To find out how many were kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the three reasons we know from the total: 50 - 31 = 19.

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to figure out how many points she has now. We know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. So, we can calculate Erin's current points by multiplying Sara's points by 3.

Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's points
Erin's current points = 3 * 8
Erin's current points = 24

Now, we know that Erin scored 14 points. To find out how many points she had before, we subtract 14 from her current points.

Erin's points before = Erin's current points - 14
Erin's points before = 24 - 14
Erin's points before = 10

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Since each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20, and there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to add the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost. To find 20% of $880, we multiply $880 by 0.2, which gives us $176. So, the total cost of the picture frames and etching is $880 + $176 = $1056.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each, so the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

We also need to calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 seniors. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Finally, we add up the cost of the picture frames and etching, the pins, and the cords to find the total cost of the senior gifts: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs. On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of pairs sold each day to find the total number of pairs sold: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs. Since each pair contains 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100 shoes.

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment first. 

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000, and 40% of it is faulty. To find 40% of $400,000, we multiply $400,000 by 0.4. 
$400,000 * 0.4 = $160,000.

This means the company spent $160,000 on faulty equipment. Now, to find the amount spent on functioning equipment, we subtract the amount spent on faulty equipment from the total amount spent.
$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from both halves of the sheep.

First, we find out how many sheep are in each half. Since Mary has 30 sheep, half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

Now, we know that from 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk. From the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

The total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 45 kg.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many rolls were left after Mrs. Sherman fed her children, and then calculate the total number of pieces she fed to the chickens.

First, let's determine the number of rolls left. Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls. She gave one roll to each of her 6 children, so she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces she fed to the chickens. Since she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces, we multiply the number of rolls left by 8. So, 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

"To find out how many pupils like the color yellow, we need to break down the information given. 

First, we know there are 40 pupils in the class. Half of them like blue, which is 40 / 2 = 20 pupils. This means 40 - 20 = 20 pupils don't like blue.

Out of these 20 pupils, one-fourth like green. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils. 

Now, we subtract the pupils who like green from the pupils who don't like blue. This gives us 20 - 5 = 15 pupils who like yellow.

"To find the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day.

First, let's find out how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. We know she sold them at $4 per piece and made a total of $56. To find the number of apples, we divide the total amount by the price per apple:
56 ÷ 4 = 14 apples

So, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday. To find the number of apples picked on Wednesday, we multiply the number of apples picked on Tuesday by 2:
12 × 2 = 24 apples

Now, we add the number of apples picked each day to find the total:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she owes, including the interest. 

First, let's calculate the interest. The interest rate is 10% per year, but Karan borrowed the money for 5 months, which is less than a year. So, we need to convert the interest rate to a monthly rate. There are 12 months in a year, so the interest rate for 5 months is 10% * (5/12) = 4.17%.

Now, we can calculate the interest: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
= $3,650 * 4.17%
= $3,650 * 0.0417
= $152.08

The total amount Karan owes is the principal plus the interest:
Total amount = Principal + Interest
= $3,650 + $152.08
= $3,802.08

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we can divide the total amount by 5 to find the monthly payment:
Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
= $3,802.08 / 5
= $760.42

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make. Since she buys enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade and each pitcher holds 12 cups, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so her total revenue will be 36 * $1 = $36.

Her total cost is $18, so her total profit will be $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the total number of hours she spends running the stand is 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Now, we can calculate her profit per hour by dividing her total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2 per hour.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to figure out the total amount of land he had before selling 3/5 of it. Since he sold 3/5, that means he has 2/5 of his land left, which is 12.8 hectares.

Let's use a variable, x, to represent the total amount of land he had at first. We can set up an equation based on the information we have:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5/2, which is the reciprocal of 2/5.

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of people who sang in the performance, we need to calculate the number of female choir members who were able to attend and add the 3 teachers.

Since the choir has 52 members, with 50% being boys and 50% being girls, we can find the number of girls by multiplying 52 by 0.5. This gives us 26 girls.

However, half of the girls couldn't make it to the show due to their bus breaking down. To find the number of girls who attended, we divide 26 by 2, which equals 13.

The 3 teachers then joined the performance, so we add 13 (the number of girls who attended) to 3 (the number of teachers). This gives us a total of 16 people who sang in the performance.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu by multiplying the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3. 

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have, which is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.

We are also given that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Let's use this information to find the number of popsicles each of them has.

First, we add the parts of the ratio: 5 + 6 = 11. This is the total number of parts in the ratio.

Next, we divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total parts (11) to find the value of 1 part:
165 ÷ 11 = 15

Now that we know the value of 1 part, we can multiply it by the number of parts each person has to find the number of popsicles they have. Betty has 5 parts, so she has:
5 x 15 = 75 popsicles

Sam has 6 parts, so he has:
6 x 15 = 90 popsicles

Finally, we need to find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty. To do this, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"To figure out how much money Tim saves by switching from his cable package to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services first.

Tim gets Netflix for $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he gets a 20% discount for bundling them. So, the original price for Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 + $10 = $20. The 20% discount is 0.20 * $20 = $4. After the discount, Hulu and Disney Plus cost $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, we add the cost of Netflix to get the total cost of the streaming services: $16 + $10 = $26.

Tim's cable package costs $60 a month. To find out how much he saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 - $26 = $34.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to calculate the total time she spent on the song. 

First, let's convert all the time to hours. She spent 4 hours writing the song. She spent half that time recording it, which is 4 / 2 = 2 hours. She spent 90 minutes editing it. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 minutes is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up the time she spent on each task: 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time she spent editing, we'll divide the time spent editing (1.5 hours) by the total time (7.5 hours) and multiply by 100.

First, we know she saw 90 spiders. Then, she saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. To find the number of millipedes, we multiply the number of spiders by 1/3. 

Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. 

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to figure out the total amount of each ingredient required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he'll need 4 times the amount of each ingredient. So, for flour, that's 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups. For milk, it's 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups.

Now, let's convert these amounts into the quantities sold in stores. Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so Mark will need 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour. Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so he'll need 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

Finally, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

"To find out how much energy Mel will save, we need to calculate the difference in his daily energy usage before and after reducing the time he uses the air conditioner.

First, let's find out how much energy Mel uses in a day with the air conditioner on for 8 hours. Since the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour, we multiply 900 watts by 8 hours to get the total watt-hours per day. 

900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours

Since we want the answer in kilowatts, we'll convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours by dividing by 1000 (because 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts). 

7200 watt-hours / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatt-hours

Now, let's calculate the energy usage when Mel reduces the time to 3 hours a day.

900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours
2700 watt-hours / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatt-hours

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new energy usage.

7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours

To find the energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30.

First, let's find the total number of stripes. Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 x 17 = 34 stripes. Another zebra has 36 stripes. The last zebra has half the number of stripes as the one with 36, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

"To figure out how much money Tyson will spend on meat and cheese, we need to calculate how many sandwiches he needs to make and then multiply that by the amount of meat and cheese each sandwich requires.

Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people coming over, we can divide 20 by 4 to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. 20 / 4 = 5, so he needs to make 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so for 5 sandwiches, he'll need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 x $7.00 = $35.00. The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis in his house, and he has a total of 40 cannolis. To find the number of corns, we multiply the number of cannolis by 2. So, the number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, Allan buys 60 more cannolis at the store, so the total number of cannolis becomes 40 + 60 = 100.

It's also given that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he bought 100 cannolis, he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Initially, Allan had 80 corns, and he bought 60 more, so the total number of corns becomes 80 + 60 = 140.

To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis, we add the total number of corns and cannolis: 140 + 100 = 240.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to figure out how many steps he had taken before the jog and then subtract that from the total steps he needed to take.

Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps with his friend. So, before the jog, he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that before the jog, he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps taken. Since he took 6,000 steps before the jog, the steps he took during the jog would be 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"To figure out how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate how long it'll take him to read the book and then subtract that from the total time he has before leaving for the airport.

First, let's find out how many words are in the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and has an average of 200 words per page, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we need to find out how long it'll take Toby to read the book. We know he can read 300 words per minute, so we divide the total number of words by his reading rate:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so we add that to the time it takes him to read the book:
30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport. To find out how many minutes early he'll be, we subtract the total time he needs from the time he has:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the amount paid in May and June separately.

First, let's calculate the amount paid in May. The company hired 40 employees and paid each $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, each employee made $15 * 40 = $600 per week. Since there are about 4 weeks in a month, each employee made $600 * 4 = $2400 in May. With 40 employees, the total amount paid in May is $2400 * 40 = $96,000.

Now, let's calculate the amount paid in June. One-fourth of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees left. Each employee still made $15 * 40 = $600 per week, and $600 * 4 = $2400 in June. With 30 employees, the total amount paid in June is $2400 * 30 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent.

First, let's look at the taffy. Sally bought 2 pounds, and the deal is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which means it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, Sally bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

She also bought 4 magnets that were $0.25 each. To find the total cost of the magnets, we multiply the cost of one magnet by the number of magnets: 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the total amount Sally spent: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks packages and the finale firework.

First, let's find the cost of the two packages. The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. So, the total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.20 (which is the same as 20%). So, the discount is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150. So, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To figure out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she'll need for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, we multiply 2 cookies by 30 nights to get the total number of cookies.

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Now, we know that her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies, which is equal to 12 cookies. To find out how many dozens she needs to make, we divide the total number of cookies by 12.

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that 1% of the candles will explode, since they are 99% guaranteed not to explode. To find the number of candles that will explode, we multiply the total number of candles (50000) by 1% (or 0.01).

Number of candles that will explode = 50000 * 0.01
= 500

Next, we know that 5% of the more dangerous candles (the ones that explode) will also smell like wet dog. Since we already found that 500 candles will explode, we can multiply this number by 5% (or 0.05) to find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode.

Number of candles that will smell like wet dog and explode = 500 * 0.05

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount first. The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. To find 30% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.3. 

$20 * 0.3 = $6

This means each blouse is discounted by $6. The discounted price of each blouse is the regular price minus the discount.

$20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost is 4 times the discounted price of each blouse.

4 * $14 = $56

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half that amount, which is 15 apples, from the shortest trees. We also know that her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 60 apples, and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 45 apples.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as x. Since her sister didn't gather any apples from the average trees, the total number of apples gathered by both sisters can be represented by the equation:

Joanne's apples + Sister's apples = Total apples
(30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500

Combine the constants on both sides of the equation:

(45 + x) + 105 = 500

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

150 + x = 500

Now, subtract 150 from both sides of the equation to solve for x:

x = 350

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up two equations based on the information given. Let's use 'c' to represent the number of camels and 'd' to represent the number of dromedaries.

We know that the total number of heads (or animals) is 180, so we can write the equation:
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Since there are 304 humps in total, we can write the equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. To do this, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate 'd'. This gives us:
2c + d - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:
124 + d = 180
d = 56

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip, we need to break it down into parts.

First, let's calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. Since he traveled 200 kilometers every day, we multiply 200 by 4:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we need to find the distance he traveled in the next 2 days. It's given that he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.3:
0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

On the 7th day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance is 0 km.

Now, let's move on to the second week. Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. We multiply 300 by 7:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Finally, we add up all the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and that it's 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Zack's locker size, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker size, we can find Timothy's locker size. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches

"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to figure out the comb's current elevation first. Since the comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's original elevation of 10,000 feet, we subtract 4,000 from 10,000.

10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

So, the comb is now at an elevation of 6,000 feet. Now, we need to find the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the comb's elevation. Oliver is at 3,000 feet, and the comb is at 6,000 feet.

6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that there were 50 cats on the rock initially. Then, four boats came and took away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 x 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats to find the number of cats left: 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we can multiply 30 by 3 and then divide by 5: (30 x 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. To find the number of cats left on the rock, we subtract 18 from 30: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

First, let's calculate the cost of the introductory period. Bill got a special deal for the first 6 months at $8 per month. So, the cost for the introductory period is 6 months * $8/month = $48.

Next, we calculate the cost of the period at the normal rate. After the introductory period, the price went up to $12 per month for 8 months. So, the cost for this period is 8 months * $12/month = $96.

Now, let's find out how many months are left in the 2 years. Since 1 year has 12 months, 2 years have 24 months. We subtract the months already calculated: 24 months - 6 months - 8 months = 10 months. These 10 months are at the increased rate of $14 per month. So, the cost for this period is 10 months * $14/month = $140.

Finally, we add the costs of all three periods to find the total cost. $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

"To find the difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, we need to first find the original prices of both jeans.

The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we add the savings to the sale price: $22 + $2 = $24.

To find the original price of the tattered jeans, we add the savings to the sale price: $28 + $4 = $32.

The original price difference between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8. However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, the answer will be negative.

"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders separately.

First, let's consider the homemade feeders. Since they attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, and each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, the homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. Lillian built 3 homemade feeders, so they attract a total of 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Now, let's consider the store-bought feeders. Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, and Lillian bought 3 of them. So, the store-bought feeders attract a total of 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to figure out how much money he made from selling his cards. Since he spent $100 on the ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, he must have made $150.

We know that he sold his cards for $1.5 each, so we can divide the total amount of money he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5) to find the number of cards he sold:

$150 ÷ $1.5 = 100 cards

Since Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, that means he sold 2/3 of them. Let's call the total number of cards he started with ""x"". We can set up an equation to represent this:

x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. The caterer was initially told to prepare hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them able to have two hotdogs. This means 18 guests could have two hotdogs, and the other 18 could have one.

For the 18 guests who could have two hotdogs, the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs. For the other 18 guests, the caterer prepared 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs. So, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 + 18 = 54.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means each of the 40 guests wanted 2 hotdogs, for a total of 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, there's a shortage of hotdogs. To find out how many guests didn't get a second hotdog, we need to find out how many hotdogs were short. This is 80 (total hotdogs requested) - 54 (total hotdogs prepared) = 26 hotdogs.

Since each guest who didn't get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who didn't get a second hotdog is 26.

First, we know that 15 gallons of gas were divided equally into 5 containers. To find out how many gallons were in each container, we divide 15 gallons by 5 containers. 

15 gallons ÷ 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we multiply 3 gallons by 1/4.

1/4 * 3 gallons = 0.75 gallons

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, we multiply 0.75 gallons by 8 pints/gallon.

0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how much George spent on chips and then subtract that from the total amount he spent.

George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x 40 = 120 cents on chips. Since he spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, we need to find 99% of $5. To do this, we multiply $5 by 0.99, which is $4.95. Converting this to cents, we get $4.95 x 100 = 495 cents.

Now, we subtract the amount spent on chips (120 cents) from the total amount spent (495 cents): 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we divide the remaining amount spent (375 cents) by the cost of a candy bar (75 cents): 375 / 75 = 5.

George bought 5 candy bars.

"To figure out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to find out how long it takes her to get to the theater and compare it to Wayne's travel time.

We know it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater. Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, we multiply 4 minutes by 4 to get Bernadette's travel time. That's 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Now, we subtract Wayne's travel time from Bernadette's travel time to find the difference. That's 16 - 4 = 12 minutes.

But Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so we add those extra 5 minutes to the difference in their travel times. That's 12 + 5 = 17 minutes.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we need to know the length and width of the room in feet. We're given the length in yards, so we need to convert it to feet first. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, we multiply 3 yards by 3 feet/yard to get the length in feet.

Length (in feet) = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

We're also given the area of the room, which is 360 square feet. The formula for the area of a rectangle is Area = Length * Width. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width by dividing both sides by the length.

Width = Area / Length
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width). Plugging in the values we found, we get:

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought. 

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, which is a total of 3 packs. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads, for a total of 7 packs.

Since each pack contains 20 beads, we multiply the number of packs by 20 to find the total number of beads. Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads. Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number. So, 140 (Margareth's beads) - 60 (Elizabeth's beads) = 80 beads.

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the temperature increase from baking and the temperature decrease from opening the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase from baking. The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase from baking is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees. Since the initial temperature is 40 degrees, the temperature after baking is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease from opening the window. The window is open for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equal to 3 intervals of 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease from the window being open is 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Now, we can find the final temperature by subtracting the temperature decrease from the temperature after baking: 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we need to calculate Jon's total time and James' time for the swim and bike ride.

First, let's calculate Jon's total time. 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Now, let's calculate James' time for the swim. Since James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time.
- 10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
- James' swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

Next, let's calculate James' time for the bike ride. James took 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike ride.
- James' bike ride time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' time for the run by subtracting his swim and bike time from his total time.
- James' total time: 180 minutes
- James' swim and bike time: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes
- James' run time: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to start by finding the length of Movie C in minutes. Since Movie C is 1.25 hours, we can convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (1 hour = 60 minutes).

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B.

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

Movie A = Movie B / 4
Movie A = 80 minutes / 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, we need to find out how far the horse runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour, we need to convert the time to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is half an hour.

Distance = speed * time = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats half a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is 8 bails * $3 per bail = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

To find out how much change he has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money he has: $30 - $24 = $6.

"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we need to figure out the total number of eggs she has and then divide that by the number of eggs needed per tray.

Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs, which is 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. She also has 2 loose eggs, so in total, she has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, and each tray holds 5 glasses. So, each tray needs 5 x 5 = 25 eggs.

Now, let's divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per tray: 50 eggs / 25 eggs per tray = 2 trays.

"To find out by how many points Joey is winning, we need to calculate the points for both Joey and Marcy after their turns.

Joey had 214 points and scored 26 more, so his new total is 214 + 26 = 240.

Marcy had 225 points and scored 10 more, so her new total is 225 + 10 = 235.

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's points. To do this, we subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points: 240 - 235 = 5.

Joey is winning by 5 points."
"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the cost.

First, let's find out how much the salesman spent on the sneakers. He bought 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sneakers he sold. On Monday, he sold 17 sneakers for $20 each. So, the revenue from Monday's sale is 17 x $20 = $340.

Now, let's find out how many sneakers he sold for the rest of the week. He had 48 sneakers and sold 17 on Monday, so he had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left. He sold these for $25 each, so the revenue from the rest of the week is 31 x $25 = $775.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from Monday's sale and the rest of the week, which is $340 + $775 = $1115.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue. The profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.

First, let's calculate the total number of colors in the packets with 8 pieces each. Since there are 6 packets, we multiply 6 by 8, which gives us 48 colors.

Next, we calculate the total number of colors in the packets with 16 pieces each. There are 4 packets, so we multiply 4 by 16, which gives us 64 colors.

Now, we add the total number of colors in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's break down the information given. 

If you buy the super ticket, it costs $20 and you get a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, making the total $21. 

If you don't buy the super ticket, you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and then buy a popcorn and a soda separately. We know the soda costs $3. 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket option must be $21 - $2 = $19.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ticket and soda from the total cost of the regular ticket option: $19 - $12 (ticket) - $3 (soda) = $4.

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the original cost per balloon. We know that the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. So, we can divide $900 by 20 to get the original cost per balloon.

$900 ÷ 20 = $45 per balloon

After the price increase, the cost per balloon went up by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons Bentley wants to fill, which is 170.

$65 per balloon × 170 balloons = $11,050

"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

First, let's find the distance traveled at each speed. The car drove 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance traveled at 60 mph is 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then, it drove 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance traveled at 30 mph is 30 * 1 = 30 miles. 

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance traveled: 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

Next, we need to find the total time taken. The car drove for 2 hours at 60 mph and 1 hour at 30 mph, so the total time taken is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Finally, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies she has.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 for 2 rubies. This means she now has 5 sapphires and 2 rubies.

Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 5 sapphires is 5 x $800 = $4000. Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of the 2 rubies is 2 x $1200 = $2400.

To find the total value of her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and rubies together: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"To find the total cost of the potting soil, we need to figure out how many cubic feet of soil Bob needs and then divide that by the amount in each bag.

First, we calculate the volume of one raised bed by multiplying its width, length, and height: 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet. Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we multiply 32 cubic feet by 10 to get the total volume: 32 cubic feet * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we divide the total volume by the volume of each bag: 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet = 160 bags.

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to get the total cost: 160 bags * $12 = $1920.

"To find the total number of cards, we need to calculate the number of green cards and yellow cards.

First, let's find the number of green cards. We know there are 60% more green cards than red cards. To find 60% of 15, we multiply 15 by 0.6, which gives us 9. So, there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Next, we find the number of yellow cards, which is the sum of red and green cards. So, yellow cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39.

Now, we add up the number of red, green, and yellow cards to find the total. Total cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78.

The number of fairies remaining is 45."
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

First, let's find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

Next, let's find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
= (7 / 20) * 100

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed first. 

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds. He buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds. He buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds. He buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the truck: 4500 / 2250 = 2. 

However, since 2 trips will not be enough to carry the remaining 0 pounds of feed, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, 2 trips will be enough to carry all the feed, but since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, we can say that 2 trips will be enough.

"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles.

First, let's calculate the amount she earns from aluminum cans. Since each can is worth 2 cents and she drinks 3 cans per week, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents per week from cans. In a four-week month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from cans.

Next, let's calculate the amount she earns from plastic bottles. Since each bottle is worth 3 cents and she drinks 5 bottles per week, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents per week from bottles. In a four-week month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from bottles.

Now, let's add the amount she earns from cans and bottles to find the total amount she earns in a four-week month. The total amount is 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to figure out how many cards she gave away and then divide that by the number of cards each student got.

First, let's calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has. She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so that's 6 x 25 = 150 basketball cards. She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so that's 5 x 40 = 200 baseball cards. In total, she has 150 + 200 = 350 cards.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so she gives away 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Since each student gets 10 cards, we can find out how many students she has by dividing the total number of cards given away (300) by the number of cards each student gets (10). That's 300 ÷ 10 = 30.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of apples by the cost per apple: 20 * 0.50 = $10. Kelly received a 10% discount, so we need to find 10% of $10 and subtract it from the total cost. To find 10% of $10, we multiply $10 by 0.10: $10 * 0.10 = $1. Now, we subtract $1 from the total cost: $10 - $1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total cost from Kelly's total cost: $9 - $8 = $1.

Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. He then gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday, 15 pairs on Wednesday, and 30 pairs on Friday. Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the number of pairs by 2.

- 5 pairs on Monday: 5 * 2 = 10 shoes
- 15 pairs on Wednesday: 15 * 2 = 30 shoes
- 30 pairs on Friday: 30 * 2 = 60 shoes

Now, we add the shoes he received to the initial number of shoes:

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras is, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the remoras' length is given in inches, let's convert the shark's length from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the shark is 10 * 12 = 120 inches long.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches. Now, we can calculate the percentage by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiplying by 100:

"To figure out the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

First, let's look at the plane tickets. Since Tom and his wife are both going, we need to multiply the cost of one ticket by 2. The cost of one ticket is $5000, so 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the hotel. The normal price is $1500 per day, but it's 20% more expensive because it's a busy weekend. To find 20% of $1500, we multiply $1500 by 0.2, which gives us $300. So, the hotel price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800. Since they're staying for 3 days, we multiply $1800 by 3, which gives us $5400.

Now, let's add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip. $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he has.

Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper also has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, and Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. So, Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint: 2 + 9 = 11.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny first. Since it's three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:
Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 + 48
Combined weight = 84

"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn, we need to calculate the difference between their goal and the amount they've already earned.

First, let's add up the amount they've earned so far: $83 (Keegan) + $91 (Tashay) = $174.

Their goal is to raise $200 for the baseball camp. To find out how much more they need, we subtract the amount they've earned from their goal: $200 - $174 = $26.

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many songs Luri has and then determine how many more songs each of them can add to their players.

Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can multiply 20 by 3 to find out how many songs Luri has: 20 * 3 = 60.

Now, let's find out how many more songs each of them can add. Gabriel's player can store up to 100 songs, and he already has 20. So, he can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs.

Luri's player can also store up to 100 songs, and he already has 60. So, he can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs.

The question asks how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel. To find this out, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

"To find out how much money Stetson gave up, we need to figure out how many oranges he ate and then multiply that by the amount he gave up for each orange.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Stetson ate. We know they picked 60 oranges and he ate 2/5 of them. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 2 by 60 and then divide by 5. 

2 * 60 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply 24 by $10 to find the total amount he gave up.

24 * $10 = $240

"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week and then divide that by his running speed.

James runs 12 miles a day, and he does this for 5 days a week. So, the total miles he runs in a week is 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

We know James runs 10 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he runs, we divide the total miles he runs in a week by his running speed: 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week.

"To figure out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses eat in five days.

First, we find out how much oats each horse eats in a day. Since each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal and they're fed twice a day, that's 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day per horse.

Now, Uncle Ben has 4 horses, so the total amount of oats they eat in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find out how much they eat in five days, we multiply the daily amount by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since each bag of oats is 50 pounds, we divide the total amount of oats needed by the weight of one bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To find the number of girl Pomeranians Jana has, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we know Jana has 27 puppies, and two thirds of them are Pomeranians. To find two thirds of 27, we can multiply 27 by 2 and then divide by 3. This gives us (27 * 2) / 3 = 54 / 3 = 18. So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we know one third of the Pomeranians are girls. To find one third of 18, we can divide 18 by 3. This gives us 18 / 3 = 6. So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to add their highest temperatures and then divide by 3.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48°F, in Northlandia is 21°F, and in Midlandia is -3°F. 

First, let's add these temperatures: 
-48 + 21 = -27
-27 + (-3) = -30

Now, we divide the sum by 3:
-30 ÷ 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10°F.

"To determine how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the difference between the cost of the toy car and the child's current savings. 

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 in savings. So, the remaining amount needed is $12 - $4 = $8.

Since the child saves $2 daily from his allowance, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find the number of days it will take to save the remaining amount.

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
= $8 / $2
= 4

The child will need 4 days to save the remaining amount."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many eggs Jaime can fit on the trays and then subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

Since each tray can hold 24 eggs and Jaime has 2 trays, the total number of eggs the trays can hold is 2 x 24 = 48 eggs.

Jaime has 64 eggs, so to find out how many eggs won't fit on the trays, we subtract the number of eggs the trays can hold from the total number of eggs:
64 - 48 = 16

"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza and add it to the cost of the small pizza.

The small pizza costs $8. Since the family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3. So, the family-size pizza costs 3 * $8 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of both pizzas: $8 + $24 = $32.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors after the discount and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but since they're on sale for buy one get one free, she only pays for 1 pack. Each pack costs $4.00, and she has a $2.00 coupon. So, the total cost will be:

$4.00 (cost of 1 pack) - $2.00 (coupon) = $2.00

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have a total of 8 razors (2 packs * 4 razors per pack). 

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor:

$2.00 ÷ 8 razors = $0.25 per razor

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

$0.25 * 100 = 25 cents

The top level has 2 girls, each 64"" tall, so their total height is 2 * 64"" = 128"". 
The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, add the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 636"" / 12 = 53 feet.

"To find out how many minutes Charisma has walked, we need to calculate the total minutes she walks in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she's been at the office.

Charisma works 8 hours a day and takes a 5-minute walk every hour. So, in a day, she walks 8 hours * 5 minutes/hour = 40 minutes.

Since she's been at the office for 5 days, we multiply the daily minutes by 5: 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

If Angela's age in four years is three times Brett's current age, then we multiply 14 by 3 to get Angela's age in four years. 14 * 3 = 42 years.

Since this is Angela's age in four years, we need to subtract 4 from 42 to find her current age. 

Angela's current age = 42 - 4 = 38 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges Ashley and Brianne have in total, and then divide that number by the number of oranges needed to make one pie.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ashley brought. Since she brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges in each box: 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. We know she brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so we add 20 to Ashley's total: 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Next, we add Ashley's and Brianne's oranges together to find the total number of oranges: 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Finally, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed to make one pie, which is 3: 120 / 3 = 40.

So, Ashley and Brianne can make 40 Greek orange pies.

"To figure out how many guests are needed for the two venues to cost the same, we need to think about the costs of each venue. The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, plus $5 per guest for food. The second venue charges $25 per guest, and that includes the food.

Let's say the number of guests is 'x'. The cost of the first venue would be $200 + $5x. The cost of the second venue would be $25x.

We want to find out when these two costs are equal, so we can set up an equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

To solve for 'x', we need to get all the 'x' terms on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5x from both sides:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x

Now, we can divide both sides by 20 to find 'x':

x = 200 / 20
x = 10

So, the two venues will cost the same if there are 10 guests.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's say Bodhi found B insects. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects. And since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

We can set up an equation using the fact that together they collected 43 insects:

B + B/2 + (B/2 + 7) = 43

Combine like terms:

B + B/2 + B/2 = 43 - 7
B + B = 36

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many yards Mariah used. Since she used 1/4 of a skein, we multiply 1/4 by the total yards in a skein, which is 364. So, Mariah used 1/4 * 364 = 91 yards.

Next, let's find out how many yards her grandma used. Since she used 1/2 of a skein, we multiply 1/2 by the total yards in a skein, which is 364. So, her grandma used 1/2 * 364 = 182 yards.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma: 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards.

"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the gifts for her friends first. Two of her friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts. The other three friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts. 

Now, we add the gifts for the two groups of friends: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts. 

Cherrie also decided to get 10 more random gifts. To find the total number of gifts, we add the gifts for her friends and the random gifts: 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to start by finding the width of the rug. We know the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide. So, the width of the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Next, we need to find twice the width of the rug, which is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. The couch is 2 feet longer than this, so we add 2 feet to get the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The length of the couch is 18 feet."
"To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to first calculate the total cost of the other two packs of gum. Suzie paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much, which is $1, for a small pack of green apple gum. 

So, the total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid $7 in all, the total cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost by 2, since there are two packs. 

$4 / 2 = $2

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to figure out which type of wood gives the best value for his money. 

Let's start by calculating the number of sticks per dollar for each type of wood. For the 2 x 4 wood, we get 200 sticks for $4, which is 200 / 4 = 50 sticks per dollar. For the 2 x 8 wood, we get 400 sticks for $6, which is 400 / 6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar.

Since the 2 x 8 wood gives more sticks per dollar, it's the better option. Now, let's see how many 2 x 8 woods Frederick can buy with his $24. We can do this by dividing the total money by the cost of one 2 x 8 wood: 24 / 6 = 4.

So, Frederick can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood. Since each one gives 400 sticks, we multiply the number of woods by the number of sticks per wood: 4 * 400 = 1600.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of the snowshoes, we need to figure out how many pairs Mario needs to buy for his 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs and snowshoes come in pairs, each dog needs 2 pairs of snowshoes.

So, for 6 dogs, Mario will need 6 dogs * 2 pairs/dog = 12 pairs of snowshoes. 

Now, we multiply the total number of pairs by the cost per pair, which is $12.00. The total cost will be 12 pairs * $12/pair = $144.

"To figure out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate how much she spends on bus trips each week. 

Janet takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. So, she takes a total of 2 * 5 = 10 bus trips a week. Each trip costs $2.20, so she spends 10 * $2.20 = $22 a week on bus trips.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

"To find the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo, we need to figure out how many cows and sheep each has.

First, we know the farm has 30 cows. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

Next, we know the zoo has 20 sheep. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals at each place. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

To find the total number of animals at both the farm and the zoo, we add the total number of animals at each place: 40 + 80 = 120.

"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to use the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.

Let's start with the onions. Since Rose bought 12 onions, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: 4x = 12, where x is the number of onions Sophia bought. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4, which gives us x = 12 / 4 = 3. So, Sophia bought 3 onions.

Now, let's do the same for the potatoes. Rose bought 4 potatoes, so we can set up another equation: 4x = 4, where x is the number of potatoes Sophia bought. Solving for x, we get x = 4 / 4 = 1. Therefore, Sophia bought 1 potato.

In total, Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items.

"To figure out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day to reach his goal, we need to do some math. 

First, let's calculate the number of days Andy has to lose the weight. From December 31st to July 19th, we have the rest of December (1 day), January (31 days), February (28 days), March (31 days), April (30 days), May (31 days), June (30 days), and 19 days in July. That's a total of 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days.

Since Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and it takes 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

Now, we divide the total calories by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit: 105,000 / 201 ≈ 522 calories.

The final answer is: 522"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Since Gerald earns $30 per day and there are 7 days in a week, his total earnings for the week would be:
$30/day * 7 days = $210

Now, let's subtract the amount he spent ($100) from his total earnings:
$210 - $100 = $110

So, Gerald has $110 left.

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total distance she will run and then multiply it by the amount of water she needs per kilometer.

First, we need to find the total distance. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she has to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap:
8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now that we know the total distance, we can multiply it by the amount of water she needs per kilometer, which is 60 ml/km:
2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes. Since she spent 20% of $500, we can find 20% of $500 by multiplying $500 by 0.20. 

$500 * 0.20 = $100

So, she spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's subtract this amount from the initial $500 to find out how much money she had left.

$500 - $100 = $400

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find 25% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.25.

$400 * 0.25 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount she spent on CDs from the remaining $400.

$400 - $100 = $300

"To find the cost of the house, let's break it down step by step. We know the house and the lot together cost $120,000. We also know the house costs three times as much as the lot.

Let's say the cost of the lot is x. Then, the cost of the house is 3x. Since the total cost is $120,000, we can set up an equation: x + 3x = 120,000.

Combine the x terms: 4x = 120,000.

Now, divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000.

So, the lot costs $30,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the house costs 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find Tara's profit, we need to calculate how much she spent on the bags and how much she made from selling them.

First, let's find the total cost. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, so she bought a total of 8 * 5 = 40 bags. Each bag cost $4, so the total cost is 40 * $4 = $160.

Next, let's find the total revenue. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is 40 * $8 = $320.

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $160 = $160.

We can calculate Josh's cookies by multiplying Suzanne's cookies by 1/4:
Josh's cookies = 1/4 * 36
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many Kelsie made. Since Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we multiply Josh's cookies by 2:
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find out how much money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. He also has six $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. So, the total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Next, Ali gives half of the total money to his sister. Half of $160 is $160 / 2 = $80. This means Ali is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of $80, we multiply $80 by 3 and then divide by 5. This gives us (3 * $80) / 5 = $240 / 5 = $48.

Finally, to find out how much money Ali has after buying dinner, we subtract the cost of dinner from the remaining amount. So, $80 - $48 = $32.

- Each scarf takes 4 skeins, so 3 scarves will take 4 * 3 = 12 skeins.
- Each sweater takes 12 skeins, so 3 sweaters will take 12 * 3 = 36 skeins.
- Each pair of mittens takes 1 skein, so 3 pairs will take 1 * 3 = 3 skeins.
- Each pair of socks takes 2 skeins, so 3 pairs will take 2 * 3 = 6 skeins.

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to break down the number of problems he completed each day.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems. On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems. So, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

Now, let's find out how many problems are left after Tuesday. Since Chris had 100 problems in total, the remaining number of problems after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52 problems.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

Now, let's find out the total number of problems completed by Wednesday. We add the problems completed by Tuesday (48) to the problems completed on Wednesday (13), which is 48 + 13 = 61 problems.

Finally, to find out how many problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we subtract the total number of problems completed (61) from the total number of problems (100).

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate each of their individual rates and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour. Since Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, Bobby's rate is 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so we multiply Bobby's rate by 2. Kathy's rate is 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so we subtract 2 from Kathy's rate. Ricky's rate is 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add their individual rates together to find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, so the total number of loaves sold is 93 + 39 = 132.

Now, we subtract the total number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked: 200 - 132 = 68.

The bakery also got 6 loaves back from a grocery store, so we add those to the total: 68 + 6 = 74.

"To find the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for each color of tulips and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of rows of red tulips. Since Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row and he buys 36 red tulips, we can divide the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row:
36 ÷ 6 = 6 rows of red tulips.

Next, let's find the number of rows of blue tulips. Since Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row and he buys 24 blue tulips, we can divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips per row:
24 ÷ 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
6 rows (red) + 3 rows (blue) = 9 rows.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3, since she's dividing them equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix. 

27 cups / 3 = 9 cups for the cookies.

Now, we know that a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches Heather can make, we need to divide the number of cups she's using for the cookies (9) by 3/4.

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3. 

9 * 4/3 = 9 * 4 / 3 = 36 / 3 = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

First, let's find out how much electricity Ada uses in a day. She uses 12 kilowatts per hour, and there are 24 hours in a day. So, her daily consumption is 12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours = 288 kilowatts.

The new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour, so her new daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts/hour. Multiply this by 24 hours to get 14 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours = 336 kilowatts.

Now, let's find out how much electricity Ada uses in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so her weekly consumption before adding the new device is 288 kilowatts * 7 = 2016 kilowatts. Her weekly consumption after adding the new device is 336 kilowatts * 7 = 2352 kilowatts.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt. Multiply the weekly consumption by the cost to find the weekly bill. Ada's weekly bill before adding the new device is 2016 kilowatts * $1.50 = $3024. Her weekly bill after adding the new device is 2352 kilowatts * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

"To solve this problem, let's think about it step by step. 

First, if one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it means they can paint the whole house in 10 days, since painting the whole house is twice as much work as painting half of it.

Next, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days is equal to 10 * 24 = 240 hours.

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, we need to figure out how long it would take for 5 people to do the same job. Since there are 5 people working together, they can finish the job in 1/5 of the time it would take one person.

"To find the total number of sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna have, we need to start by figuring out how many chairs each of them has.

We know Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, to find the number of chairs she has, we add 2 to the number of sofas: 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Since Ophelia has 22 chairs, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we know Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, to find the number of sofas Jenna has, we subtract 2 from the number of chairs: 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now that we know how many sofas and chairs each of them has, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs:
Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to break it down. Josh worked out for 8 weeks, but there were some weeks where he spent more time than usual.

Let's start with the weeks where he spent the usual 4 hours. Since there were 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours and 1 week where he spent 6 hours, that's 3 weeks that weren't the usual 4 hours. So, he spent 4 hours a week for 8 - 3 = 5 weeks.

For those 5 weeks, he spent a total of 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

Then, there were 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours each. So, that's 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, let's break it down step by step.

First, we start with 48 people on the bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 people on the bus. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus, making the total 40 + 40 = 80.

On the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 people on the bus. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer is 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get on the bus, making the total 59 + 7 = 66.

The number of passengers after the second stop is 66."
"To find out how many years separate the age of Jame and his cousin, we need to figure out their current ages and then find the difference.

First, let's find Jame's current age. We know he'll be 27 in 5 years, so we subtract 5 from 27 to get his current age: 27 - 5 = 22.

Now, let's find Jame's age in 8 years: 22 + 8 = 30.

Next, we're told that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 2 * 30 = 60. So, Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 from 55: 55 - 8 = 47.

Finally, we find the difference in their current ages: 47 - 22 = 25.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to start by finding the cost of the printer. We know Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100. So, the cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's add the cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. This is the total cost of the computer and printer.

The total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the cost of the 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300.

"To find the number of seashells each girl brought, we need to first determine the total number of seashells the boys brought. Since there are 20 kids divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls. Each boy brought 60 shells, so the total number of shells the boys brought is 10 x 60 = 600.

The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be represented as 600 + (4 x 600). To find the total number of shells the girls brought, we need to calculate this expression.

First, multiply 4 by 600: 4 x 600 = 2400. Then, add 600 to this result: 2400 + 600 = 3000. So, the girls brought a total of 3000 shells.

Since there are 10 girls, we can find the number of seashells each girl brought by dividing the total number of shells the girls brought (3000) by the number of girls (10): 3000 / 10 = 300.

So, George initially had 3 (candies left) + 5 (candies eaten) = 8 candies.

The problem states that Nick had twice as many candies as George. To find out how many candies Nick has, we need to multiply the number of candies George had by 2.

Nick has 2 * 8 (George's initial candies) = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to first determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, who is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = 10 - 4 = 6 years

Now that we know Alyana's age, we can find Anne's age. We are given that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we add 2 to Alyana's age to find Anne's age.

Anne's age = 6 + 2 = 8 years

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick, and the second book is 50 mm thick. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so we subtract 5 mm from 50 mm to get 45 mm. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so we multiply 31 mm by 2 to get 62 mm.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 mm + 50 mm = 81 mm
81 mm + 45 mm = 126 mm
126 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

"To figure out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to reach her goal, we need to calculate the total number of vlogs she's made so far and subtract that from her monthly goal.

Emma's monthly goal is 72 vlogs. She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 in the second week, and 15 in the third week. To find the total number of vlogs she's made, we add those numbers together: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54.

Now, we subtract the total number of vlogs she's made from her monthly goal: 72 - 54 = 18.

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal.

"To figure out how much I paid, I need to calculate the tip first. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill. To find 20% of $50, I multiply $50 by 0.20.

$50 * 0.20 = $10

So the tip is $10. Since we're splitting the bill, I'll pay half of the original bill, which is $50 / 2 = $25. Now, I add the half of the bill and the tip.

$25 + $10 = $35

I ended up paying $35."
"To find out how much the eldest boy has now, let's break down the steps:

First, we need to find out how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys. This can be calculated by dividing $18 by 3, which equals $6.

Next, the eldest boy adds $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11. The following day, he adds another $10 to his share, making it $11 + $10 = $21.

However, he spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

Finally, he triples the amount he had left after spending the $8. To do this, we multiply $13 by 3, which equals $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April, and he wants to save twice as much each day in the second half of the month as he does in the first half.

Since April has 30 days, the first half and the second half each have 15 days. Let's say Elvis saves 'x' dollars per day in the first half. Then, he'll save 2x dollars per day in the second half.

The total amount he saves in the first half is 15x (15 days times x dollars per day), and the total amount he saves in the second half is 15(2x) or 30x (15 days times 2x dollars per day).

We know that the total amount he saves is $1125, so we can set up the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine like terms:
45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So, Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half. Since he saves twice as much in the second half, he saves 2x = 2 * 25 = 50 dollars per day in the second half.

"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the apples. She bought three apples at $1.50 each, so the total cost of the apples is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the oranges. She bought five oranges at $0.80 each, so the total cost of the oranges is 5 x $0.80 = $4.00.

Then, we calculate the cost of the peaches. She bought six peaches at $0.75 each, so the total cost of the peaches is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, we add the cost of the apples, oranges, and peaches to find the total cost of the fruits. $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Since Verna gave $20, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from $20 to find the change she received. $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he will earn a total of 20 x $0.8 = $16.

Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she will earn a total of 20 x $0.5 = $10.

Now, let's find the difference between the amount Jairus earns and the amount Jenny earns. 
$16 - $10 = $6

"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

So Brad gets 20 dollars, and Jeff gets 4 times that amount, which is 4 x 20 = 80 dollars.

"To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to figure out how many miles he walks in a day and then multiply that by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back home, we need to double the distance to work. The distance to work is 3 miles, so the round trip is 3 + 3 = 6 miles per day.

Jeff works 5 days a week, so we multiply the miles walked per day by the number of days worked: 6 miles/day * 5 days = 30 miles.

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, let's break it down step by step.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, writing it twice gives us 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters from the first two alphabets and the 13 letters from the half alphabet, for a total of 52 + 13 = 65 letters re-written.

To find the total number of letters, we add the letters from each step: 52 (initial) + 13 (half) + 65 (re-written) = 130 letters.

- 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
- 1 calculator is $12
- 1 geometry set is $10

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the items. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%): $30 * 0.1 = $3

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the amount Daniel has to spend: $30 - $3 = $27

"To find out how much change Carly gets back, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she ordered. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the hamburgers. Since she ordered 5 hamburgers at $4 each, the total cost of the hamburgers is 5 x $4 = $20.

Next, we calculate the cost of the potato fries. She ordered 10 packs at $0.30 each, so the total cost of the potato fries is 10 x $0.30 = $3.

Then, we calculate the cost of the fruit drinks. She ordered 5 cans at $2 each, so the total cost of the fruit drinks is 5 x $2 = $10.

Now, we add the costs of all the items together to get the total cost. The total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Since Carly pays with a $50 bill, we subtract the total cost from $50 to find the change. The change is $50 - $33 = $17.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day and then compare it to the time it takes him to swim on a cold day.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Twice as long as 16 minutes is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim in hot water, we will assume that the time for warm water is the same as the time for hot water, which is 34 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. 

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes. So, 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

Now, to find out how many weeks it'll take him to save $80, we can divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40). 

$80 ÷ $40 = 2

So, it'll take John 2 weeks to save $80.

7 * 2 = 14 holes

Next, we need to find the number of buttons with 4 holes. Since there were 21 buttons in total, and 7 had 2 holes, we subtract 7 from 21 to get the number of buttons with 4 holes:
21 - 7 = 14 buttons

Now, we multiply the number of buttons with 4 holes by 4 to get the total number of holes in these buttons:

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we need to know each of their weights. Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so we subtract 20 from 150 to get Susan's weight: 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 

Now, we know Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. To find Bob's weight, we multiply Susan's weight by 2: 130 * 2 = 260 pounds.

Now that we have all their weights, we can find the total weight by adding them together: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of people, which is 3. So, the average weight is 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in 105 minutes. To do this, we can first find out how many sets of 1.5 minutes are in 105 minutes. We can do this by dividing 105 by 1.5, which gives us 70. Then, we multiply 70 by 2, since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. This gives us 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. So, the total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses.

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month. Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses.

Now, let's subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month.

- The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot. For 216 square feet, the total cost of removal is 216 * $4 = $864.
- The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot. For 216 square feet, the total cost of installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

Now, let's add up the costs: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

Let's break it down:

- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Now, let's add up the total number of birds: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Since Mack counted birds over 7 days, we'll divide the total number of birds by 7 to find the average: 280 / 7 = 40

"To find the final value of the number train, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find half of the starting value, which is 20. Half of 20 is 10. 

Next, we add the starting value and half the number, which gives us 20 + 10 = 30.

Then, we divide the resulting value by 5. So, 30 / 5 = 6.

After that, we subtract 12 from the starting value, which gives us 20 - 12 = 8.

Finally, we multiply the resulting value (6) by the starting value minus 12 (8). This gives us 6 * 8 = 48.

Final answer: 48"
"To find the total number of cards the boy and his brother have, we need to determine the number of cards the brother has and then add it to the number of cards the boy has.

Since the brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, and the boy has 5 cards, we can calculate the number of cards the brother has by subtracting 3 from 5. This gives us 5 - 3 = 2 cards for the brother.

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of cards the boy has (5) to the number of cards the brother has (2). 

5 + 2 = 7

"To figure out the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we need to find out how much it's off from the actual temperature. We know that when she sets it to 450, the actual temperature is 468. 

First, let's find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature: 468 - 450 = 18. 

Now, we need to find out what percentage 18 is of 450. To do this, we'll divide 18 by 450 and multiply by 100: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%. 

This means Maggie's oven is 4% off from the actual temperature. Now, we need to find the temperature she should set it to if her recipe calls for 520 degrees. 

Let's call the temperature she should set it to ""x"". Since the oven is 4% off, the actual temperature will be x + 4% of x. We know the actual temperature should be 520, so we can set up an equation: x + 0.04x = 520. 

Combine like terms: 1.04x = 520. 

Now, divide both sides by 1.04: x = 500. 

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

First, let's convert the time of the first movie. It's 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 1 hour by 60 to get 60 minutes. Then, we add the 30 minutes to get a total of 90 minutes for the first movie.

Next, let's convert the time of the second movie. It's 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We multiply 2 hours by 60 to get 120 minutes, and then add the 5 minutes to get a total of 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to figure out what 30% less than Herb's house is. Herb's house is worth $76,000. 

First, we need to find 30% of $76,000. To do that, we multiply $76,000 by 0.3. 
$76,000 * 0.3 = $22,800

Now, we subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to get the value of Juan's house.
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200. To find the combined value of the two houses, we add the values of both houses.
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

"To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we need to calculate the number of cups and dishes each of them brought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups, which is more than Judy's 12 cups. Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of utensils:

Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36
Her friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84
Total utensils: 36 + 84 = 120

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts and then divide it by the total number of contacts.

First, let's find the cost of 1 box of contacts after the discount. The original price is $100.00, and it's 10% off. To find 10% of $100.00, we multiply $100.00 by 0.10, which is $10.00. So, the discount is $10.00. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, we multiply the cost of 1 box by 2: $90.00 * 2 = $180.00.

Now, let's find the total number of contacts in 2 boxes. 1 box contains 90 contacts, so 2 boxes contain 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

Since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the total number of pairs is 180 contacts / 2 = 90 pairs.

Now, we can calculate the cost of each pair of contacts by dividing the total cost by the total number of pairs:
$180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00 per pair.

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate the total hours worked by each and multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked a total of 3 hours. Since she's paid $10 an hour, she earned 3 * $10 = $30.

Now, let's calculate John's hours. On Saturday, he worked twice as long as Jill, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. On Sunday, he worked three times as long as Jill, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. At $10 an hour, he earned 7 * $10 = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total calories she burns. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, she burns 2 * 500 = 1000 calories doing aerobics.

She spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, she burns 1 * 600 = 600 calories running.

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200. 1600 / 200 = 8.

This means she burned 8 sets of 200 calories. Since she needs 100 ml of water for each set, she needs 8 * 100 = 800 ml of water.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. We'll use B for the number of blue jelly beans. Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 99% of B, or 0.99B. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so it's 101% of B, or 1.01B.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up an equation:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to add the three measurements and divide by 3.

First, we know Jared's initial typing speed is 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons, his speed increases to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his speed by 5 words, his new speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we add the three measurements: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156. To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 ÷ 3 = 52.

"To find the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over 5 weeks.

If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds per week. So, in 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

On the other hand, if Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. So, in 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

Now, to find the difference in weight, we need to subtract the weight lost from the weight gained. But since the weight lost is a negative number (he's losing weight), we can think of it as adding the weight lost to the weight gained. So, the difference is 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds.

Next, Alex called 10 friends to invite them, and 8 of them are bringing their spouses. So, the 10 friends plus their 8 spouses make 10 + 8 = 18 people.

Now, let's add the people invited via email and their friends to the people invited via phone: 300 + 18 = 318.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to start with the weight of the Affenpinscher, which is 10 pounds. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so we multiply 10 by 2 to get 20 pounds. 

Next, the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. To find one-fourth of 20, we divide 20 by 4, which equals 5 pounds.

Finally, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. We multiply 5 by 44 to get the weight of the Mastiff.

The weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds.

"To figure out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both Amazon and eBay.

First, let's look at Amazon. The boots cost $16 and shipping is $4, so the total cost is $16 + $4 = $20.

Now, let's look at eBay. The boots cost $13, which is cheaper than Amazon. However, the shipping cost is twice as much as Amazon's, so it's $4 * 2 = $8. The total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

"To solve this problem, we need to track the height of the beanstalk over time, since it doubles in height every day.

On the first day, the beanstalk is 4 feet tall. On the second day, it doubles to 8 feet. On the third day, it doubles again to 16 feet. On the fourth day, it doubles once more to 32 feet.

Since Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground, we want to find out when the beanstalk will be taller than that. Looking at the heights we calculated, we can see that the beanstalk is still shorter than the window on the third day (16 feet), but it's taller on the fourth day (32 feet).

So, it takes 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein. So, the protein content per gram of mushrooms is 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

Next, we know John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the protein content per gram by the amount he eats: 0.03 grams/gram * 200 grams = 6 grams of protein per day.

Finally, to find out how many grams of protein he gets per week, we multiply the protein content per day by the number of days in a week: 6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week.

"To solve this problem, let's think about it step by step. We know that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. If we let Jerry's current age be 'x', then 5 years ago, he was 'x - 5' years old.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up an equation based on this information. The equation would be: x = 2(x - 5).

Now, let's solve for 'x'. First, we'll expand the equation: x = 2x - 10.

Next, we'll subtract 'x' from both sides of the equation to get: 0 = x - 10.

Then, we'll add 10 to both sides to solve for 'x': 10 = x.

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old he'll be in 3 years, we just need to add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13.

"To figure out how many hours George needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

First, we find the base price for 2 implants, which is 2 * $2000 = $4000. Then, we add the extra $500 for the porcelain crown, making the total cost $4000 + $500 = $4500.

Since George already paid $600, we subtract that from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900. This is the amount he still needs to pay.

Now, we divide the amount he needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"To find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that the three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Let's call the smallest angle x. Then, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is 2x, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, which is 3x.

We can write an equation based on the fact that the sum of the three angles is 180 degrees:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine the x terms:

6x = 180

Now, divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. Now we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

Since 90 degrees is the largest of the three angles, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, let's convert the coins into cents. We have 8 quarters, which is 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents. Then, we have 6 dimes, which is 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents. We also have 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents. Lastly, we have 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy. 

Number of gumballs = 345 / 5 = 69

In the first year, Steve buys 1 game per month, which is 12 games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas. So, at the end of the first year, he has 5 (initial games) + 12 (games bought) + 5 (Christmas games) = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve buys 2 games per month, which is 24 games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas. So, at the end of the second year, he has 22 (games from the previous year) + 24 (games bought) + 5 (Christmas games) = 51 games.

In the third year, Steve buys 4 games per month, which is 48 games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas. So, at the end of the third year, he has 51 (games from the previous year) + 48 (games bought) + 5 (Christmas games) = 104 games.

The rate of the plane is 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Now that we know the rate, we can use it to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles. We can do this by dividing the additional distance (2000 miles) by the rate (400 miles per hour).

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour

Ruiz's hourly production = 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour

Now, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour. We know that Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. However, we need to compare it to Ruiz's hourly production. So, we calculate 3/4 of Ruiz's hourly production.

Marissa's hourly production = 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds per hour

Now that we know their hourly production, we can find out how many pounds of chocolates they make in 12 hours.

Ruiz's 12-hour production = 60 * 12 = 720 pounds
Marissa's 12-hour production = 45 * 12 = 540 pounds

In the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, the total number of cups he sold in 4 hours is 15 * 4 = 60 cups. Since each cup costs $0.50, the total amount he earned in the first 4 hours is 60 * $0.50 = $30.

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, the total number of cups he sold in 2 hours is 10 * 2 = 20 cups. Since each cup costs $0.60, the total amount he earned in the next 2 hours is 20 * $0.60 = $12.

To find the total amount Patrick earned, we add the earnings from the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours: $30 + $12 = $42.

"To figure out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find out how many times the tires rotate in a month. We know that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, so we need to find out how many times they rotate per mile. To do this, we divide 725 by 2.

725 ÷ 2 = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we know Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so we multiply the rotations per mile by the miles driven per month.

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the rotations per month by 12 to get the rotations per year.

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

The tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. To find out how many years this is, we divide the total number of rotations by the rotations per year.

"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to know the number of days in March. March has 31 days.

Since each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, we can multiply this by the total number of members to find the total posts per day. 
Total posts per day = 3 posts/day * 1000 members = 3000 posts/day

Now, we multiply the total posts per day by the number of days in March to find the total posts in March. 
Total posts in March = 3000 posts/day * 31 days = 93,000 posts

"To figure out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many times Gary does laundry in a year. Since he does laundry twice a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply 2 loads per week by 52 weeks. This gives us 2 * 52 = 104 loads of laundry per year.

Next, we need to find out how much water he uses in a year. Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so we multiply 104 loads by 20 gallons per load. This gives us 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons of water per year.

Finally, we need to find out how much it costs him to use that much water. Since a gallon of water costs $0.15, we multiply 2080 gallons by $0.15 per gallon. This gives us 2080 * 0.15 = $312.

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year.

"To find the total amount Scarlett spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's start with the aquarium, which cost $10.00. Then, she bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each, so that's 2 x $2.50 = $5.00. Next, she bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 apiece, which is 3 x $2.00 = $6.00. She also bought 20 fish at $0.50 each, so that's 20 x $0.50 = $10.00. Finally, she needed fish food that cost $2.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00.

"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to break it down step by step.

In the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall. Then, in the second week, it doubled in height. So, we multiply the initial height by 2: 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

In the third week, the beanstalk grew another 4 inches. To find the total height, we add the height at the end of the second week to the growth in the third week: 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells per day. Since Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, we multiply the amount of meat he sells per hour by the number of hours he works per day.

15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg/day

Now, we know the bull weighs 750kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat, we divide the weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day:

750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days

"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to calculate the total number of seats and then subtract the seats occupied by administrators and parents.

First, we find the total number of seats by multiplying the number of rows by the number of seats in each row: 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats.

Next, we calculate the seats occupied by administrators, which is one-fourth of the total seats: 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats.

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by administrators from the total seats to find the remaining seats: 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

Then, we calculate the seats occupied by parents, which is one-third of the remaining seats: 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats.

Finally, we subtract the seats occupied by parents from the remaining seats to find the seats occupied by students: 54 - 18 = 36 seats.

Number of students: 36"
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to calculate the total number of street lights first. 

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Now, we subtract the 20 non-functioning street lights from the total: 96 - 20 = 76.

The total number of functioning street lights is 76."

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to break down his gum-chewing habits throughout the day.

First, let's calculate how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours and the school day lasts 8 hours, we can divide 8 hours by 2 to get 4. So, Jim chews 4 pieces of gum at school.

In addition to the gum he chews at school, Jim also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. This adds up to 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum.

Jim started with a 20-pack of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find half of 14, we can divide 14 by 2, which equals 7. So, Jim gives 7 pieces to his sister and keeps the other 7.

The number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is 7."
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we need to first determine her current age. We know that in 12 years, she'll be 16 years old. So, we subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age.

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount each coach spent and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total amount the baseball coach spent. Since the baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, we multiply the number of baseballs by the cost per baseball:
9 * $3 = $27

Next, let's calculate the total amount the basketball coach spent. The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so we multiply the number of basketballs by the cost per basketball:
8 * $14 = $112

Now, let's find the difference in the amount spent by the two coaches. To do this, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:
$112 - $27 = $85

"To find the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row.

Total flowers = 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Now, we know that only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. To find the number of bloomed flowers, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.

Number of bloomed flowers = 200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to do a couple of conversions. 

First, we need to convert her speed from kilobytes (kb) to megabytes (Mb). We know that 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb. So, we can convert 20 kb to Mb by dividing 20 by 1000, which gives us 0.02 Mb per second.

Next, we need to convert seconds to hours. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

Now, we multiply the speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour: 0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds = 72 Mb per hour.

"To find the total number of cars towed that week, we need to break it down into two parts: the first three days and the remaining days.

The tow truck pulled 10 cars per day for the first three days, so we multiply the number of cars per day by the number of days:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. We multiply this by the number of remaining days:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days to find the total:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"To determine how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to first convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the required height of 4 feet is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, let's subtract Adam's current height from the required height to find out how many more inches he needs to grow: 
48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the remaining inches by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to be tall enough:
8 / 2 = 4 years.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit the company made on each car and then find James' commission.

First, let's find the cost price of each car. The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire the cars. Since the selling price is $25,000, the cost price is 30% of $25,000. To find 30% of $25,000, we multiply $25,000 by 0.3. 

$25,000 * 0.3 = $7,500

So, the cost price of each car is $7,500. Now, let's find the profit on each car. The profit is the selling price minus the cost price.

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
= $25,000 - $7,500
= $17,500

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 times the profit on each car.

Total Profit = 10 * $17,500
= $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profits. To find his commission, we multiply the total profit by 0.1.

Commission = Total Profit * 0.1
= $175,000 * 0.1
= $17,500

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to break down the information given. First, we know that only 25% of the riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright by multiplying 100 by 0.25 (which is the same as 25%).

100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright. Now, we know that 60% of these riders are women. To find the number of women, we multiply 25 by 0.6.

25 * 0.6 = 15

This means 15 of the riders who can stay upright are women. To find the number of men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

25 - 15 = 10

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to calculate the price of the gold and silver jewels.

First, we know the price of the diamond jewel is $2000. The price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel. To find 4/5 of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 4 and then divide by 5. 

4 * $2000 = $8000
$8000 / 5 = $1600

So, the price of the gold jewel is $1600.

Next, we know the price of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. To find the price of the silver jewel, we subtract $400 from $1600.

$1600 - $400 = $1200

Now that we have the prices of all three jewels, we can find the total price by adding them together.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of truck stamps and rose stamps.

First, we know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. Since he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, we can find the number of truck stamps by adding 3 to 16. So, the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

Next, we know Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. To find the number of rose stamps, we subtract 9 from the number of truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we add the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

"To figure out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to cover the 75-mile gap between them.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Since they're moving in the same direction, we subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed. This will give us the speed at which Tom is closing the gap.

Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour, and Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour. So, the relative speed is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is the 75-mile gap between Tom and Bob, and the speed is the relative speed we just calculated (15 mph).

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many Tommy caught. We're told Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we add 3 to Darren's total.

Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To figure out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to find out how many classes he can attend before the cost goes over $10 per class. 

We know that the total cost of the classes is $60, and the maximum cost per class is $10. So, we can divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class to find the maximum number of classes he can attend.

$60 ÷ $10 = 6 classes

This means Manny can attend 6 classes before the cost goes over $10 per class. Since there are 10 total classes, we subtract the number of classes he can attend from the total number of classes to find out how many he can miss.

10 (total classes) - 6 (classes he can attend) = 4 classes

Jewel processes 50 customers daily. Since Julie is twice as fast, she processes twice as many customers as Jewel. So, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers daily.

Now, let's add the number of customers they process daily: 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, we multiply the daily total by 7: 150 * 7 = 1050.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. This means that Lynn's total miles are 3 miles less than Reggie's total miles. To find Lynn's total miles, we subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total miles.

Lynn's total miles = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 17 miles

"To find the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of one apple. Since four apples cost $5.20, we can divide $5.20 by 4 to get the cost of one apple: $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30. Now, we can multiply the cost of one apple by 5 to find the cost of 5 apples: $1.30 × 5 = $6.50.

Next, let's find the cost of one orange. Since three oranges cost $3.30, we can divide $3.30 by 3 to get the cost of one orange: $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10. Now, we can multiply the cost of one orange by 5 to find the cost of 5 oranges: $1.10 × 5 = $5.50.

Finally, we can add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To find the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the suits. James bought 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7,500.

Next, we need to find the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits, which is $750 / 5 = $150. Since James bought 10 dress pants, the total cost of the dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1,500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James bought 3 dress shirts per suit, and he bought 10 suits, so he bought a total of 3 * 10 = 30 dress shirts. The cost of each dress shirt is $60, so the total cost of the dress shirts is 30 * $60 = $1,800.

"To find the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them covered. We can do this by multiplying their speed (in miles per hour) by the time they biked (in hours).

For Alisa, the distance is 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours. To multiply a decimal by a whole number, we multiply the whole number by the decimal's whole part and the decimal's fractional part separately, then add the results. So, 12 * 4 = 48, and 12 * 0.5 = 6. Adding these together, we get 48 + 6 = 54 miles.

For Stanley, the distance is 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours. Again, we multiply the whole number by the decimal's whole part and the decimal's fractional part separately, then add the results. So, 10 * 2 = 20, and 10 * 0.5 = 5. Adding these together, we get 20 + 5 = 25 miles.

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet of soil per hour. He has to dig through 24 feet of soil, so we can divide the total feet of soil by his rate to find the time: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill digs half as fast through clay, so his rate is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He has to dig through 8 feet of clay, so we can divide the total feet of clay by his rate: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Finally, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to find the total time: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to first calculate her total sales for the first month. We know that her sales from red hats were $400, which is half the amount she earned from selling green hats. 

Let's find the sales from green hats. If the sales from red hats are half the sales from green hats, then the sales from green hats are twice the sales from red hats. So, sales from green hats = 2 * 400 = 800.

Now, we can find the total sales for the first month by adding the sales from red hats and green hats. Total sales for the first month = 400 + 800 = 1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the total sales for the second month, we multiply the total sales for the first month by 3/4. Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * 1200 = 900.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the cost for each hour. James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. Since he gets 1 hour free, he pays for 3 hours.

The cost for the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost of the previous hour. So, the second paid hour is 2 * $15 = $30, and the third paid hour is 2 * $30 = $60.

Now, we add the cost of the paid hours: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

"To figure out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate how much she actually received and compare it to her expected wage.

First, let's find out how much she received. We know her bank account had $200 at the start of the week and $420 at the end. So, the amount she received is $420 - $200 = $220.

Now, we know Sally's expected wage is $300. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the amount she actually received from her expected wage: $300 - $220 = $80.

"To figure out how many eggs Lori needs, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves she'll need for her party. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she's inviting 16 guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves per guest.

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Now, we know that 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves. So, to find out how many eggs Lori needs, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 eggs

Finally, since eggs are usually sold by the dozen (12 eggs per dozen), we need to find out how many dozens Lori needs. We do this by dividing the total number of eggs by 12.

24 eggs / 12 = 2

"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to calculate how many pages she has already written. Since she finished 1/3 of the paper, we can find this by multiplying 15 pages by 1/3.

15 * 1/3 = 15 / 3 = 5 pages

So, Shiela has already written 5 pages. To find out how many pages she has left, we subtract the number of pages she has written from the total number of pages.

15 (total pages) - 5 (pages written) = 10 pages

She has 10 pages left to write.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate how many days it will take him to read the book and then subtract that from the total number of days he has to complete the assignment.

The book has 200 pages, and Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. To find out how many days it will take him to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day.

200 pages / 10 pages per day = 20 days

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

30 days - 20 days = 10 days

"To figure out how much it cost James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to add up a few things. First, the plane itself cost $150,000. Then, he pays $5,000 a month to rent a hangar, so for a whole year that's $5,000 * 12 = $60,000. He also spends twice as much as that on fuel, so that's $10,000 a month, or $10,000 * 12 = $120,000 for the year. 

Now, we just need to add all those numbers together: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

$330,000"
"To find the total cooking time, we need to calculate the time it took to cook each item. We know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice, we can find the cooking time for pork by adding 20 minutes to the cooking time for rice. So, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Next, we need to find the cooking time for beans. We know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. To find half of this, we divide by 2: 80 / 2 = 40 minutes. So, it took 40 minutes to cook the beans.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking time for each item: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

"To find the cost difference between the two mixtures, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture with 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. Since a pound of almonds costs $10, 1/2 pound will cost half of that, which is $5. A pound of walnuts costs $15, so 1/3 pound will cost 1/3 of that, which is $5. The total cost of this mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture with 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. Since a pound of almonds costs $10, 1/5 pound will cost 1/5 of that, which is $2. Again, 1/3 pound of walnuts will cost $5. The total cost of this mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two mixtures. To do this, we subtract the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up two equations based on the information given. Let's use S to represent the number of sheep and G to represent the number of geese.

First, we know that each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so we can write the equation:
4S + 2G = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation:
S + G = 20

Now, we can solve these equations by multiplying the second equation by 2, which gives us:
2S + 2G = 40

Next, we can subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate G:
(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
This simplifies to:
2S = 30

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
S = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost of Roger's purchase, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and add the cost of the donut.

First, let's find the cost of the coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but Roger had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. To find 20% of $5, we multiply $5 by 0.2, which gives us $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 days, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he buys 7 pounds of coffee. The cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Finally, we add the cost of the donut, which is $2. The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items Gus bought and then subtract that from the total amount he spent.

Gus bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, so that's 2 x $2.00 = $4.00. He also bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00. Adding these costs together, we get $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

Since Gus spent a total of $20.00, we can subtract the cost of the other items from this amount to find the cost of the apple pie. $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Let's do the math:

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

First, we add the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C:
198 + 209 = 407

Now, we subtract this total from the total number of newspapers delivered:
600 - 407 = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class. The class meets 4 times a week, and each class is 2 hours long. So, in one week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours in class. Since the class goes on for 6 weeks, the total number of hours is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

Now, we know that John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours. To find out how many recipes he learns, we need to divide the total number of hours by 1.5. 

48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes

"To find the total time the math teachers spend sleeping, we need to first find out how many math teachers are there. We know that 60% of the teachers are history teachers, so the remaining teachers are math teachers. 

Since there are 150 teachers in total, we can find the number of math teachers by calculating 40% of 150. To do this, we multiply 150 by 0.4 (which is the same as 40%).

Number of math teachers = 0.4 * 150
= 60

Now that we know there are 60 math teachers, we can find the total time they spend sleeping. We are told that each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so we multiply the number of math teachers by the hours each teacher sleeps.

Total time math teachers spend sleeping = 60 * 6

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has, then add it together and divide by 3.

First, we know Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so we multiply $120 by 3/4. To do this, we can convert 3/4 to a decimal by dividing 3 by 4, which is 0.75. Then, we multiply $120 by 0.75, which equals $90.

Now we know Kassidy has $90. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so we add $60 to $90, which equals $150.

Now that we know how much money each person has, we can add it together: $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total by 3: $360 / 3 = $120.

"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the length of the regular quarters and add the extra time. Since there are 4 quarters in a game, each lasting 12 minutes, we multiply 4 by 12 to get the total minutes for the regular quarters. 

4 * 12 = 48 minutes

Since the game was extended for 5 minutes due to a tie, we add this extra time to the total minutes of the regular quarters.

48 + 5 = 53 minutes

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"To find out how many employees oversee the company, we need to do a couple of calculations.

50 * 0.20 = 10

So, 10 employees are management. Now, we need to find out how many of these 10 employees oversee the company. We're told that 30% of the management employees oversee the company. To find this out, we multiply 10 (the number of management employees) by 0.30 (which is the same as 30%).

Let's start by adding up the amount of candy each person has: Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. 

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Since they want to share the candy equally, we'll divide the total amount of candy by the number of people, which is 3.

Candy per person = Total candy / Number of people
Candy per person = 12 / 3
Candy per person = 4

So, each person would have 4 pounds of candy.

"To find out how much change Adam got, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought and then subtract that from the amount he paid.

First, let's calculate the cost of the candies of type A. Since one candy of type A costs $0.5, 7 candies will cost 7 * $0.5 = $3.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the candies of type B. One candy of type B costs $0.75, so 10 candies will cost 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

Now, we add the cost of both types of candies to get the total cost: $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Adam paid $15, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid: $15 - $11 = $4.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to figure out how many good days Christina had in total, including the first 30 days and the next 3 days.

We know that Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days. Her first 8 days were good, and then the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. So, that's 2 more good days. 

Now, we add the good days in the first 30 days (12) to the additional good days (2) to get the total good days, which is 14. But we want to know how many good days were left in the month after the first 30 days. Since we already know the total good days in the first 30 days (12), we subtract the good days in the first 30 days from the total good days including the next 3 days.

So, the good days left in the month are 14 (total good days including the next 3 days) - 12 (initial good days) = 2.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many days it'll take for the bamboo to grow from its current height to 600 inches. First, we need to convert the current height from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 20 feet by 12.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo is currently 240 inches tall, and we want to know how many days it'll take to reach 600 inches. To do this, we subtract the current height from the target height.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

This means the bamboo needs to grow 360 more inches to reach 600 inches. Since it grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the number of inches it needs to grow by the growth rate.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

First, James had 4 dogs and then 8 more dogs arrived, so that's 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. 

When James came back, there were twice as many dogs as before, so we multiply 12 by 2 to get 24 dogs. 

However, 3 dogs left, so we subtract 3 from 24 to get 21 dogs. 

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to break down the investments of Dylan and Frances.

First, Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200. To calculate this, we multiply 2/5 by 1200. To multiply a fraction by a number, we multiply the numerator (2) by the number (1200) and then divide by the denominator (5). So, 2 * 1200 = 2400, and 2400 / 5 = 480. Dylan invested $480.

Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount. $1200 - $480 = $720.

Next, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720. To calculate this, we multiply 2/3 by 720. Again, we multiply the numerator (2) by the number (720) and then divide by the denominator (3). So, 2 * 720 = 1440, and 1440 / 3 = 480. Frances invested $480.

Finally, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find Skyler's investment. $720 - $480 = $240.

Skyler's investment was $240."

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to figure out how many cookies each person has. We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find Max's cookies by adding 5 to Katarina's total. 

Max's cookies = Katarina's cookies + 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find the Cookie Monster's cookies. The Cookie Monster has 12 less cookies than Max, so we subtract 12 from Max's total.

Cookie Monster's cookies = Max's cookies - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

Lastly, we know Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. We can find Summer's cookies by adding 23 to Max's total.

Summer's cookies = Max's cookies + 23
Summer's cookies = 73 + 23
Summer's cookies = 96

Now, we can add up the total number of cookies:

"To find the original length of the dress, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length. This means the new length is 1.5 times the original length. If we denote the original length as 'x', the length after extension is 1.5x.

Next, she added 20cm to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We're given that the final length is 140cm. We can set up an equation using this information:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we'll subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Then, we'll divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes Chris to mow half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode.

First, let's convert the time it takes to mow the lawn in turtle mode to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it takes Chris 60 minutes to mow the lawn in turtle mode. To mow half the lawn, he'll take half of that time, which is 60 / 2 = 30 minutes.

Next, we know it takes Chris 40 minutes to mow the lawn in rabbit mode. To mow half the lawn, he'll take half of that time, which is 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode to get the total time.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know there's one set of twins and one set of triplets. Let's say the age of one twin is T and the age of one triplet is t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation: T = t + 7.

We also know that the combined ages of all the kids are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write another equation: 2T + 3t = 44.

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second one. We'll replace T with t + 7, so the equation becomes: 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + 3t = 44. Combining like terms, we get: 5t + 14 = 44.

Now, let's solve for t. Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get: 5t = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get: t = 6.

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin. Since T = t + 7, we can plug in t = 6 to get: T = 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of 5 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the total cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.

We know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. So, the cost of 4 candies can be found by subtracting the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

Now, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost of 4 candies by 4: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Next, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00, and the cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate the number of coins each of them has saved.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 20 by 12 to get the number of coins Rong saves in a year: 20 * 12 = 240 coins. To find the total number of coins Rong has saved in 10 years, we multiply 240 by 10: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many more coins Neil saves, we multiply 20 by 2/5: (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. In a year, Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins. In 10 years, Neil will have saved 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

We're also told that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. This means the heartworm check costs 0.6x.

Since the total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write an equation: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for x: x = $40 / 0.4 = $100.

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so to find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought: $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the individual fruits. 

First, we need to find the cost of each fruit. We know that one apple costs $0.5. Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, the cost of a banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece, so the cost of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To find the total area of Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and add them together.

First, we know there are 14 red squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, we can find the number of blue squares by adding 4 to 14, which gives us 18 blue squares.

Next, we're told there are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, we add 6 to 18, which gives us 24 green squares.

Finally, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. To find the number of white squares, we subtract 12 from 24, which gives us 12 white squares.

Now, let's add up the number of squares: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To figure out how many more chairs Mia needs, we first need to find out the total number of people attending the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of people is 42 + 15 = 57.

The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs. So, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

In total, the restaurant has 40 regular chairs + 8 high chairs = 48 chairs.

Since there are 57 people and only 48 chairs, Mia needs to get more chairs. To find out how many, we subtract the number of chairs from the number of people: 57 - 48 = 9.

"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to break down the information given. First, we know that 50% of the 50 deer are bucks. To find the number of bucks, we multiply 50 by 0.5 (which is the same as 50%). 

50 * 0.5 = 25

So, there are 25 bucks in the field. Now, we need to find 20% of the bucks that are 8 points. To do this, we multiply 25 by 0.2 (which is the same as 20%).

25 * 0.2 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

"To find out how many points the class is missing, we need to calculate the total points collected by the students.

Adam has 50 points. Since Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, we need to find 30% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which gives us 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Now, let's find out how many points Tom has. We know Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so we subtract 30 from 65, which gives us 35 points for Tom.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. To find Marta's points, we multiply Tom's points by 3. So, Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold: 
400 - 255 = 145 points.

"To figure out how many great grand-babies will be at the family reunion, we need to break it down step by step. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children, and each of them has 3 kids of their own, making them her grandchildren. So, the number of grandchildren is 3 (children) * 3 (grandchildren per child) = 9.

Now, since each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, we multiply the number of grandchildren by 3 to get the number of great grand-babies. That's 9 (grandchildren) * 3 (great grand-babies per grandchild) = 27.

"To figure out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate how much she puts into her retirement account and how much she spends on her car payment. Then, we subtract those amounts from her total paycheck.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account. Since she puts 50% of her paycheck into her retirement account, we multiply her paycheck by 0.5. 
$2400.00 * 0.5 = $1200.00

Next, let's calculate her car payment. She uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment, so we multiply her paycheck by 0.2.
$2400.00 * 0.2 = $480.00

Now, we add the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she spends on her car payment to find the total amount deducted from her paycheck.
$1200.00 + $480.00 = $1680.00

Finally, we subtract the total amount deducted from her paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend.
$2400.00 - $1680.00 = $720.00

"To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to determine how many pencils are actually in the box. Since there's space for 20 pencils and 4 are missing, we subtract the missing pencils from the total capacity.

Pencils in the box = Total capacity - Missing pencils
Pencils in the box = 20 - 4
Pencils in the box = 16

Now, we know that a pair consists of 2 pencils. So, to find the number of pairs, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

Pairs of pencils = Pencils in the box / 2
Pairs of pencils = 16 / 2
Pairs of pencils = 8

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of city fireworks she can see and add the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard.

First, let's find the total number of city fireworks. Since there are 15 boxes with 20 fireworks each, we multiply 15 by 20 to get 300 fireworks. However, Hannah can only see 40% of these fireworks. To find 40% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which gives us 120 fireworks.

Next, we need to find the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard. She has 3 boxes with 5 fireworks each, so we multiply 3 by 5 to get 15 fireworks.

Now, we add the number of city fireworks Hannah can see (120) to the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard (15). This gives us a total of 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks.

"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we need to calculate the total number of people first. Aiden and 12 of his friends are going to see a film, and they meet up with 7 more friends there. So, the total number of people is 1 (Aiden) + 12 (his friends) + 7 (more friends) = 20.

Each person has 2 drinks and 3 snacks. To find the total number of drinks, we multiply the number of people by 2: 20 * 2 = 40 drinks. To find the total number of snacks, we multiply the number of people by 3: 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

Now, we add the total number of drinks and snacks to find the total number of items: 40 (drinks) + 60 (snacks) = 100 items.

Since each item costs $2, we multiply the total number of items by the cost per item: 100 * 2 = 200.

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first figure out how many pounds Gordy's truck can carry. We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, and Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than that. So, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, let's add up how many pounds Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry together. That's 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

We're told that all three trucks combined can carry 11,600 pounds. To find out how many pounds Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the total weight that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total weight that all three trucks can carry. 

11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to figure out how many dumplings the males and females ate in total.

First, let's look at the females. There are 6 females, and each of them ate 3 dumplings. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 x 3 = 18.

Now, let's look at the males. There are 8 males, including Larry. We know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 x 4 = 32.

To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we add the number of dumplings eaten by males and females. That's 18 + 32 = 50.

"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first determine his share of the $100. Since Gerald and Julia divided the money in the ratio 3:2, we can think of the money being split into 5 parts (3 parts for Gerald and 2 parts for Julia).

Gerald's share is 3 out of the 5 parts, so we can calculate his share by multiplying 3/5 by $100. This gives us (3/5) * 100 = 60.

Now, we know Gerald spent $10 on a book. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the cost of the book from his initial share: 60 - 10 = 50.

"To find out how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to figure out the turtle's speed. We know the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat can run 15 feet per second. 

So, if the cat is 5 times faster, we divide the cat's speed by 5 to get the turtle's speed. 

Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5
Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5
Turtle's speed = 3 feet/second

Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can find the distance it can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

"To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them up. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the croissants. Marcus ordered 5 croissants at $3.00 each, so the total cost of the croissants is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of the cinnamon rolls. Marcus ordered 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, so the total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00.

Then, we calculate the cost of the mini quiches. Marcus ordered 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each, so the total cost of the mini quiches is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.

Finally, we calculate the cost of the blueberry muffins. Marcus ordered 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each, so the total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add up the cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10: $50.00 x 0.10 = $5.00.

"To find out how much James saved by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we need to calculate the cost of both options.

First, let's calculate the cost of picking the blueberries. James had to pay $20 to go picking, and then he paid $1.5 per pound for the 30 pounds he picked. So, the total cost of picking is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 * 30 (cost per pound) = $20 + $45 = $65.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries for $2.5 per pound, and James would have needed 30 pounds. So, the total cost of buying is $2.5 * 30 = $75.

The amount James saved is the difference between the cost of buying and the cost of picking. So, the amount saved is $75 - $65 = $10.

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the taps for the time with arms raised and the time with arms at her sides, then add them together.

When Helga's arms are raised, she taps 200 times per minute with each foot. Since she does this for 2 minutes, the total taps with arms raised is:
2 minutes * 200 taps/minute * 2 feet = 800 taps

When her arms are at her sides, she taps 300 times per minute with her right foot and 250 times per minute with her left foot. So, the total taps per minute with arms at her sides is 300 + 250 = 550 taps/minute. Since she does this for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps with arms at her sides is:
3 minutes * 550 taps/minute = 1650 taps

The combined total number of taps is the sum of the taps with arms raised and the taps with arms at her sides:

There are 5 pizzas in total, each with 12 slices. So, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, we need to find 2/3 of 12 slices for each of them. To do this, we multiply 12 by 2/3, which is the same as multiplying 12 by 2 and then dividing by 3. This gives us 24 slices for the three of them.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, we need to find ¾ of 12 slices for each of them. To do this, we multiply 12 by ¾, which is the same as multiplying 12 by 3 and then dividing by 4. This gives us 9 slices for each of the two friends, for a total of 18 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42.

"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we need to first determine the time the dog takes. Since the dog eats the sausages in 2/3 the time the cat takes, we can calculate the dog's time by multiplying the cat's time by 2/3.

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes, so the dog eats them in 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes.

Now that we know the time taken by both the cat (30 minutes) and the dog (20 minutes), we can find the average time by adding the two times and dividing by 2.

Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, let's use the given information that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. If we denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x, we can set up the equation:
9x + 10 = 100

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
9x = 90

Next, divide both sides by 9:
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

First, let's find the total number of windows for students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we need to find one-fourth of 256. To do this, we can divide 256 by 4, which gives us 64 windows smashed.

Next, let's find the total number of windows for teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we need to find three-fourths of 64. To do this, we can multiply 64 by 3 and then divide by 4, which gives us 48 windows smashed.

Now, let's add the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed. 64 + 48 = 112.

At the start, there were 5000 people in line. By midday, 2/5 of them had voted. To find 2/5 of 5000, we multiply 5000 by 2 and divide by 5. That's (5000 * 2) / 5 = 2000 people.

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted, and 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were left.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. To find 2/3 of 3000, we multiply 3000 by 2 and divide by 3. That's (3000 * 2) / 3 = 2000 people.

Now, we add the people who voted by midday (2000) to the people who voted by 16:00 (2000), and we get 2000 + 2000 = 4000 people who had voted.

To find the number of people who hadn't voted by 16:00, we subtract the number of people who had voted (4000) from the total number of people (5000). That's 5000 - 4000 = 1000.

"To figure out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he'll chew in 30 days. Since he chews 4 pieces a day, we multiply that by 30 days:
4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we know that a pack of gum has 15 pieces. To find out how many packs he'll need, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack:
120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

"To figure out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required. There are 9 kids who want 2 s'mores each, so that's 9 * 2 = 18 s'mores. The 6 adults want 1 s'more each, so that's 6 * 1 = 6 s'mores. Adding these together, we get 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores.

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores, so we divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed: 24 / 8 = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to figure out how many boxes are needed. In this case, it's simple: 3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to calculate the ages of Dora's father and mother.

First, we know Dora is 15 years old. Her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we multiply Dora's age by 2 and add 8 to get her father's age: 2 * 15 + 8 = 38.

Next, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. To find her age, we subtract 4 from her father's age: 38 - 4 = 34.

Now, we can calculate the total combined age by adding the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87.

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to calculate the weight of each type of book and then add them all together.

Cindy has two math and science books, each weighing 2 pounds. So, the total weight of these books is 2 * 2 = 4 pounds.

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.

The history book is a bit heavier, weighing twice as much as her English book. Since the English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the books: 
4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds.

"To find out how many votes candidate C got, we need to first figure out how many votes candidates A and B got.

Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, we can find 20% of 100 by multiplying 0.2 and 100, which gives us 20 votes.

Now, candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. To find 50% of 20, we multiply 0.5 and 20, which gives us 10. So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now that we know candidate A got 20 votes and candidate B got 30 votes, we can add them together to get the total number of votes they got: 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Since there were 100 voters in total, we subtract the votes candidates A and B got from the total number of voters to find out how many votes candidate C got: 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's apples by subtracting 23 from 100.

Beck's apples = 100 - 23 = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. This means Boris will have 10 fewer apples, and Beck will have 10 more apples.

Boris' new apples = 100 - 10 = 90
Beck's new apples = 77 + 10 = 87

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's new apples from Boris' new apples.

Difference = 90 - 87 = 3

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the total amount of water he started with.

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes. Since each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water and Peter makes 3 giant cubes, the total water used for giant cubes is 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

Next, we calculate the water used for the medium cubes. Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water, and Peter makes 7 medium cubes, so the total water used for medium cubes is 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

Finally, we calculate the water used for the small cubes. Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water, and Peter makes 8 small cubes, so the total water used for small cubes is 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, we add up the total water used for all the cubes: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

Since Peter started with 32 ounces of water, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount to find out how much water he has left: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Clara has 20 books, and she has two times as many books as Steven. To find out how many books Steven has, we can divide the number of books Clara has by 2. 

20 ÷ 2 = 10

So, Steven has 10 books. Now, we know Alice has 6 more books than Steven. To find out how many books Alice has, we can add 6 to the number of books Steven has.

10 + 6 = 16

Now that we know Alice has 16 books, we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice by subtracting the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has.

"To find the total amount Cecelia spent, we need to first figure out the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5, we can subtract $2 from $5 to get the cost of a half-gallon jar.

Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5 = $50
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3 = $48

To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars.

Total amount spent = $50 + $48 = $98

"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we need to break down the information given. There are 50 students in total, with 10 who like to bake and 5 who like to play basketball. This means 10 + 5 = 15 students are either bakers or basketball players.

Since there are 50 students in total, the remaining students who like to play video games or play music are 50 - 15 = 35.

We're also told that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to play music from the total number of students who like to play video games or play music. 

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, Jeremy saw 12 birds in his backyard. When he threw a stone, he scared away 1/3 of the birds. To find out how many birds he scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of 12. 

Since 1/3 is the same as dividing by 3, we can calculate this as 12 ÷ 3 = 4 birds. So, Jeremy scared away 4 birds.

Now, we need to find out how many birds are left. We can do this by subtracting the number of birds he scared away from the original number of birds. 

12 (original birds) - 4 (birds scared away) = 8 birds.

Later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. To find the total number of birds now, we add the number of birds that joined to the number of birds that were left.

8 (remaining birds) + 20 (new birds) = 28 birds.

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls, we can multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4.

40 * 0.4 = 16 girls per class

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

After that, Mara ate 2 slices, leaving her with 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Finally, her friend stole 5 slices from the plate. To find the number of slices remaining, we subtract 5 from 13, which gives us 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

Since Melissa wants to split the jobs evenly over the days of the week, we divide the total number of animals by 7 (the number of days in a week).

28 ÷ 7 = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

"To find out how much profit Mark made, we need to calculate how much he spent and how much he earned.

Mark bought 3 packs of cards for $1800 each, so he spent 3 x $1800 = $5400.

Now, let's calculate how much he earned. He got two valuable cards worth $4000 and $1000, which adds up to $5000. He also got 30 more cards that are worth $50 each, so that's 30 x $50 = $1500. Adding all these together, Mark earned $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the earnings: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

"To find out how much Jake's family can save by choosing the second amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then compare them.

The first amusement park charges $26 per adult and $12 per child. Since there are 2 adults and 2 children, the total cost would be:
2 adults * $26 = $52
2 children * $12 = $24
Total cost for the first park = $52 + $24 = $76

The second amusement park charges $14 per adult and $10 per child. For 2 adults and 2 children, the total cost would be:
2 adults * $14 = $28
2 children * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second park = $28 + $20 = $48

Now, let's find out how much they can save by choosing the second park:
Cost difference = Total cost for the first park - Total cost for the second park
Cost difference = $76 - $48
Cost difference = $28

Next, let's find the new daily cost. The vendor still sells 500 tomatoes a day, but the new cost per tomato is $.4, so the new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

Now, let's find the daily savings by subtracting the new daily cost from the original daily cost: $250 - $200 = $50.

Finally, to find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

Now, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. We can find the number of marbles Carl has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 4.

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

Finally, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined by adding the number of marbles each of them has.

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles

"To find the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in a week. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week. On weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day, and on weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

So, the number of chairs rented on weekdays in a week is 60 * 5 = 300 chairs. The number of chairs rented on weekends in a week is 100 * 2 = 200 chairs. Now, let's add these two numbers together to get the total number of chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs.

Since we want to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to know how many weeks are in that time period. There are 4 weeks in a month, so there are 2 * 4 = 8 weeks in two 4-week months.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 27, so she trades 27 small stickers for 9 large buttons (since 3 small stickers = 1 large button). Now she has 3 small stickers left and 9 large buttons.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 20, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons. Now she has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons, and 20 large stickers left.

She then trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker = 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons. Now she has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons, and 60 small buttons.

Adding the 9 large buttons from earlier, she now has a total of 38 large buttons. Since 1 large button = 3 small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons. 38 large buttons = 38 * 3 = 114 small buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers and 114 + 60 = 174 small buttons. Since 1 small sticker = 1 small button, we can convert the small stickers to small buttons. So she has 3 + 174 = 177 small buttons.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is x. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and each member votes either in favor or against. So, the total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and against, which is x + 2x = 3x.

Since the total number of council members is 33, we can set up the equation 3x = 33. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3, which gives us x = 11.

Now that we know the number of votes against is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2. This gives us 2 * 11 = 22.

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"To find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we need to calculate the number of students for each size.

First, we know that 11 students need size extra-small. Since twice as many students need size small as extra small, we multiply 11 by 2 to get 22 students who need size small.

Next, we're told that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, we subtract 4 from 22 to get 18 students who need size medium.

Then, we're told that half as many students need size large as size medium. To find this, we divide 18 by 2 to get 9 students who need size large.

Finally, we're told that six more students need size extra-large than large. So, we add 6 to 9 to get 15 students who need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the number of students for each size:

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns 5 * $15 = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she doesn't earn the additional $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $80 + $30 = $110.

"To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we need to calculate the total sales of each type of scent.

The perfume company has 4 vanilla scents and they sold 5 of each, so the total sales of vanilla scents is 4 * 5 = 20.

They have 8 fruity scents and they sold 2 of each, so the total sales of fruity scents is 8 * 2 = 16.

Now, let's find the difference in sales by subtracting the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold: 20 - 16 = 4.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants and then figure out how much more he needs to make.

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made 20 x $3 = $60 from the eggplants. Since he wants to make a total of $135, we subtract the amount he made from the eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. This gives us $135 - $60 = $75.

Now, we know that Bennet needs to make $75 from selling 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to make by the number of ears of corn. So, $75 ÷ 25 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the percentage of time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to calculate the total time she has available and then subtract the time spent reading and playing video games.

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so her total time is 7 + 5 = 12 hours.

She spends 3 hours reading, so we subtract that from her total time: 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

Next, she spends 1/3 of the remaining time playing video games. To find 1/3 of 9 hours, we can divide 9 by 3, which gives us 3 hours.

Now, we subtract the time spent playing video games from the remaining time: 9 - 3 = 6 hours. This is the time Tatiana spends playing soccer.

To find the percentage, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, Anthony gave 1/2 of his 50 pencils to Brandon. To find 1/2 of 50, we multiply 50 by 1/2, which is the same as dividing by 2. So, 50 / 2 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.

Now, Anthony is left with 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie. To find 3/5 of 25, we multiply 25 by 3 and then divide by 5. So, (25 * 3) / 5 = 75 / 5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.

Finally, we subtract the pencils given to Charlie from the remaining pencils: 25 - 15 = 10 pencils.

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to and from the museum, and add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum. We know the distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 miles per hour. To find the time, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. 

Time = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home at the same speed, the time spent driving back is also 2 hours. So, the total time Jack spends driving is 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

We also know that Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we add the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

Total time = Time spent driving + Time spent at the museum
= 4 hours + 6 hours
= 10 hours

"To find out how many wheels will be left, we need to calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles. 

First, let's calculate the number of wheels needed for the cars. Since each car needs 4 wheels, we multiply the number of cars by 4. 
57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

Next, we calculate the number of wheels needed for the motorcycles. Since each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, we multiply the number of motorcycles by 2. 
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to get the total number of wheels needed. 
228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Finally, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels available in the box. 
650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

"To find the amount you have to pay after a 20% discount, you need to calculate the discount first. 

The discount is 20% of the original price, which is $1000. To find 20% of $1000, multiply $1000 by 0.20. 

$1000 * 0.20 = $200

So, the discount is $200. Now, subtract the discount from the original price to find the final amount you have to pay.

$1000 - $200 = $800

"To figure out how much it'll cost Mike to replace his movie collection, we need to break it down into parts. He's got 600 movies in total.

First, let's look at the movies that are part of a series. Since a third of his movies are in series, we can calculate that by dividing 600 by 3, which gives us 200 movies. These series movies cost 1/6 of what a normal movie costs, which is $10. So, 1/6 of $10 is $1.67. Multiply that by 200, and we get $334 for the series movies.

Now, let's look at the remaining movies. We subtract the 200 series movies from the total, which leaves us with 400 movies. Out of these, 40% are older movies that cost $5 each. To find 40% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.4, which gives us 160 older movies. Multiply 160 by $5, and we get $800 for the older movies.

The remaining movies are the normal ones that cost $10 each. We subtract the 160 older movies from the 400 remaining movies, which leaves us with 240 normal movies. Multiply 240 by $10, and we get $2400 for the normal movies.

Now, let's add up the costs: $334 for the series movies, $800 for the older movies, and $2400 for the normal movies. That gives us a total of $3534.

The final answer is: $3534"
"To find the total amount Winston spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the peaches. Since peaches cost $2.00 per pound and Winston picked 6 pounds, the total cost of peaches is 6 * $2.00 = $12.00.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the plums. Plums cost $1.00 per pound, and Winston picked 8 pounds, so the total cost of plums is 8 * $1.00 = $8.00.

Finally, we'll calculate the cost of the apricots. Apricots cost $3.00 per pound, and Winston picked 6 pounds, so the total cost of apricots is 6 * $3.00 = $18.00.

Now, let's add the costs of all three fruits together to find the total amount Winston spent: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the time they spent driving. They spent a total of 6 hours traveling, and 1.5 hours of that was hiking. So, they spent 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours driving.

Next, we can find the distance they drove. We know they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, so we multiply their speed by the time they spent driving: 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

Now, let's find their hiking speed. We know it's 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25, so their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

We can use this speed to find the distance they hiked. We know they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so we multiply their hiking speed by the time they spent hiking: 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Finally, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to the vacation spot: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

"To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points each of them scored. 

Ava and Emma receive 10 points for every enemy they jump on, 5 points for each berry they collect, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level. 

Let's say Emma jumps on 'x' enemies and collects 'y' berries, and finishes the level with 'z' seconds left on the timer. 

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 'x + 8' enemies. She collects 3 more berries than Emma, so she collects 'y + 3' berries. Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes with 'z - 4' seconds left on the timer.

Now, let's calculate their scores. 

Emma's score = 10x + 5y + 30z
Ava's score = 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(z - 4)

To find the difference between their scores, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's score. 

The difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
= 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(z - 4) - (10x + 5y + 30z)
= 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30z - 120 - 10x - 5y - 30z

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas.

First, let's find the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars, we can assume that each of these two pizzas costs 15 dollars. So, the total cost of these two pizzas is 15 + 15 = 30 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. 

So, the cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 30 = 34 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 34 / 2 = 17 dollars.

"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break it down into two parts: the usual days and the other two days.

On the usual 5 days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day. So, the total number of rides on these days is 5 days * 3 rides/day = 15 rides.

On the other 2 days, they ride twice as many times as they do on the usual days. Since they ride 3 times on a usual day, they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times on these 2 days. The total number of rides on these 2 days is 2 days * 6 rides/day = 12 rides.

Now, we add the total number of rides on the usual days and the other 2 days to get the total number of rides in a week: 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He then bought 17 more fish, and after adding them to his pond, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, the total number of white fish he has is x + 4 (the 4 white fish he already had). The total number of orange fish he has is 2(x + 4), since he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

We know that the total number of orange fish he has is the sum of the orange fish he already had (3) and the orange fish he bought. Since he bought 17 fish in total, the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - x.

So, we can set up the equation: 3 + (17 - x) = 2(x + 4).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3 + 17 - x = 2x + 8.
Combine like terms: 20 - x = 2x + 8.
Add x to both sides: 20 = 3x + 8.
Subtract 8 from both sides: 12 = 3x.
Divide both sides by 3: 4 = x.

However, this doesn't seem right, since if x = 4, then the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - 4 = 13, and the total number of orange fish he has is 3 + 13 = 16. The total number of white fish he has is 4 + 4 = 8, which doesn't satisfy the condition that he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's try another approach. We know that the total number of fish Bob has is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (new fish) = 24. We also know that the total number of white fish he has is x + 4, and the total number of orange fish he has is 2(x + 4).

Since the total number of fish is 24, we can set up the equation: x + 4 + 2(x + 4) = 24.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 4 + 2x + 8 = 24.
Combine like terms: 3x + 12 = 24.
Subtract 12 from both sides: 3x = 12.
Divide both sides by 3: x = 4.

So, we can set up the equation: 3 + (17 - x) = 2(x + 4).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3 + 17 - x = 2x + 8.
Combine like terms: 20 - x = 2x + 8.
Add x to both sides: 20 = 3x + 8.
Subtract 8 from both sides: 12 = 3x.

"To figure out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total distance Andy drives in a week. He drives to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days a week. The distance between his home and office is 5 miles one way, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day. Multiply that by 5 days, and he drives a total of 10 miles/day x 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we need to find out how much gas his car uses in a week. His car gets 10 miles per gallon (MPG), so we divide the total distance by the MPG: 50 miles/week ÷ 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we multiply the amount of gas his car uses in a week by the price of gas, which is $3 per gallon: 5 gallons/week x $3/gallon = $15/week.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Since Carrie spent all 140 quarters and each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Carrie spent 3/5 of the 10 twenties. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3 and then divide by 5:
(10 * 3) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6

Since each twenty is worth $20, we multiply the number of twenties spent by the value of each twenty:
6 * $20 = $120

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount spent:
$35 + $120 = $155

"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his garden, we need to calculate the yield from both tomato and eggplant plants.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes. Since each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes and Ricardo has 5 plants, we multiply the number of plants by the yield per plant: 22 tomatoes/plant * 5 plants = 110 tomatoes.

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants. Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and Ricardo has 8 plants, so we multiply the number of plants by the yield per plant: 4 eggplants/plant * 8 plants = 32 eggplants.

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits: 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

Since one-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs, we multiply 40 by 1/4. This is the same as dividing 40 by 4, which equals 10. So, 10 smart TVs were sold.

Next, we calculate the number of analog TVs sold. Since one-eighth of the total sales are analog TVs, we multiply 40 by 1/8. This is the same as dividing 40 by 8, which equals 5. So, 5 analog TVs were sold.

Now, we add the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold: 10 + 5 = 15. This means that 15 out of the 40 TVs sold were either smart TVs or analog TVs.

To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to calculate the total amount he needs to pay for the trip and subtract the amount he already has, along with the amount the school is covering.

The school is covering half the cost of the trip, which is $300. So, the school's contribution is $300 / 2 = $150.

Now, let's subtract the school's contribution and the money John already has from the total cost of the trip:

$300 (total cost) - $150 (school's contribution) = $150
$150 - $50 (John's money) = $100

So, John is missing $100."
"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to find the nighttime temperature. We know it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, so we subtract 33 from the daytime temperature of 45 degrees.

Nighttime temperature = 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, we need to find out how many degrees the temperature needs to rise to reach 32 degrees.

Temperature rise needed = 32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed, we divide the temperature rise needed by the heat provided by each log.

Number of logs needed = 20 / 5 = 4

"To find the total number of seashells, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of groups. Since there are 90 people and each group has 9 people, we can divide 90 by 9 to get the number of groups:

90 ÷ 9 = 10 groups

Next, we know that 3/5 of the groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. To find the number of groups that brought seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

10 * 3/5 = 6 groups

Since each group has 9 members, the total number of people who brought seashells is:

6 groups * 9 people per group = 54 people

Finally, since each of these people brought 2 seashells, we multiply the number of people who brought seashells by 2:

54 people * 2 seashells per person = 108 seashells

"To find the number of people on the train, we need to calculate the changes in the number of passengers at each stop.

First, we start with 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172. This leaves us with 172 - 47 = 125 people. Then, 13 more people get on, so we add 13 to 125, which gives us 125 + 13 = 138 people.

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138. This gives us 138 - 38 = 100 people.

The number of people on the train is 100."
"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to calculate the total number of bottle caps he finds and multiply it by the value of each bottle cap.

First, let's find the total number of bottle caps Damien finds in a month. Since he finds 10 bottle caps a day, we multiply this by the number of days in the month:
10 bottle caps/day * 30 days = 300 bottle caps

Now, we know that each bottle cap is worth $0.25. To find the total amount of money Damien makes, we multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap:
300 bottle caps * $0.25/bottle cap = $75

"To find out how much Jamie was paid, we need to break down her work hours and pay rate. She earns $20 per hour for the first 8 hours of work. For any hours worked beyond that, she gets paid 150% of her regular rate, which is $20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour.

Last Tuesday, Jamie worked 11 hours. So, we'll calculate her pay for the first 8 hours and the extra 3 hours separately. 

For the first 8 hours, she earns $20 per hour, so that's 8 * $20 = $160. For the extra 3 hours, she earns $30 per hour, so that's 3 * $30 = $90.

Now, we add both amounts together to get her total pay: $160 + $90 = $250.

"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. 

First, we know there are 12 female lions. The problem states there are half as many male lions as female lions. So, to find the number of male lions, we divide the number of female lions by 2. This gives us 12 / 2 = 6 male lions.

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. We have 12 female lions, 6 male lions, and 14 lion cubs. Adding these together, we get 12 + 6 + 14 = 32.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they're on sale for 25% off. 

First, we need to find 25% of $40. To do this, we multiply $40 by 0.25 (since 25% is the same as 0.25). 
$40 * 0.25 = $10

Now that we know the discount is $10, we subtract it from the original price to get the sale price.
$40 - $10 = $30

So, the jeans cost $30. Mike pays with a $50 bill, so to find out how much money he'll have left over, we subtract the cost of the jeans from the $50 bill.
$50 - $30 = $20

"To find the total amount of money the company pays its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and their total salary.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 more each month. After three months, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 260.

Each employee makes $4000 per month. To find the total amount the company pays in one month, we multiply the number of employees by their monthly salary: 260 * 4000 = $1,040,000.

Since we want to know the total amount paid after three months, we multiply the monthly total by 3: $1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000.

The final answer is: 3120000"
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the time for each song and add them together.

First, we'll find the total time for ""Deck the Halls"". Since it's 150 seconds long and will be sung twice, we multiply 150 by 2, which equals 300 seconds.

Next, we add the time for ""Jingle Bells"", which is 240 seconds.

Now, we add the time for both songs together: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The total time the choir will be caroling is 540 seconds."
"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work.

First, let's calculate Billy's current salary. He started at $10 per hour, got a $0.50 raise after 2 months, and then another $1.00 raise on his first anniversary. So, his current salary is $10 + $0.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, which is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work:

Billy's earnings: 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's earnings: 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the cost of each and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread. Since each loaf costs $2, we multiply the number of loaves by the cost per loaf: 3 * $2 = $6.

Next, we calculate the cost of 2 bagels. Since each bagel costs $1, we multiply the number of bagels by the cost per bagel: 2 * $1 = $2.

Now, we find the difference in cost by subtracting the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

"To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we need to calculate Nikita's score first. Since Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson, we'll start by finding half of Pierson's score. Pierson scored 278 points, so half of that is 278 / 2 = 139. Now, we add 11 to that result to find Nikita's score: 139 + 11 = 150.

Now that we know Nikita's score, we can find the total points by adding Pierson's and Nikita's scores: 278 + 150 = 428.

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by students and teachers separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is 25 * 40 = 1000. Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Next, let's find the total number of trees planted by teachers. There are 3 teachers per class, and there are 40 classes. So, the total number of teachers is 3 * 40 = 120. Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Now, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to find the total number of trees planted. 1000 (by students) + 240 (by teachers) = 1240.

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to first calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 
Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all of her stuffed animals, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is x. 
The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To figure out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she's already played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

First, let's calculate the hours she played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. She played half an hour every day, so that's 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours she played in the next week. She played 2 hours every day for 7 days, so that's 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Now, we add the hours she played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

The achievement requires 30 hours of playtime. To find out how many hours she still needs to play, we subtract the hours she's already played from the total hours required: 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate how far each car will travel in that time. 

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it will travel in 2 hours, we multiply its speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. To find the distance it will travel in 2 hours, we multiply its speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since the second car is ahead of the first car, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them: 
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to calculate the total cost of the diamond and gold, then add the premium he paid for it to be made.

The diamond cost $600 and the gold cost $300, so the total cost is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3. This gives us $900 * 0.3 = $270.

Now, we add the premium to the total cost to find the final amount James paid: $900 + $270 = $1170.

"To find the overall pass rate of Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's look at the number of students who passed in each grade. 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, and 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed. 

The fifth-graders had a pass rate that was twice the fourth graders' pass rate. Since the fourth graders' pass rate is 40%, the fifth graders' pass rate is 2 * 40% = 80%. This means 80% of the 400 fifth graders passed, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320 students.

Now, let's add up the total number of students who passed: 340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 320 (fifth graders) = 700 students.

The total number of students is 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000 students.

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of students who passed (700) by the total number of students (1000), which gives us 700/1000 = 0.7. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.7 * 100 = 70%.

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to calculate the total number of square inches he can cover with the glass chips he has. 

Since each bag of glass chips holds 72 chips and Milo has 2 bags, he has a total of 2 x 72 = 144 chips. 

It takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, so we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total square inches: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Now, we know that Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find the length, we can divide the total square inches by the height: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed and add it to the remaining amount.

First, let's find out how much tea the students drank. Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so we multiply 4 by 1.5 to get 6 quarts. Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so we multiply 16 by 2 to get 32 quarts. 

Now, we add the amount of tea the two groups of students drank: 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left, so we add this to the amount of tea consumed: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Since the question asks for the amount of tea in gallons, we need to convert quarts to gallons. There are 4 quarts in a gallon, so we divide 48 by 4 to get 12 gallons.

"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Dale initially ordered 100 candies, but he ended up selling 150. Since he didn't have enough candies to fulfill the orders, he must have ordered more. He ordered 100 more candies. So, the total number of candies he has is the sum of his initial order and the additional order: 100 + 100 = 200.

However, we know that he sold 150 candies before ordering more. This means that he must have been short 50 candies (150 - 100 = 50) when he made the additional order. The additional order of 100 candies would cover this shortage and leave him with some extra candies.

Now, let's calculate how many candies he still needs to sell. We know that he has 200 candies in total and he has already sold 150. To find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies: 200 - 150 = 50.

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed. We know that he charges $0.25 per branch and made a total of $105 during the week.

Let's divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25) to find the total number of branches climbed.

Total branches climbed = Total amount made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by 7.

Average branches climbed per day = Total branches climbed / 7
Average branches climbed per day = 420 / 7
Average branches climbed per day = 60

"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each type of flower and then subtract the petals from the dropped flowers.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each type of flower. Rose picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 petals. She also picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each, which is 4 * 6 = 24 petals. Then, she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each, which is 5 * 4 = 20 petals. Lastly, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each, which is 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

However, Rose dropped 1 flower of each type, so we need to subtract the petals from the dropped flowers. The dropped flowers had 5, 6, 4, and 7 petals, for a total of 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals.

To find the total number of petals in the vase, we subtract the dropped petals from the total: 101 - 22 = 79 petals.

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped.

First, let's add the number of S'mores John and DeSean made. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, this will give us the total number of marshmallows used. John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

In addition to the marshmallows used, they also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21.

Now, let's subtract the total marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows in the bag. The bag had 35 marshmallows initially. 

Marshmallows left = 35 (initial) - 21 (used and dropped) = 14

Since there are 2 kids, we'll divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have.

S'mores per kid = 14 / 2 = 7

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate how many quarters each person uses. 

First, let's figure out how many quarters Jack uses. He can play for 20 minutes per quarter, and they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. To find out how many quarters he uses, we divide 240 minutes by 20 minutes per quarter. This gives us 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Now, let's look at his two friends who are worse at the game. They can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They also play for 240 minutes, so we divide 240 by 10 to find out how many quarters they use each. This gives us 240 / 10 = 24 quarters per friend. Since there are two of them, we multiply 24 by 2 to get 48 quarters.

The last friend is better at the game and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack. This means he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He also plays for 240 minutes, so we divide 240 by 30 to find out how many quarters he uses. This gives us 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Now, we add up all the quarters used: 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply 68 by $0.25 to find the total amount of money used. This gives us 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"To find out how many ounces of oil Tanya uses, we need to break down the information given. We know that she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. We also know that she uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's say the amount of zest is x. Then the amount of fragrance is also x, the amount of salt is 2x, the amount of sugar is 2x, and the amount of oil is 4x (twice the amount of salt).

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can set up an equation:

x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10

Combine like terms:
10x = 10

Divide both sides by 10:
x = 1

Now, we know the amount of oil is 4x, so:
4 * 1 = 4

The amount of oil Tanya uses is 4 ounces.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, we can find the number of cars Joe has by multiplying Robert's cars by 2. So, Joe has 2 x 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2. This gives us 40 x 0.2 = 8 cars sold.

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. This means he gives away 2 x 8 = 16 cars.

Now, let's find out how many cars Joe has left. We subtract the number of cars he sold (8) and the number of cars he gave away (16) from his initial number of cars (40). So, 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

Joe has 16 cars left."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. This will give us the total amount raised by the students.

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Amount raised by students = $125,000

Now, we know that there are 20 students and each earns the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we can divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students.

Since we need to find the total time in minutes, we'll convert the hours to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break, we need to calculate the number of cars that remained in the parking lot.

Hunter initially counted 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars were added, making the total number of cars 50 + 20 = 70.

Since half of the cars left during lunch break, we need to find half of 70. To do this, we can divide 70 by 2, which gives us 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To figure out how much John makes in a week, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, let's calculate how much he makes per cycle. Since each cycle has 5 tasks and each task pays $1.20, we multiply the number of tasks by the pay per task:
5 tasks * $1.20 per task = $6 per cycle

Next, we need to find out how much he makes in a day. We know he does 30 cycles a day, so we multiply the amount he makes per cycle by the number of cycles:
$6 per cycle * 30 cycles = $180 per day

Finally, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
$180 per day * 7 days = $1260

"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

Now, let's look at the second game. Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add Sasha's points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

"To find out how many more tins of cat food Kimberly bought than dog food, we need to calculate the total number of tins of each type of food. 

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food. Since each package contains 11 tins and Kimberly bought 8 packages, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food. Each package contains 6 tins, and Kimberly bought 6 packages, so we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 88 - 36 = 52.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"To find out how many cards Becca has, we need to use the information given in the problem. Let's start by saying PJ has x cards. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341. So, we can set up an equation using the information we have:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

And the number of cards Becca has:
Becca has 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards

Becca has 153 cards."
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs.

First, we know she had 5 green eggs. Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, we multiply the number of green eggs by 2 to get the number of blue eggs: 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.

Next, we know she had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so we subtract 1 from the number of blue eggs: 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Finally, we know she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so we divide the number of pink eggs by 3: 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color to find the total number of eggs:
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"To figure out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book back and the amount she'll get refunded.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The company charges $0.35 per pound, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so that's 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. They also charge $0.08 per mile, and the distribution center is 20 miles away, so that's 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. Adding those together, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, let's calculate the refund amount. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which was $32. To find 75% of $32, we multiply $32 by 0.75, which gives us $24.00.

Now, let's calculate the total loss. We subtract the refund amount from the book's cost and add the shipping cost. So, the total loss is $32 - $24.00 + $3.00 = $11.00.

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she had initially and then subtract the total amount she spent.

First, let's add the money Mulan had to the money her father gave her: $40 + $100 = $140.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the items she bought. Two pairs of jeans at $30 each will be 2 x $30 = $60. Adding the $20 bag, the total cost is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the total amount she spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and subtract that from the total monthly production.

Boris produces 8,000 bars in the first week. In the second week, he produces half as much, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

So, the total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the monthly production to find the production for the fourth week: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then add them up.

First, let's look at the time she spends recording videos. She records 18 videos a week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, she spends 18 * 4 = 72 minutes a week recording videos. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 72 * 4 = 288 minutes a month recording videos.

Next, let's look at the time she spends writing songs. She spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes a week. In a month, she spends 120 * 4 = 480 minutes writing songs.

Finally, let's look at the time she spends on makeup. She spends 15 minutes a day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. So, she spends 15 * 6 = 90 minutes a week on makeup. In a month, she spends 90 * 4 = 360 minutes on makeup.

Now, let's add up the time she spends on each activity: 288 + 480 + 360 = 1128 minutes.

"To find the total cost of the installation, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial installation cost and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation cost is $129.00, which includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.

Now, let's calculate the number of additional items Angela needs installed. She has 6 mirrors, but the initial installation only includes 4, so she needs 2 more mirrors installed. She also has 2 chandeliers, but the initial installation only includes 1, so she needs 1 more chandelier installed. Lastly, she has 20 pictures, but the initial installation only includes 10, so she needs 10 more pictures installed.

The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost of the additional items is 2 mirrors * $15.00 + 1 chandelier * $15.00 + 10 pictures * $15.00 = $15.00 * 13 = $195.00.

Now, let's add the initial installation cost and the cost of the additional items to find the total cost. $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to start with Eva's savings, which is $20. Since Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, we add $10 to Eva's savings to get Anthony's savings: $20 + $10 = $30.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30 by 0.4. This is the same as finding 40% of $30, which is 40/100 * $30 = $12. Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we add $12 to Anthony's savings: $30 + $12 = $42.

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to start with Pompei, who can lift a mountain 1 inch. Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, Saskay's limit is 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami's limit is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto's limit is 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To find the total distance Mason traveled, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours and the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours, then add them together.

We know that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. Since Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour, we can multiply this by the time he traveled.

Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the two distances together to find the total distance traveled.
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway. Since they're traveling at the same speed, we can find the time it would take one kangaroo by multiplying the total time by the number of kangaroos. So, one kangaroo would take 18 * 3 = 54 hours to cross the highway.

Now, we're told that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that a turtle would take twice as long as a kangaroo to cross the highway. Since one kangaroo takes 54 hours, one turtle would take 54 * 2 = 108 hours.

The question asks about four turtles, but since they're traveling at the same speed, the time it would take them to cross the highway would be the same as the time it would take one turtle. Therefore, it would take the four turtles 108 hours to cross the highway.

"To find the total number of clay dishes made, we need to determine the number of dishes each person created. We know Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, we can calculate Rory's total by adding 20 to Kora's total: 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Next, we know Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory. To find Jada's total, we multiply Rory's total by 2: 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we add the number of dishes each person made to find the total number of dishes: 
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to figure out the total amount she has and subtract the amount she got from other sources.

The laptop costs $600, but she gets a $200 discount for trading in her old laptop, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika got $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so that's a total of $150 + $80 = $230.

Since she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, that means she already has $400 - $50 = $350.

Now, let's subtract the amount she got from her job and her mom from the total amount she has: $350 - $230 = $120.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices Adam had initially and subtract the slices he ate.

First, let's calculate the number of slices from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, 3 large apples will give us 3 * 5 = 15 slices.

Next, we calculate the number of slices from the small apples. Since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, 5 small apples will give us 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices initially. This is 15 (large) + 15 (small) = 30 slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the slices eaten from the total number of slices initially. This gives us 30 - 15 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

First, let's calculate how much milk the farmer's current cows produce. He has 3 cows, and each cow gives 5 liters of milk per day. So, the total milk from his current cows is 3 * 5 = 15 liters.

Now, we need to find out how many more liters of milk the farmer needs to reach his goal of 25 liters per day. To do this, we subtract the current milk production from the desired milk production: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we can divide the additional milk needed by the amount each cow produces to find out how many more cows are needed: 10 / 5 = 2.

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each glue stick that is used and then subtract that from the total length of all three glue sticks.

First, let's find the length of each glue stick that is used. The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so 5/6 of it is used. Since the original length is 12 mm, the used length is 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so 1/3 of it is used. The used length is 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so 1/2 of it is used. The used length is 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add up the lengths of the glue sticks that are used: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

"To find the total number of socks and dishes Peter and Jack have together, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know Jack collected 60 dishes. Since he collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks he has by dividing the number of dishes by 2. So, Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Now, we know Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. This means Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

We also know Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of socks and dishes they have:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90

"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. To find three-quarters of $300, we multiply $300 by 3/4. 

$300 * 3/4 = $300 * 0.75 = $225.

This means Brenda earns $225 in interest each year. Since it's simple interest, the interest earned each year will be the same. 

Total interest earned in 3 years = $225 * 3 = $675.

Now, we add the total interest earned to the original amount to find the total amount after 3 years.

Total amount after 3 years = Original amount + Total interest earned

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. We know that half of the white shirts have collars, so the other half have no collars. Since there are 40 white shirts, half of that is 40 / 2 = 20. So, there are 20 white shirts with collars and 20 white shirts with no collars.

Next, let's find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons, so to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract 20 from the total number of floral shirts. There are 50 floral shirts, so 50 - 20 = 30. Therefore, there are 30 floral shirts with no buttons.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. To do this, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons. 30 - 20 = 10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that I am three years younger than my brother, so if my brother's age is B, then my age is B - 3.

We also know that I am 2 years older than my sister, so if my sister's age is S, then my age is S + 2. Since both of these expressions equal my age, we can set them equal to each other:
B - 3 = S + 2

We can also rewrite this as:
S = B - 5

Now, we know that my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so if my mom's age is M, then:
M = 3B - 1

When we add all our ages, we get 87, so:
B + (B - 3) + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
5B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:
5B = 96

Divide by 5:
B = 19.2

Since B must be a whole number, we'll try both 19 and 20 to see which one works.

If B = 19, then my age is 16, my sister's age is 14, and my mom's age is 56. But 19 + 16 + 14 + 56 = 105, which is not 87.

If B = 20, then my age is 17, my sister's age is 15, and my mom's age is 59.

"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students in his class and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks per student: 27 * 2 = 54 glue sticks.

The glue sticks come in packs of 8, so we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 ÷ 8 = 6.75. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks.

Rounding up 6.75 to the nearest whole number gives us 7. Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To find the total amount of water passing through the river, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that the initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. So, we multiply the initial amount by 2 to get the new amount: 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons.

Now, we're told that on the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. To find the total amount of water passing through the river, we add this increase to the amount we calculated earlier: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

"To find the total number of people infected after three days, we need to break it down day by day.

On the first day, 10 people are already infected. Each of these 10 people infects 6 others, so that's 10 * 6 = 60 new infections. Adding these to the original 10, we get 70 people infected after the first day.

On the second day, those 70 people infect 6 others each. So, that's 70 * 6 = 420 new infections. Adding these to the 70 already infected, we get 490 people infected after the second day.

On the third day, those 490 people infect 6 others each. That's 490 * 6 = 2940 new infections. Adding these to the 490 already infected, we get a total of 3430 people infected after three days.

"To find out how much money Rafaela received in tips, we need to multiply the number of customers by the tip amount. Since each of the 40 customers gave Rafaela a $20 tip, we can calculate it as follows:

40 customers * $20 per customer = $800

Now, let's find out how much Julieta received. We know that Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To calculate 10% of $800, we multiply $800 by 0.1.

$800 * 0.1 = $80

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract $80 from $800.

$800 - $80 = $720

So, Julieta received $720 in tips. To find the total amount of money they both received, we add their individual amounts.

$800 (Rafaela) + $720 (Julieta) = $1520

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer has left, we need to calculate the total number of oranges she gave to her children and subtract that from the total number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges. She has 3 daughters, and each of them got 2 oranges, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. Her only boy got 3 oranges. 

So, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 (for the daughters) + 3 (for the boy) = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the total oranges given to her children from the total oranges she bought: 12 - 9 = 3.

Jennifer has 3 oranges left."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many badges each girl earns in a year. Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in 12 months, she earns 12 badges.

Since Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, she earns 1 badge every 2 months. To find out how many badges Amber earns in a year, we divide 12 months by 2, which gives us 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, we multiply the number of badges Claire earns in a year (12) by 3, which gives us 36 badges.

Now, let's find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year. We subtract the number of badges Amber earns (6) from the number of badges Wendy earns (36), which gives us 30.

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she sold and multiply it by the price per slice.

First, let's figure out how many loaves Paige baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked a total of 5 * 2 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to figure out how many silver coins she had. We know there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and she had 70 gold coins. 

So, if we subtract 30 from the number of gold coins, we can find the number of silver coins. That's 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.

Now, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins to find the total. That's 70 gold coins + 40 silver coins = 110 coins.

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to calculate the total number of burritos eaten and subtract that from the total number of burritos ordered.

First, let's find out how many burritos the students ate. There were 50 students, and each student got 10 burritos, so the total number of burritos eaten by students is 50 * 10 = 500. Mr. George also ate 20 burritos, so the total number of burritos eaten is 500 + 20 = 520.

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos. The total number of burritos ordered was 600, so the number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to figure out how many of the other colored cars there are. We know there are 12 red cars. Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, we subtract 2 from 12 to get 10 green cars.

Next, we're told there are 3 times as many blue cars as green cars. So, we multiply 10 (the number of green cars) by 3 to get 30 blue cars.

Now, let's add up the number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52 cars.

We're given that the total number of cars is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of other colored cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. 

Let's say Anne has A books. Then, Sofie has A + 25 books, and Fawn has A + 12 books. 

We also know that the total number of books they have together is 85. So, we can set up the equation:
A + (A + 25) + (A + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:
3A + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:
3A = 48

Divide by 3:
A = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find out how many books Fawn has. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, Fawn has:
16 + 12 = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, we multiply the weight of the potatoes (5 pounds) by 2. This gives us 5 * 2 = 10 pounds for the sweet potatoes.

Next, we know the carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds.

"To figure out how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups he needs and then determine how many boxes of jello he needs to buy.

First, we need to find out the total number of jello cups needed. Since each kid will get 4 jello cups and there are 30 kids, we multiply the number of kids by the number of jello cups per kid:
30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs to buy. Since one box of jello makes 10 jello cups, we divide the total number of jello cups needed by the number of jello cups per box:
120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Finally, we need to find out the total cost. Since the cost of jello is $1.25 per box, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:
12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

"To find the change, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones and subtract it from the amount given by the buyer.

First, let's find the total cost of the phones. The seller bought 5 phones for $700 each, so we multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 5 x $700 = $3500.

The buyer gave the seller $4000 in dollar bills. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given: $4000 - $3500 = $500.

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first figure out how much he spends per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

The total cost of groceries is $400 per month. To find 40% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.4.

$400 * 0.4 = $160

So, Keenan spends $160 per month. Since we want to know how much he spends per week, we divide $160 by the number of weeks in a month, which is 4.

$160 / 4 = $40

"To find out how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to break down the information given.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we multiply 2/5 by 60. To do this, we multiply 2 by 60 and then divide by 5. This gives us (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. Now, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. We subtract the pieces he ate on the first two days from the total: 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To find out how many pieces this is, we multiply 7/13 by 26. This gives us (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, we add the pieces he ate each day: 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.

"To find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to calculate the cost of each item first.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so to find the cost of one bottle, we divide $21.00 by 7. This gives us $3.00 per bottle of soda. 

Now, we multiply the cost of one bottle of soda by 3 to find the total cost of 3 bottles: $3.00 * 3 = $9.00.

Next, we find the cost of one bottle of water by dividing the cost of 4 bottles ($8.00) by 4. This gives us $2.00 per bottle of water.

Then, we multiply the cost of one bottle of water by 2 to find the total cost of 2 bottles: $2.00 * 2 = $4.00.

Finally, we add the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water to find the overall cost: $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

First, Paul starts with 52 marbles. His friend gives him 28 more, so we add those to the initial amount: 
52 + 28 = 80 marbles

Next, Paul loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we can divide 80 by 4:
80 ÷ 4 = 20

So, Paul loses 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from 80:
80 - 20 = 60

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she scores in each type of question and then add them up.

First, let's look at the multiple-choice questions. There are 10 questions, and Amy answers 80% of them correctly. To find 80% of 10, we multiply 10 by 0.8, which gives us 8. Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, Amy scores 8 points.

Next, let's look at the true/false questions. There are 20 questions, and Amy answers 90% of them correctly. To find 90% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.9, which gives us 18. Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, Amy scores 18 points.

Finally, let's look at the long-answer questions. There are 5 questions, and Amy answers 60% of them correctly. To find 60% of 5, we multiply 5 by 0.6, which gives us 3. Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, Amy scores 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, let's add up the points: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

"To find out how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to figure out how many chickens he's selling and how much he'll make from selling them.

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. To find out how many chickens that is, we multiply 300 by 3/5. 
3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

He's selling each chicken for $50, so to find the total amount he'll make, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken. 
180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

We know he wants to make a profit of $2000, so to find the cost price, we subtract the profit from the total amount he'll make. 
$9000 - $2000 = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

$7000"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many glasses Micah sold, and then compare that to the number of glasses Julie sold.

We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses of lemonade. We also know that Julie sold 14 glasses. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Julie's glasses + Micah's glasses + Mitchell's glasses = Total glasses
14 + Micah's glasses + Micah's glasses = 32

Combine like terms:
14 + 2(Micah's glasses) = 32

Subtract 14 from both sides:
2(Micah's glasses) = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
Micah's glasses = 9

Now that we know Micah sold 9 glasses, we can find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Difference = 14 - 9 = 5

"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure.

First, let's find the cost of the manicure. Since Iris spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, we multiply the cost of her hair by 1/4. 

Cost of hair: $400
Cost of manicure: $400 * 1/4 = $400 * 0.25 = $100

Next, we find the cost of the pedicure. Iris spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure. We multiply the cost of the manicure by 3/4.

Cost of pedicure: $100 * 3/4 = $100 * 0.75 = $75

Now, we add the cost of the hair, manicure, and pedicure to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the profit she makes from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah gets from selling the rope. Since the rope is 20 meters long and is sold for $2 per meter, we multiply the length by the price per meter: 20 * $2 = $40.

Next, we need to find the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and since Sarah is buying a new rope of the same length (20 meters), we multiply the length by the price per meter: 20 * $1.5 = $30.

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount of money Sarah got from selling the rope: $40 - $30 = $10.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, she'll be 18 years old. So, we subtract 10 from 18 to get her current age.

Melanie's current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

To find out in how many years she'll be 24, we subtract her current age from 24.

Number of years = 24 - 8 = 16 years

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item. Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. To find the cost of one pack of bacon, we divide $10 by 5, which is $2. 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the chicken. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so it's $2 * 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost is $4 * 6 = $24.

Next, we have the strawberries. Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4. So, the total cost is $4 * 3 = $12.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60

Kelly's budget is $65, so she has $65 - $60 = $5 left.

"To find the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to work backwards from the total runtime of the final concert. The final concert was 65 minutes long, and it included a 15-minute encore. So, the actual concert part was 65 - 15 = 50 minutes long.

Since the final concert was twice as long as her usual concerts, we can divide the concert part of the final show by 2 to find the length of her usual concerts. 

50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had initially.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys Argo gave away. He gave 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. So, the total number of toys he gave away is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150.

Now, let's subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had initially. Argo had 200 toys initially, so we subtract 150 from 200:
200 - 150 = 50

Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to determine how many microphones were left after 20% of them couldn't fit. 

20% of 50 microphones is 0.2 * 50 = 10 microphones that couldn't fit. 

Now, we subtract these from the total number of microphones to find the number of microphones that were arranged in pairs. 

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Since the microphones are arranged in pairs, we divide the number of remaining microphones by 2.

40 / 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to calculate the number of birds in each category and add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. Then, he sees 2/3 of that number flying overhead. To find 2/3 of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and divide by 3. This gives us (6 * 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4 birds flying overhead.

Next, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group: 3 * 8 = 24.

Now, let's add the number of birds in each category:
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine the number of cookies Lani had left after eating 5. We can do this by subtracting the number of cookies she ate from the total number of cookies she baked.

Total cookies = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies eaten = 55 - 5 = 50

Now that we know Lani had 50 cookies left, we can divide this number by the number of jars to find out how many cookies were in each jar.

Number of jars = 5
Cookies in each jar = Remaining cookies / Number of jars = 50 / 5 = 10

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower. 

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids. Since there are 5 orchids and each orchid has 5 petals, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 * 5 = 25 petals.

Next, we calculate the total number of petals for the daisies. There are 4 daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals, so we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 * 10 = 40 petals.

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids. To do this, we subtract the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the daisies: 40 - 25 = 15.

"To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants. So, the number of indoor plants is 1/4 * 100 = 25.

Now, we subtract the indoor plants from the total to find the remaining plants: 100 - 25 = 75.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. To find the number of outdoor plants, we multiply 2/3 by 75, which is 50.

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants. So, we subtract the outdoor plants from the remaining plants: 75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to start by figuring out the speed of the thingamabob. We know that the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second.

Let's use a variable to represent the speed of the thingamabob. If the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob, so we can multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to break down the information given. Ellen buys a salad for $6 and a yogurt for half that price, which is $3. So, the salad and yogurt together cost $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays a total of $11 for her daily food, the remaining amount after buying the salad and yogurt must be spent on the two carrots. This means the two carrots cost $11 - $9 = $2.

Now, to find the cost of one carrot, we divide the total cost of the carrots by 2. So, $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's new hourly wage is $10 (his old wage) + $2 (the raise) = $12 per hour.

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we multiply the hours he works in a day by the number of days he works in a week: 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: 40 hours/week * $12/hour = $480/week.

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to calculate how much she made from mowing lawns. We know that she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, and Joe paid her $6. This means she mowed Kamala's lawn three times, so she made 3 * $6 = $18 from Kamala.

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once for $6, she mowed Alba's lawn five times, making 5 * $6 = $30 from Alba.

Now, let's add up the money she made from mowing lawns: $6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) + $30 (Alba) = $54.

Since Tasha made a total of $80 last month, we subtract the money she made from mowing lawns from the total to find out how much she made from lemonade sales: $80 - $54 = $26.

"To find Harry's weight, we need to start with Martin's weight, which is 55 kg. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's, so we add 16 to 55 to get Carl's weight.

Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg

Next, Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's, so we add 8 to 71 to get Christian's weight.

Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg

Finally, Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's, so we subtract 5 from 79 to get Harry's weight.

Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg

"To find the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we need to calculate how far Anis rowed. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can find this by multiplying Dijana's distance by 1/5.

Dijana rowed 50 miles, so 1/5 of 50 miles is 50 * 1/5 = 10 miles. This means Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. To find Anis' total distance, we add 10 miles to Dijana's distance: 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, we add the distance rowed by Dijana and Anis to get the total distance. 
Total distance = 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many bowls of soup Calvin's family will eat for dinner, and then subtract that from the total amount of soup available.

The pot of soup can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will eat 2 adult bowls. Their 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. 

Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, we can convert the 2 adult bowls eaten by Calvin and his wife into child bowls. So, 2 adult bowls is equal to 2 x 2 = 4 child bowls. 

Now, we add the child bowls eaten by the kids, which is 2. So, the total number of child bowls eaten is 4 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

The pot can fill 8 child bowls, and 6 child bowls were eaten. To find the leftover soup, we subtract the number of child bowls eaten from the total: 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, we divide the leftover soup (2 child bowls) by the number of children (2) to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch: 2 / 2 = 1.

"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material needed for the small masks and the large masks separately.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks. Since Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, we can find the material needed per small mask by dividing 2 yards by 4 masks. This gives us 0.5 yards per small mask. To make 20 small masks, we multiply 0.5 yards per mask by 20 masks, which equals 10 yards.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks. Since Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material, we can find the material needed per large mask by dividing 2.25 yards by 3 masks. This gives us 0.75 yards per large mask. To make 8 large masks, we multiply 0.75 yards per mask by 8 masks, which equals 6 yards.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given and set up an equation. 

Let's start by identifying the information we have: Duncan is 60 years old now, and eight years ago, his age was two times Adam's age four years ago.

We can represent Duncan's age eight years ago as 60 - 8 = 52. 

Now, we know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. If we let Adam's current age be A, then Adam's age four years ago would be A - 4. 

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can set up the equation:

52 = 2(A - 4)

To solve for A, we need to simplify the equation. First, we can distribute the 2 to the terms inside the parentheses:

52 = 2A - 8

Next, we can add 8 to both sides of the equation to get:

60 = 2A

Finally, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for A:

A = 30

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the number of packages he completes in a day and multiply it by the amount he earns per package.

First, let's figure out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. It's given that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we subtract 10 from 50, which gives us 40 packages per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many packages he completes in 8 hours. To do this, we multiply the number of packages he completes in an hour (40) by the number of hours he works in a day (8). This gives us 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since Colby earns $0.20 per package, we multiply the total number of packages he completes in a day (320) by the amount he earns per package ($0.20). This gives us 320 * 0.20 = $64.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons and a total of 58 pieces of bologna thrown.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons. Since there were 20 red balloons and 2 pieces of bologna were thrown at each one, we multiply 20 by 2 to get 40.

Now, we know that 40 pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons, so we subtract 40 from the total number of pieces of bologna thrown (58) to find out how many were thrown at the yellow balloons. 58 - 40 = 18.

Since 3 pieces of bologna were thrown at each yellow balloon, we divide 18 by 3 to find the number of yellow balloons. 18 / 3 = 6.

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items they bought. The cake costs $11. Since 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons, and 2 balloons cost $0.5, we can calculate the cost of 1 dozen balloons as follows: 12 / 2 * $0.5 = $3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2.

$28 / 2 = $14

"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and then add them together.

First, we know there are 6 students playing tennis. Since twice that number are playing volleyball, we multiply 6 by 2 to get 12 students playing volleyball.

Next, we're given the number of boys and girls playing soccer, which is 16 and 22, respectively. To find the total number of students playing soccer, we simply add these two numbers together: 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we add the number of students in each group: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

"To find out how much money the class was able to raise, we need to calculate the total profit from selling the lollipops. 

First, we calculate the total number of lollipops sold. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is 30 * 10 = 300.

Next, we calculate the total revenue, which is the total amount of money the students made from selling the lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.8, the total revenue is 300 * $0.8 = $240.

Then, we calculate the total cost, which is the total amount of money the students spent on buying the lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.5, the total cost is 300 * $0.5 = $150.

Finally, we calculate the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. The total profit is $240 - $150 = $90.

"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet.

First, Larry has 3 cats. Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Larry also has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. This means he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

Lastly, he has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of pet:
3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat in a day. 

Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day. 

Together, they eat 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices a day.

Now, we can divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the number of slices they can eat in a day (6) to find out how many days the loaf will last.

24 / 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find the total number of shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

Since Martha collects 1 shell per month, we can multiply the number of years she's been collecting shells by 12 (the number of months in a year). 

Martha has been collecting shells for 5 years (from 5 years old to 10 years old). 
5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects 1 shell per month, she will have collected a total of 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we need to first figure out how many cups Lana used for chamomile and mint tea. We know she started with 27 cups and used 15 cups for cinnamon tea. So, the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12 cups.

Since Lana divided the cups into 3 rows, we can divide the 12 cups by 3 to find out how many cups of chamomile and mint tea are in each row. 12 / 3 = 4 cups.

Now, we know that in each row, there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. So, to find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we can divide the 4 cups by 2. 4 / 2 = 2 cups.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours and then divide the total number of berries he wants to collect by the number of trips.

Since each trip takes 4 hours, we can find the number of trips by dividing the total time (8 hours) by the time per trip (4 hours). 

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Now that we know the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, we can find the number of berries he needs to collect per trip by dividing the total number of berries (24) by the number of trips (2).

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to first determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find the total amount of water emptied in 6 days, we multiply the rate by the number of days: 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

Now, we subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

"To figure out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he's already spent. 

He's seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, which cost $10 each. So, that's 5 x $10 = $50. He's also seen 8 movies on other days, which cost $7 each. That's 8 x $7 = $56. 

He's had 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each, so that's 2 x $8 = $16. And he's had 4 boxes of candy at $2 each, so that's 4 x $2 = $8.

Adding all that up, he's spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

Since his parents give him $150 a month, he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Tonight, he wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy, which will cost him $8 + $2 = $10. That leaves him with $20 - $10 = $10.

Since it's a Friday, the movie ticket costs $10, which is exactly what he has left. So, he can see 1 more movie.

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the calories in a mini cinnamon roll. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, let's find the calories in a mini blueberry muffin. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, which is 450 / 3 = 150 calories. Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Now, let's add the total calories from the cinnamon rolls and the blueberry muffins to find the total calories of all the pastries. 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.

Let's start by finding the total number of Junebugs she removed. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so that's 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs each day. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs, and on Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs she removed: 
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300

Since she removed Junebugs over 5 days, we'll divide the total number of Junebugs by 5 to find the average:
300 / 5 = 60

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled. We can do this by multiplying the speed of each vehicle by the time it traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is 60 * 5 = 300 miles. The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

Now, let's find the difference in distance by subtracting the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

"To find out how many bouncy balls Sophie bought, we need to calculate the total number of toys she had before buying the bouncy balls and then subtract that from the total number of toys she has now.

First, let's add up the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings: 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48.

We know that after buying the bouncy balls, Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls she bought, we subtract the total number of toys she had before (48) from the total number of toys she has now (62): 62 - 48 = 14.

So, the tube of bouncy balls Sophie bought contains 14 bouncy balls.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. Let's start by using variables to represent each person's age. We'll use P for Peter, L for Paul, and J for John.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old, so we can write an equation:
P + L + J = 100

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than John, so we can write another equation:
L = J + 10

Finally, we know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so we can write a third equation:
P = L + J

Now, let's substitute the second equation into the third equation to get:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Next, we'll substitute the expression for P and L into the first equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age:
L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10
L = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age:
P = L + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

"To find the total number of water balloons the girls had, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

First, let's find the initial number of balloons. Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so they had 4 * 2 = 8 balloons. Maria also had 1 balloon for herself, making the total initial number of balloons 8 + 1 = 9.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total additional number of balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

To find the total number of balloons, we add the initial and additional balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

"To figure out how many new tables the charity group needs, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

First, we find out how many boxes were donated. Since 10 people donated 5 boxes each, we multiply 10 by 5, which gives us 50 boxes. Adding the 10 boxes they already had, we get a total of 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Now, we know they can fit 2 boxes per table. To find out how many tables they need in total, we divide the total number of boxes by 2. So, 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

Since they already have 15 tables, we subtract that from the total number of tables they need. 30 - 15 = 15.

"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance each person spits and then find the average of those two distances.

First, let's calculate Zoey's total distance. She has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet, so we multiply the number of seeds by the distance per seed: 40 x 10 = 400 feet.

Next, let's calculate Sydney's total distance. She has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet, so we multiply the number of seeds by the distance per seed: 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

Now, we add the total distances and divide by 2 to find the average: (400 + 420) / 2 = 820 / 2 = 410 feet.

"To figure out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's find out how many widgets each machine can make in a day. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours, it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours, it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets.

Now, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a month (30 days). The Widgeteer 3000 makes 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets, and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Since each widget sells for $6, we can multiply the number of widgets each machine makes by the price of each widget. The Widgeteer 3000 will make 43200 * 6 = $259200 in a month, and the WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32400 * 6 = $194400 in a month.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we subtract the amount of money the WidgetMaster 9000 makes from the amount of money the Widgeteer 3000 makes: $259200 - $194400 = $64800.

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options.

First, let's look at the 24-hour stay. The hotel charges 1600 pesos for this option.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours. Cameron is staying for 17 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning). The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours, he has to pay 70 pesos per hour, so that's 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's compare the two options. If Cameron chooses the 24-hour stay, he'll pay 1600 pesos. If he chooses the 12-hour stay plus additional hours, he'll pay 1350 pesos. To find out how much he'll save, we subtract the cost of the second option from the cost of the first option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"To find out how many pounds of hay Nate needs, we need to calculate the amount of hay each type of animal needs and then add them together.

First, we know that each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, we multiply 15 by 5 to get the total amount of hay the goats need: 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much hay each sheep needs. We're told that each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we multiply the amount each goat needs (5 pounds) by 2, which gives us 10 pounds. Then, we subtract 3 pounds from that amount: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. This means each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay.

Since there are 12 sheep, we multiply 12 by 7 to get the total amount of hay the sheep need: 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

Finally, we add the total amount of hay the goats need (75 pounds) to the total amount of hay the sheep need (84 pounds) to get the total amount of hay Nate needs: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To figure out how many pens John can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after his expenses.

First, let's calculate how much John earned. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so we subtract that from his total earnings: 300 - 50 = 250 dollars.

Next, he wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that too: 250 - 100 = 150 dollars.

Then, he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so we need to calculate how much he spends on pencils: 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of pencils from the remaining amount: 150 - 50 = 100 dollars.

Finally, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with 100 dollars. To do that, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of a pen: 100 / 25 = 4.

"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig and his brother spelled, we need to calculate the total number of letters each of them spelled and then add those two totals together.

Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, so we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word to find his total. 
Craig's total letters = 20 * 15 = 300 letters.

Since Craig's brother spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we add 50 to Craig's total letters to find the brother's total letters.
Brother's total letters = 300 + 50 = 350 letters.

Now, we add Craig's total letters and his brother's total letters to find the overall total.
Total letters = 300 + 350 = 650 letters.

"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to add up the visit charge, labor cost, and the cost of parts.

First, let's calculate the labor cost. Patty charges $35 per hour, or part thereof. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we round up to the nearest hour, which is 3 hours. So, the labor cost is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

Now, we add the labor cost to the visit charge and the cost of parts. The visit charge is $40, and the cost of parts is $60. 

Total charge = Visit charge + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60

"To figure out how much money James lost, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the amount he paid for them, and the amount he got back from selling 5 of them.

First, let's find the total cost of the CDs. James bought 10 CDs at $15 each, so the total cost is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got a 40% discount, he only paid 60% of the total cost. To find 60% of $150, we multiply $150 by 0.6, which gives us $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40, so he got $40 back.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, let's find the distance James swam at his normal speed. Since he swam 60% of the 20-mile distance, we multiply 20 miles by 0.6 to get 12 miles. James can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour, so the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. Half of 6 hours is 3 hours.

Finally, James swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

"To find the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times. Cayley sold 6 copies at $5 each, so the total sales amount is 6 * $5 = $30. Since he gets a 10% commission, we multiply $30 by 0.10 to get the commission: $30 * 0.10 = $3.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal. Cayley sold 10 copies at $15 each, so the total sales amount is 10 * $15 = $150. Since he gets an 8% commission, we multiply $150 by 0.08 to get the commission: $150 * 0.08 = $12.

Now, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission: $3 + $12 = $15.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. Let's say Azibo scored x points.

Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati scored x + 20 points. We also know that Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar scored (x + 20) - 10 = x + 10 points.

The total points scored by the team is 45, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms to get 3x + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides to get 3x = 15.

Divide both sides by 3 to get x = 5.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to figure out how many pages are in one inch of the book. Since each paper is printed on both sides, that means there are 2 pages per paper. Given that there are 100 papers to the inch, we can multiply 100 by 2 to get the total number of pages per inch.

So, 100 papers/inch * 2 pages/paper = 200 pages/inch.

Now, we know the book is 1.5 inches thick. To find the total number of pages, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book.

Total number of pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches
Total number of pages = 300 pages

"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports and then determine how many 15-minute intervals fit into that time.

Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60 minutes to get the total minutes: 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Now, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the number of 15-minute intervals: 900 / 15 = 60 intervals.

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval: 60 * 30 = 1800 reports.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 8 hours by 60 to get the total minutes: 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes early that day, so we subtract those 5 minutes from the total: 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time she spent sleepwalking. She sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. We subtract those 23 minutes from the total: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept 452 minutes on her bed that day.

"To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we need to start by calculating the number of measuring spoons he has. 

Jonathan has 2 dozen cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 cups. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of spoons. 

(2/3) * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the number of cups and the number of measuring spoons: 24 + 10 = 34.

"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of beds that are already occupied. The hospital has 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied. To find 1/5 of 1000, we can multiply 1000 by 1/5 or divide 1000 by 5.

1000 / 5 = 200

So, 200 beds are already occupied. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract 200 from the total number of beds.

1000 - 200 = 800

Now, let's calculate the number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we multiply 50 by the number of days in 2 weeks, which is 14.

50 * 14 = 700

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is the sum of the initial occupied beds and the new patients.

200 + 700 = 900

Finally, to find the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks, we subtract the total occupied beds from the hospital's capacity.

1000 - 900 = 100

"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the information given. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of those are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Out of these 9 non-work emails, 2/3 are to her family. To find 2/3 of 9, we multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3. This gives us (9 * 2) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6 emails to her family.

Now, we subtract the emails to her family from the non-work emails to find the emails to others, including her boyfriend. This is 9 - 6 = 3 emails.

Out of these 3 emails, 1/3 are to her boyfriend. To find 1/3 of 3, we divide 3 by 3, which gives us 1.

"To find Shawna's father's age, we need to start with Aliya's age, which is 3 years. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we multiply Aliya's age by 3 to get Shawna's age. 

Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

Now, we know Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. To find Shawna's father's age, we multiply Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years

"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to figure out what 20% of 48 is, since that's how much Courtney overestimated. 

20% is the same as 0.20, so we multiply 48 by 0.20 to get 9.6. This means Courtney overcounted by 9.6 people.

Now, we subtract 9.6 from the number Courtney reported, which is 48. So, 48 - 9.6 = 38.4. Since you can't have a fraction of a person, we round down to the nearest whole number.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of balls the coach brought to practice, we need to figure out how many balls each of the boys carried. We know Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 x 2 = 4 balls.

We also know Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. To find out how many balls Jeffrey carried, we divide Jason's balls by 2. So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Now, we add up the number of balls each boy carried to find the total number of balls: 4 (Jordan) + 2 (Jason) + 1 (Jeffrey) = 7.

Total number of balls: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they also filled in 2 holes on the third day, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, to find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11.

"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to figure out how many Collins got and then add that to the amount Amora and Lainey got. 

We know Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips. Since Collins got 15 more than them, we can find Collins' amount by adding 15 to 70. So, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we add up the amount each person got to find the total number of corn chips: 
70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225

"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of supplies and add it to the cost of supplies. 

First, we find 50% of the cost of supplies. To do this, we multiply the cost of supplies by 0.5. The cost of supplies is $400, so 50% of $400 is 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Now, we add this amount to the cost of supplies to find the cost of travel. The cost of travel is $400 + $200 = $600.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of Pokémon each person has caught. We'll use 'x' to represent the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught.

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, we can write an expression for the number of Pokémon Stan has caught: 4x - 13.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokémon Alex has caught is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

The total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so we can set up an equation:
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon Stan has caught:
Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to figure out how many episodes there are and multiply that by the length of each episode.

The problem states that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we can find the number of episodes by dividing 20 by 2. This gives us 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

Now, we multiply the total number of episodes (10) by the length of each episode (20 minutes) to find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show: 10 * 20 = 200 minutes.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each direction and then find the net distance.

First, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. We multiply the speed by the time: 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

Finally, the bird flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. We multiply the speed by the time: 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Since the bird flew north for a while, we need to subtract that distance from the total distance traveled south. We add the two south distances and subtract the north distance: 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

The final answer is: 374"
"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had and then subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made a batch of brownies, which is 1 dozen, or 12 brownies. At her office, they gave her 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her at home, which is 48 brownies. 

So, the total number of brownies Greta had is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 dozen is 12, 1 1/2 dozen is 12 + 6 = 18 brownies.

Now, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies to find out how many are left. 
66 - 18 = 48

"To find the total age of Nani and his siblings, we need to calculate the age of his brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find her age, we need to calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from his age. 
25% of 8 is 0.25 * 8 = 2 years.
So, Nani's sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we can calculate the total age of all three family members:
Nani's age: 8 years
Nani's brother's age: 16 years
Nani's sister's age: 6 years
Total age: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years

"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them up.

First, let's calculate the time for the racquets that need synthetic gut. Since it takes Andy 15 minutes to string a racquet with synthetic gut, and there are 3 racquets, the total time for synthetic gut is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for the racquets that need polyester string. It takes Andy 22 minutes to string a racquet with polyester string, and there are 5 racquets, so the total time for polyester string is 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

Finally, let's calculate the time for the racquets that need hybrid sets. Since a hybrid set is half synthetic gut and half polyester string, it takes Andy 18 minutes to string a racquet with a hybrid set. There are 4 racquets that need hybrid sets, so the total time for hybrid sets is 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all three types of strings: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

Number of players in Zeke's team = 13 + 7 = 20

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team.

Total number of players = 20 + 13 = 33

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is the distance around the outside of the shape. We can find it by adding the lengths of all four sides. Since the fence is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide, we have two 15-foot sides and two 10-foot sides.

Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Now, we know that Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. To find the total number of slats, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total slats = 2 * 50
Total slats = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to calculate the total number of oranges she had initially, then subtract the number of oranges she gave away and kept.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, and she bought 12 boxes, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 4 boxes. So, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the oranges she gave away from the total: 240 - 80 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, which is 160 * 1/4 = 40 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the oranges she kept from the remaining oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold, and then multiply those numbers by their respective costs.

Let's start with the gingerbread. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. In total, Sunny sold 10 + 15 = 25 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, let's look at the apple pie. On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday. In total, Sunny sold 11 + 15 = 26 boxes of apple pie.

The cost of each box of gingerbread is $6, and the cost of each box of apple pie is $15. To find the total amount Sunny earned, we multiply the total number of boxes of each item by its cost:

Gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6 = $150
Apple pie: 26 boxes * $15 = $390

Adding these amounts together, we get the total amount Sunny earned:

"To solve this problem, let's start by using the information that when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48.

Since Emil is 19 now, it will take him 5 years to turn 24. So, to find his dad's current age, we subtract 5 from 48: 48 - 5 = 43.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12.

Again, since Emil is 19 now, it will take him 5 years to turn 24. So, to find his brother's current age, we subtract 5 from 12: 12 - 5 = 7.

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother:

"To figure out how much money Pat will spend at the store, we need to calculate how many flowers she needs to buy. First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches.

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Each plant takes up 12 inches, and Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space each plant takes up is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space each plant takes up.

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants. However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

"To find the total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the petunias. Since Katherine wants 3 petunias in each basket and she has 5 baskets, she'll need a total of 3 * 5 = 15 petunias. Each petunia costs $3.00, so the total cost of the petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines. Katherine wants 2 sweet potato vines in each basket, so for 5 baskets, she'll need 2 * 5 = 10 sweet potato vines. Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50, so the total cost of the sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. 

First, let's calculate the amount of soil used for the sunflowers. Since each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil and they planted 4 sunflowers, the total amount of soil used for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Next, we calculate the amount of soil used for the carnations. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they planted 10 carnations, so the total amount of soil used for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

Now, we add the amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations to find the total amount of soil used: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they started with a 30-pound bag of soil, we subtract the amount used from the total to find the amount left: 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses they can plant is 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses.

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes. Now, let's see how much she'll have in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply $500.00 by 12.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she has by the cost of one pair of shoes.

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the problem into two parts: peeling the shrimp and cooking the shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel the shrimp. We know she can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we can divide 90 by 6, which gives us 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to cook the shrimp. We know she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we can set up a proportion: if 30 shrimp take 10 minutes, then 90 shrimp will take (90 / 30) * 10 = 30 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp (15 minutes) to the time it takes to cook the shrimp (30 minutes). This gives us a total time of 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.

"To find out how many degrees lower the final temperature was compared to the starting temperature, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

First, let's consider the air conditioner running on low for 3 hours. Since it cools the room by 2 degrees per hour, the total cooling in 3 hours is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Next, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours. It cools the room by 3 degrees per hour, so the total cooling in 4 hours is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling from both low and high settings is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

To find the net temperature change, we subtract the warming from the cooling: 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we subtract 75 from 90 to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 

90 - 75 = 15

"To figure out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to break it down by type of check and then add them all up.

First, Buford writes a check for the electric bill once a month. Since there are 12 months in a year, that's 12 checks for the electric bill. He also writes a check for the gas bill once a month, which is another 12 checks.

Buford writes a check to the church twice a month, so that's 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks per year.

Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service once a quarter. There are 4 quarters in a year, so that's 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up all the checks: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks per year.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know the second plane makes 44 trips, and that's half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

Now, we know the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. To find out how many flights that is, we multiply 88 by 3/4. To do this, we can multiply 88 by 3 and then divide by 4. 

88 * 3 = 264
264 / 4 = 66

So, the first plane goes to Greece for 66 flights. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights. These 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find out how many flights go to France, we divide 22 by 2.

22 / 2 = 11

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

First, we know that Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote's howl lasts 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of the three wolves' howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes by dividing by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount he received from his parents and subtract it from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. So, the total amount he received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

$30 - $18 = $12

"To find Wilfred's age, we need to start by finding the average age of the group. Since there are four children and their total age is 20, we can calculate the average age by dividing the total age by the number of children.

Average age = Total age / Number of children
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. So, we can find Helene's age by multiplying the average age by 2.

Helene's age = 2 * Average age
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

Now, we know the ages of three children: Akbar (3 years old), Alessandro (4 years old), and Helene (10 years old). We can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of these three children from the total age.

Wilfred's age = Total age - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age)
Wilfred's age = 20 - (3 + 4 + 10)
Wilfred's age = 20 - 17
Wilfred's age = 3

"To figure out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to add up the money collected from the neighbors and the online fund. The neighbors gave $500 and the online fund gave $1500, so that's a total of $500 + $1500 = $2000.

The lawyer is going to give three times as much as everyone else, but ""everyone else"" only includes the neighbors and the online fund. The $200 from Walter's friend doesn't count in this case.

So, the lawyer's contribution will be three times $2000, which is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

$6000"
"To find out how many people were in the church next door, we need to figure out how many cookies were given to them and then divide that by the number of cookies each person got.

First, we calculate the total number of cookies brought to the wedding. Since each of the 100 guests brought 15 cookies, we multiply 100 by 15.

100 * 15 = 1500 cookies

The bride gave half of these cookies to the church, so we divide the total number of cookies by 2.

1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we divide the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

750 / 15 = 50

So, there were 50 people in the church next door.

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, let's break it down step by step. 

We know that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. Let's say the size of each kid's slice is x. Then, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

Now, let's find the total number of slices. The kids get 4 slices of size x, and the adults get 2 slices of size 2x. So, the total number of slices is 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Since each adult gets 2x, we can find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets by dividing 2x by the total number of slices (8x) and multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (2x / 8x) * 100
= (1/4) * 100
= 25%

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To figure out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the time he spends on rounds and appointments.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds. He has 9 inpatients and each round takes 20 minutes, so we multiply 9 by 20, which is 180 minutes. 

Next, we calculate the time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes, so we multiply 10 by 30, which is 300 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 480 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

Doctor Jones is at the clinic for 9 hours, so we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time: 9 - 8 = 1 hour.

"To figure out the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake batter, bake the cake, let it cool, and frost it. 

Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes, baking the cake takes 30 minutes, cooling the cake takes 2 hours (which is 120 minutes), and frosting the cake takes 10 minutes. 

So, the total time is 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes. 

We can convert 180 minutes to hours and minutes by dividing by 60. 180 minutes is equal to 3 hours. 

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm. 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

The latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box. We know that Lisa and Peter sold a total of 64 chocolate bars together. We also know that Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

First, let's find the total number of boxes they sold. To do this, we add the number of boxes Lisa sold to the number of boxes Peter sold: 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Now that we know they sold 8 boxes in total, we can find out how many chocolate bars are in a box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes: 64 ÷ 8 = 8.

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total earnings per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

First, let's calculate the earnings per session. The studio costs $25 to rent, and there's an additional $1.50 charge per student. Since there are 10 students, the total cost per session is:

$25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the earnings per week would be:

$40 per session * 3 sessions per week = $120 per week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the expected earnings per month would be:

$120 per week * 4 weeks per month = $480 per month

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chocolate bars Peter and Martha have in each box. We can do this by dividing the total number of chocolate bars they have by the number of boxes.

Let's start with Peter. He has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes. To find out how many chocolate bars he has in each box, we divide 64 by 4, which gives us 16. So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, let's do the same for Martha. She has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes. To find out how many chocolate bars she has in each box, we divide 56 by 7, which gives us 8. So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

The question asks how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. To find this out, we subtract the number of chocolate bars Martha has in each box from the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box. This gives us 16 - 8 = 8.

"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

The total population of porcupines is 50. So, the number of female porcupines is 50 * (3/5) = 30.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, in a month, the total number of babies born is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

Now, we need to add the initial population of porcupines to the number of babies born in a year to find the total number of porcupines after a year. 

So, the total number of porcupines after a year is 50 + 1440 = 1490.

"To find the cost of filling the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. The pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. The volume of a rectangular prism (like the pool) is calculated by multiplying the width, length, and depth.

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

The pool company told the Smiths to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the gallons of water needed. So, we'll do that next.

Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260

Now, we know the cost is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = gallons * $0.10
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of each color of sticks. We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks by adding 5 to the number of red sticks: 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.

Next, we're told that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, we subtract 3 from the number of blue sticks to find the number of yellow sticks: 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled. 

First, let's calculate Matteo's distance. We know he traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. So, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

Next, let's calculate Shandy's distance. We know she traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. So, we multiply her speed by the time she traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances. To do this, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

"To find the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know there are 3000 students in total. Half of them are over 16 years old, which is 3000 / 2 = 1500 students. One-fourth of these students are male, so the number of male students over 16 is 1500 / 4 = 375.

The other half of the students are under 16 years old, which is also 1500 students. One-half of these students are male, so the number of male students under 16 is 1500 / 2 = 750.

Now, we add the number of male students over 16 and under 16 to get the total number of male students: 375 + 750 = 1125.

Since there are 3000 students in total, the number of female students is 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

"To find out how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full, we need to calculate the total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days.

First, let's find out how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day. Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's add up the total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days: 
4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons (first day)
3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons (second day)
7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons (total)

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To find the initial charge of the power bank, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

First, let's calculate the charge before the power bank started losing 7% of its total capacity each hour. Since it lost 7% each hour for 3 hours, the total loss during this time is 7% * 3 = 21%. To find the charge before this, we add the 21% loss to the final charge: 28% + 21% = 49%.

Next, we need to calculate the charge before the power bank started losing 9% of its total capacity each hour. Since it lost 9% each hour for 5 hours, the total loss during this time is 9% * 5 = 45%. To find the charge before this, we add the 45% loss to the 49% charge: 49% + 45% = 94%.

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

"To figure out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save for the down payment on the car, we need to calculate how much she makes in a week and how much she needs to save.

Janet makes $10 an hour from her wages and $15 an hour from tips, so that's a total of $25 an hour. If she works 40 hours a week, she makes $25 * 40 = $1000 a week.

The car costs $10000, and she wants to save 20% of that for the down payment. To find 20% of $10000, we multiply $10000 by 0.20, which is $2000.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it'll take her to save $2000 if she makes $1000 a week. We can do this by dividing $2000 by $1000, which gives us 2 weeks.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased and subtract that from the $10 he has.

First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit he bought:
- 3 peaches at $.5 each is 3 * .5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $.5 each is 4 * .5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each is 2 * 1 = $2
- 5 apples at $.75 each is 5 * .75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:
$1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so we subtract the total cost from that:
$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $.25 each, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $.25 = 3

First, let's find the price after one year. 
5% of $120 is 0.05 * $120 = $6. 
So, the price after one year is $120 + $6 = $126.

Next, we find the price after two years. 
5% of $126 is 0.05 * $126 = $6.30. 
So, the price after two years is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Finally, we find the price after three years. 
5% of $132.30 is 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615. 
So, the price after three years is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. We can multiply the number of albums by the number of pictures per album to find the total number of selfies and portraits.

Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of selfies = 27

Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures per album

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since a large stuffed animal costs three times as much as a small one, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

We also know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold L large stuffed animals. Then, she sold 2L small stuffed animals.

The total amount of money she earned from selling large stuffed animals is $12L, and the total amount of money she earned from selling small stuffed animals is $4 * 2L = $8L.

Since she earned a total of $120, we can set up the equation: 12L + 8L = 120.

Combine like terms: 20L = 120.

Divide both sides by 20: L = 6.

Since she sold 2L small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. If he uses an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

Next, if he uses a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. To find 50% of 24, we multiply 24 by 0.5, which is 12. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 36 pounds per day. To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine in a day, we multiply 36 by 40, which is 1440 pounds per day.

Tom bought a new bedroom set for $3000 and sold his old one for $1000. So, he used that $1000 to pay for part of the new set. To find out how much he still owes, we subtract the $1000 from the $3000.

$3000 (new set) - $1000 (old set) = $2000

Now, we know Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month. To find 10% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.10.

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

"To find the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

First, let's look at the red balloons. Sally started with 25 red balloons, but 40% of them burst due to the wind. To find 40% of 25, we multiply 25 by 0.4, which gives us 10. So, she lost 10 red balloons. Now, she has 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons weren't affected, so she still has 7 green balloons.

Next, let's look at the yellow balloons. Sally had 12 yellow balloons, but she accidentally released half of them. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons. Now, she has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. To find 75% of 8, we multiply 8 by 0.75, which gives us 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she has: 
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios where he won't have to turn it in.

First, there's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. If the normal teacher comes in, which is also a 50% chance, there are two more possibilities. The teacher might give everyone an extension, which has a 40% chance, or she might not give an extension, which has a 60% chance.

If the teacher doesn't give an extension, Marcus can try to convince her that his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. This has a 20% chance of working.

Now, let's calculate the probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework. If the substitute teacher comes in, that's 50%. If the normal teacher comes in and gives an extension, that's 50% * 40% = 20%. If the normal teacher comes in, doesn't give an extension, but Marcus gets a personal extension, that's 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Adding these probabilities together, we get 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%. This means there's a 76% chance that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.

To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we subtract 76% from 100%, which gives us 24%.

"To figure out how many tickets each graduate would get, we need to subtract the seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total seats in the Fine Arts Center. 

There are 6000 seats in total. 950 seats are for graduates and 300 seats are for faculty. So, the total seats taken are 950 + 300 = 1250. 

Now, we subtract the seats taken from the total seats to find out how many seats are left for friends and family. 6000 - 1250 = 4750.

Since there are 950 graduates and they will split the 4750 seats equally, we divide 4750 by 950 to find out how many tickets each graduate would get. 

4750 / 950 = 5

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat. We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill him up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium-sized beans he can eat by multiplying 75 by 2. This gives us 75 * 2 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we're told that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. To find the number of small beans, we can multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3. So, 150 * 3 = 450.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to calculate her total pay and total expenses, then subtract her expenses from her pay and divide by the total hours worked.

Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so she works a total of 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

Her total pay is $15 per day for 3 days, so she earns 15 * 3 = $45.

She also has to pay $3 for parking each day, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, let's subtract her expenses from her pay: $45 - $9 = $36.

Finally, we divide her pay after expenses by the total hours worked: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the pencils separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the books. Since Ted bought 3 books for $16 each, we multiply the number of books by the cost per book: 3 * $16 = $48.

Next, we find the cost of the pencils. Ted bought 3 pencils for $6 each, so we multiply the number of pencils by the cost per pencil: 3 * $6 = $18.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils to find the total amount spent: $48 + $18 = $66.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the number of bottles he'll place along his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

First, let's find the number of bottles. Since Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle every 3 feet, we can divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle. 

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

However, since Richard starts at the first bottle, he only needs to move to the remaining 7 bottles. 

Now, we know it takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. To find the total time, we multiply the number of bottles he needs to move to by the time it takes to move to each one.

7 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 35 seconds

"To find out how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we first need to determine the total number of apples he has. Since there are 40 apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, we multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes.

Total number of apples = 40 apples/box * 2 boxes = 80 apples

Now, we know that Uncle Franky wants to pack 8 apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in one pack.

Number of packs = Total number of apples / Number of apples in one pack
= 80 apples / 8 apples/pack
= 10 packs

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from the initial amount of cash she had.

First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese. Since it's $11 per pound and Amor bought 2 pounds, the total cost is 2 x $11 = $22.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese. It's $6 per pound, and Amor bought 3 pounds, so the total cost is 3 x $6 = $18.

Now, we add the cost of both cheeses to find the total cost: $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $50 - $40 = $10.

"So, Jim is going to college and he's taking out $50,000 in loans each year for 4 years. That's a total of $200,000 in loans. On top of that, he's not working his $25,000 a year job while he's in school, so that's another $100,000 he's missing out on. 

In total, Jim needs to make $300,000 to cover the loans and the money he didn't make while in school. After college, his new job pays him $75,000 a year, which is three times what he used to make.

To figure out how long it'll take Jim to make $300,000 at his new job, we can divide the total amount he needs to make ($300,000) by his new yearly salary ($75,000). 

$300,000 ÷ $75,000 = 4 years

"To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long, and the fabric needs to be 2 feet longer, so the length of the fabric is 6 + 2 = 8 feet. The bed is 8 feet wide, and the fabric needs to be 2 feet wider, so the width of the fabric is 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric by multiplying the length and width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

"To find the total number of letters delivered, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. To find one-fifth of 425, we divide 425 by 5, which is 85. Then, we add 17 to get 85 + 17 = 102 letters delivered on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. Then, we add 5 to get 204 + 5 = 209 letters delivered on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

Next, we calculate the cost of the pasta salad. 6 people want the pasta salad, and it costs $6 per person, so we multiply the number of people by the cost per person: 6 * $6 = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad to find the total amount Molly will pay: $65 + $36 = $101.

"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

First, let's look at the first race. Johnny's dad lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost. Since he won $11 on the second race, we subtract that from the total. Total amount lost = $5 (lost) + $16.50 (lost) - $11 (won) = $10.50.

Since there were 3 races, the average amount lost is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

"To find the share of the first person, let's break down the information given. We know that the second person took $80 more than the first person, and the third person took twice what the second person took. 

Let's say the first person's share is x. Then, the second person's share is x + 80. Since the third person took twice what the second person took, the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

We also know that the total amount is $1920, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find out how many hours each painter worked, we need to calculate the total hours the team worked and then divide that by the number of painters.

First, we need to figure out how many hours the team worked in a day. Since they worked 3/8 of a day, we multiply that by the total hours in a day, which is 24. 

3/8 * 24 = 9 hours per day

Next, we need to find out how many days they worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 3 by 7.

3 * 7 = 21 days

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days to get the total hours worked.

9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Finally, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters, which is 4.

189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls in three sets. Let's say the number of balls he retrieved in the second set is x.

Since he retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls in the third set is x/2.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

To simplify the equation, let's multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (from 2007 to 2010). The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

First, let's find the price of the car after 1 year (2008). To do this, we'll multiply the initial price by the depreciation rate and subtract that from the initial price.

Initial price = $20000
Depreciation rate = 21% = 0.21
Depreciation after 1 year = $20000 * 0.21 = $4200
Price after 1 year (2008) = $20000 - $4200 = $15800

Now, let's find the price of the car after 2 years (2009). We'll do the same thing, but use the price after 1 year.

Depreciation after 2 years = $15800 * 0.21 = $3328
Price after 2 years (2009) = $15800 - $3328 = $12472

Finally, let's find the price of the car after 3 years (2010).

Depreciation after 3 years = $12472 * 0.21 = $2618.52
Price after 3 years (2010) = $12472 - $2618.52 = $9853.48

Next, we find the number of German books by multiplying the total number of books by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%).

Number of German books: 50 * 0.1 = 5

Now, we know that the remaining books are written in Spanish. To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books.

The total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is 1955 kilometers. Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, so we need to find out the total distance she has driven.

Total distance driven = Distance driven per day * Number of days
Total distance driven = 325 * 4
Total distance driven = 1300 kilometers

Now, we subtract the total distance driven from the total distance to find out how many kilometers Bernice will still need to drive.

The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price, which is $48 / 2 = $24. Lastly, the athletic socks cost $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6 for the socks.

Now, let's add the king size bed. The laundry machine can wash 1 king set of sheets at a time, and there's only 1 king size bed. So, that's 1 more load.

In total, Greg does 2 loads for the twin beds and 1 load for the king size bed, which is 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine the x terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Now, subtract 18 from both sides:

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of mailing the small coupons. Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons, and each one costs 5 cents to mail. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of coupons by the cost per coupon:
700 * 0.05 = 35 dollars

Next, we need to find the cost of mailing the big coupons. Anthony is sending out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he's sending out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so we multiply the number of big coupons by the cost per coupon:
1400 * 0.15 = 210 dollars

Now, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons to find the total cost of postage:
35 + 210 = 245 dollars

"To find the number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Since he ordered 3 less than ten, we subtract 3 from 10, which gives us 7 sub sandwiches.

Now, we know that each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. So, the total number of meatballs in 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

However, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, leaving him with 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total to 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to figure out how many trucks were able to deliver. Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks. So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures.

Now, we subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks:
20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

These 15 trucks were able to deliver the fertiliser. Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we multiply the number of trucks that delivered by the tons each truck was carrying:
15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers:

"To make 6 dozen croissants, Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter. The grocery store has a promotion where you can buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay full price for one and half price for the other.

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can divide this into three pairs of two pounds each. For each pair, he'll pay full price for one pound ($4.00) and half price for the other ($2.00). 

So, for each pair, the total cost is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00. Since there are three pairs, the total cost is 3 * $6.00 = $18.00.

"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the total number of guests. Kayla invited her 25 classmates, the 7 girls in her dance class, and 13 family members. So, the total number of guests invited is 25 + 7 + 13 = 45.

However, 4 people said they could not come, so we subtract them from the total: 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, and there's an additional $6 for each guest beyond that. Since Kayla has 41 guests, we need to find out how many guests are beyond the initial 20. That's 41 - 20 = 21 guests.

The cost for these additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126. Now, we add this to the initial fee: $125 + $126 = $251.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to calculate the amount each of them spent and subtract that from their initial amount.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. To find 1/4 of $60, we can divide $60 by 4, which equals $15. So Maggie spent $15 and has $60 - $15 = $45 left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. To find 1/3 of $60, we can divide $60 by 3, which equals $20. So Riza spent $20 and has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

Now, let's add the amount of money Maggie and Riza have left: $45 + $40 = $85.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to calculate the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day. Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, we can divide this number by 7 to get the daily total: 315 ÷ 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, let's look at the eating habits of the first two monkeys. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, and the second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, which is 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day. 

To find the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys, we add their individual totals: 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day.

Since the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is 45, and the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas, we can subtract to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats: 45 - 24 = 21 bananas per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed in that hour. 

First, let's calculate how many pieces Teddy placed from the first puzzle. Since Teddy finished half of the 500-piece puzzle, we can find that by dividing 500 by 2, which equals 250 pieces.

Next, we know Teddy finished the entire second 500-piece puzzle. So, we just add those 500 pieces to the 250 pieces from the first puzzle.

The total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we need to calculate the cost of the roses and the change she receives.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15, she can buy a dozen for $15 and 3 more roses at $2 each. The cost of a dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 more roses is 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny paid with 5 * $5 = $25. To find the change, we subtract the cost from the amount she paid: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the change is given in quarters, and each quarter is $0.25, we can find the number of quarters by dividing the change by the value of a quarter: $4 / $0.25 = 16.

"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total amount from each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total amount from the milkshakes. Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, so we multiply 6 by $5.50, which is $33.

Next, we calculate the total amount from the burger platters. Terry sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, so we multiply 9 by $11, which is $99.

Finally, we calculate the total amount from the sodas. Terry sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so we multiply 20 by $1.50, which is $30.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to break down the arrival and departure times of the other trains.

The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes and will stay in the station for 20 minutes. So, it will leave the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train will arrive half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train leaves. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train will arrive at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train will stay for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train will leave the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train will arrive an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the second train leaves. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train will arrive at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train will leave the station immediately after it arrives, so it will leave at 125 minutes.

The fourth train, which is the one Paul needs to get on, will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train will arrive at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

So, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already collected and how many more she needs.

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks she has collected so far, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks she has been saving them.

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks needed to find out how many more she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week. We can do this by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which the friend bought the watch and compare it to the original price.

First, let's find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Since he bought it at 75% of the original price, we multiply the original price by 0.75. The original price is $2000, so:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. To find this price, we multiply $1500 by 1.20:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by the friend from the original price. The discount is the difference between the original price and the price the friend paid:
$2000 - $1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many seconds are in 4 hours and then multiply that by the number of springs.

First, let's break down the time. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So, to find the total number of seconds in an hour, we multiply 60 minutes by 60 seconds:
60 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 3600 seconds/hour

Now, we multiply the number of seconds in an hour by the number of hours:
3600 seconds/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, we multiply the total number of seconds by the number of springs:
14400 seconds * 5 springs = 72000 jellyfish

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts. James walks halfway to the store, then back home, and finally to the store. 

First, let's find the distance James walked halfway to the store. Since his home is 4 miles from the store, halfway would be 4 / 2 = 2 miles. 

Now, James walks 2 miles back home. So, the total distance he's walked so far is 2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.

Finally, James walks the full 4 miles to the store. So, the total distance he walked is 4 miles (to the halfway point and back home) + 4 miles (to the store) = 8 miles.

We know James walks 4 miles per hour. To find the time it took him to walk 8 miles, we can divide the total distance by his speed:

Time = Total distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's find out how many bananas Jenny bought. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas, so she bought 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so 40 bananas would cost 40 * $0.80 = $32.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00, so 10 bunches would cost 10 * $3.00 = $30.

The amount of money Jenny saved is the difference between the cost of buying the bananas individually and the cost of buying them in bunches. So, she saved $32 - $30 = $2.

"To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to figure out how much he gets. We know that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, and together they have 100 feet of fence.

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Then Harry gets x + 60 feet. Since the total is 100 feet, we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the crocodile grows per year. We know that it grows 8 inches in 4 years. 

So, we divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4 years) to get the growth rate per year. 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now that we know the crocodile grows 2 inches per year, we can multiply this rate by the number of years we want to find the growth for, which is 13 years.

2 inches per year * 13 years = 26 inches

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, we know that Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so that's 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15, which gives us 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we know that the rest of the bikes were MTB type. So, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

The prices of the bikes are: MTB - $500, BMX - $250 (half the price of an MTB), and Trekking - $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many bales of hay the farmer makes in 6 hours and how many bales the truck picks up in the same time.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we need to find out how many bales are left in the field. To do this, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, after a 6-hour day, there will be 12 bales of hay left in the field.

"To find the total hours John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and extra learning time, then convert it to hours.

John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. To find the extra learning time, we need to know the total weekly minutes. Let's call the total weekly minutes 'x'. Then, the extra learning time is (1/16)x, and the class time is 1600 minutes. The total weekly minutes 'x' is the sum of class time and extra learning time:

x = 1600 + (1/16)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 16:

16x = 25600 + x

Subtract x from both sides:

15x = 25600

Divide both sides by 15:

x = 25600 / 15
x = 1706.67

Now, we can convert the total weekly minutes to hours:

Total hours per week = x / 60
Total hours per week = 1706.67 / 60
Total hours per week = 28.44

First, we need to find the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since each story is 24 feet high and he drops it from the third-floor balcony, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

Now, we know the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. So, on the first bounce, the ball goes to 2/3 of 72 feet, which is (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball goes to 2/3 of its height on the first bounce, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert this to inches by multiplying 6 by 12, which gives us 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 inches to 72 inches, which gives us 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from 74 inches, which gives us 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to 69 inches, which gives us 72 inches.

The height of the fourth child is 72 inches."

Next, we know that the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

Finally, since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

First, let's calculate the area of the north and south walls. Since they are 10 x 8 feet, each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. There are two walls, so the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

Next, let's calculate the area of the east and west walls. They are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. There are two walls, so the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of all four walls to get the total area: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we divide the total area by 20 to find the number of gallons required: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Finally, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to find the total cost: 12 * $12 = $144.

"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to figure out the probability of choosing a shaken soda.

Ellen started with 12 sodas and shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself. This leaves 12 - 1 = 11 sodas. Out of these 11, 3 are shaken and 8 are unshaken.

Ellen's brother then took 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas. This leaves 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas and 8 - 2 = 6 unshaken sodas.

So, when Ellen's friend comes along, there are 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas left. The total number of sodas left is 2 + 6 = 8.

The probability of choosing a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas: 2/8 = 1/4 = 0.25.

To express this probability as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate how far each train has traveled in 3 hours. 

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled, we multiply its speed by the time it has been traveling:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour. We use the same formula to find the distance it has traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To find out how many people Billy helps, we need to figure out how many days he works and then multiply that by the number of people he helps each day.

First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th is 19 days. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2, which gives us 10 days off.

Now, we subtract the days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works: 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour, and he works for 3 hours a day. So, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people Billy helps, we multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works: 6 * 40 = 240.

The time it takes to ride the biggest slide is its length divided by the speed at which people slide down. So, for the biggest slide, that's 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.

For the second biggest slide, we do the same thing: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

Now, to find the difference, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

Now, we add the miles run by Amber and Micah to get their total. 
Total miles run by Amber and Micah = 8 + 28 = 36 miles.

We know the total miles run by all three is 52 miles. To find Ahito's miles, we subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - miles run by Amber and Micah = 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to do some math. 

First, let's subtract the cost of the item she returned from the initial charge. The item cost $15.00, so we subtract that from the initial charge of $85.00. 

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new purchases. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off the original price of $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20 (which is the same as 20%). 

$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price of the frying pan.

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

The set of towels was on sale for 10% off the original price of $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 0.10 (which is the same as 10%). 

$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price of the towels.

$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now that we have the prices of the new purchases, we can add them to the balance after the return.

$16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of these large jellyfish change color under UV light. We're also told that 6 jellyfish changed color.

First, we need to find out how many large jellyfish there are. Since a third of the large jellyfish changed color, we can multiply the number of jellyfish that changed color by 3 to get the total number of large jellyfish. So, 6 * 3 = 18 large jellyfish.

Now, we know that a fifth of the total jellyfish are large. To find the total number of jellyfish, we can multiply the number of large jellyfish by 5. So, 18 * 5 = 90 jellyfish.

"To find Caroline's age, we need to start with Chris's age, which is given as 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2.

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so we multiply Ben's age by 3.

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To figure out how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate how much she needs to save for retirement and how long it'll take her to save that amount.

Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000, during her 20-year retirement. So, she'll need:

$100,000 x 0.40 = $40,000 per year

For 20 years, that's:

$40,000 per year x 20 years = $800,000

Lauren saves 20% of her paycheck, which is:

$100,000 per year x 0.20 = $20,000 per year

Now, let's divide the total amount she needs to save ($800,000) by the amount she saves each year ($20,000):

$800,000 ÷ $20,000 per year = 40 years

However, Lauren wants to retire in 20 years. Since she's already been working and saving, let's assume she's already saved some money. We don't know exactly how much, but we can use the information we have.

Lauren will save $20,000 per year for the next 20 years, which is:

$20,000 per year x 20 years = $400,000

This means she still needs to save:

$800,000 - $400,000 = $400,000

Since she saves $20,000 per year, she needs to work for:

$400,000 ÷ $20,000 per year = 20 years

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to determine the total number of cuts and then divide the total length of the ribbon by that number.

Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. This means he'll have 4 parts. Then, each of these 4 parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. So, the total number of final cuts will be 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we can divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of cuts:
100 cm / 20 = 5 cm

"To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to find the total number of students. We know that 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys. 

Let's start by finding 1% of the population. To do this, we'll divide 240 by 40, since 40% is equal to 240 boys.
240 ÷ 40 = 6

This means 1% of the population is 6 students. Now, we'll multiply 6 by 100 to find 100% of the population, which is the total number of students.
6 * 100 = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys (240) from the total number of students (600).
600 - 240 = 360

"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so their total height is 3 x 4 = 12 inches. The other three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so their total height is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

Now, let's add the total height of all the heels: 12 + 6 = 18 inches. Since there are 6 women, we'll divide the total height by 6 to find the average: 18 ÷ 6 = 3 inches.

"Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June, which has 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide 9,300 miles by 30 days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad plans to hike twice a day, we divide 310 miles by 2:

310 miles / 2 = 155 miles per hike

However, Soledad is currently planning to hike 125 miles per time. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we subtract 125 miles from 155 miles:

155 miles - 125 miles = 30 miles

Soledad needs to hike 30 more miles per hike to complete her journey on time.

"To find the total amount the store will receive after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of ball and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the red balls. There are 3 red balls, and each one costs $9. So, the total cost of the red balls is 3 x $9 = $27.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the blue balls. There are 11 blue balls, and each one costs $5. So, the total cost of the blue balls is 11 x $5 = $55.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the green balls. There are 25 green balls, and each one costs $3. So, the total cost of the green balls is 25 x $3 = $75.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the balls: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

"To find out how many kilograms James will have left, we need to determine how many kilograms Pierre, Paul, and Jacques will have left after Peter and Paul take their share. However, the question seems to be referring to Pierre, Paul, and Jacques, but then mentions Peter and James, who were not initially mentioned. Assuming the question meant Pierre, Paul, and Jacques, and Peter and James are actually Pierre and Jacques, we can proceed.

First, let's calculate the amount of apples Peter (Pierre) and Paul want. Peter wants a quarter of the total apples, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. Paul wants 1/3 of the total apples, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Now, let's add the amount of apples Peter and Paul want: 3 + 4 = 7 kg. To find out how many apples are left, we subtract the total amount taken from the initial amount: 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

Since Jacques is the only one left, he will have 5 kg of apples.

Next, we subtract the money he spent. He spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, for a total of $5 + $19 = $24.

Now, we subtract the total money spent from the total money he had: $32 - $24 = $8.

However, we also know that Anna had already spent $4 before buying the books. To find out how much she spent on the books, we subtract the $4 from the $14. This gives us $14 - $4 = $10.

Since Anna bought 2 books for the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount she spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$10 / 2 = $5

First, let's add up the initial number of fishes: 
Male fishes: 4 (male guppies) + 3 (male goldfishes) = 7
Female fishes: 7 (female guppies) + 5 (female goldfishes) = 12

Then, let's add the number of fishes Tate bought:
Male fishes: 2 (male guppies) + 2 (male goldfishes) = 4
Female fishes: 1 (female guppy) + 3 (female goldfishes) = 4

Now, we add the initial number of fishes and the number of fishes Tate bought:
Total male fishes: 7 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 11
Total female fishes: 12 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes, we subtract the number of male fishes from the number of female fishes:

"To find the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their task.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog. Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia, but the problem states ""well over 4 hours longer,"" which implies at least 4 hours and 1 minute longer. However, for the sake of calculation, we will consider it as 4 hours longer. So, Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add up the time each person took to complete their chore:

"To find out how many miles John drives per month when visiting his parents, we need to calculate the distance of the round trip and multiply it by the number of visits per month.

First, let's find the distance of the round trip. Since it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents at a speed of 70 mph, we can calculate the distance one way as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles

Since John makes a round trip, we need to multiply the distance by 2:
Distance for round trip = 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles

Now, we know John visits his parents twice a month. To find the total miles driven per month, we multiply the distance of the round trip by the number of visits:
Total miles per month = 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how far Sofie will walk in 7 days, and then use that information to find out how far Brian will walk.

Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days to find the total distance she'll walk. So, 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.

The problem states that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian, which means Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks. To find the distance Brian will walk, we can divide Sofie's total distance by 2. So, 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we need to figure out how many toys the other four workers made in 10 hours. Two of the workers make 6 toys an hour, so in 10 hours, they make 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys. The other two workers make 4 toys an hour, so in 10 hours, they make 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

So, the first four workers made 120 + 80 = 200 toys in 10 hours. The manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order, but they still need 20 toys after 10 hours. This means they made 400 - 20 = 380 toys in 10 hours.

Since the first four workers made 200 toys, the fifth worker must have made 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours. To find out how many toys the fifth worker makes per hour, we divide the total number of toys by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of Elijah's dogs first. Elijah has two dogs, one that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog and another that is half the weight of Kory's dog.

Since Kory's dog is 60 pounds, Elijah's first dog is 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. This is because one-fourth of 60 is the same as 60 divided by 4.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it's 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs: 
Kory's dog: 60 pounds
Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds
Elijah's second dog: 30 pounds
Total weight: 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds

"To find out how many small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's he has. Since he buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

We know that 1 ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's in it. So, to find the total number of M&M's, we multiply the total weight by the number of M&M's per ounce: 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, if John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we can find the number of small bags by dividing the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/small bag = 90 small bags.

Now, we know Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by his daily flying distance. So, 20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days.

Now, we know the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the fastest car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25: 600 * 1.25 = 750 miles per hour.

"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from Liam's age. Liam is 16 years old now, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Since Liam's age two years ago was twice the age of Vince, we can set up an equation to find Vince's age two years ago. Let's call Vince's age two years ago ""x"". The equation would be 2x = 14, since Liam's age was twice Vince's age.

Solving for x, we get x = 14 / 2 = 7. This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago.

To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago: 7 + 2 = 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation x + (x + 12) = 30.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 12 = 30. Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 2x = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 9. So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the remaining eggs. Since the total number of eggs is 56, and Camden and Sarah painted 30, Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since they painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Finally, we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. The difference is 21 - 13 = 8.

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the weight of each separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces.

Next, we need to find the weight of the boxes. Since Nik puts the crayons into groups of 8, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes: 200 crayons / 8 crayons/box = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes to find the total weight in ounces: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16: 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Now, we know that John cuts the tree into 4-foot logs. To find the total number of logs, we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Each log can be cut into 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5 to find the total number of planks.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank to find the total amount John makes.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

Now, let's add Valerie's and her brother's salaries: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000. This is their combined salary.

Their mom makes twice their combined salary, so we multiply their combined salary by 2: $15,000 * 2 = $30,000.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk, we need to find the time she spends on the sidewalk and add it to the time she spends on the beach.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We know she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. We can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time. 

Speed = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 1/20 miles per minute.

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * (1/20 miles per minute) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Now, we know that Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk. We can find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk using the same formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute) = 10 minutes.

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk is the sum of the time she spends on the beach and the time she spends on the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how much Jane has saved so far and how much more she needs to save. 

Since Jane has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks, we multiply the amount she saves each week by the number of weeks she's been saving:

Now, we know Jane wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she's already saved from her goal:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since Jane saves $4 every week, we can divide the amount she still needs to save by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives us:

Initial marbles = 60 - 24
Initial marbles = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we can subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles to find the new total:

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to think about how temperatures mix. When you mix two things of different temperatures, the resulting temperature is a kind of average of the two.

Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of the unknown temperature water, and the result is at least 40 degrees. We can use this information to figure out the minimum temperature of the second bottle.

Let's call the temperature of the second bottle ""x"". When we mix the two waters, the total amount of water is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug). We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

This equation says that the average temperature of the mixture (the sum of the temperatures of the two waters, divided by the total amount of water) is at least 40 degrees.

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5:

4 * 33 + x ≥ 200

This simplifies to:

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides gives us:

x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three weeks and then add them to the initial number of animals.

First, let's find out how many cows and chickens are added each day. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. Since there are 21 days in three weeks, we multiply the number of cows and chickens added per day by 21.

Cows added: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Chickens added: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, we add the initial number of cows and chickens to the number of cows and chickens added.

Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20

Total number of cows after three weeks: 50 + 420 = 470
Total number of chickens after three weeks: 20 + 210 = 230

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Total number of animals after three weeks: 470 + 230 = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels after the discount and then divide it by the total number of bagels.

First, let's find the original cost of 4 packs of bagels. Since each pack costs $10.00, the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Next, we apply the 10% discount. To do this, we find 10% of $40.00, which is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00. Then, we subtract this amount from the original cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find the total number of bagels. Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Finally, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost of each single bagel: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he'll eat in that time.

First, let's figure out how many eggs he eats in the first 30 days. Since he eats 3 eggs a day, we multiply 3 eggs by 30 days:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Next, we calculate how many eggs he eats in the next 30 days. He eats 5 eggs a day, so we multiply 5 eggs by 30 days:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to get the total number of eggs:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first determine the total number of green and red jellybeans. We know there are 17 green jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, we can calculate the number of red jellybeans by multiplying the number of green jellybeans by 2. 

Red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34

Now, we add the number of green and red jellybeans to find their total. 

Total green and red jellybeans = 17 + 34 = 51

We are given that there are 60 jellybeans in total. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total jellybeans - Total green and red jellybeans
= 60 - 51
= 9

"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to break it down step by step. First, we know that Tim grows 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons per year. So, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 trees * 6 lemons per tree = 30 lemons per year.

Since a decade is 10 years, we multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10. This gives us 30 lemons per year * 10 years = 300 lemons.

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we need to first find the initial number of women on the bus. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means the total parts are 5 + 9 = 14.

We can use this ratio to find the number of women on the bus. Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by 14 to find the value of one part. 

84 ÷ 14 = 6

Now, we multiply 6 by 9 to find the number of women on the bus.

6 * 9 = 54

So, there were initially 54 women on the bus. If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who remained is:

54 - 20 = 34

"To find the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost of each sunflower:
$26 ÷ $2 = 13 individual sunflowers per day

Since we want to know the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days, we multiply the number of individual sunflowers per day by 3:
13 * 3 = 39 individual sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Each bouquet costs $8, and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, so we can divide the total earnings by the cost of each bouquet:
$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets per day is:
7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers per day

For 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets is:
84 * 3 = 252 sunflowers

Finally, we add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in bouquets:
39 + 252 = 291 sunflowers

"To figure out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate how many rocks he buys and sells, and then find the difference between his total cost and total revenue.

Adam has $100 to spend on rocks, and each rock costs $5. We can find out how many rocks he buys by dividing his total money by the cost of each rock:

$100 ÷ $5 = 20 rocks

So, Adam buys 20 rocks. Since each rock costs $5, his total cost is:

20 rocks × $5 = $100

Now, let's calculate how many rocks he sells. Adam sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks. To find 60% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.6:

20 × 0.6 = 12 rocks

Adam sells each rock for $7, so his total revenue is:

12 rocks × $7 = $84

To find out how much money he loses, we subtract his total revenue from his total cost:

$100 (total cost) - $84 (total revenue) = $16

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days for each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

However, Lauren can work on different scenes in a single day. A more efficient approach would be to work on the scenes in a way that minimizes the total number of days.

One possible combination is:
- 6 days for medium-sized scenes (36 scenes)
- During these 6 days, she can also work on 6 * 5 = 30 large-sized scenes (leaving 15 large-sized scenes)
- Then, she can work on the remaining 15 large-sized scenes and the 49 small-sized scenes. Since she can do 5 large-sized scenes per day and 7 small-sized scenes per day, she can do the remaining 15 large-sized scenes in 3 days, and the 49 small-sized scenes in 7 days, but she can do the 7 small-sized scenes that are left after 6 days in the 3 days that she is doing the last 15 large-sized scenes.

So, the total number of days is 6 days for medium-sized scenes + 3 days for the remaining large-sized scenes and the remaining small-sized scenes.

The total number of days is 6 + 3 = 9 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of eggs Chatty prepared. Since a dozen is equal to 12, three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we know that Chatty has four children and she wants to distribute the eggs equally among them. To find out how many eggs each child will receive, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

So, we divide 36 eggs by 4 children: 36 ÷ 4 = 9.

Each child will receive 9 eggs.

"To find out how much Jen spends on food in May, we need to calculate the total number of days in May and multiply it by the daily cost of food for the fish.

May has 31 days. Since Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, the daily cost of food for the fish is 3 * $1 = $3. To find the total cost of food for the month of May, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days: 31 days * $3 per day = $93.

"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to follow the order of events. First, she gave 24 roses to her mother, so we subtract 24 from the initial 30 roses. 

30 - 24 = 6

Then, she bought 15 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we add the roses she bought to the roses she had left.

6 + 15 = 21

So, Patricia has 21 roses now.

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours and then an additional 140 miles in 3 hours. So, the total distance traveled is 110 + 140 = 250 miles. The total time taken is 2 + 3 = 5 hours.

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. 

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

Now, we multiply these two probabilities together: 20% * 60% = 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person collected and then divide the total by 3.

Let's start with Jim, who collected 27 seashells. Since Carlos collected 5 less than Jim, we can calculate Carlos' seashells as 27 - 5 = 22.

We're also told that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. To find out how many seashells Carrey collected, we can divide Carlos' seashells by 2. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up the total number of seashells collected: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Finally, since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we can divide the total by 3 to find out how many seashells each person got: 60 / 3 = 20.

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends separately, then add them together.

Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays, which is 5 days (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots.

On weekends, Mason eats 5 carrots each day, which is 2 days (Saturday and Sunday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekends is 5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots.

Now, let's add the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week: 20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6, which gives us 3 minutes. Since the second song is 60% longer, we add these 3 minutes to the original 5 minutes, making the second song 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total time of the cassette: 5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes.

"To find the profit Linus earned, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

First, let's find the total number of devices Linus bought. He bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices is 2 + 4 = 6.

The cost of each device is $20, so the total cost is 6 * $20 = $120.

Since Linus sells each device for twice the original price, the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40. The total selling price is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price: $240 - $120 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to figure out Carl's height first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than her. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we need to divide Carl's height by 2. 

6 / 2 = 3

The length of Carl's cane is 3 feet.

"To figure out how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that one bottle of juice covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs. To find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of a person's daily energy needs, we can divide 100% by 20%, which is the same as dividing 1 by 0.2. This gives us 5 bottles per person.

Now, we need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of 2300 people's daily energy needs. We can do this by multiplying the number of bottles per person (5) by the number of people (2300). This gives us 5 * 2300 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex already produces 4200 bottles per day, we need to subtract this from the total number of bottles needed to find out how many more bottles they need to produce. So, 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, let's find out how many babies are wearing purple and how many are wearing blue. Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them wear purple, we can calculate the number of babies wearing purple by multiplying 8 by 3/4, which gives us 6 babies. The remaining 1/4 wear blue, so 8 * 1/4 = 2 babies wear blue.

Now, we know that all the blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows. To find 1/3 of the purple wearers, we multiply 6 by 1/3, which gives us 2 babies. So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

Out of these 4 babies wearing bows, 2 are wearing purple. To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of babies wearing purple and bows (2) by the total number of babies wearing bows (4), and then multiply by 100.

(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%.

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to break down the problem into parts.

Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land. He sells half of it, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters, for $50.

Next, he sells 1/4 of his original land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30.

Now, let's find out how much land he has left. He started with 80 square meters, sold 40, and then sold 20 more. So, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

Abraham sells this remaining land for $3 per square meter. To find out how much he earns from this, we multiply the amount of land left (20 square meters) by the price per square meter ($3). This gives us 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned: $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $60 (from the third sale) = $140.

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to figure out how many he uses in a day first. Since he changes his face mask 2 times every time he goes out, and he goes out 3 times a day, we multiply the number of times he changes his mask by the number of times he goes out.

So, the number of face masks he uses per day is 2 * 3 = 6 face masks. Now, to find out how many he uses every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses per day by 2.

6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many eggs were found and then subtract that from the total number of eggs hidden.

First, let's find the total number of eggs hidden. Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, and there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we multiply 3 by 12 to get 36 eggs.

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs each person found. Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so she found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs found, we add the eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden to find the number of eggs still hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply that by the number of collections per week and the amount he gets paid per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6, which is 240. Since the last complex is 60% bigger, we add 240 to 400, which gives us 640 apartments.

Now, let's add up the total number of apartments: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he makes 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections per week. He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so we multiply 3120 by 0.40 to find out how much he makes in a week.

3120 * 0.40 = 1248

John makes $1248 in a week."
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in 10 years, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

We know that a 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old tree produces 3 times that amount (3 * 50 = 150), and a 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount (7 * 50 = 350).

For the 8-year-old and 10-year-old trees, we have a bit more information. We know that the 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. We also know that the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

- Year 5: 50
- Year 6: 150
- Year 7: 350
- Year 8: 800
- Year 9: 0 (since it doesn't produce any fruits)

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the lengths of the ropes. We'll call the length of the yellow rope ""y"". Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is y - 7. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4(y - 7).

We know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up an equation:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6y = 72

Divide by 6:
y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
Blue rope = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
Red rope = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4(5) = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to start by figuring out how much money Rissa had initially. We know Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given thrice as much. So, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Next, we know that after they each gave some money to their little sister, Rissa was left with 4/5 of her money. This means she was left with 4/5 * $15 = $12.

Since Rissa had $15 initially and was left with $12, she must have given $15 - $12 = $3 to her little sister.

Now, we know that Ronnie and Rissa each gave the same amount of money to their little sister, which is $3. So, Ronnie was left with $5 - $3 = $2.

"To find the amount of red paint used, we need to break down the information given. The mural has four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. We know that half of the mural is yellow, and the remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple.

Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we can calculate the amount of yellow paint as half of the total.

Yellow paint = 1/2 * 12 pints = 6 pints

Now, we subtract the yellow paint from the total to find the amount of paint used for the other three colors.

Non-yellow paint (red, white, purple) = 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we divide the non-yellow paint by 3 to find the amount of red paint used.

Red paint = 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints

"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom. Since the bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet, we multiply the length and width to get the area: 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, we multiply the area of one bedroom by 4: 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

Next, we find the area of the living room. The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so we multiply the area of one bedroom by 5: 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many dishwasher pods are in the special size box. Since it has 20% more pods than the regular box, we need to calculate 20% of 100. 

20% is the same as 0.2, so we multiply 100 by 0.2 to get 20. This means the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we know the special size box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how much one pod costs, we divide $12 by 120. This gives us $0.1 per pod.

Finally, we need to find out how many cycles we can run for $1. Since each cycle uses one pod and each pod costs $0.1, we divide $1 by $0.1 to get 10.

"To find out how many 5 dollar bills Thomas has, let's break down what happened.

First, Thomas took out $1000 in 20 dollar bills. To find out how many 20 dollar bills he got, we divide $1000 by $20. That's 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

On his way home, he lost 10 of those bills. So now he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

Then, he used half of those bills to pay for something. Half of 40 is 20, so he used 20 bills and had 20 left.

Those 20 bills are worth 20 * $20 = $400.

Next, Thomas tripled his money. So now he has 3 * $400 = $1200.

Finally, he changed all his money to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5. That's 1200 / 5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to break it down into two halves.

In the first half, team A scored 4 goals. Team B scored 2 goals fewer than team A, which means team B scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scored 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, it scored 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half. Team A scored 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the total number of goals scored by each team. Team A scored 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, for a total of 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then determine how many days it will take for him to use up the rest of the chalk.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. To find out how much chalk he used, we multiply 5 inches by 0.45 (which is the same as 45%). This gives us 2.25 inches. So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

The teacher usually uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch per day. However, since the chalk is not full, we need to think about how many days it will take for him to use up the remaining 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher can't write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles it when it's smaller than 2 inches. Let's see how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches.

On the first day, the teacher will have 2.75 - 1 = 1.75 inches left.
On the second day, the teacher will have 1.75 - 1 = 0.75 inches left.

Since 0.75 inches is less than 1 inch, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after the second day of using 20% of the original chalk length per day.

However, the question asks for the number of days before he has to recycle the chalk. Therefore, the answer is 2 days before he has to recycle the chalk on the third day.

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we need to first determine how many students are on varsity. 

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity. So, the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.

There are also 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. So, the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to get the total number of students on varsity: 4 + 3 = 7.

Since there are 24 students in the class (12 boys + 12 girls), we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students to find the number of students not on varsity: 24 - 7 = 17.

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to follow the information given in the problem step by step. 

First, we know Mike bought 5 face masks. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. So, we need to calculate thrice the number of face masks Mike bought. 

Thrice the number of face masks Mike bought is 3 * 5 = 15. Now, we need to add 2 to this number to find out how many face masks Johnny bought. 

15 + 2 = 17

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth the dentist works on. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

Now, we can find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes by dividing the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has, and then multiplying by 100:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

"To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk that had passed the expiry date.

First, we find the total cost of all the milk he bought. Since he bought 4000 gallons at $3.5 per gallon, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon.
Total cost = 4000 * $3.5 = $14,000

Next, we find out how many gallons of milk had passed the expiry date. We know it's 2/5 of the total amount, so we multiply 4000 by 2/5.
2/5 * 4000 = 1600 gallons

Now, we multiply the number of gallons of sour milk by the cost per gallon to find the refund amount.
Refund amount = 1600 * $3.5 = $5600

"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent Wendy's and Colin's current ages. We'll call Wendy's age W and Colin's age C.

We know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as an equation: W = 5(C + 7).

We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as another equation: C + 25 = (1/3)W.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second one. We'll replace W with 5(C + 7) in the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

To simplify this, we'll multiply the terms inside the parentheses by 5:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Now, we'll subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Then, we'll subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Finally, we'll divide both sides by 2:
C = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first figure out how many books he can buy in total. We know that 100 books cost $500, so we can divide the total amount he spends ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500) to get the total number of sets of 100 books he can buy.

Total sets of 100 books = $27000 / $500
Total sets of 100 books = 54

Since each set has 100 books, we multiply the total sets by 100 to get the total number of books.

Total books = 54 * 100
Total books = 5400

Now, to find out how many books he can buy per school, we divide the total number of books by the number of schools (3).

Books per school = Total books / 3
Books per school = 5400 / 3
Books per school = 1800

"To find the total number of apples Newton brought home, let's analyze the situation step by step.

First, two apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up, put one in his pocket, and threw the other one at the tree. This caused five more apples to fall. So, at this point, Newton has one apple in his pocket and five more apples on the ground.

Newton then picked up the five apples, put four of them in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree. This caused six more apples to fall. Now, Newton has a total of five apples in his pocket (one from the initial pick-up and four from the second pick-up) and six more apples on the ground.

Finally, Newton picked up the six apples on the ground and added them to the five apples already in his pocket. Therefore, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 5 + 6 = 11.

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to figure out how many 50 kg bags he ordered and then multiply that by the cost per bag.

First, let's calculate the number of bags. We can do this by dividing the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight per bag (50 kg). 

850 kg ÷ 50 kg = 17 bags

Now that we know Ali ordered 17 bags, we can multiply this by the cost per bag ($18) to find the total cost.

17 bags × $18 per bag = $306

"To figure out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat. 

First, let's look at the cheese pizza. Each of Kate's 6 friends will eat 6 slices of cheese pizza, so they'll eat 6 x 6 = 36 slices in total. Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we can divide 36 by 12 to find out how many cheese pizzas Kate needs. 36 / 12 = 3, so Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas.

Next, let's look at the pepperoni pizza. Each of Kate's 6 friends will eat 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, so they'll eat 6 x 4 = 24 slices in total. Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can divide 24 by 8 to find out how many pepperoni pizzas Kate needs. 24 / 8 = 3, so Kate needs 3 pepperoni pizzas.

In total, Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. To find the total number of pizzas, we add 3 + 3 = 6.

"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on each day and add them up. 

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, so that's 3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles. On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles, so that's 5 miles * 2 days = 10 miles. 

Now, let's add the miles run on each set of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many snowballs Jay gains per minute. Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, which is 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which they melt per minute, we divide 2 by 15, which is 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the net rate at which Jay gains snowballs. This is the rate at which he builds them minus the rate at which they melt. To do this, we need a common denominator, which is 15. So, we convert 1/3 to 5/15. Now we can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15 snowballs per minute.

Since 3/15 can be simplified to 1/5, Jay gains 1/5 snowballs per minute. To find the time it will take him to have 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by 1/5. This is the same as multiplying 60 by 5, which is 300 minutes.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find Jim's current age, we need to figure out how old he was when Digimon first came out, which was 20 years ago. We know that John is 28 now, so we can start by finding John's age 20 years ago.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up a simple equation. If John was 8 and he was twice as old as Jim, then Jim must have been half of John's age.

Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2 = 4

Now, we can find Jim's current age by adding 20 years to his age 20 years ago.

Jim's current age = 4 + 20 = 24

"To find the total number of slices eaten, let's break it down step by step.

First, Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. 

Next, her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, which means he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, we need to add up the slices eaten by each person: Doxa (1 slice) + her sister (2 slices) + her brother (3 slices) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices.

"To find out how many bandages they started with, let's break down the information.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, at the end of the third day, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

However, it's given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means that they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the previous days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

Now, we know that they had 3 bandages left from the previous days at the end of the third day. This 3 bandages is the sum of the bandages left at the end of the first day (12) and the bandages left at the end of the second day. Since they used 28 bandages on the second day and only had 12 left from the first day, they must have had 28 - 12 = 16 more bandages at the start of the second day. This means they had 16 more bandages at the start of the first day.

So, the total bandages they had at the start of the first day is 50 (from the bulk pack) + 12 (left at the end of the first day) + 16 (extra bandages) = 78.

"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and add it to the cost of the color. 

First, let's find out how many inches of hair were cut off. May's hair was originally 10 inches, and after the cut, it was 8 inches. So, the difference is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

Since the cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, we multiply the number of inches cut off by the cost per inch: 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color: $60 + $40 = $100.

"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate how many hours she works in a month and multiply that by her hourly rate. We also need to add the extra money she gets for having perfect attendance.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. So, in a week, she works 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 45 * 4 = 180 hours.

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so she earns 180 * $1.5 = $270 from her hours worked.

Since she had perfect attendance for the whole month, she gets an extra $10 for each of the 4 weeks. That's 4 * $10 = $40.

Adding the money she earned from working and the extra money for perfect attendance, we get $270 + $40 = $310.

First, let's look at the amount Jason earned from emptying the dishwasher. He emptied it 6 times and got paid $0.50 each time, so that's 6 x $0.50 = $3.00.

Next, Jason did his laundry once and got paid $3.00 for it.

He also took the trash out twice and got paid $0.75 each time, so that's 2 x $0.75 = $1.50.

Lastly, Jason cleaned his room once and got paid $1.50 for it.

Now, let's add up the total amount Jason earned: $3.00 (dishwasher) + $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (trash) + $1.50 (room) = $9.00.

"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to break it down step by step.

First, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. So, the total number of people who entered up to 10:00 is 50 + 40 = 90.

After that, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is 2 * 40 = 80. Now, we add this to the previous total: 90 + 80 = 170.

Finally, three times as many people as the number that came in first entered the restaurant in the evening. The number that came in first was 50, so three times that is 3 * 50 = 150. We add this to the previous total: 170 + 150 = 320.

So, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320.

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

First, let's find the number of red pens. Since Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack has 5 pens, we multiply the number of packs by the number of pens per pack: 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Next, we find the number of black pens. Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, so she bought 2 * 5 packs = 10 packs of black pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, we multiply the number of packs by the number of pens per pack: 10 packs * 5 pens/pack = 50 black pens.

Now, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens to find the total number of pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

"To find the total amount John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of one bottle of scotch. Since John bought 10 bottles for $600, we can divide $600 by 10 to get the cost per bottle: $600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cognac. John bought twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he bought 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac. The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch per bottle. To find 50% of $60, we multiply $60 by 0.5, which gives us $30. So, the cost of cognac per bottle is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles × $90 per bottle = $1800.

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch ($600) to the cost of the cognac ($1800) to get the total amount John spent: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than he did on the first day. 1/4 of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees.

Now, we add the total number of trees planted on both days: 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees.

First, we know that one-third of the fish have red stripes. Since there are 66 fish in total, we can calculate the number of fish with red stripes by dividing 66 by 3.

66 ÷ 3 = 22

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. We are told that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. To find the number of remaining fish, we subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

66 - 22 = 44

Now, we can calculate 5/11 of the remaining fish.

(5/11) × 44 = 20

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to find the total.

Her sister took one of the palettes, so Amy lost 4 colors. Now she has 8 - 4 = 4 colors from the palettes. The makeup sets still have 18 colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Half of 6 is 3, so she used 3 colors. Now she has 18 - 3 = 15 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy has 4 colors from the palettes and 15 colors from the makeup sets. So, she has 4 + 15 = 19 colors left.

First, let's look at the low setting. It removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

Next, the medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters/day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

Finally, the high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters/day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so we multiply $25 by 11 to find the total amount he pays in the first 11 months: $25 * 11 = $275.

Finally, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month: $306 - $275 = $31.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to calculate the total number of diapers changed for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan also changes half of the diapers. To find out how many diapers Jordan changes, we divide the total number of diaper changes by 2.

10 / 2 = 5

"To solve this problem, we need to find the volume of the jar and then calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in it. The jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. 

First, we find the area of the base by multiplying the sides: 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. Then, we multiply the base area by the height to get the volume: 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans don't fill the jar perfectly, we need to account for the packing efficiency, which is 80%. So, we multiply the volume by 0.8: 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we know that each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches. To find the total number of jelly beans, we divide the volume of jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean: 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

The problem states that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3: 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

We're told that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off the guess was, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 864 = 36.

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after the third station and subtract that from the bus's capacity.

Let's start with the initial number of people on the bus, which is 20. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people after the first stop is 20 + 40 = 60.

On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered the bus at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, the total number of people after the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90.

If the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, the total number of people after the third stop is 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the total number of people after the third stop from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find out how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 5 years and the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, and each visit costs $2. So, she spends 2 * 3 = $6 per year. Since she does this for 5 years, she spends a total of 6 * 5 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit goes up by 150%. This means the new cost is the original $2 plus 150% of $2, which is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5. Now, Pauline spends 5 * 3 = $15 per year. For the next 3 years, she spends a total of 15 * 3 = $45.

To find the total amount Pauline spent, we add the cost of the first 5 years and the next 3 years: 30 + 45 = $75.

"To determine how long it will take for all the students to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of students and divide them into groups of 8, since that's the maximum number of students that can try the escape room at a time.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students each who get to try the escape room. So, the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, we divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups: 40 / 8 = 5 groups.

Since each group uses the full 45 minutes, we multiply the number of groups by the time per group to find the total time: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the roof frames.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tables. John made 4 tables for $20 each, so the total cost of the tables is 4 x $20 = $80.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames. John made 2 roof frames for $10 each, so the total cost of the roof frames is 2 x $10 = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay John. $80 + $20 = $100.

"To find the length of the longer piece, let's break it down step by step. We know the board is 40 feet long and Ian wants to cut it into two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece.

Let's say the length of the shorter piece is x. Then, the length of the longer piece is 4x. Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up an equation: x + 4x = 40.

Combine the x terms: 5x = 40.

Now, divide both sides by 5: x = 8.

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. To find the length of the longer piece, multiply x by 4: 4 * 8 = 32.

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To figure out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to find out how many pounds of ground beef he's using. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can divide 80 by 16.

80 ÷ 16 = 5

So, Aiden is using 5 pounds of meat. Now, we know he adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat. To find the total amount of seasoning needed, we multiply the number of pounds of meat by 2.

5 * 2 = 10

Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning."
"To find out how much fabric Luke should buy, we need to calculate the total width of the windows first. Since there are 5 windows, each 35 inches wide, we multiply the number of windows by the width of each window.

Total width of the windows = 5 * 35 = 175 inches

The problem states that Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * 175 = 350 inches

"To find the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts. The first 16 minutes cost $0.25 per minute, and the remaining 20 minutes cost $0.20 per minute.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first 16 minutes:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the remaining 20 minutes:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

Now, we add the cost of the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes to get the total cost:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate twice of Monday's total and add 1 inch.

First, we know it rained 2 inches on Monday. Twice of that would be 2 * 2 = 4 inches. Since it's expected to rain 1 more inch than that on Tuesday, we add 1 inch to the total.

So, Tuesday's total is 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using a variable to represent the number of cupcakes Carly made. Let's call this number 'c'. We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so the number of brownies is 3c - 2.

Since each person in Carly's class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide by 4: c = 3

The number of cupcakes Carly made is 3."
"To find the total cost of Karen's salon visit, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount, and then add the cost of the nail art.

First, let's find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure. A basic manicure costs $35, and a pedicure costs $40, so together they cost $35 + $40 = $75. The salon offers a 20% discount if you get both, so we need to find 20% of $75. To do this, we multiply $75 by 0.20, which gives us $15. This is the amount of the discount. So, the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we need to find the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers. The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of the nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, we add the cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art to find the total cost. The total cost is $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find the total number of magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

First, let's look at the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year. Since there are 3 of them, we multiply 3 by 12 to get 36 issues.

Next, we have 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. We don't need to do any calculations for this one, it's just 6 issues.

The last magazine is a bit trickier. It sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine. So, we multiply 6 by 4 to get 24 issues.

Now, let's add up all the issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to calculate the price after the increase in December and then the decrease in January.

First, let's find the price in December. The toy's price increased by 80% of $40. To find 80% of $40, we multiply $40 by 0.8, which is $32. So, the price in December is $40 + $32 = $72.

Next, let's find the price in January. The price decreased by 50% of $72. To find 50% of $72, we multiply $72 by 0.5, which is $36. So, the price in January is $72 - $36 = $36.

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find out how much money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from his standard rate lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with the veteran.

Charlie's standard rate is $80 per hour, and he has 4 1-hour lessons at this rate. So, he earns 4 x $80 = $320 from these lessons.

For the lessons with the veteran, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. To find the reduced rate, we need to find 25% of $80 and subtract it from $80. 25% of $80 is 0.25 x $80 = $20. So, the reduced rate is $80 - $20 = $60 per hour. Charlie has 2 1-hour lessons with the veteran, so he earns 2 x $60 = $120 from these lessons.

Now, we add the amount Charlie earns from the standard rate lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with the veteran to find the total amount of money he will make for the day: $320 + $120 = $440.

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to figure out how many she had left and subtract that from the original amount.

Since Eve was left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can calculate it by multiplying 20 (the original amount) by 1/4 or 0.25. 
20 * 0.25 = 5

So, Eve was left with 5 pomelos. Now, to find out how many she gave away, we subtract the remaining amount from the original amount:

"To find out how much money Walter received, we need to calculate the number of apples he sold to his uncle.

First, let's find out how many apples Walter ate. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 apples, we multiply 60 by 2/5. This gives us (60 * 2) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples eaten.

Now, we subtract the apples eaten from the total to find the remaining apples: 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25 (since 25% is the same as 0.25). This gives us 36 * 0.25 = 9 apples given to his sister.

We subtract the apples given to his sister from the remaining apples: 36 - 9 = 27 apples.

Finally, Walter sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple: 27 * 3 = 81 dollars.

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we need to figure out what number 9 is 3/4 of. Think of it like this: if 9 is 3/4 of the total, then the total is the whole, and 9 is just a part of it.

We can set up a simple equation to solve this. Let's say the total number of novels written this year is x. Since 9 is 3/4 of x, we can write it as 9 = (3/4)x.

To find x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4/3, which is the opposite of 3/4. This gives us x = 9 * (4/3).

Now, let's do the math: x = 9 * (4/3) = 12.

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To find the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we need to calculate the distance he traveled and then compare it to the total distance between Alaska and Texas.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr, and he traveled for 3 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total hours he traveled is:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the distance covered, we will divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

"To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning and divide it by the total time available.

First, let's find the total time spent cleaning. There are 80 classrooms, and it takes 15 minutes to clean each one. So, the total time spent cleaning is:
80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since the custodian has 5 days to clean the school, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by 5:
1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes per day

Now, we need to convert the total time available per day from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning:
(240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.

"To figure out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to calculate the total number of books one bookcase can hold. 

Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so together they can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which is 2 * 10 = 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books one bookcase can hold: 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold to find out how many bookcases she needs: 110 / 55 = 2.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate how much she spent on the eggs and how much she'll make from selling them.

First, let's figure out how many eggs she bought. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 5 dozens would be 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. The cost of these eggs is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Now, let's calculate how much she'll make from selling the eggs. She's selling them for $1 for every 3 eggs. So, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 3 to find out how many sets she can sell. 60 eggs / 3 eggs per set = 20 sets. Since each set is sold for $1, she'll make 20 x $1 = $20.

To find her profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $20 (revenue) - $12 (cost) = $8.

Now, we have 100 - 50 = 50 hats left. 

Out of these 50 hats, 3/5 are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply 50 by 3/5. This gives us (50 * 3) / 5 = 150 / 5 = 30 blue hats.

Since the rest of the hats are white, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats. So, the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount and then divide it by the number of sticks.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, but it's on sale for $3.00 off. So, the new price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since we want to find the cost per stick in cents, we need to convert the total cost to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so $15.00 is equal to 15 x 100 = 1500 cents.

Now, we know that there are 30 sticks in a bag. To find the cost per stick, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks: 1500 cents / 30 sticks = 50 cents per stick.

"To figure out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many questions she got right on the first test. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct. To find 60% of 70, we multiply 0.6 by 70, which gives us 42 questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions she needs to get right in total to pass. There are a total of 70 + 40 = 110 questions in both tests. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, we multiply 0.7 by 110, which gives us 77 questions.

Since Audrey already got 42 questions correct on the first test, we subtract that from the total number of questions she needs to get right: 77 - 42 = 35.

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of strawberry and blueberry cubes. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is 's' and the number of blueberry cubes is 'b'.

We know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as an equation: b = 5s - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes is 116. This can be written as another equation: s + b = 116.

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation. This gives us: s + (5s - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6s - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6s = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: s = 20.

Now that we know 's', we can find 'b' by substituting 's' into the first equation: b = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To figure out how many phone calls Jason needs to make, let's break it down step by step.

First, Jason needs to sell 15 cars to get his bonus. We know that for every 2 people who come into the dealership, 1 car is sold. So, to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 x 2 = 30 people to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 phone calls Jason makes, 1 person comes into the dealership. To get 30 people to come in, we need to multiply 30 by 25, since that's how many calls it takes to get 1 person in the door. So, 30 x 25 = 750.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate each type separately.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. Since there's one flashlight for each person, and there are 4 people, that's 4 flashlights. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms, so that's 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights. The total number of flashlights is 4 + 16 = 20.

Now, let's calculate the number of candles. Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since half of 8 is 4, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other 4 have 5 medium candles each. The total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16, and the total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20. The total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles to get the final answer.

Since Mitchell bought 2 bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members, which is 5. 

Chips per person = Total number of chips / Number of family members
Chips per person = 110 / 5
Chips per person = 22

So, each person gets 22 chips.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes John to complete each side of the Rubik's cube and then add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes. The second and third sides take twice as long as the first side, so they take 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each. The last two sides take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides: 
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes.

Number of footballs = 2 * 20
Number of footballs = 40

Now, we know there are half as many robots as helmets. So, we can find the number of robots by dividing the number of helmets by 2.
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

To find the total number of items, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40

First, let's calculate the total minutes Tim spends at work in a day. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and he works 6 hours a day, so that's 6 x 60 = 360 minutes per day.

Since he works 5 days a week, we multiply the minutes per day by 5: 360 x 5 = 1800 minutes.

Now, we know it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call. To find the total number of calls, we divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call: 1800 ÷ 15 = 120.

"To find out how much longer it'll take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for each type of varnish.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry per painting. For 6 paintings, that's 7 minutes * 6 paintings = 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry per painting. For 6 paintings, that's 12 minutes * 6 paintings = 72 minutes.

Now, let's find the difference in time: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs for her plants, we need to calculate the total amount of water required for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's consider the 4 plants that need half a cup of water each. Since half a cup is 0.5 cups, we multiply 4 by 0.5 to get 2 cups of water.

Next, we have 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each. So, we multiply 8 by 1 to get 8 cups of water.

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. That leaves us with 20 - 12 = 8 plants. These plants need a quarter of a cup of water each, which is 0.25 cups. We multiply 8 by 0.25 to get 2 cups of water.

Finally, we add up the water needed for each group: 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups of water.

"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the time it takes for him to hop on land and the time it takes for him to swim through water.

Since half of the 200-yard distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the distance for each part: 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

Phineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so the time it takes for him to cover the 100 yards on land is: 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

He swims through water at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so the time it takes for him to cover the 100 yards in water is: 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the time on land and the time in water: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

"To find the total cost of the popsicle sticks, we need to calculate how many boxes Bob needs to buy. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks, we can divide the total number of sticks needed (56) by the number of sticks per box (8).

56 ÷ 8 = 7

This means Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks. Now, we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box ($2.00) to find the total cost.

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

The final answer is: $14.00"
"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the additional phones. The main phone costs $20. Since it costs twice as much as each additional phone, we can find the cost of an additional phone by dividing $20 by 2, which is $10.

There are 4 additional phones, so we multiply $10 by 4 to get the total cost of the additional phones, which is $40.

Now, we add the cost of the main phone ($20) to the cost of the additional phones ($40) to get the total cost of the phone plan. 

$20 + $40 = $60

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts sold and multiply it by the price per doughnut.

Derrick's bakery makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, Derrick's bakery makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts made in June is 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts.

Now, we multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut to find the total amount of money Derrick makes in June. 3600 * $2 = $7200.

"To figure out how many days Jade will need to upload all her photos, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many batches of photos Jade has. Since she uploads 7 photos in one batch, we divide the total number of photos (210) by the number of photos per batch (7). 

210 ÷ 7 = 30 batches

Now that we know Jade has 30 batches of photos, we need to find out how many days it'll take her to upload them all. We're told she uploads 6 batches each day. To find out how many days she needs, we divide the total number of batches (30) by the number of batches per day (6).

30 ÷ 6 = 5 days

"To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to calculate the total cost of her weekly drop-off and then multiply it by 5.

Alicia drops off 5 blouses, 2 pants, and 1 skirt every week. The dry cleaners charge her $5.00 per blouse, $6.00 per skirt, and $8.00 per pair of pants. 

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- 5 blouses * $5.00 = $25.00
- 2 pants * $8.00 = $16.00
- 1 skirt * $6.00 = $6.00
Now, add up the costs: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Since Alicia does this every week, we multiply the weekly cost by 5 to get the total cost for 5 weeks: $47.00 * 5 = $235.00

"To find out how long it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to figure out how many words he can say in a minute and then divide the total number of words by that number.

First, we need to find out how many words John can say in a minute after his training. He started at 150 words per minute (WPM), but now he's 2.5 times faster. So, we multiply 150 by 2.5 to get his new speed:
150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Next, we need to find out how many words are in 10 pages. Since each page has 450 words, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page:
10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we can find out how long it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed. We do this by dividing the total number of words by his new speed:
4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to break it down day by day. 

On the first day, there were 50 people at the beach. The next day, 20 more people showed up, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 people. On the third day, the number of people doubled from the second day, which is 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people for the first three days: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

For the rest of the week, which is 4 days, Conor saw an average of 60 people per day. So, the total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 4 = 240 people.

To find the total number of people Conor saw that week, we add the people from the first three days and the rest of the week: 260 + 240 = 500 people.

Total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:

"To find the total number of popped kernels, let's break it down step by step.

First, 20 kernels popped in the first 30 seconds. Then, in the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

Next, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate in the next 30 seconds. Since the initial rate was 20 kernels, four times that is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

After that, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds in the final 30 seconds. Since the past 30 seconds had 80 kernels, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

Finally, after taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped. Since 40 kernels popped in the final 30 seconds, a quarter of that is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of popped kernels: 
20 + 60 = 80 
80 + 80 = 160 
160 + 40 = 200 
200 + 10 = 210

"To figure out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required. For the 4 gallons of regular lemonade, he needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon, so that's 4 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he'll need 4 * 6 = 24 lemons for the regular lemonade.

For the extra gallon that's twice as tart, he'll need twice the amount of lemon juice, which is 2 cups. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he'll need 2 * 6 = 12 lemons for the extra gallon.

Now, let's add the lemons needed for the regular lemonade and the extra gallon: 24 + 12 = 36 lemons.

"To find out how many kilograms of dog food the Kennel house needs in a week, we need to calculate the total amount of food each type of dog eats in a week.

First, let's find out how much food the German Shepherds eat in a week. Since there are 3 German Shepherds and each one eats 5 kilograms of dog food per day, they eat 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms per day. To find out how much they eat in a week, we multiply this by 7: 15 * 7 = 105 kilograms.

Next, let's calculate how much food the Bulldogs eat in a week. There are 2 Bulldogs, and each one eats 3 kilograms of dog food per day, so they eat 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms per day. To find out how much they eat in a week, we multiply this by 7: 6 * 7 = 42 kilograms.

Now, we add the total amount of food the German Shepherds and Bulldogs eat in a week: 105 + 42 = 147 kilograms.

"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the total number of legs first. 

The farm has 10 animals with 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from these animals is 10 * 2 = 20. 

The farm also has 15 animals with 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from these animals is 15 * 4 = 60.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of animals: 20 + 60 = 80.

Since each pair of legs consists of 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the total number of pairs: 80 / 2 = 40.

"To find the number of red blocks in the tower, we need to first figure out how many yellow blocks there are. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and we know there are 4 blue blocks, we can calculate the number of yellow blocks by multiplying the number of blue blocks by 2. 

Number of yellow blocks = 2 * Number of blue blocks
Number of yellow blocks = 2 * 4
Number of yellow blocks = 8

Now that we know the number of yellow blocks, we can find the total number of blue and yellow blocks by adding them together.

Total number of blue and yellow blocks = Number of blue blocks + Number of yellow blocks
Total number of blue and yellow blocks = 4 + 8
Total number of blue and yellow blocks = 12

We're told that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32. To find the number of red blocks, we subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks.

Number of red blocks = Total number of blocks - Total number of blue and yellow blocks
Number of red blocks = 32 - 12
Number of red blocks = 20

"To find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to figure out the distance he traveled in each direction. We know he drove at an average speed of 18 miles per hour for both parts of the trip.

First, let's calculate the distance he traveled west. Distance equals speed times time, so for the west trip, it's 18 miles per hour times 5 hours, which is 90 miles.

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled east. Again, distance equals speed times time, so for the east trip, it's 18 miles per hour times 8 hours, which is 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east to find out how far he is from his house. That's 144 miles minus 90 miles, which equals 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house."
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

First, let's calculate the depreciation for the first year. The boat depreciated 30% of its original price of $9000. To find 30% of $9000, we multiply $9000 by 0.3. 

$9000 * 0.3 = $2700

So, the boat depreciated by $2700 in the first year. To find its value after the first year, we subtract the depreciation from the original price.

$9000 - $2700 = $6300

Now, let's calculate the depreciation for the second year. The boat depreciated another 30% of its value after the first year, which is $6300. To find 30% of $6300, we multiply $6300 by 0.3.

$6300 * 0.3 = $1890

So, the boat depreciated by $1890 in the second year. To find its value after the second year, we subtract the depreciation from the value after the first year.

$6300 - $1890 = $4410

Finally, let's calculate the depreciation for the third year. The boat depreciated 20% of its value after the second year, which is $4410. To find 20% of $4410, we multiply $4410 by 0.2.

$4410 * 0.2 = $882

So, the boat depreciated by $882 in the third year. To find its value after the third year, we subtract the depreciation from the value after the second year.

$4410 - $882 = $3528

"To find the number of pink candies, we need to determine the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies first. 

We know there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, we multiply 54 by 2 to get 108 orange candies. For the yellow candies, we have half as many as red candies, so we divide 54 by 2 to get 27 yellow candies.

Now, we add the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

"To find the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay and the cost of the bus rides separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel stay. Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights, and one night at the hotel costs $80. So, the total cost of the hotel stay is 3 nights * $80 per night = $240.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the bus rides. Each bus ride costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. To find 10% of $80, we multiply $80 by 0.1, which gives us $8 per bus ride. Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus rides is 7 * $8 = $56.

Now, let's add the cost of the hotel stay and the cost of the bus rides to find the total cost of Helen's trip. The total cost is $240 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $296.

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to determine the number of marbles Dallas received from Mazie. Since Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, we can calculate the number of marbles Dallas had initially by adding the dropped marbles to the current total. 

So, Dallas initially had 21 (current marbles) + 4 (dropped marbles) = 25 marbles.

Now, we know that Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins. To find out how many marbles Darla received, we subtract the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles given by Mazie. 

Number of marbles given to Darla = Total marbles - Number of marbles given to Dallas

"To find the total cost of the family's trip to the cinema, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets. The family consists of two adults and one child. The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $8. So, the total cost of the tickets is:
2 adult tickets = 2 * $12 = $24
1 child ticket = $8
Total ticket cost = $24 + $8 = $32

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorns. The family buys 2 popcorns for $3 each, so the total cost of the popcorns is:
2 popcorns = 2 * $3 = $6

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns to find the total cost:
Total cost = $32 (tickets) + $6 (popcorns) = $38

"To find the force needed to push the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car, the luggage, and the two children. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children weigh 75 pounds each. So, the total weight of the children is 2 * 75 = 150 pounds. 

Now, we add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children: 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds.

The problem states that the force to move the car is 1% of the weight. To find 1% of the total weight, we multiply the total weight by 0.01 (since 1% is the same as 0.01). 

So, the force needed to push the car is 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds.

"To find the total length of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is the distance around the outside of the shape. Since James' fence is a rectangle, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).

Given the length of the fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2(35)
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang from his backyard fence.

"To find out how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week.

First, let's figure out how much feed each pig eats in a day. Since each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, that's a total of 4 * 2 = 8 pounds per pig per day.

Now, since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

To find out how much feed they eat in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). So, 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the amount they ate from the total amount ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To figure out how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of hot dogs per guest.

20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we subtract those from the total number of hot dogs required.

40 hot dogs - 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, we divide the number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack.

36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs

"To find the total number of children following the truck, let's analyze the situation step by step.

First, we start with 5 children on the first street. On the second street, each of these 5 children is joined by another child, effectively doubling the number of children. So, we have 5 * 2 = 10 children now.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children. This means each of the 10 children becomes a group of 3 (the original child and 2 new ones). So, we multiply the number of children by 3: 10 * 3 = 30 children.

However, the original 5 children then give up and leave the group. To find the final number of children, we subtract the original 5 from the total: 30 - 5 = 25.

"To find the total time Charisma spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to break it down.

Charisma meditates 15 minutes, twice a day. That's 30 minutes a day. Since there are 7 days in a week, she meditates 30 * 7 = 210 minutes a week. In 4 weeks, that's 210 * 4 = 840 minutes.

She also practices yoga 1 hour a day, 5 days a week. That's 60 * 5 = 300 minutes a week. In 4 weeks, that's 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we add the total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

To make it easier to understand, we can convert the total time to hours: 2040 / 60 = 34 hours.

"To find the total square feet of the quilt, we need to calculate the total square feet of fabric from each type of shirt and add them together.

First, let's calculate the total square feet from the small shirts. Since each small shirt is 3 square feet, we multiply the number of small shirts (11) by the square feet per small shirt (3). This gives us 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.

Next, we calculate the total square feet from the medium shirts. Each medium shirt is 4 square feet, so we multiply the number of medium shirts (8) by the square feet per medium shirt (4). This gives us 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.

Finally, we calculate the total square feet from the large shirts. Each large shirt is 6 square feet, so we multiply the number of large shirts (6) by the square feet per large shirt (6). This gives us 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

Now, we add the total square feet from each type of shirt to find the total square feet of the quilt: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

Now, we know Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so we can find Jackie's current height by subtracting 2 inches from Anne's height.

Jackie's current height = Anne's height - 2""
Jackie's current height = 72"" - 2""
Jackie's current height = 70""

Since Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, we can find her height before summer by subtracting 3 inches from her current height.

Jackie's height before summer = Jackie's current height - 3""
Jackie's height before summer = 70"" - 3""
Jackie's height before summer = 67""

"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling the chocolate bars, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and multiply it by the price per bar.

First, let's find out how many bars the company produces in a week. Since it produces 5000 bars per day and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bars produced in a week is:
5000 bars/day * 7 days/week = 35000 bars/week

Now, we need to find out how many bars the company will produce in two weeks:
35000 bars/week * 2 weeks = 70000 bars

The company sells each bar for $2, so the total amount of money it will receive is:
70000 bars * $2/bar = $140000

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt, which is $8. For the second T-shirt, he gets 50% off, so he pays half of $8, which is $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and it's 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply $40 by 0.4, which gives us $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends. $12 + $24 = $36.

"To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings from doing chores and then subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for doing chores, and he did his chores for 3 weeks. So, his total earnings are $6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of ice cream cones is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of ice cream cones from his total earnings: $18 - $5 = $13.

Ryan has $13 left to spend on movie tickets, and each ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we'll divide the amount of money he has by the cost of a ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

"To find the total amount Ellen and Lani spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item they bought and add them together.

Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, Ellen spent $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes for $100 each. The cost of the two bathrobes is 2 * $100 = $200. So, Lani spent $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, we add the amount Ellen spent to the amount Lani spent: $105 + $230 = $335.

"To find the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the total cost of making 10 jars and subtract it from the total revenue.

First, let's find the cost of making one jar. The ingredients needed for one jar are 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey. The cost of these ingredients is:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20
So, the total cost of making one jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Now, let's find the total cost of making 10 jars: $44 * 10 = $440.

The revenue from selling 10 jars at $50 each is: $50 * 10 = $500.

The profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost: $500 - $440 = $60.

"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

First, let's start with the quarters. There are 32 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25. So, the total value of the quarters is 32 * $0.25 = $8.

Next, we have 95 dimes. Each dime is worth $0.10, so the total value of the dimes is 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.

Then, there are 120 nickels. Each nickel is worth $0.05, so the total value of the nickels is 120 * $0.05 = $6.

Finally, we have 750 pennies. Each penny is worth $0.01, so the total value of the pennies is 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add up the values of all the coins:
$8 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the amount her parents gave her.

First, let's add up the cost of the items she bought. The ice cream cost $3.50, the movie tickets cost $7.50 each, and she bought two of them, so that's $7.50 * 2 = $15. The bracelet cost $8.50. 

Now, let's add up the total cost: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27.

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the amount her parents gave her: $40 - $27 = $13.

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to figure out how many days he works and how many cars he services.

Josh is open 5 days a week, since he's closed on Sunday and Wednesday. In 2 weeks, that's 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, he services a total of 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars in 2 weeks.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings. Josh gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings are 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, let's break down what happened step by step.

Randy started with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. That's a total of 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies.

For his early day snack, Randy ate 1 oatmeal cookie, 1 chocolate chip cookie, and 1 sugar cookie. So, he had 8 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies left.

Then, Randy ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. Now, he has 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies.

After that, Randy gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he had 6 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies left.

Finally, Randy baked 4 of each flavor for dinner. Now, he has 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies, 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies.

To find the total number of cookies Randy has now, we add the number of each type of cookie: 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies.

"To find out how much money Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he'd get for each half of the collection and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 toy soldiers, half of the collection would be 6 toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for the first half, so that's 6 * $5 = $30.

For the other half, the buyer is willing to pay $7 per toy, so that's 6 * $7 = $42.

Now, we just need to add the amounts for both halves together: $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. Since the dog digs 6 holes a day and Nate is away for 14 days, the total number of holes is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

When Nate gets back, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes per day.

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day. To do this, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Finally, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the number of days by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is than the enrollment at Butler High School, we need to first figure out how many students Butler High School enrolls on average.

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply 4000 (the average enrollment at Norman High School) by 3/4. 

3/4 * 4000 = 3000

So, Butler High School enrolls 3000 students on average. Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

4000 - 3000 = 1000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested. Since Dr. Grumpus asked for 16 test tubes, Igor gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

Next, Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested. Dr. Grumpus asked for 14 Petri dishes, so Igor gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

Now, let's consider the beakers. Dr. Grumpus asked for 7 beakers, but Igor lost some on the way to the lab bench. We don't know how many beakers Igor lost yet, so let's call that number x. This means Igor actually placed 7 - x beakers on the lab bench.

We know that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29. We can set up an equation to represent this:

8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + 7 - x (beakers) = 29

Combine the numbers:
31 - x = 29

Subtract 31 from both sides:
-x = -2

Multiply both sides by -1:
x = 2

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to figure out the total number of screws needed for the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws needed for one table is 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, we multiply the number of screws needed for one table by 4. This gives us 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

Now, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws James has. He has 40 screws, so we do 40 - 32 = 8.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to figure out how many eggs are in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2. 

The first basket has 10 eggs, so the second basket has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs. Now, we just need to add the number of eggs in both baskets together: 10 + 20 = 30.

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each person and then add them together.

First, we know Alexandra raised $430. Since Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, we can find Kim's total by adding $320 to Alexandra's amount: $430 + $320 = $750.

Next, we know Sarah raised $300. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so we can find Maryam's total by adding $400 to Sarah's amount: $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each person: 
Alexandra's $430 + Kim's $750 + Sarah's $300 + Maryam's $700 = $2180.

The total amount of money raised is $2180."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron. This means that Aaron ran half the distance that Vanessa ran, which is 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

We also know that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can find out how long it took him to run 1 mile by dividing the total time by the distance. So, Aaron ran 1 mile in 16 / 2 = 8 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, it would take Vanessa twice as long to run 1 mile. Therefore, Vanessa would take 8 * 2 = 16 minutes to run 1 mile.

To find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles, we can multiply the time it took her to run 1 mile by the total distance. So, Vanessa took 16 * 4 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To find out how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to figure out the total amount of line required for the docks. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3.

200 * 3 = 600 feet

This means he needs a total of 600 feet of line. However, he already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract that from the total amount needed.

600 - 6 = 594 feet

"To figure out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, let's calculate how much each reservation spends. They order 2 meals at $5 each, so that's 2 x $5 = $10. They also get a $5 bottle of wine, so the total for each reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, we multiply the amount each reservation spends by 6. That's 6 x $15 = $90 per night.

Now, we know the restaurant is open 2 days a week. To find out how much they make in a week, we multiply the amount they make per night by 2. That's 2 x $90 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the cost price of each watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons to get the cost price of one watermelon.

Cost price of 1 watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
= $80 / 50
= $1.60

The vendor sold the watermelons at a 25% profit. To find the profit amount, we multiply the cost price by the profit percentage.

Profit amount per watermelon = 25% of $1.60
= 0.25 * $1.60
= $0.40

Now, we add the profit amount to the cost price to get the selling price.

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit amount per watermelon
= $1.60 + $0.40
= $2.00

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to figure out his current age. 

First, let's find out how old Dora is now. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, we subtract 3 from 12 to get her current age. So, Dora is 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

Now, we know James is twice as old as Dora. To find James' age, we multiply Dora's age by 2. James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

John was 19 years old when James was born. This means the age difference between John and James is 19 years.

Since James is 18 years old, we add 19 to James' age to find John's current age. John is 18 + 19 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the age difference between John and his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

This means John's youngest son is 5 years old now. To find his age in 3 years, we add 3 to 5. In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many oranges Ana and Jane can peel in an hour. 

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour. Since Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, we can divide the total minutes in an hour (60) by the time it takes her to peel an orange (3 minutes). 

60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges

Now, let's do the same for Jane. Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so we'll divide the total minutes in an hour (60) by the time it takes her to peel an orange (4 minutes).

60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Since the question asks how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane, we need to subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled.

20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5

"To find out how much Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

First, let's find the cost of the radiator. Mark got it for 80% off, which means he paid 20% of the original price. The original price is $400, so we need to find 20% of $400. To do this, we multiply $400 by 0.20 (which is the same as 20%).

$400 * 0.20 = $80

So, the radiator cost $80.

Next, let's find the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic worked for 3 hours at $50 per hour. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate.

$50 * 3 = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total cost.

$80 + $150 = $230

"To solve this problem, we need to use a system of equations. Let's say the number of chickens is 'c' and the number of cows is 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. Since the total number of legs is 70, we can write another equation:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve these equations to find the number of chickens. First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:

c + 2w = 35

Next, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to get:

c + 2w - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'w' into the first equation:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

The final answer is: 5"
