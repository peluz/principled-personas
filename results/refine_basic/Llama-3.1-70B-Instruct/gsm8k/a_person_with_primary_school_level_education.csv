"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs every day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins. So, she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. That means she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left to sell.

She sells each egg for $2. To find out how much money she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price of each egg. So, 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"So we need to find out how many bolts of fiber it takes to make a robe. The robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber. It also needs half that much white fiber. Half of 2 is 1. So it needs 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, let's add the blue and white fiber together. 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts.

"Josh bought a house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. That's a total of $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs made the house worth 150% more. That means it's now 2.5 times the price Josh paid for it. So, the new price is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

To find the profit, we need to subtract the total cost from the new price. The profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Wendi has 20 chickens. Each chicken needs 3 cups of food every day. So, we need to find out how much food 20 chickens need. 

20 chickens * 3 cups of food = 60 cups of food.

Wendi gives them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, we need to add those two numbers together. 

15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Now, we need to find out how much food is left to give them. We do that by taking the total amount of food (60 cups) and subtracting the food they already had (40 cups).

60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"Carla is downloading a big file. It's 200 GB. She can download 2 GB in one minute. 

First, she downloads some of the file, but then her computer turns off and she has to start again. She downloaded 40% of the file before it turned off. 40% of 200 GB is 80 GB. To download 80 GB, it takes her 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Then her computer turns off for 20 minutes. After that, she has to download the whole file again. It's 200 GB, so it takes her 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

So, in total, it takes her 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes.

"John drove his car for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. To find out how far he went, we multiply 3 hours by 60 miles per hour. That's 3 x 60 = 180 miles.

Then, he turned around and drove back home. But he got stuck in traffic for 2 hours and didn't move. After that, he drove for half an hour at 30 miles per hour. To find out how far he went, we multiply half an hour by 30 miles per hour. Half an hour is the same as 0.5 hours. So, 0.5 x 30 = 15 miles.

After that, he drove for 1.5 hours at 80 miles per hour. To find out how far he went, we multiply 1.5 hours by 80 miles per hour. That's 1.5 x 80 = 120 miles.

So, in total, he drove 15 + 120 = 135 miles on the way back.

But he was 180 miles away from home. So, to find out how far he is from home now, we subtract 135 miles from 180 miles. That's 180 - 135 = 45 miles.

"Let's break it down. 

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. 

In the second month, it had three times as many downloads as the first month. So, we need to multiply 60 by 3. That's 60 x 3 = 180 downloads.

Now, in the third month, the downloads went down by 30%. To find 30% of 180, we can multiply 180 by 0.3. That's 180 x 0.3 = 54. So, the downloads went down by 54. To find the downloads in the third month, we subtract 54 from 180. That's 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, let's add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

Then, the cupcakes cost 2 x $80, which is $160.
The cheesecakes cost 6 x $55, which is $330.

"Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree costs $90 to plant. Each year it grows 7 lemons, and he can sell them for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. We need to find out how many years it will take before he starts earning money.

First, let's calculate how much money Carlos gets from selling lemons each year. 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year.

Now, let's see how much money Carlos spends each year. He spends $3 per year to water and feed the tree. But we also need to remember that he spent $90 to plant the tree.

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (planting) + $3 (watering) = $93, Total revenue = $10.5
Year 2: Total cost = $93 + $3 = $96, Total revenue = $10.5 * 2 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 + $3 = $99, Total revenue = $10.5 * 3 = $31.5
Year 4: Total cost = $99 + $3 = $102, Total revenue = $10.5 * 4 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 + $3 = $105, Total revenue = $10.5 * 5 = $52.5
Year 6: Total cost = $105 + $3 = $108, Total revenue = $10.5 * 6 = $63
Year 7: Total cost = $108 + $3 = $111, Total revenue = $10.5 * 7 = $73.5
Year 8: Total cost = $111 + $3 = $114, Total revenue = $10.5 * 8 = $84
Year 9: Total cost = $114 + $3 = $117, Total revenue = $10.5 * 9 = $94.5
Year 10: Total cost = $117 + $3 = $120, Total revenue = $10.5 * 10 = $105
Year 11: Total cost = $120 + $3 = $123, Total revenue = $10.5 * 11 = $115.5
Year 12: Total cost = $123 + $3 = $126, Total revenue = $10.5 * 12 = $126
Year 13: Total cost = $126 + $3 = $129, Total revenue = $10.5 * 13 = $136.5

Carlos will start earning money when his total revenue is more than his total cost. This happens in year 13.

"Melanie sold some vacuum cleaners. She sold a third of them at the green house. Then she sold 2 more at the red house. After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Now she has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

Let's think about it. If she sold half of what was left at the orange house, that means she had 10 vacuum cleaners before the orange house (because 10 divided by 2 is 5). 

Before the orange house, she had 10 vacuum cleaners. But before that, she sold 2 at the red house. So before the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.

Before the red house, she had 12 vacuum cleaners. But before that, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. That means she had 12 + some more before the green house. If a third of her vacuum cleaners is the same as 12 - the number she had after the green house, then the number she had before the green house is 18 (because 18 divided by 3 is 6, and 18 - 6 is 12).

So Melanie had 18 vacuum cleaners at the start.

Then, 25% of those 16 students chose jazz dance. That's 4 students again. So, 16 - 4 = 12 students are left.

Those 12 students chose hip-hop dance. To find the percentage, I need to divide 12 by 20 and multiply by 100. That's 60%.

She's a coach for 15 hours a week and gets $30 for each hour. So, she gets $30 * 15 = $450 a week for coaching. She does this for 50 weeks, so that's $450 * 50 = $22,500 a year.

"So we have 10 liters of orange drink, but we spill 1 liter. That means we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. This drink is 2/3 water. To find out how much water is in it, we need to find 2/3 of 9. 

Imagine you have 9 cookies and you want to give 2/3 of them to your friend. You can divide the cookies into 3 groups of 3 cookies each. Then, you give 2 groups to your friend. That's 2/3 of the cookies. 

So, 2/3 of 9 is 6. That means we have 6 liters of water in the orange drink.

5 packs of milk cost 5 x $3 = $15.
4 apples cost 4 x $1.50 = $6.
So, the chicken meal, milk, and apples cost $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid $50 in total. So, the pizza boxes cost $50 - $33 = $17.

On Wednesday, she writes 2 times the articles she wrote on Tuesday. That's 2 x 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's count all the articles she wrote: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

It takes her 4 hours to write one article. So, for 26 articles, it will take her 26 x 4 = 104 hours.

"Candice had 80 post-it notes. Then she bought some more. We don't know how many she bought, so let's call that number ""x"". 

After she bought the post-it notes, she had 80 + x post-it notes. 

Then she used 220 post-it notes at work. So she had 80 + x - 220 post-it notes left.

We know she had 23 post-it notes left. So we can make an equation: 80 + x - 220 = 23.

Let's solve the equation. First, let's add 220 to both sides: 80 + x = 23 + 220. 

Now, let's do the math: 80 + x = 243.

Now, let's subtract 80 from both sides: x = 243 - 80.

x = 163.

The final answer is: 163"
"John bought some blue ties and some red ties. He bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. The blue ties cost $40 each. He spent $200 on blue ties. So, he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

He bought twice as many red ties, so he bought 2 x 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. 50% of $40 is $20. So, the red ties cost $40 + $20 = $60 each.

He bought 10 red ties, so he spent 10 x $60 = $600 on red ties.

He spent $200 on blue ties and $600 on red ties. So, he spent $200 + $600 = $800 on ties.

So, on Thursday, the mechanic made $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic fixed 12 car tires and no truck tires. 
12 car tires cost 12 x $40 = $480.

Now, we need to find out which day the mechanic made more money.

First, let's find out how many are unripe. 20% of 25 is unripe. 20% means 20 out of 100. So, 20% of 25 is 5 oranges.

Now, we know 1 orange is bad, 5 are unripe, and 2 are sour. Let's add them together: 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges.

We started with 25 oranges. If 8 are bad, unripe, or sour, we subtract 8 from 25. 25 - 8 = 17.

"So, when Freda cooks the tomatoes, they get smaller. She made 32 ounces of sauce, but that's half the size of the tomatoes she started with. So, the tomatoes she started with must have been 64 ounces.

Now, we need to know how many cans of tomatoes she used. Each can is 16 ounces, so we need to divide 64 by 16. That's like sharing 64 cookies into groups of 16. We get 4 groups.

Each can has 3 tomatoes, so we multiply 4 (the number of cans) by 3 (the number of tomatoes in each can). That's like having 4 boxes, and each box has 3 toys inside. We get 12 toys, or in this case, 12 tomatoes.

"Mary has 2 plants on each of 40 window ledges. That's 2 x 40 = 80 plants. She got 18 more, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 plants.

She's giving 1 plant from each window ledge to friends and family. She has 40 window ledges, so she's giving away 40 plants.

To find out how many plants she has left, we need to subtract the number of plants she's giving away from the total number of plants. That's 98 - 40 = 58.

"So Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him. We need to find out how many times the doorbell rang.

The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend rang it a bit more than the first friend. He rang it 1/4 times more. That's like 1/4 of 20, which is 5. So the second friend rang the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend rang it 10 times more than the fourth friend. So that's 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's count how many times the doorbell rang in total:

That means on Wednesday, he watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1.5 hours is 1.5 x 60 = 90 minutes.

Each show on Wednesday is 30 minutes. So, he watched 90 / 30 = 3 shows.

Then, he dropped 5 cookies, so he had 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left. That's the same as 2x + 10 cookies.

We know he had 110 cookies left. So we can say 2x + 10 = 110.

If we take 10 away from both sides, we get 2x = 100.

If we divide both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

So Henry made 50 cookies last year.

First, let's find out how much she spent on the small boards. 10 small boards cost 10 x $10 = $100.

Then, let's find out how much she spent on the big boards. 5 big boards cost 5 x $16 = $80.

So, she spent $100 + $80 = $180 on all the boards.

Now, the price of lumber went up by 50%. That means she can sell the boards for 50% more than what she paid. To find the new price, we multiply the old price by 1.5.

For the small boards, the new price is $10 x 1.5 = $15 each. So, 10 small boards will cost 10 x $15 = $150.

For the big boards, the new price is $16 x 1.5 = $24 each. So, 5 big boards will cost 5 x $24 = $120.

So, she can sell all the boards for $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the selling price. $270 - $180 = $90.

We had 30 bees leave, then 15 came back, and then 60 more left. So, that's 30 - 15 + 60 = 75 bees that left and didn't come back.

In the last 6 hours, all those bees came back to the hive. So, Debra saw 75 bees come back to the hive in the last 6 hours.

"So, Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket. The adult ticket costs $12 and the child ticket costs $10. We need to add those together to get the total cost of the tickets.

$12 + $10 = $22

But that's not all. We also know that Brittany's mom got $8 in change. That means she gave the cashier more than $22. To find out how much she gave, we need to add the change to the total cost.

$22 + $8 = $30

"To figure this out, we need to know how long it takes Steve and Tim to get home.

Steve lives 3 miles from school and can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute. But we need to know how many feet are in 3 miles. There are 5280 feet in a mile. So, 3 miles is 3 x 5280 = 15840 feet.

Now, we can find out how long it takes Steve to get home. We do this by dividing the distance (15840 feet) by how fast he can ride his bike (440 feet per minute). 15840 รท 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim lives 2 miles from school and can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute. We need to know how many feet are in 2 miles. 2 miles is 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, we can find out how long it takes Tim to get home. We do this by dividing the distance (10560 feet) by how fast he can ride his skateboard (264 feet per minute). 10560 รท 264 = 40 minutes.

Steve gets home in 36 minutes and Tim gets home in 40 minutes. So, Steve gets home first. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time. 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.

"Shawnda inflated a lot of tires. She charged 25 cents for each tire. 

Some people came with bikes. They have 2 tires. 5 people came with bikes, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 tires.

Some people came with tricycles. They have 3 tires. 3 people came with tricycles, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 tires.

One person came with a unicycle. It has 1 tire.

So, Shawnda inflated 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents. So, 20 x 25 cents is 500 cents.

We have 100 cents in a dollar. So, 500 cents is 500 / 100 = 5 dollars.

"Let's think about this problem step by step.

Dave ate 14 fries. Then a seagull ate half of that, which is 7 fries. So, the seagull ate 7 fries.

Now, we need to find out how many fries were left. But we don't know how many fries were there in the first place. Let's call that number ""x"".

So, after Dave and the seagull ate, we have x - 14 - 7 fries left. That's x - 21 fries.

Then, three pigeons came and each ate 3 fries. That's 3 x 3 = 9 fries. Now we have x - 21 - 9 fries left. That's x - 30 fries.

After that, a raccoon came and ate 2/3 of the fries that were left. That means 1/3 of the fries were left. And then ants took 1 fry, and 5 fries were left.

So, 1/3 of the fries that were left is 6 (because 5 + 1 = 6). And that's 1/3 of x - 30. 

To find x, we need to do some math. If 1/3 of x - 30 is 6, then x - 30 is 6 x 3. That's 18. 

So, x - 30 = 18. To find x, we need to add 30 to both sides. That's x = 18 + 30. 

x = 48.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day. Each class is 2 hours long. So, he has 2 x 2 = 4 hours of classes on each of these days. There are 2 days, so that's 4 x 2 = 8 hours.

Kimo has 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours of classes each week. There are 16 weeks in a semester. So, Kimo has 17 x 16 = 272 hours of classes in a semester.

"Bill bakes lots of yummy things every day. He makes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes. We need to find out how long they are when we put them all together.

First, we need to know how long each thing is. Rolls are 4 inches long, croissants are 6 inches long, and baguettes are 2 feet long. But we need to make sure everything is in the same units, so we'll change inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Let's start with the rolls. 300 rolls * 4 inches is 1200 inches. Now, we change inches to feet: 1200 inches / 12 = 100 feet.

Next, the croissants. 120 croissants * 6 inches is 720 inches. Now, we change inches to feet: 720 inches / 12 = 60 feet.

The baguettes are already in feet, so we don't need to change them. 60 baguettes * 2 feet is 120 feet.

Now, we add all the lengths together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. So, he runs 15 x 200 yards. That's 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once. That's 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The 40-yard line is in the middle of the field, so it's 40 yards to the line and 40 yards back. That's 80 yards each time. So, she runs 80 yards 34 times. That's 80 x 34 = 2720 yards. Plus the 200 yards she ran at the start, that's 2920 yards.

Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards. To find out how much farther Blake ran, we need to subtract Kelly's yards from Blake's yards. 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

Now, on Wednesday, the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Two-thirds means we need to multiply by 2 and then divide by 3.

"Imagine you have a bag of marbles that costs $20. Every 2 months, the price goes up by 20% of the original price. We need to find out how much it will cost after 36 months.

Let's break it down:

- After 2 months, the price goes up by 20% of $20, which is $4. So, the new price is $20 + $4 = $24.
- After 4 months, the price goes up by 20% of $24, which is $4.80. So, the new price is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.
- We keep doing this for 36 months.

To make it easier, let's do the math:

$20 * 1.20 = $24 (after 2 months)
$24 * 1.20 = $28.80 (after 4 months)
$28.80 * 1.20 = $34.56 (after 6 months)
$34.56 * 1.20 = $41.47 (after 8 months)
$41.47 * 1.20 = $49.76 (after 10 months)
$49.76 * 1.20 = $59.71 (after 12 months)
$59.71 * 1.20 = $71.65 (after 14 months)
$71.65 * 1.20 = $85.98 (after 16 months)
$85.98 * 1.20 = $103.18 (after 18 months)
$103.18 * 1.20 = $123.82 (after 20 months)
$123.82 * 1.20 = $148.58 (after 22 months)
$148.58 * 1.20 = $178.30 (after 24 months)
$178.30 * 1.20 = $213.96 (after 26 months)
$213.96 * 1.20 = $256.75 (after 28 months)

"Imagine the trader bought some bags of wheat. He paid $20 for each bag and $2 to move each bag. He sold each bag for $30. He made $400 in total.

Let's think about it. If he sold one bag, he would make $30 - $20 (for the bag) - $2 (to move the bag) = $8. 

If he made $400, we need to find out how many $8's are in $400. We can do this by dividing $400 by $8.

$400 รท $8 = 50

"So, three friends went to the fair. They bought 3 tickets for $20.25. They also bought food, but they spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets. So, they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.

They also went on 2 rides. Each ride cost $33. So, 2 rides cost 2 x $33 = $66.

Now, let's add all the money they spent: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

They want to share the cost evenly. There are 3 friends, so we divide $102 by 3.

"Let's think about this problem. Jerry has red chickens and white chickens. The red chickens give 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens give 5 eggs a day. Jerry gets 42 eggs every day.

We also know that Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens. Let's say Jerry has 'r' red chickens. Then, he has 'r + 2' white chickens.

Now, let's think about the eggs. The red chickens give 3 eggs each, so 'r' red chickens give 3r eggs. The white chickens give 5 eggs each, so 'r + 2' white chickens give 5(r + 2) eggs.

We know Jerry gets 42 eggs in total. So, we can make an equation: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42.

Let's solve this equation. First, we multiply 5 by (r + 2). This gives us 5r + 10. Now our equation is: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42.

We can combine the 'r's: 8r + 10 = 42.

Now, let's get rid of the 10. We subtract 10 from both sides: 8r = 32.

Finally, we divide both sides by 8: r = 4.

"Let's think about this problem. We have two pools, and they both leak water at the same rate. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's say the small pool had some water, and we'll call that ""x"". Then, the big pool had twice as much, so that's 2x.

Both pools leaked water for 4 minutes, so they both lost the same amount of water. Let's say they lost 16 gallons each.

Now, the small pool has x - 16 gallons, and the big pool has 2x - 16 gallons.

The problem says the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can say:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

This looks a bit tricky, but we can solve it. Let's try to make it simpler.

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Now, let's move some numbers around.

-16 + 64 = 2x - 4x + 64 - 64

That's the same as:

48 = -2x + 64 - 64

And that's the same as:

48 = -2x

Now, let's divide both sides by -2.

-24 = x

 Wait, that can't be right. We can't have a negative amount of water. Let's try again.

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Now, let's move some numbers around.

2x - 4x = -64 + 16

That's the same as:

-2x = -48

Now, let's divide both sides by -2.

24 = x

So, the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it leaked 16 gallons, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

"To find out how many students went out through exit C, we need to do some math.

Next, we need to find out how many students went out through exit B. 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find 3/5 of 700, we multiply 700 by 3 and then divide by 5. That's 420 students.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left again. We subtract 420 from 700. That's 280 students.

So, 280 students went out through exit C.

Each letter has 5 pages. So, Mike writes 6 letters x 5 pages = 30 pages.

Mike can write 1 page in 6 minutes. To write 30 pages, it will take him 30 x 6 minutes = 180 minutes.

Then Billy took some fries. He took twice as many as Kyle. Kyle took 5, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.

After that, Colby took some fries. He took 3 less than Kyle. Kyle took 5, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.

But we know Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So, Ginger must have given Griffin some fries. To find out how many, we need to subtract the fries Griffin had from the fries he ended up with. That's 27 - 7 = 20.

First, let's find out how many more snails are in the big aquarium. 32 - 4 = 28. That's 28 more snails in the big aquarium.

Now, we know that the difference in snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can say that 28 is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.

If we divide 28 by 2, we get 14. But that's the number of fish in both aquariums, not one. So we need to divide 14 by 2 again to get the number of fish in one aquarium.

"So, Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half of that, which is 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Now, Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 3 * 2 = 6. And 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

So, Harry has 11 trees and Ferdinand has 3 trees. To find out how many more trees Harry has, we need to subtract 3 from 11. That's 11 - 3 = 8.

"Mrs. Cruz wants a house that costs $400,000 or less. She found a house that costs $350,000. But she also has to pay a brokerage fee and a transfer fee.

The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000. To find 5% of $350,000, I will multiply $350,000 by 0.05. That is $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000. To find 12% of $350,000, I will multiply $350,000 by 0.12. That is $42,000.

Now, I will add the cost of the house, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee. That is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the house costs, I will subtract $400,000 from $409,500. That is $9,500.

"Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. He had to pay some fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price. That's like 3 cents for every dollar. So, 3% of $400,000 is $12,000.

He also paid a brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price. That's like 5 cents for every dollar. So, 5% of $400,000 is $20,000.

Mr. Tan also had to pay the remaining loan amount of $250,000.

Let's add up all the money he paid: $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

Now, let's find out how much money Mr. Tan has left. He sold his house for $400,000 and paid $282,000. So, his net proceeds are: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

"So we need to figure out how long it takes to heat the oil and cook the chicken. 

First, it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. Then it takes a bit longer to get to 400 degrees. 40% longer is like adding 40% more minutes. 40% of 20 is 8 minutes. So it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to get to 400 degrees.

It took 20 minutes to get to 300 degrees and 28 minutes to get to 400 degrees. So in total, it took 20 + 28 = 48 minutes to warm the oil.

Now, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to warm the oil. So it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook the chicken.

So, we add the time it took to warm the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken. That's 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.

First, we know the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes one-tenth of that, which is 900 รท 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it's 2 x 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

The whole sweater has 1800 stitches, so the sleeves must take 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

There are two sleeves, so we need to divide 630 by 2 to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes: 630 รท 2 = 315 stitches.

"Sean has to memorize lines for a song and two scenes. The song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice as many lines as the song. So, it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines. But Sean only has to memorize a third of those lines. So, he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines for the first scene.

The second scene has 6 more lines than the song. So, it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Sean has to memorize four-fifths of those lines. Four-fifths is the same as 4/5. So, he has to memorize 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines for the second scene.

"Let's break it down step by step.

Carly had 80 cards. Some had A, some had B, some had C, and the rest had D. 

First, we find out how many cards had A. 2/5 of 80 is the same as 2 groups of 16, because 5 groups of 16 make 80. So, 2 groups of 16 is 32. That means 32 cards had A.

Now, we subtract 32 from 80 to find out how many cards didn't have A. That's 80 - 32 = 48.

Next, we find out how many of those 48 cards had B. Half of 48 is 24, because 48 divided by 2 is 24. So, 24 cards had B.

Now, we subtract 24 from 48 to find out how many cards didn't have A or B. That's 48 - 24 = 24.

Then, we find out how many of those 24 cards had C. 5/8 of 24 is a bit tricky, but we can do it. If we divide 24 into 8 groups, each group will have 3 cards. So, 5 groups of 3 is 15. That means 15 cards had C.

Now, we subtract 15 from 24 to find out how many cards didn't have A, B, or C. That's 24 - 15 = 9.

So, the cards that didn't have A, B, or C must have had D. And that's 9 cards.

First, let's look at the ice cream. It used to cost $13, but now it costs $11. So, we save $2 on each ice cream. If we buy 2 ice creams, we save 2 x $2 = $4.

Next, let's look at the milk. We save $0.5 on each packet of milk. If we buy 4 packets, we save 4 x $0.5 = $2.

Now, let's add the money we saved from the ice cream and the milk. $4 + $2 = $6.

"So, Theo has $6000 for his trip. He buys 6 suits for $100 each. That's 6 x $100 = $600. He also buys 3 suitcases for $50 each. That's 3 x $50 = $150.

He buys a flight ticket too. It costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a suit. A suit costs $100, so 5 times that is $500. Add $700 to that, and it's $1200.

So, he spends $600 on suits, $150 on suitcases, and $1200 on a flight ticket. That's $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

He wants to save $2000, so we need to take that away from his total money, $6000. That leaves him with $6000 - $2000 = $4000. But he already spent $1950, so we need to take that away too. $4000 - $1950 = $2050.

Now, we know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, if Cera was 40, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

But we are told that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. So, if it was half, that means the population now is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

Population of Chile now: 120,000"
"Let's think about this problem. We have 105 people in the football team. We need to find out how many are on the defense.

Let's say the number of people on the defense is some number. The offense has twice as many people as the defense. So, if the defense has some number, the offense has two times that number.

The special teams have half the number of people as the defense. So, if the defense has some number, the special teams have half of that number.

We can add these numbers together to get the total number of people in the team, which is 105.

Let's use a simple example. If the defense has 30 people, the offense has 2 x 30 = 60 people. The special teams have 30 / 2 = 15 people.

30 + 60 + 15 = 105

This looks right! So, the number of people on the defense is 30.

But some people couldn't come. 8 people were sick. And 1/4 of 8 people had other things to do. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, 8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't come.

That means 24 - 10 = 14 people came to Martha's party.

Now Solomon has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Each marble is 2kgs. So we need to multiply 78 by 2. 78 * 2 = 156.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has is 156 kgs.

200 / 5 = 40

So, there are 40 junior programmers. The rest are senior programmers. 100 - 40 = 60. There are 60 senior programmers.

Junior programmers get $2000 each month. Senior programmers get $400 more than junior programmers. So, senior programmers get $2000 + $400 = $2400 each month.

Now, let's calculate how much money the company pays to junior programmers. 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Now, let's calculate how much money the company pays to senior programmers. 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

$90 รท $30 = 3

But Morgan is also going to the party, so we need to subtract 1 from 3. 

3 - 1 = 2

"Marisa gets $5 every day. She buys 4 lollipops for 25 cents each. We need to find out how much she spends on lollipops. 
4 lollipops for 25 cents each is 4 x 25 cents = 100 cents. 100 cents is $1.

So, she spends $1 on lollipops. Now, we subtract $1 from $5. $5 - $1 is $4. She saves $4 every day.

If she saves for 5 days, we multiply $4 by 5. $4 x 5 is $20.

"So Billy got $10 from his dad to buy candy. The candy costs $1.5 per pound. After buying candy, he had some money left, which is called change. He took half of that change and bought 40 gumballs. Each gumball costs $.05.

First, let's find out how much he spent on gumballs. 40 gumballs times $.05 is 40 x .05 = $2. Since he spent half his change on gumballs, that means he had $4 in change.

Now, we know Billy started with $10 and had $4 in change. So, he must have spent $10 - $4 = $6 on candy.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds he bought, we need to divide $6 by $1.5. That's 6 รท 1.5 = 4.

"So Carver is 45 years old and that's 5 years less than twice his son's age. Let's think about it. If it's twice his son's age, that means we need to divide 45 by 2, but then we have to add 5 because it's 5 years less. But that's not right, we need to do it the other way around.

Let's say his son is x years old. Twice his son's age would be 2x. And it's 5 years less than that, so it's 2x - 5. We know that's equal to 45, so we can write that down.

2x - 5 = 45

Now, let's add 5 to both sides. That way, the -5 will disappear.

2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Now, let's divide both sides by 2. That way, the 2 will disappear.

2x / 2 = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, his son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"The train goes from the first city to the second city, that's 75 miles. Then it goes from the second city to the third city, that's 100 miles. So, that's 75 + 100 = 175 miles so far.

Now, to get back to the first city, it goes 50 miles less than 175 miles. So, that's 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

So, the whole trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so it goes 300 * 3 = 900 miles in a day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes before needing service, we need to divide 18,000 by 900.

18,000 รท 900 = 20

"To make a dog bed for a Rottweiler, Mark needs 8 pounds of stuffing. For a chihuahua, he needs 2 pounds. But for a collie, he needs the amount that's in the middle of 8 and 2. 

So, the amount for a collie is (8 + 2) / 2. That's like adding 8 and 2, then splitting it in half. 8 + 2 is 10, and half of 10 is 5. So, a collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing.

Now, Mark needs to make 4 beds for chihuahuas and 3 beds for collies. For the chihuahuas, he needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds. For the collies, he needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

So, Mark needs 8 + 15 pounds of stuffing. That's 23 pounds.

"So John is going to his friend's house. It's 200 miles away, but he has to go a bit more because of a detour. That's 10 miles more. So it's 200 + 10 = 210 miles. He's going 70 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes, we need to divide the miles by the speed. That's 210 miles / 70 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Now, when he goes back home, it's 240 miles. He's going a bit faster, 80 miles per hour. We do the same thing, divide the miles by the speed. That's 240 miles / 80 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Then, some people got kicked out for fighting over things on sale. It's 3 times the people who got kicked out for shoplifting. That's 3 x 7 = 21.

Interest is like extra money we pay for using someone else's money. To find the interest, we multiply the amount she borrowed ($3,650) by the interest rate (10% or 0.10) and the time (5 months, but we need to change months to years, so 5 months is about 0.4167 years).

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 0.4167 = $152.08

Now, we add the interest to the amount she borrowed to get the total amount she has to pay.
Total amount = $3,650 + $152.08 = $3,802.08

Now, let's see how many steps he jogged. We subtract the steps he walked before jogging from the steps he walked before he finished: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"Toby has a book with 45 pages. Each page has 200 words. So, the book has 45 x 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words in 1 minute. To read 9000 words, he needs 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. So, Toby needs 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.

Toby has 60 minutes. He will be 60 - 40 = 20 minutes early.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid, we need to calculate how much they paid in May and June.

In May, they hired 40 people. Each person worked 40 hours a week and got $15 per hour. So each person got $15 * 40 = $600 per week. There are about 4 weeks in a month, so each person got $600 * 4 = $2400 in May. Since there are 40 people, the company paid 40 * $2400 = $96000 in May.

In June, 1/4 of the people didn't work anymore. 1/4 of 40 is 10, so 40 - 10 = 30 people worked in June. Each person still got $600 per week and $2400 in June. The company paid 30 * $2400 = $72000 in June.

The total amount of money the company paid is $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

"Sally went to the seashore and her parents gave her $10. She bought some taffy, seashells, and magnets. 

The taffy was a special deal. She got 2 pounds. One pound was $3 and the other pound was half off. Half of $3 is $1.50. So the taffy cost $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The seashells cost $1.50.

The magnets were $0.25 each. She bought 4 of them. So the magnets cost $0.25 x 4 = $1.

Now, let's add up how much she spent. $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally had $10 and she spent $7. So she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

"Tim bought two packs of fireworks. One pack cost $400. The other pack cost twice that much, so it was $800.

So, the two packs together cost $400 + $800 = $1200.

Then, Tim got a discount of 20%. That means he got 20% off the $1200. To find 20% of $1200, I multiply $1200 by 0.20. That's $240.

Now, I subtract $240 from $1200. That's $1200 - $240 = $960.

Tim also bought a big finale firework for $150. So, I add $150 to $960. That's $960 + $150 = $1110.

"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Joanne picked 30 apples from the tall trees. She picked half of that from the short trees. Half of 30 is 15. So, she picked 15 apples from the short trees.

Her sister picked twice as many apples from the tall trees. Twice 30 is 60. Her sister picked 60 apples from the tall trees. Her sister picked 3 times as many apples from the short trees. Three times 15 is 45. Her sister picked 45 apples from the short trees.

We know that together they picked 500 apples. Let's add up the apples we know about so far. Joanne picked 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tall and short trees. Her sister picked 60 + 45 = 105 apples from the tall and short trees. Together, that's 45 + 105 = 150 apples.

We know they picked 500 apples in total. So, the number of apples they haven't picked yet is 500 - 150 = 350. These apples must be the ones Joanne picked from the average trees.

The final answer is: 350"
"Imagine we have two kinds of animals: camels and dromedaries. Camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump. We know there are 180 animals in total and 304 humps.

Let's think about it. If we add up all the humps from the camels and the dromedaries, we get 304. If we add up all the animals, we get 180.

If we think about the camels, they have two humps each. So if we have 'c' camels, they will have 2c humps. The dromedaries have one hump each, so if we have 'd' dromedaries, they will have d humps.

We know that the total number of humps is 304, so we can say 2c + d = 304. We also know that the total number of animals is 180, so we can say c + d = 180.

Now, let's try to figure it out. If we look at the two equations, we can see that if we subtract the second equation from the first, we get c = 124.

Now that we know there are 124 camels, we can find out how many dromedaries there are. We know that c + d = 180, so 124 + d = 180. If we subtract 124 from both sides, we get d = 56.

Then, he traveled for 2 more days, but not as much. He only went 30% of 800 kilometers. 30% is like 30 out of 100. So, 30% of 800 is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

Then, he rested for a day. He didn't travel at all.

After that, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. That's 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

"So Cole bought two types of jeans, tattered and jogger. The tattered jeans cost $28. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. That means the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Cole saved $6 in total. He saved 1/3 of that from the jogger jeans. 1/3 of $6 is $2. So he saved $2 from the jogger jeans and $6 - $2 = $4 from the tattered jeans.

The jogger jeans originally cost $22 + $2 = $24. The tattered jeans originally cost $28 + $4 = $32.

The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. But the jogger jeans cost less. So the answer is the other way around. The tattered jeans cost $32 - $24 = $8 more than the jogger jeans. But since the question asks how much more the jogger jeans cost, the answer is -$8.

"So we need to find out how much it costs to fill 170 balloons. First, we need to know how much it costs to fill one balloon. 

We know that 20 balloons cost $900. So, to find the cost of one balloon, we divide $900 by 20. That's $45 for one balloon.

Then, the price went up by $20. So now, one balloon costs $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we need to find out how much 170 balloons cost. We multiply $65 by 170. That's a lot of money! 

$65 x 100 = $6,500
$65 x 70 = $4,550
Add them together: $6,500 + $4,550 = $11,050

"To find the average speed, we need to know how far the car went and how long it took.

The car went 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. That's 60 x 2 = 120 miles. Then it went 30 miles per hour for 1 hour. That's 30 x 1 = 30 miles. So the car went 120 + 30 = 150 miles in total.

The car took 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours to go that far.

Now, to find the average speed, we divide the total miles by the total hours. That's 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.

Each sapphire is worth $800. So 5 sapphires are worth 5 x $800 = $4000.

Each ruby is worth $1200. So 2 rubies are worth 2 x $1200 = $2400.

Now we add the money from the sapphires and rubies. $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"To find out how much the potting soil will cost, we need to figure out how many bags Bob needs. 

First, we need to know how much dirt each bed can hold. Each bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, we multiply those numbers: 2 x 8 x 2 = 32. That's how many cubic feet of dirt each bed can hold.

Since Bob has 10 beds, we multiply 32 by 10: 32 x 10 = 320. That's how many cubic feet of dirt he needs.

Each bag of dirt holds 2 cubic feet. To find out how many bags he needs, we divide 320 by 2: 320 รท 2 = 160. So, Bob needs 160 bags of dirt.

Each bag costs $12. To find out how much it will cost, we multiply 160 by $12: 160 x $12 = $1920.

So, all the puppies together is 8 + 12 = 20 puppies.

All the puppies with spots together is 3 + 4 = 7 puppies.

Now, we need to find what part of 20 is 7. We can do this by dividing 7 by 20 and then multiplying by 100.

7 divided by 20 is 0.35. Multiply 0.35 by 100 is 35.

So, 35% of the puppies have spots.

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we need to know how much all the food weighs. 

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes. Each box weighs 1 pound. So, 2 boxes weigh 2 pounds.

He buys 4 bags of carrots. Each bag weighs 12 pounds. So, 4 bags weigh 4 x 12 = 48 pounds.

He buys 42 bales of hay. Each bale weighs 75 pounds. So, 42 bales weigh 42 x 75 = 3150 pounds.

He buys 20 sacks of oats. Each sack weighs 65 pounds. So, 20 sacks weigh 20 x 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add all the weights together: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs, we divide the total weight by the weight the truck can carry: 4500 / 2250 = 2.

But, 2 trips will not be enough to carry all the food. We need to round up to the nearest whole number. Since 2 trips will carry 4500 pounds, and the farmer has 4500 pounds of food, he will need 2 trips."

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David. So Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

We can add all these up and set it equal to 43, because that's how many they found together:
B + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43

This can be simplified to:

2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2:
B = 18

But wait, that's not what Bodhi found. That's what Bodhi and David found together. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, Bodhi must have found twice as much as David. So Bodhi found 36 insects.

Now that we know Bodhi found 36, we can find David:
David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found 36/2 = 18 insects.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, so we need to find 1/2 of 364. That's 364 divided by 2, which is 182 yards.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma: 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards.

"Cherrie has 5 friends. 2 friends want 5 gifts each, that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts. 3 friends want 2 gifts each, that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts. So, for her friends, she needs 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Then, she buys 10 more gifts. So, we add 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

"So we need to find out how long the couch is. First, we need to know how wide the rug is. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. The chair is 3 feet wide. So the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.

Now, the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 x 8 = 16 feet. Then we add 2 feet to that. 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The couch is 18 feet long.

"Suzie bought 4 packs of gum. She got 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum, and 1 pack of green apple gum. The grape gum cost $2. The green apple gum cost half of that, so it's $1. 

The grape and green apple gum together cost $2 + $1 = $3. Suzie paid $7 in all. So, the 2 packs of strawberry gum cost $7 - $3 = $4.

If 2 packs of strawberry gum cost $4, then 1 pack costs $4 / 2 = $2.

"Frederick wants to make lots of popsicle sticks. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood.

A 2 x 4 costs $4 and a 2 x 8 costs $6. We need to find out which one is cheaper to buy. 

Let's see how many sticks we get for each dollar. For 2 x 4, we get 200 sticks for $4. That's 50 sticks for each dollar. For 2 x 8, we get 400 sticks for $6. That's a lot more than 50 sticks for each dollar.

If we divide 400 by 6, we get 66.67. That's more than 50. So, 2 x 8 is the better deal.

Now, let's see how many 2 x 8 woods Frederick can buy with $24. We divide $24 by $6, and we get 4. He can buy 4 woods.

Each 2 x 8 wood gives 400 sticks. If we multiply 4 by 400, we get 1600. That's a lot of sticks!

The final answer is: 1600"
"Mario has 6 dogs. Each dog has 4 legs. We need to buy snowshoes for all the legs. But snowshoes come in pairs. So each dog needs 2 pairs of snowshoes.

Mario has 6 dogs, so he needs 6 * 2 = 12 pairs of snowshoes. Each pair costs $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair.

12 pairs * $12 = $144

x + 3x is the same as 4x. So, 4x is $120,000. To find x, we need to divide $120,000 by 4. That's $30,000.

Now we know the lot costs $30,000. The house costs three times that, so it's 3 * $30,000. That's $90,000.

First, we add the new device's electricity use to Ada's old use: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

There are 24 hours in a day. So, we multiply 14 kilowatts by 24 hours to get the total electricity use in a day: 14 * 24 = 336 kilowatt-hours.

We multiply this by 7 to get the total electricity use in a week: 336 * 7 = 2352 kilowatt-hours.

Ada's old electricity use in a week is: 12 * 24 * 7 = 2016 kilowatt-hours.

The shop gives a 10% discount. To find 10% of $30, we multiply $30 by 0.1. 
$30 x 0.1 = $3

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost. 
$30 - $3 = $27

"Carly buys some food for her friends. She gets 5 hamburgers for $4 each. That's 5 x $4 = $20. She gets 10 packs of fries for $0.30 each. That's 10 x $0.30 = $3. She gets 5 cans of fruit drinks for $2 each. That's 5 x $2 = $10.

Now, let's add all the money together. $20 + $3 + $10 = $33. Carly pays with a $50 bill. To find the change, we need to subtract $33 from $50. $50 - $33 = $17.

"Bill has 2 big boxes of water. Each box has 24 bottles. So, he has 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

He wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 friends. So, he needs 70 x 2 = 140 bottles.

He already has 48 bottles. But he needs 140. So, he needs to buy more. To find out how many more, we subtract 48 from 140. That's 140 - 48 = 92.

"So, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold. When the water is warm, it takes him 2 minutes more than twice as long. Twice as long as 16 minutes is 32 minutes. Then we add 2 minutes, so it's 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

I think the warm water is like the hot water, so it's also 34 minutes for a mile. Now, let's see how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles. 

When the water is cold, it takes him 16 minutes for a mile. So, 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

When the water is hot, it takes him 34 minutes for a mile. So, 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

Now, let's see how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day. It's 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is 100 (but it's actually more, we'll get to that later). If there are 1% fewer red jelly beans, that means there are 99 red jelly beans. And if there are 1% more green jelly beans, that means there are 101 green jelly beans.

Now, we know the jar has 4500 jelly beans in total. So, if we add up the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans, it should be 4500. But we said the number of blue jelly beans is 100, and that's not true. We need to find the real number.

Dogs have 4 legs, and there are 5 dogs. So, 5 x 4 = 20 legs for the dogs.

Cats have 4 legs, and there are 2 cats. So, 2 x 4 = 8 legs for the cats.

Birds have 2 legs, and there are 10 birds. So, 10 x 2 = 20 legs for the birds.

Now, let's add all the legs together: 20 + 8 + 20 = 48.

The next year, he bought 2 games a month. That's 24 games. He got 5 more for Christmas. So now he has 22 + 24 + 5 = 51 games.

The year after that, he bought 4 games a month. That's 48 games. He got 5 more for Christmas. So now he has 51 + 48 + 5 = 104 games.

Marissa makes 3/4 of what Ruiz makes in 1 hour. To find out how much Marissa makes, we need to multiply 60 by 3/4.
3/4 of 60 is 45.

So Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates in 1 hour.

Now, we need to find out how much they make in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds in 1 hour, so in 12 hours he makes 60 x 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds in 1 hour, so in 12 hours she makes 45 x 12 = 540 pounds.

725 รท 2 = 362.5

Now, Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. So, we multiply 362.5 by 400 to get the number of turns per month.

362.5 ร 400 = 145,000

There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply 145,000 by 12 to get the number of turns per year.

145,000 ร 12 = 1,740,000

The tires can turn 10,440,000 times before they wear out. So, we divide 10,440,000 by 1,740,000 to get the number of years.

Now, if 2 pumps give 120 washings, then the whole bottle will have 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The bottle costs $24.00, which is 2400 cents. We can divide the cost by the number of pumps to find the cost of 1 pump.

Cost of 1 pump = 2400 cents / 240 pumps
Cost of 1 pump = 10 cents

For the rest of the months, he needed 50% more money each month. 50% of $20,000 is $10,000. So he needed $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000 each month.

For 45 months, that's $30,000 x 45 = $1,350,000.

Let's say there are S sheep and G geese. We can make two equations. One for the legs and one for the animals.

For the legs: 4S + 2G = 70
For the animals: S + G = 20

Now, let's try to solve it. If we multiply the animal equation by 2, we get: 2S + 2G = 40

Now, let's subtract this from the leg equation: 4S + 2G - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
This simplifies to: 2S = 30

Now, let's divide both sides by 2: S = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

20% of $5 is like, if you had 5 cookies and you got 1 more cookie, that's like 20% more cookies. So 20% of $5 is $1. Now the coffee costs $5 + $1 = $6.

Roger wants coffee for a week. A week is 7 days. He uses 1 pound of coffee per day. So he needs 7 pounds of coffee. That's 7 * $6 = $42.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta has 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points: 
Adam has 50, Betty has 65, Tom has 35, and Marta has 105. 
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The class needs 400 points to go on the trip.

"So, we need to figure out how many logs Carson needs to burn to keep his house warm. 

First, we need to know how cold it is at night. It was 45 degrees during the day, and it's 33 degrees colder at night. So, we subtract 33 from 45.

45 - 33 = 12

That means it's 12 degrees at night. But we don't want the pipes to freeze, and they will freeze if it's below 32 degrees. So, we need to make it 32 degrees. 

To do that, we need to make it 32 - 12 = 20 degrees warmer.

Each log makes it 5 degrees warmer. So, we need to divide 20 by 5.

20 รท 5 = 4

Carson needs to burn 4 logs."
"We have 90 people and they are split into groups of 9. To find out how many groups, we do 90 รท 9 = 10 groups.

Now, 3 out of 5 groups brought seashells. That's like 3 groups out of 5. We have 10 groups, so we need to find 3/5 of 10. We can do this by multiplying 10 by 3 and then dividing by 5. That's (10 x 3) รท 5 = 30 รท 5 = 6.

So, 6 groups brought seashells. Each group has 9 people, so 6 x 9 = 54 people brought seashells. And each of them brought 2 seashells, so 54 x 2 = 108 seashells.

"There were 172 people on the train. Then 47 people got off, so we need to take 47 away from 172. That's 172 - 47 = 125.

Then 13 people got on the train, so we need to add 13 to 125. That's 125 + 13 = 138.

After that, 38 people got off the train, so we need to take 38 away from 138. That's 138 - 38 = 100.

There are 100 people on the train.

"Mike wants to buy jeans that cost $40. They are on sale for 25% off. That means he gets a discount. To find the discount, I multiply $40 by 0.25. That's $10. So the discount is $10.

Now, I subtract the discount from the original price. $40 - $10 is $30. So the jeans cost $30.

Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he gets back, I subtract the price of the jeans from $50. $50 - $30 is $20.

"The company starts with 200 workers. They add 20 new workers every month. So after 3 months, they have:

200 (workers they already had) + 20 (new workers in month 1) + 20 (new workers in month 2) + 20 (new workers in month 3)
= 200 + 20 + 20 + 20
= 260 workers

Each worker gets $4000 every month. So in one month, the company pays:
260 workers * $4000
= $1,040,000

The company pays this much for 3 months. So we multiply by 3:
$1,040,000 * 3

If they both work 20 hours, Billy gets 20 x $11.50 = $230. Sally gets 20 x $10.50 = $210.

Billy gets $230 and Sally gets $210. So Billy gets $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally.

"So we need to find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels. 

First, let's find out how much 3 loaves of bread cost. Each loaf costs $2, so 3 loaves cost 3 x $2 = $6.

Next, let's find out how much 2 bagels cost. Each bagel costs $1, so 2 bagels cost 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, let's find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels. We do this by subtracting the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread. So, $6 - $2 = $4.

The teachers plant 2 trees each. So, 3 teachers in a class plant 3 x 2 = 6 trees. We have 40 classes, so the teachers plant 6 x 40 = 240 trees.

Now, we add the trees planted by students and teachers. 1000 + 240 = 1240.

Now, Bubbles wants to buy some goats. She wants the goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. To do this, we need to find out how many stuffed animals she will have after buying the goats. Let's say she buys x goats. Then she will have 14 + x stuffed animals.

We want the goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. So, we can make a special equation. The number of goats (x) divided by the total number of stuffed animals (14 + x) should be equal to 30% or 0.3.

x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can solve for x. 
x = 0.3(14 + x)
x = 4.2 + 0.3x
0.7x = 4.2
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Kris wants to play 30 hours of video games. She played for a little bit every day for 2 weeks. That's 14 days. She played half an hour each day. So that's 14 days * 0.5 hours = 7 hours.

Then she played 2 hours a day for 1 week. That's 7 days. So that's 7 days * 2 hours = 14 hours.

She played 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours. But she needs 30 hours. So she needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 more hours.

Let's think about it. If the slower car goes 60 miles per hour, in 2 hours it will go 60 x 2 = 120 miles.

The faster car goes 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will go 70 x 2 = 140 miles.

So the faster car will be 140 - 120 = 20 miles ahead of the slower car.

340 kids out of 500 passed in the third grade. 
40 kids out of 100 passed in the fourth grade. 
The fifth grade had 400 kids and their pass rate was twice the fourth grade's pass rate. The fourth grade's pass rate is 40 out of 100, which is 40%. Twice that is 80%. So 80% of 400 kids passed in the fifth grade. 80% of 400 is 320 kids.

Now, let's add up all the kids who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 kids.
And let's add up all the kids who took the test: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 kids.

The overall pass rate is the number of kids who passed divided by the number of kids who took the test. That's 700 out of 1000, or 700/1000. That's the same as 70%.

"Erika wants a new laptop that costs $600. But she can get $200 off if she gives her old laptop. So the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika got $150 from her job and her mom gave her $80. So she has $150 + $80 = $230.

Erika needs $50 more to buy the laptop. So she already has $400 - $50 = $350.

Now, let's see how much money Erika had in her purse. We know she has $350 and $230 came from her job and her mom. So, $350 - $230 = $120.

"Adam sliced 3 big apples and 5 small apples. Big apples can be cut into 5 pieces and small apples can be cut into 3 pieces.

So, the big apples will make 3 x 5 = 15 pieces.
And the small apples will make 5 x 3 = 15 pieces.

That's 15 + 15 = 30 pieces in total.

Adam ate 15 pieces, so we need to take those away from the total.

The farmer wants 25 liters of milk. To get that, he needs 25 - 15 = 10 more liters.

Each cow gives 5 liters of milk. So, to get 10 more liters, he needs 10 / 5 = 2 more cows.

"To find out how much of the glue sticks are not used, we need to find out how much of each glue stick is used. 

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so 5/6 is used. If the whole glue stick is 12 mm, then 5/6 of 12 mm is used. To find this, we can multiply 12 by 5 and then divide by 6. 
12 * 5 = 60 
60 / 6 = 10 mm 

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so 1/3 is used. If the whole glue stick is 12 mm, then 1/3 of 12 mm is used. To find this, we can multiply 12 by 1 and then divide by 3. 
12 * 1 = 12 
12 / 3 = 4 mm 

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so 1/2 is used. If the whole glue stick is 12 mm, then 1/2 of 12 mm is used. To find this, we can multiply 12 by 1 and then divide by 2. 
12 * 1 = 12 
12 / 2 = 6 mm 

Now, we add up the lengths of the glue sticks that are used:

Jack has 60 dishes. He has twice as many dishes as socks. So, if we divide 60 by 2, we get 30 socks. That's how many socks Jack has.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has 2 x 30 = 60 socks.

Now, Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Let's count how many socks and dishes they have together. Jack has 30 socks and Peter has 60 socks. That's 30 + 60 = 90 socks.

Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has 30 dishes. That's 60 + 30 = 90 dishes.

20 (total students) - 5 (good at math only) - 8 (good at English only) = 7

So, 7 students are good at both math and English. Now, to find out how many are good at math, we add the ones who are good at math only and the ones who are good at both.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. If my mom is M, then M = 3B - 1.

When you add all our ages, you get 87. So, B + (B - 3) + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87.

Let's try to make it easier. If my brother is 20, then I am 17 and my sister is 15. My mom would be 59.

If my brother is 18, then I am 15 and my sister is 13. My mom would be 53.

Now, let's add up all the things she bought. $10 for bacon, $24 for chicken, $12 for strawberries, and $14 for apples. That's $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly has $65. So, she has $65 - $60 = $5 left.

"Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts. Let's say her usual concerts are x minutes long. So, her final concert is 2x minutes long. But we know that's not all - she also does a 15-minute encore. So, the whole final concert is 2x + 15 minutes long.

We know the final concert is 65 minutes long. So, we can make an equation: 2x + 15 = 65. To solve for x, we need to get rid of the 15. We can do that by subtracting 15 from both sides. That gives us 2x = 50.

Now, we need to get rid of the 2. We can do that by dividing both sides by 2. That gives us x = 25.

So, Elaina's usual concerts are 25 minutes long.

The final answer is: 25"

But they already have 15 tables. So, we need to subtract 15 from 30. That's 30 - 15 = 15.

They need 15 new tables.

"Zoey and Sydney are having a contest. They spit watermelon seeds. We need to find out how far they spit the seeds on average.

Zoey has 40 seeds. She spits each one 10 feet. So, she spits 40 x 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney has 35 seeds. She spits each one 12 feet. So, she spits 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

Now, we need to find the average. To do that, we add the two numbers and divide by 2. 400 + 420 = 820. 820 / 2 = 410.

"So we have two machines, the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000. They make widgets, and we sell widgets for $6 each. We want to know which machine will make more money.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets in one hour. If it runs for 24 hours, that's 60 x 24 = 1440 widgets. If it runs for 30 days, that's 1440 x 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets in one hour. If it runs for 24 hours, that's 45 x 24 = 1080 widgets. If it runs for 30 days, that's 1080 x 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, let's see how much money we can make from each machine. We sell each widget for $6.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 43200 widgets, so we get 43200 x 6 = $259200.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 32400 widgets, so we get 32400 x 6 = $194400.

The difference is $259200 - $194400 = $64800.

"Cameron is staying at a hotel. He can pay 1000 pesos for 12 hours or 1600 pesos for 24 hours. If he stays more than 12 hours, he has to pay 70 pesos for each extra hour.

Cameron is staying for 17 hours. He can pay 1600 pesos for 24 hours. But he can also pay 1000 pesos for 12 hours and then 70 pesos for each extra hour. He has 5 extra hours. 5 x 70 is 350 pesos. So, 1000 + 350 is 1350 pesos.

Cameron will save money if he pays 1000 pesos and then 350 pesos. He will save 1600 - 1350 pesos. That is 250 pesos.

"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we need to know how much each animal needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. 

Sheep need 3 pounds less than twice what the goats need. So, we need to find out what twice what the goats need is. Twice what the goats need is 2 x 5 = 10 pounds. Then we subtract 3 pounds from that, so 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. That's how much hay each sheep needs.

Now, we need to find out how much hay all the goats need. There are 15 goats and they need 5 pounds each, so 15 x 5 = 75 pounds.

Then we need to find out how much hay all the sheep need. There are 12 sheep and they need 7 pounds each, so 12 x 7 = 84 pounds.

Now we add the hay the goats need and the hay the sheep need. 75 + 84 = 159.

"John gets 50 dollars for every hour he works. He worked 6 hours, so he got 50 x 6 = 300 dollars.

He spent 50 dollars on gas, so now he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars.

He wants to put 100 dollars in the bank, so now he has 250 - 100 = 150 dollars.

He bought 5 pencils for 10 dollars each, so that's 5 x 10 = 50 dollars.

Now he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars.

He wants to buy pens that cost 25 dollars each. If he has 100 dollars, he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens.

"Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each. To find the total number of letters, we multiply 20 and 15. 
20 x 15 = 300

Craig's brother spelled 50 more letters than Craig. So, we add 50 to 300.
300 + 50 = 350

Now, we add the total letters of Craig and his brother to find the total number of letters they spelled.
300 + 350 = 650

"There are 8 children in a row. There are 7 rows. So, in one school, there are 8 x 7 = 56 children. Since there are 5 schools, we multiply 56 by 5. That's 56 x 5 = 280.

"The teacher has 9 coupons. Each coupon is for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, she gets 9 x 100 = 900 bottles of apple juice.

There are 29 pupils in the class. The teacher gives each pupil 2 bottles of apple juice. So, she gives away 29 x 2 = 58 bottles.

Now, let's see how many bottles she has left. We subtract the bottles she gave away from the total bottles she got. That's 900 - 58 = 842.

"Patty's Plumbing charges $40 to visit a house. They also charge $35 for each hour they work. If they work a little bit of an hour, they still charge $35. They also charge for the parts they use.

This job took 2.25 hours. That's more than 2 hours, so we have to count it as 3 hours. 3 hours x $35 is $105.

They also used $60 in parts. Now we add everything together: $40 (visit) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205.

"James got 10 CDs for 40% off. They cost $15 each. So first, we need to know how much they cost with the discount. 

If they cost $15 each, 10 CDs would be 10 x $15 = $150. But James got 40% off. That means he paid 60% of $150. 

60% is like 60 out of 100. So we need to find 60% of $150. We can do that by multiplying $150 by 0.6. That's $90.

James paid $90 for the CDs. Then he sold 5 of them for $40. So he got $40 back.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to subtract the $40 he got back from the $90 he paid. That's $90 - $40 = $50.

Now, let's add them all together. $9 + $20 is $29. Then, $29 + $5 is $34.

"James has to swim 20 miles. He swims 60% of that, which is 12 miles. He swims 2 miles per hour, so it takes him 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim 12 miles.

Then, he rests for half of 6 hours, which is 3 hours.

After that, he has 8 miles left to swim. But he swims slower now, 1 mile per hour. So, it takes him 8 hours to swim the last 8 miles.

To find the total time, we add 6 hours (swimming), 3 hours (resting), and 8 hours (swimming again). That's 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"Cayley sells newspapers and gets some money for each one he sells. He gets 10% for the New York Times and 8% for the Wall Street Journal.

The New York Times costs $5. He sold 6 of them, so that's 6 x $5 = $30. He gets 10% of that, which is $30 x 0.10 = $3.

The Wall Street Journal costs $15. He sold 10 of them, so that's 10 x $15 = $150. He gets 8% of that, which is $150 x 0.08 = $12.

"Let's think about this problem. We know Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored. We also know it was 10 more points than Dinar scored.

So, if we say Azibo scored some points, Bahati scored 20 more than that. And Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati.

Let's try to find out how many points Azibo scored. If we say Azibo scored 5 points, then Bahati scored 5 + 20 = 25 points. And Dinar scored 25 - 10 = 15 points.

Now, let's add all the points together: 5 + 25 + 15 = 45. This is the total number of points the team scored.

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

The final answer is: 5"
"So we have a big book, and it's 1.5 inches thick. The paper it's made of is special - 100 pages can fit in just 1 inch. But here's the cool thing: each piece of paper has a page on both sides.

So, if 100 pages fit in 1 inch, and each piece of paper has 2 pages, that means 200 pages fit in 1 inch. Now, we need to figure out how many pages fit in 1.5 inches.

To do that, we multiply 200 pages (that fit in 1 inch) by 1.5. That's like adding 200 + 200 + half of 200. Half of 200 is 100, so it's 200 + 200 + 100.

200 + 200 is 400, and then we add 100, which makes 500. But wait, we made a mistake - we added 200 + 200 + 100, but we should have only added half of 200, which is 100, to 200 + 200. So, 200 + 200 is 400, and then we add 100, which makes 500, but we should have only added 100 to 400, so that's 400 + 100, which is 500, but we should have only added half of 200 to 200 + 200, so

"Jonathan has 2 dozen cups. Dozen means 12, so he has 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

He has 2/3 as many spoons as cups. To find out how many spoons, we need to do a little math. If he had 3 cups, he would have 2 spoons. So for 24 cups, we need to find out how many groups of 3 cups there are. That's 24 รท 3 = 8. Then we multiply 8 by 2 (because 2 spoons for every 3 cups), and we get 16 spoons.

Jonathan gives Pedro 6 spoons, so he has 16 - 6 = 10 spoons left.

Now, let's count all the things Jonathan has: 24 cups and 10 spoons. That's 24 + 10 = 34.

So, the number of empty beds is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

Now, 50 new patients come to the hospital every day. We need to find out how many patients come in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 7 x 2 = 14 days. 
50 patients x 14 days = 700 patients.

Now, we add the new patients to the patients already in the hospital. 
200 + 700 = 900 patients.

So, the number of empty beds is 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

"Robyn sends 16 emails a day. 7 are for work. So, she sends 16 - 7 = 9 emails that aren't for work.

Two-thirds of those 9 emails are to her family. Two-thirds is like 2 out of 3. So, if we divide 9 into 3 groups, we get 3 groups of 3. Two of those groups are for her family. That's 2 x 3 = 6 emails to her family.

That leaves 9 - 6 = 3 emails for other people. One-third of those 3 emails are to her boyfriend. One-third is like 1 out of 3. So, 1 group of 3 is for her boyfriend. That's 1 x 3 = 3, but we only have 3 emails, so it's just 1 group, which is 1 email.

"So Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert, but Kelly said that's not right. Kelly said Courtney made a mistake and added 20% more people. 

To find out how many people were really there, we need to find 20% of 48. To do that, we multiply 48 by 0.20. That's like 48 x 20/100. 

48 x 20 is 960, and 960/100 is 9.6. So 20% of 48 is 9.6. 

Now, we subtract 9.6 from 48. That's 48 - 9.6 = 38.4. We can't have a part of a person, so we'll say 38 people were at the concert.

The final answer is: 38"

After that, the bird flew south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. We multiply 5 hours by 22 miles per hour. That's 5 x 22 = 110 miles.

Now, we need to find out how far the bird is from her home. She flew 300 miles south, then 36 miles north, and then 110 miles south. So, we add the miles she flew south and subtract the miles she flew north. That's 300 + 110 - 36 = 374 miles.

Now, let's add them all up: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. But we need to find out how many minutes that is. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we need to divide 120 by 60. That's 120 รท 60 = 2 minutes.

"Adam's mum gave him $6 to buy trousers. His dad gave him twice as much, so that's 2 x $6 = $12 from his dad. 

So, Adam got $6 + $12 = $18 from his parents. The trousers cost $30. To find out how much Adam had to pay, we need to subtract the money he got from his parents from the cost of the trousers.

$30 - $18 = $12

"We know that there are four kids: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. Their total age is 20 years. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.

Let's add their ages: 3 + 4 = 7. Now we subtract 7 from the total age: 20 - 7 = 13. This means Helene and Wilfred's ages add up to 13.

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. To find the average age, we divide the total age by the number of kids: 20 / 4 = 5. So Helene is 2 * 5 = 10 years old.

Now we know Helene's age, so we subtract it from 13: 13 - 10 = 3. This is Wilfred's age.

So, the adults get 4 pieces in total (2 pieces x 2 adults). To find out what percentage of the watermelon the adults get, we need to divide the number of pieces the adults get by the total number of pieces and multiply by 100.

There are 8 pieces in total, and the adults get 4 pieces. 4 is half of 8, and half is the same as 50%. But we want to know what percentage each adult gets, not both adults together. Since there are 2 adults, we need to divide 50% by 2.

In total, he will spend 180 + 300 = 480 minutes on checking people and appointments. There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 480 minutes is 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

Doctor Jones is at the clinic for 9 hours. He spends 8 hours on checking people and appointments. So, he has 9 - 8 = 1 hour left to update his records.

Each female porcupine has 4 babies every month. So, 30 female porcupines will have 30 x 4 = 120 babies every month. 

There are 12 months in a year. So, in a year, the female porcupines will have 120 x 12 = 1440 babies.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank. That's 1/4 of 18000, which is 4500 gallons. Ms. B filled 3/4 of what Wanda filled, so that's 3/4 of 4500, which is 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda filled 2/3 of what she filled the day before. That's 2/3 of 4500, which is 3000 gallons. Ms. B filled 1/3 of what she filled the day before. That's 1/3 of 3375, which is 1125 gallons.

Now, let's add up all the gallons they filled: 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 gallons.

The tank can hold 18000 gallons, and they filled 9000 gallons. So, to find out how many gallons are left, we subtract 9000 from 18000.

But to make it easy, we can multiply 18 by 3, and then add a little more. 18 x 3 = 54.

She earned $120 from selling the stuffed animals. We can make a list of how much money she earned from the big ones and the small ones. Let's say she sold L big ones. Then she sold 2L small ones.

The big ones cost $12 each, so she earned 12L dollars from the big ones. The small ones cost $4 each, so she earned 4 x 2L = 8L dollars from the small ones.

We know she earned $120 in total. So, we can write an equation: 12L + 8L = 120.

We can add 12L and 8L: 20L = 120.

Now, we need to find L. We can do this by dividing both sides by 20: L = 120 / 20 = 6.

She also buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese. It costs $6 per pound. So 3 pounds will be 3 x $6 = $18.

Now, we add the cost of both cheeses. $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor had $50. She spent $40 on cheese. So she has $50 - $40 = $10 left.

"Jim went to college for 4 years. He got $50,000 in loans each year. So, he got 4 x $50,000 = $200,000 in loans.

Before college, Jim made $25,000 per year. He didn't work for 4 years, so he lost 4 x $25,000 = $100,000.

Jim's new job pays him 3 times more than his old job. So, he makes $25,000 x 3 = $75,000 per year.

To pay back the loans and the money he lost, Jim needs to make $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

If Jim makes $75,000 per year, it will take him $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years to make that much money.

The final answer is: 4"
"So Jim needs fabric for his big bed. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. He wants the fabric to be a bit bigger, 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider.

So the fabric needs to be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long. And it needs to be 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

Now we need to find out how much fabric Jim needs. To do that, we multiply the length and the width. That's 8 x 10 = 80 square feet. But Jim needs two pieces of fabric, so we multiply 80 by 2.

80 x 2 = 160

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 x 102 = 204. Then they added 5, so that's 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

On the third race, he lost some money again. He lost 1.5 times as much as he won on the second race. So, he lost 1.5 x $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's see how much money he lost in total. He lost $5, then he won $11, so that's like he didn't lose $11. Then he lost $16.50. So, in total, he lost $5 - $11 + $16.50 = $10.50.

"Let's say the first person got some money, and we don't know how much. Let's call that amount ""x"".

The second person got $80 more than the first person, so they got x + 80.

The third person got twice as much as the second person, so they got 2 times (x + 80).

We know that all the money together is $1920. So, we can add up the money the first, second, and third person got, and it should equal $1920.

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Now, let's add it all up. 

x + x is 2x, and x + 80 + 2(x + 80) is 2x + 80 + 2x + 160. That's 4x + 240.

So, 4x + 240 = 1920

Now, let's subtract 240 from both sides. That gives us 4x = 1680.

Now, let's divide both sides by 4. That gives us x = 420.

"To find out how many hours each painter worked, we need to do some math.

First, we need to know how many hours they worked in a day. They worked 3/8 of a day. There are 24 hours in a day. So, we need to find 3/8 of 24.

Imagine you have 24 cookies and you want to give 3/8 of them to your friend. You can divide the cookies into 8 groups of 3 cookies each. Then, you give 3 groups to your friend. That's 3 x 3 = 9 cookies.

So, 3/8 of 24 hours is 9 hours. They worked 9 hours a day.

They worked for 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so they worked 3 x 7 = 21 days.

Now, we need to multiply the hours they worked in a day by the number of days they worked. That's 9 hours x 21 days = 189 hours.

He got 4 more balls in the first set, so that's x + 4.

In the third set, he got half the balls he got in the second set, so that's x/2.

We know he got 19 balls in total. So we can make an equation: x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19.

To make it easier, let's multiply everything by 2: 2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38.

That's the same as 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38.

So that's 5x + 8 = 38.

If we take away 8 from both sides, we get 5x = 30.

Then we divide both sides by 5, and we get x = 6.

So in the second set, he got 6 balls. In the first set, he got 4 more than that, so he got 6 + 4 = 10.

21% of $20000 is $4200. So, the price in 2008 is $20000 - $4200 = $15800.

Now, we need to find the price in 2009. The car goes down by 21% again. 21% of $15800 is $3328. So, the price in 2009 is $15800 - $3328 = $12472.

Finally, we need to find the price in 2010. The car goes down by 21% again. 21% of $12472 is $2618.52. So, the price in 2010 is $12472 - $2618.52 = $9853.48.

We can make a simple math problem out of this. If Sam gets some feet, and Harry gets some feet plus 60, and together they have 100 feet, then we can say:

Sam's feet + Harry's feet = 100 feet
Sam's feet + (Sam's feet + 60) = 100 feet

Now, let's add Sam's feet together. If we have Sam's feet + Sam's feet, that's like having 2 Sam's feet. So we can say:

2 Sam's feet + 60 = 100 feet

Now, let's get rid of the 60. If we subtract 60 from both sides, we get:

2 Sam's feet = 40 feet

Now, let's find out how many feet Sam gets. If 2 Sam's feet is 40 feet, then 1 Sam's feet is half of that. So we can say:

Sam's feet = 40 / 2 = 20 feet

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Marcel sold 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes. That's 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes. 

He also sold 15% BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, I will multiply 300 by 0.15. That's 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes. Marcel sold 150 Trekking bikes and 45 BMX bikes. So, the number of MTB bikes is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105.

The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB ($500 / 2 = $250), and a Trekking bike is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

The truck picks up 3 bales every hour. It also works for 6 hours, so it picks up 3 x 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we need to find out how many bales are left. To do that, we subtract the bales picked up by the truck from the bales made by the farmer. That's 30 - 18 = 12.

"John goes to school 5 days a week. He has 8 classes a day. Each class is 40 minutes long. So, he spends 8 x 40 = 320 minutes in school each day. 

He goes to school 5 days a week, so he spends 320 x 5 = 1600 minutes in school each week.

He also studies on Saturday and Sunday. He studies 1/16 of his total weekly time on these two days. Let's say he studies x minutes in a week. Then, he studies (1/16)x minutes on Saturday and Sunday.

So, the total time he studies is the time he spends in school plus the time he studies on Saturday and Sunday. This is 1600 + (1/16)x.

But we know that the total time he studies is x. So, we can say:

x = 1600 + (1/16)x

To solve this, we can multiply both sides by 16:

16x = 25600 + x

Then, we subtract x from both sides:

15x = 25600

Next, we divide both sides by 15:

x = 25600 / 15
x = 1706.67

Now, we can convert the total weekly minutes to hours:

Total hours per week = x / 60
Total hours per week = 1706.67 / 60
Total hours per week = 28.44

Let's start with the Allosaurus. If they ate 270 kilograms, and that was half of what was left, then before they ate, there must have been 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat.

Now, the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors ate, there must have been 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the triceratops must have had 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms of meat.

Let's start with the big walls. They are 10 feet by 8 feet. To find the area, we multiply 10 and 8. That's 80 square feet. We have two big walls, so we multiply 80 by 2. That's 160 square feet.

Now, let's look at the small walls. They are 5 feet by 8 feet. To find the area, we multiply 5 and 8. That's 40 square feet. We have two small walls, so we multiply 40 by 2. That's 80 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of the big and small walls. 160 + 80 is 240 square feet.

We know that one gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet. To find out how many gallons we need, we divide 240 by 20. That's 12 gallons.

Each gallon of paint costs $12. To find the total cost, we multiply 12 gallons by $12. That's $144.

The second train goes 30 miles in 1 hour, so in 3 hours it will go 30 x 3 = 90 miles.

"Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to put them into boxes. Each box can hold 8 crayons. So, we need to find out how many boxes he needs. 

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so 200 crayons weigh 200 ounces. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so 25 boxes weigh 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes: 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.

We need to change ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound. So, we divide 400 by 16.

400 / 16 = 25

"Grandma walks 3 miles every day. She walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. She walks faster on the sidewalk than on the beach. It takes her 40 minutes to walk on the beach.

Let's think about it. If she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, how long will it take her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk? Since she walks faster on the sidewalk, it will take her less time.

Imagine you're walking, and then you start walking faster. You'll get to where you're going sooner, right? So, if it takes her 40 minutes to walk 2 miles on the beach, it will take her half the time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, because she's walking faster.

40 minutes is the time for 2 miles on the beach. To find the time for 1 mile on the sidewalk, we can divide 40 minutes by 2, and then divide that by 2 again, because she's walking twice as fast.

40 minutes รท 2 = 20 minutes
20 minutes รท 2 = 10 minutes

So, it takes her 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Now, let's add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk.

40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes

$4 + $4 + $4 + $4 + $4 + $4 + $4 + $4 = $32

But Jane wants to save $60. So, we need to find out how much more she needs to save. To do that, we subtract the money she already has from the money she wants:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we know Jane needs to save $28 more. She saves $4 every week, so we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28. We can do that by dividing the money she needs to save by the money she saves every week:
$28 รท $4 = 7

"Donny has two mugs of water. One is 33 degrees. He pours some water from each mug into a bottle. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug. Now the water in the bottle is warm enough for him to drink. We know it's at least 40 degrees.

Imagine the water from the other mug is x degrees. When we mix the water, it's like making a special recipe. We mix 4 parts of 33-degree water with 1 part of x-degree water. This makes 5 parts of water that's at least 40 degrees.

Let's do some math. If we multiply 4 by 33, we get 132. This is the ""heat"" from the 33-degree water. We add the ""heat"" from the x-degree water, which is x. This makes 132 + x. We divide this by 5, because we have 5 parts of water now. This should be at least 40 degrees.

So, we can say: (132 + x) / 5 = 40. To make it easier, we can multiply both sides by 5. This gives us: 132 + x = 200.

Now, we subtract 132 from both sides. This gives us: x = 68.

So, the water in the other mug is at least 68 degrees.

"Let's think about this problem. We have three ropes: red, blue, and yellow. The red rope is four times as long as the blue rope. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If we add up all the lengths of the ropes, we get 37 centimeters.

Let's say the yellow rope is y centimeters long. Then the blue rope is y - 7 centimeters long. The red rope is four times as long as the blue rope, so it's 4(y - 7) centimeters long.

We know that when we add up all the lengths, we get 37 centimeters. So we can write an equation:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

This looks a bit tricky, but we can simplify it. Let's add up the y's and the numbers:
y + y + 4y = 6y (because 1 + 1 + 4 = 6)
And -7 + (-28) = -35 (because -7 x 4 = -28)

So our equation becomes:
6y - 35 = 37

Now, let's add 35 to both sides:
6y = 72

Next, let's divide both sides by 6:
y = 12

Now we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter, so it's 12 - 7 = 5 centimeters long.

The red rope is four times as long as the blue rope, so it's 4 x 5 = 20 centimeters long.

"The teacher has a 5-inch piece of chalk. He used 45% of it on Monday. To find out how much he used, we need to calculate 45% of 5 inches. 

45% is the same as 45/100. So, we multiply 5 inches by 45/100. 
5 x 45/100 = 2.25 inches.

Now, we subtract 2.25 inches from 5 inches to find out how much chalk is left. 
5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how much chalk that is, we calculate 20% of 5 inches. 
20% is the same as 20/100. So, we multiply 5 inches by 20/100. 
5 x 20/100 = 1 inch.

The teacher has 2.75 inches left and uses 1 inch per day. 
2.75 - 1 = 1.75 inches after the first day.
1.75 - 1 = 0.75 inches after the second day.

The teacher can't write with a very small piece of chalk, so he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. Since 0.75 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after the second day of using 20% of the original chalk length per day.

So, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

"There are 12 boys and 12 girls in Miss Albert's class. Some of them are on varsity. To find out how many are not on varsity, we need to find out how many are on varsity first.

One-third of the girls are on varsity. That's like dividing 12 cookies into 3 groups. Each group will have 4 cookies. So, 4 girls are on varsity.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity. That's like dividing 12 cookies into 4 groups. Each group will have 3 cookies. So, 3 boys are on varsity.

There are 4 girls and 3 boys on varsity. That's 7 students on varsity.

There are 12 boys and 12 girls in the class. That's 24 students. If 7 are on varsity, we subtract 7 from 24 to find out how many are not on varsity.

24 - 7 = 17

"So Mike bought 5 face masks. Now we need to find out how many Johnny bought. Johnny bought 2 more than 3 times what Mike bought.

"The dentist fixes some of James' teeth. He drills 4 teeth and caps 11 teeth. To find the total number of teeth fixed, we add 4 + 11 = 15.

James has 30 teeth. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we need to divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100.

So, (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

The dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

"Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk. But some of it was bad. He can't sell bad milk. He wants his money back for the bad milk.

First, we need to know how much money he paid for all the milk. The milk costs $3.5 per gallon. So we multiply 4000 by $3.5. That's $14,000.

Now, we need to know how much milk was bad. It was 2/5 of 4000 gallons. To find 2/5 of 4000, we can multiply 4000 by 2 and then divide by 5. That's 8000 divided by 5, which is 1600 gallons.

The bad milk costs $3.5 per gallon. So we multiply 1600 by $3.5. That's $5600.

"Let's think about this problem. We need to find out how old Colin is now.

Let's say Colin is C years old now. Then, in 7 years, he will be C + 7 years old.

Wendy is 5 times as old as Colin will be in 7 years. So, Wendy is 5(C + 7) years old.

Now, let's think about what happens in 25 years. Colin will be C + 25 years old. And Wendy will be 5(C + 7) + 25 years old, but we don't need to think about that. We just need to know that in 25 years, Colin will be 1/3 as old as Wendy is now.

So, we can say that C + 25 = (1/3) * 5(C + 7).

Now, let's try to solve this. We can start by multiplying both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)

This means 3C + 75 = 5C + 35.

Now, let's try to get all the C's on one side. We can do this by subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Now, let's get rid of the 35 by subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Finally, let's divide both sides by 2 to find C:
C = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Bob has $27000 to buy books for 3 schools. He can buy 100 books for $500. Let's see how many books he can buy with $27000. 

If 100 books cost $500, then we need to find out how many groups of $500 are in $27000. We can do that by dividing $27000 by $500.

$27000 รท $500 = 54

So, Bob can buy 54 groups of 100 books. To find out how many books that is, we multiply 54 by 100.

54 x 100 = 5400

Now, we need to divide the total number of books (5400) by the number of schools (3) to find out how many books each school gets.

So, let's count the apples in his pocket: 
- He put 1 apple in his pocket first.
- Then he put 4 more apples in his pocket.
- Then he picked up 6 more apples.

1 + 4 + 6 = 11

"Kate's friends are going to eat a lot of pizza. They will eat 6 slices of cheese pizza each. There are 6 friends, so that's 6 x 6 = 36 slices of cheese pizza. The cheese pizza has 12 slices. So, we need to divide 36 by 12. That's 3. We need 3 cheese pizzas.

They will also eat 4 slices of pepperoni pizza each. There are 6 friends, so that's 6 x 4 = 24 slices of pepperoni pizza. The pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. So, we need to divide 24 by 8. That's 3. We need 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. That's 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

"Jay makes 20 snowballs in 1 hour. That's 20 snowballs in 60 minutes. So, he makes 1 snowball every 3 minutes.

But, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. That's like 2 snowballs melting every 15 minutes, and Jay makes 5 snowballs in 15 minutes. So, he really gets 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs every 15 minutes.

Jay wants 60 snowballs. If he gets 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many 3s fit into 60. We can do that by dividing 60 by 3. 60 รท 3 = 20. That means 20 groups of 3 snowballs. Since each group takes 15 minutes, we multiply 20 by 15. 20 x 15 = 300 minutes.

The nurses started with some bandages, but we don't know how many. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and got 50 more. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. On the third day, they got 2 more packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Let's think about what they had at the end of the third day. They got 2 packs of 50 bandages, which is 100 bandages, and used 25, so they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

But they had 78 bandages left, so they must have had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the first and second days.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and got 50, so they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left. On the second day, they used 28 bandages, but they only had 12 from the first day, so they must have had some more bandages to start with.

Let's think about how many bandages they had to start with. They used 28 on the second day, but only had 12 from the first day, so they must have had 28 - 12 = 16 more bandages. And they had 12 left from the first day, so they must have had 16 + 12 = 28 more bandages to start with.

But they also got 50 bandages on the first day, so they must have had 28 + 50 = 78 bandages to start with.

Jen also gets $10 for every week she doesn't miss a day. She didn't miss any days in April, and there are 4 weeks in April. So she gets $10 * 4 = $40.

"Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes. Each palette had 4 colors. So, she had 2 x 4 = 8 colors. 

She also had 3 makeup sets. Each set had 6 colors. So, she had 3 x 6 = 18 colors.

Her sister took 1 palette. That's 4 colors gone. Now Amy has 8 - 4 = 4 colors from the palettes.

Amy used some colors from 1 makeup set. She used half of the 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3. So, she used 3 colors. Now she has 18 - 3 = 15 colors from the makeup sets.

Amy has 4 colors from the palettes and 15 colors from the makeup sets. That's 4 + 15 = 19 colors.

"Mattison is 60 inches tall. His house is 7 times as tall as he is. So, the house is 7 x 60 = 420 inches tall.

The first floor is 3 times as tall as Mattison. So, the first floor is 3 x 60 = 180 inches tall.

Now, we need to find out how tall the roof is from the second floor. To do that, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house. That's 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

"So, we have 700 shells and three teams: Alphas, The finders, and Gogetters. 

First, team Alphas found 40% of the shells. To find 40% of 700, we need to multiply 700 by 0.4. 
0.4 * 700 = 280 shells

Now, we subtract 280 from 700 to find out how many shells are left.
700 - 280 = 420 shells

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells. To find 60% of 420, we multiply 420 by 0.6.
0.6 * 420 = 252 shells

Now, we subtract 252 from 420 to find out how many shells are left for team Gogetters.
420 - 252 = 168 shells

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

"We know that there are 4 dogs and they need to walk a total of some miles. We also know that on average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. So, if we multiply 4 dogs by 3 miles, we get 12 miles.

Now, let's add up the miles the first three dogs need: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

The last dog needs the miles that are left. To find that out, we subtract 8 miles from 12 miles: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kg

Now, we know that 1 kg of tuna costs $0.50. To find out how much money Deandre will get, we multiply the total weight by the cost of 1 kg.

128 kg * $0.50 = $64

Deandre will earn $64."
"Trinity bought magazines for $72. She sells them for 11/8 of what she paid. To find 11/8 of $72, we multiply 72 by 11 and then divide by 8.

72 * 11 = 792
792 / 8 = 99

So, Trinity sells the magazines for $99. To find her profit, we subtract what she paid from what she sold them for.

Profit = $99 - $72

"So, Brian has a dehumidifier that removes water from the air. It has three speeds: low, medium, and high. 

The low speed removes 1 liter of water per day. The medium speed removes twice as much as the low speed, so that's 2 liters per day. The high speed removes twice as much as the medium speed, so that's 4 liters per day.

Brian used the low speed for 3 days, so that's 1 liter * 3 days = 3 liters. Then he used the medium speed for 3 days, so that's 2 liters * 3 days = 6 liters. Then he used the high speed for 5 days, so that's 4 liters * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, let's add all the liters together: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

First, we need to find out how much medicine is in one dose. She needs 14 mL of the first medicine. The second medicine is 3 times that amount, so it's 14 x 3 = 42 mL.

Now, we add the two amounts together: 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL. That's the amount of medicine in one dose.

To find out how much medicine is in 8 doses, we multiply 56 mL by 8: 56 x 8 = 448 mL.

Each of John's classes can have 1/8 of the students that Ali's class can have. 1/8 of 120 is 15. So each of John's classes can have 15 students. John has two classes so 15 + 15 is 30.

Now we add the students in Ali's school and John's school. 120 + 30 is 150.

So, Stephen owes $300 + $6 = $306.

Stephen will pay $25 each month for 11 months. That's 11 x $25 = $275.

Now, we need to find out how much he still owes. We subtract $275 from $306. That's $306 - $275 = $31.

"To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to do some math.

First, we need to find out how many jelly beans can fit in the jar. The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall. So, the jar is like a big box. We need to find the volume of the box. To do that, we multiply the base area (6 x 6) by the height (15). 

6 x 6 = 36
36 x 15 = 540

But the jelly beans don't fill the whole jar. They only fill about 80% of it. So, we multiply 540 by 0.8.

540 x 0.8 = 432

Now, we know that each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. So, we divide 432 by 0.15 to find out how many jelly beans fit in the jar.

432 รท 0.15 = 2880

Now, we know that 30% of the jelly beans are red. So, we multiply 2880 by 0.3.

2880 x 0.3 = 864

But we know that there are really 900 red jelly beans in the jar. So, we subtract 864 from 900 to find out how far off Tim's guess was.

The bus can carry 200 people. It started with 20 people. Then, 40 more people got on. So now there are 20 + 40 = 60 people.

At the next stop, 3/4 of 40 people got on. 3/4 of 40 is 30. So now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people.

Then, the number of people doubled. So now there are 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus can carry 200 people. We need to find out how many more people can get on. 200 - 180 = 20.

That's like saying x + x + x + x = 40. If we add all those x's together, we get 5x = 40

Now, if we divide 40 by 5, we get 8. So x is 8. That means the shorter piece is 8 feet long.

The longer piece is 4 times longer, so it's 4 x 8 = 32 feet long.

Let's say she makes 'c' cupcakes. Then she makes 3 times as many brownies as cupcakes, but 2 less. So she makes 3c - 2 brownies.

We know that the total number of treats is 10. So we can make an equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10

Now, let's solve it. If we add c and 3c, we get 4c. Then we subtract 2. So it's 4c - 2 = 10.

Now, let's add 2 to both sides. That makes 4c = 12.

Now, let's divide both sides by 4. That makes c = 3.

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.

20% is like 20 out of 100. So, if we divide $75 into 100 parts, each part is $0.75. Then, 20 parts is 20 * $0.75 = $15. So, we get $15 off. 

Now, we subtract $15 from $75. That's $75 - $15 = $60. So, the manicure and pedicure together cost $60.

But Karen also wants nail art on each finger. She has 10 fingers, and each nail art costs $3. So, that's 10 * $3 = $30.

Now, we add the cost of the manicure and pedicure, which is $60, and the cost of the nail art, which is $30. That's $60 + $30 = $90.

Charlie teaches 4 people at the normal price. That's 4 x $80 = $320. He teaches 2 veterans at the lower price. That's 2 x $60 = $120.

"Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs. That's 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. She paid $2.40 for each dozen, so she paid 5 x $2.40 = $12.

She will sell 3 eggs for $1. So, she will sell 60 eggs in 60 / 3 = 20 sets. She will get $1 for each set, so she will get 20 x $1 = $20.

To find her profit, we need to subtract the cost from the money she got. So, her profit is $20 - $12 = $8.

"Skyler has 100 hats. Half of them are red. That's 100 divided by 2, which is 50. So, 50 hats are red.

Now, we have 100 - 50 = 50 hats left. 3/5 of these are blue. To find 3/5 of 50, we can multiply 50 by 3 and then divide by 5. That's (50 * 3) / 5 = 150 / 5 = 30. So, 30 hats are blue.

Now, we have 50 - 30 = 20 hats left. These are the white hats.

"Audrey needs to get 70% of all the questions right. There are 70 questions in the first test and 40 in the second test. So, there are 70 + 40 = 110 questions in total.

To get 70% of 110 questions right, we need to find 70% of 110. 
70% is the same as 70/100. So, we multiply 110 by 70/100.
110 * 70/100 = 77

This means Audrey needs to get 77 questions right in total. 

In the first test, Audrey got 60% of 70 questions right. 
60% is the same as 60/100. So, we multiply 70 by 60/100.

"Let's say Mary made 's' strawberry cubes. She made 5 times as many blueberry cubes as strawberry cubes, but 4 less. So, she made 5s - 4 blueberry cubes.

We know she made 116 ice cubes in total. So, the number of strawberry cubes plus the number of blueberry cubes is 116. We can write this as: s + (5s - 4) = 116.

Now, let's add the numbers together: s + 5s is 6s. So, we have 6s - 4 = 116.

To get rid of the -4, we add 4 to both sides: 6s = 120.

Now, we divide both sides by 6: s = 20.

So, Mary made 20 strawberry cubes. Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes: 5s - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

First, we know Albert is 36 inches tall. Anne is twice as tall as Albert, so we multiply 36 by 2. That's 72 inches. 

Now, Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne. So we subtract 2 from 72. That's 70 inches. That's how tall Jackie is now.

But we want to know how tall she was before summer. We know she grew 3 inches over summer. So we subtract 3 from 70. That's 67 inches.

"The company makes 5000 chocolate bars in a day. They sell each bar for $2. 

There are 7 days in a week. So in one week, they make 5000 * 7 = 35000 bars. 
In two weeks, they make 35000 * 2 = 70000 bars.

They sell each bar for $2. So they get 70000 * 2 = $140000.

"Jake buys 2 T-shirts. One T-shirt is $8. The other T-shirt is half price, so it's $8 / 2 = $4. So, the T-shirts cost $8 + $4 = $12.

Jake also buys shoes. The shoes are $40, but they're on sale. The sale is 40% off. 40% of $40 is a big number, but we can find 10% of $40, which is $4. Then we multiply it by 4 to get 40%, so it's $4 x 4 = $16. The shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the T-shirts and shoes together. $12 + $24 = $36.

"Ryan gets $6 each week for doing his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks, so he got 3 x $6 = $18.

Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and his 3 friends. Each cone cost $1.25. So, 4 cones cost 4 x $1.25 = $5.

Now, Ryan has $18 - $5 = $13 left.

Movie tickets cost $6.50 each. If Ryan has $13, he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"Ellen bought leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So Ellen spent $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought sunglasses for $30 and 2 bathrobes for $100 each. So 2 bathrobes cost $100 x 2 = $200. Lani spent $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, let's add what Ellen and Lani spent. $105 + $230 = $335.

"To find out how much profit Tim makes, we need to know how much it costs him to make the jars and how much he sells them for.

It takes 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey to make 1 jar. Passion fruit costs $6 per pound, jackfruit costs $8 per pound, and honey costs $10 per pound.

So, for 1 jar, the cost is:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8 = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10 = $20
Total cost for 1 jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

If Tim makes 10 jars, the total cost is: $44 * 10 = $440

He sells each jar for $50, so for 10 jars, he gets: $50 * 10 = $500

Profit is what's left after we take away the cost from what he gets. So, his profit is: $500 - $440 = $60

"We have to count the money in the jar. There are quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

Quarters are worth 25 cents. We have 32 quarters. So, 32 x 25 cents is 800 cents. That's 8 dollars.

Dimes are worth 10 cents. We have 95 dimes. So, 95 x 10 cents is 950 cents. That's 9 dollars and 50 cents.

Nickels are worth 5 cents. We have 120 nickels. So, 120 x 5 cents is 600 cents. That's 6 dollars.

Pennies are worth 1 cent. We have 750 pennies. So, 750 x 1 cent is 750 cents. That's 7 dollars and 50 cents.

Now, let's add the money together. 8 dollars + 9 dollars 50 cents = 17 dollars 50 cents. 
17 dollars 50 cents + 6 dollars = 23 dollars 50 cents. 
23 dollars 50 cents + 7 dollars 50 cents = 31 dollars.

"Janet went to the mall and bought some things. She spent $3.50 on ice cream. Then she bought movie tickets for herself and her sister. Each ticket cost $7.50, so that's $7.50 + $7.50 = $15. She also bought a bracelet for $8.50.

Let's add up how much she spent: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27.

Her parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the amount her parents gave her: $40 - $27 = $13.

"Randy had 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He ate 3 cookies for a snack, so we need to subtract 1 from each kind. 

Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

Then he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. 
Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6

He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends. 
Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

Now, Randy baked 4 of each kind of cookie. 
Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Let's count all the cookies now.

"Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. He wants to sell them. Someone wants to buy them, but they want to pay different prices for different toys. They want to pay $5 for half of the toys and $7 for the other half.

First, we need to find out how many toys are in each half. If we divide 12 by 2, we get 6. So, there are 6 toys in each half.

For the first 6 toys, he gets $5 each. So, we multiply 6 by $5. That's $30.

For the other 6 toys, he gets $7 each. So, we multiply 6 by $7. That's $42.

Now, we add $30 and $42. That's $72.

"Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day. He digs for 14 days. So, he digs 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

When Nate gets home, he fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 more holes every night. So, Nate fills 9 - 6 = 3 holes every day.

To fill 84 holes, Nate needs 84 / 3 = 28 days.

There are 7 days in a week. So, Nate needs 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

12000 / 4 = 3000

So Butler High School has 3000 students. Now, we need to find the difference between 4000 and 3000.

"The Adams family made a lot of cookies. They made 7995 cookies in total. Some of them are rainbow cookies, and some are oatmeal cookies. They made 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies. To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made, we need to add the rainbow and oatmeal cookies first.

Rainbow cookies + oatmeal cookies = 2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies - rainbow and oatmeal cookies = 7995 - 5670 = 2325

"Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to get 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. But Igor made a mistake. He got half the test tubes, so that's 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

He got 2 more Petri dishes than he was supposed to, so that's 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

Igor got the right number of beakers, but he lost some on the way. Let's say he lost some beakers, and we don't know how many yet. We know he had 29 things in total.

So, we can count the things we know: 8 test tubes and 16 Petri dishes. That's 8 + 16 = 24 things. We know he had 29 things, so the beakers must be 29 - 24 = 5.

But we know he was supposed to get 7 beakers. So, he must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

"Let's break this down step by step.

Dora will be 12 in 3 years. So, how old is she now? If she's going to be 12 in 3 years, that means she's 12 - 3 = 9 years old now.

James is twice as old as Dora. So, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

John was 19 when James was born. Now James is 18, so John is 18 + 19 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32. So, the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

"Let's think about this problem. We know there are 20 animals, and they are either chickens or cows. We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

If we say the number of chickens is 'c', then the number of cows is 20 - c (because there are 20 animals in total).

Now, let's think about the legs. The chickens have 2c legs (because there are 'c' chickens and each has 2 legs). The cows have 4(20 - c) legs (because there are 20 - c cows and each has 4 legs).

We know the total number of legs is 70. So, we can write an equation:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Let's solve this equation. First, multiply 4 by 20 - c:

2c + 80 - 4c = 70

Now, let's move the terms with 'c' to one side and the numbers to the other side:

-2c = -10

Now, let's divide both sides by -2:

c = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

The final answer is: 5"
