"To figure out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to know how many eggs she sells. She gets 16 eggs from her ducks every day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 to bake muffins. So, we need to subtract those from the total number of eggs.

16 (total eggs) - 3 (eaten for breakfast) - 4 (used for muffins) = 9 eggs

She sells these 9 eggs at $2 each. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs by the price per egg.

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

"To figure this out, we need to know how much white fiber is needed. It says the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, we need to divide 2 by 2 to get the amount of white fiber. 2 divided by 2 is 1.

So, the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber. To find the total, we add 2 + 1.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we need to figure out how much he sold the house for and subtract how much he spent.

Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. So, the total amount he spent is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 2.5 times the original value. To find the new value, we multiply the original value by 2.5. 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

Now, we subtract the total amount Josh spent from the new value to find the profit: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to figure out how many sprints he does in a week and multiply that by how many meters he runs per sprint.

James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week. So, he does 3 x 3 = 9 sprints a week. Each sprint is 60 meters. To find the total meters, we multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint: 9 x 60 = 540.

"To figure out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we need to know the total amount of feed they need for the day. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day and Wendi has 20 chickens, we multiply 20 by 3 to get the total amount of feed needed. 

20 * 3 = 60 cups

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. To find the total amount of feed given in the first two meals, we add 15 and 25.

15 + 25 = 40 cups

Now, we subtract the amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed needed to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal.

60 - 40 = 20 cups

"So, Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. The first glass costs $5, and every other glass costs 60% of $5. To find 60% of $5, I multiply $5 by 0.6, which is $3.

Now, I need to find the total cost. I can pair the glasses up - one that costs $5 and one that costs $3. Since Kylar wants 16 glasses, I can make 8 pairs.

Each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8. Since I have 8 pairs, I multiply $8 by 8, which is $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to figure out how many sheep each city has. We know Seattle has 20 sheep. 

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, we multiply 20 by 4 to find out how many sheep Charleston has: 20 * 4 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we multiply 80 by 2 to find out how many sheep Toulouse has: 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in each city: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

"So Carla is downloading a big file, 200 GB. She can download 2 GB every minute. But then her computer restarts and she has to start all over.

First, let's figure out how much of the file she downloaded before the computer restarted. 40% of 200 GB is 80 GB. To find out how long it took her to download 80 GB, we divide 80 by 2 (since she can download 2 GB per minute). That's 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Then, her computer restarts and that takes 20 minutes. After that, she has to start the download all over again. So, she has to download the whole 200 GB file. To find out how long that takes, we divide 200 by 2 (since she can download 2 GB per minute). That's 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

So, we add up all the time: 40 minutes (before the restart) + 20 minutes (the restart) + 100 minutes (the whole download). That's 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

"To find out how far John is from home, we need to figure out how far he drove before turning around and how far he drove after turning around.

First, let's calculate how far he drove before turning around. He drove for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate how far he drove after turning around. He spent the first 2 hours stuck in traffic, so he didn't move. Then, he drove for half an hour at 30 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

After that, he drove for the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

So, the total distance he drove after turning around is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Since he was trying to get back home, we need to subtract the distance he drove after turning around from the distance he drove before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find out how much Eliza made this week, we need to break it down. She gets paid $10 for each of the first 40 hours she works. So for those 40 hours, she made 40 * $10 = $400.

She worked 5 hours more than 40, so that's overtime. For overtime, she gets 1.2 times her regular pay, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour. So for those 5 hours, she made 5 * $12 = $60.

Now, we add the two amounts together to get her total pay: $400 + $60 = $460.

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. So, we multiply 60 by 3 to get 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180. We can do this by multiplying 180 by 0.3, which gives us 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find the total cost of the pastries, we need to calculate the cost of each type and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the donuts. Toula bought 3 dozen donuts, and each dozen costs $68. So, the cost of the donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, let's find the cost of the mini cupcakes. She bought 2 dozen, and each dozen costs $80. So, the cost of the mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.

Finally, let's find the cost of the mini cheesecakes. She bought 6 dozen, and each dozen costs $55. So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"To figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to think about the costs and the money he'll make.

The tree costs $90 to plant, and every year it costs $3 to take care of it. On the other hand, the tree grows 7 lemons each year, and Carlos can sell them for $1.5 each. So, he makes $10.5 each year from selling lemons.

Let's think about it like this: in the first year, Carlos spends $90 to plant the tree and $3 to take care of it, so he spends a total of $93. He makes $10.5 from selling lemons, but he still loses money.

In the second year, Carlos spends another $3 to take care of the tree, so now he's spent a total of $96. He makes another $10.5 from selling lemons, so now he's made a total of $21. He's still losing money.

We can keep going like this until we find the year when Carlos starts making more money than he spends.

Year 1: Spent $93, Made $10.5
Year 2: Spent $96, Made $21
Year 3: Spent $99, Made $31.5
Year 4: Spent $102, Made $42
Year 5: Spent $105, Made $52.5
Year 6: Spent $108, Made $63
Year 7: Spent $111, Made $73.5
Year 8: Spent $114, Made $84

Year 11: Spent $123, Made $115.5
Year 12: Spent $126, Made $126
Year 13: Spent $129, Made $136.5

It looks like in year 13, Carlos finally makes more money than he spends. He makes $136.5 and spends $129.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie starts with some vacuum cleaners, and we don't know how many. Let's call that number 'x'.

She sells a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. That means she sells x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Then, she sells 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So now, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

After that, she sells half of what's left at the orange house. To find out how many she has left, we need to divide what's left by 2. So, she has (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners left.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up an equation:

(x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x - x/3 - 2 = 10

Now, let's add 2 to both sides:

x - x/3 = 12

Next, let's add x/3 to both sides:

x = 12 + x/3

Now, let's subtract x/3 from both sides:

2x/3 = 12

Finally, let's multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 18

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to figure out how many students are in each type of dance.

First, 20% of the students are in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 0.2 x 20 = 4 students.

That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Next, 25% of the remaining students are in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is 0.25 x 16 = 4 students.

So, 16 - 4 = 12 students are left for hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of students in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100. That's (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

"To figure out which option is better, we need to calculate how much more the items will be worth after a month.

The jewelry is worth $5,000 and will go up 2.5%. To find out how much it will go up, we multiply $5,000 by 2.5% (which is the same as 0.025). 
$5,000 * 0.025 = $125

The electronic gadgets are worth $8,000 and will go up 1.2%. We multiply $8,000 by 1.2% (which is the same as 0.012).
$8,000 * 0.012 = $96

Since $125 is more than $96, the merchant should buy the jewelry to make the most profit.

Profit: $125"
"So, we have two trains that start at the same place, San Rafael, and travel the same distance in the same direction on the first day, which is 80 miles west. Then, on the second day, they travel 150 miles north.

To find the total distance each train traveled, we just need to add the distance they traveled on the first day to the distance they traveled on the second day.

So, the total distance is 80 miles (first day) + 150 miles (second day) = 230 miles.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to figure out how much she makes from teaching and coaching.

Jill teaches 35 hours a week and gets paid $20 per hour. So, her weekly pay from teaching is:
$20 * 35 = $700 per week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her yearly pay from teaching is:
$700 * 50 = $35,000 per year

Jill also coaches 15 hours a week and gets paid $30 per hour. So, her weekly pay from coaching is:
$30 * 15 = $450 per week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her yearly pay from coaching is:
$450 * 50 = $22,500 per year

Now, let's add her yearly pay from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

"To figure out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to do some math. First, we need to know how many days are in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 x 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats 3 eggs every day, we multiply 28 days by 3 eggs to get the total number of eggs she'll eat. That's 28 x 3 = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. We know that 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs. So, we divide 84 eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens. That's 84 ÷ 12 = 7.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we need to figure out how much time she has left to finish the trail. She wants to finish the 12-mile trail in a way that her average speed is 4 miles per hour.

We can find the total time she has by dividing the total distance by her desired average speed. 

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa already walked 6 miles in 2 hours. She has 6 miles left to walk. To find the time she has left, we subtract the time she already took from the total time.

Time left = Total time - Time already taken
Time left = 3 hours - 2 hours
Time left = 1 hour

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance. We divide the distance left by the time left.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to figure out how much water is in the orange drink and the pineapple drink.

First, let's look at the orange drink. It's 2/3 water, which means for every 3 liters, 2 of them are water. We started with 10 liters, but we spilled 1, so we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters left. To find the amount of water, we multiply 9 by 2/3. To do this, we can multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3. So, 9 * 2 = 18, and 18 / 3 = 6. So, there are 6 liters of water in the orange drink.

Now, let's look at the pineapple drink. It's 3/5 water, which means for every 5 liters, 3 of them are water. We have 15 liters of pineapple drink. To find the amount of water, we multiply 15 by 3/5. To do this, we can multiply 15 by 3 and then divide by 5. So, 15 * 3 = 45, and 45 / 5 = 9. So, there are 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

Raymond's age = 37

Now, we know Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago that was, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age.

Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

The 4 apples cost 4 x $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of these items: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so we subtract $33 from $50 to find out how much she spent on pizza: $50 - $33 = $17.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so he had 15 miles left after the second stop. To find the distance between the two stops, we subtract the distance remaining after the second stop from the distance left after the first stop.

Distance between the first and second stops = 40 - 15

"So, Gloria is trying to decide between buying boots or two pairs of high heels. The two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. We know one pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much.

To find the cost of the other pair of heels, we multiply $33 by 2, which is $66. Now we add the cost of both pairs of heels: $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 more than the heels, we add $5 to $99. So, the boots cost $99 + $5 = $104.

"So we know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x, where x is a number we don't know yet.

We also know that their total age now is 162. We can write this as an equation:

7x + 11x = 162

When we add 7x and 11x, we get 18x. So the equation becomes:

18x = 162

To find x, we need to divide both sides by 18:

x = 162 ÷ 18
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's current age = 11x
= 11 × 9
= 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10

"To find the average guess, we need to know what each friend guessed. The first friend said 80 jelly beans.

The second friend said 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third friend said 25% more than the first friend's guess. To find 25% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.25, which is 20. Then we add 20 to 80, which is 100.

Now we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the sum by the number of guesses. There are 3 guesses, so we divide 240 by 3.

240 ÷ 3 = 80

"To find out how many gold coins Gretchen has, we need to know how many silver coins she has. Let's say the number of silver coins is 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'.

We know Gretchen has 110 coins in total. So, the number of silver coins plus the number of gold coins equals 110. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine the x's and the 30:
2x + 30 = 110

Now, subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the number of gold coins, we add 30 to the number of silver coins:
40 + 30 = 70

Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. That's easy.

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25. That's 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points from the first and second 20 minutes to get the total points.

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Now, we know the yogurts are on sale for 4 yogurts for $5.00. We need to find out how many groups of 4 yogurts Terry buys. We do this by dividing 60 yogurts by 4.

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts = 15 groups

Since each group costs $5.00, we multiply 15 groups by $5.00.

15 groups * $5.00 = $75.00

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we need to figure out how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold his lego sets for $15 each. Let's say he sold x lego sets. Then, he made 15x dollars.

We know he bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160 on video games. He also had $5 left.

The total amount of money he made from selling lego sets is equal to the amount he spent on video games plus the amount he had left. So, we can set up the equation: 15x = 160 + 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get 15x = 165.

Now, we can divide both sides by 15 to find x: x = 165 / 15 = 11.

This means John sold 11 lego sets. He had 13 lego sets initially, so the number of lego sets he still has is 13 - 11 = 2.

So, the total time he runs is 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours.

Now, we can find his speed. Speed is how far you go divided by how long it takes you to get there. So, we divide the distance (60 miles) by the time (6 hours).

Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour

Now, we know Dana runs four times faster than she walks. To find her walking speed, we divide her running speed by 4. So, 6 miles per hour divided by 4 is 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends 1/3 of her time running and 2/3 of her time walking. If she has 6 hours, she spends 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

When she runs for 2 hours, she covers 2 * 6 = 12 miles. When she walks for 4 hours, she covers 4 * 1.5 = 6 miles.

So, the total distance she covers in 6 hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

"To figure this out, we need to find out how far Polly can throw the javelin when she's holding the gemstone. We know she can throw it 400 feet without the gemstone, but with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. So, we multiply 400 by 3 to get 1200 feet.

Now, we need to find out how far outside the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon. The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, so we subtract 1000 from 1200 to get the answer.

1200 - 1000 = 200

Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To find out how many pieces of pie the guests took, we need to figure out how many pieces were there in the first place. Grandma Jones had 5 pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. So, we multiply 5 by 8 to get the total number of pieces.

5 x 8 = 40

That means there were 40 pieces of pie on the buffet table. At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces the guests took, we subtract the number of pieces left from the total number of pieces.

40 - 14 = 26

"To figure this out, we need to know how many calories you have left for the day. You said your target is 2000 calories, and you already ate 1800 calories. So, let's subtract 1800 from 2000.

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Now, we know the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. We need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories. To do that, we'll divide 200 by 250.

200 ÷ 250 = 0.8 servings.

The bag of chips is 300g and has 5 servings. So, we need to find out how many grams are in one serving. We'll divide 300g by 5.

300g ÷ 5 = 60g per serving.

Now, we know you can eat 0.8 servings. We'll multiply 60g by 0.8.

60g * 0.8 = 48g.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to figure out how much money he makes from selling the candles and subtract how much he spent on supplies.

Charlie makes 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax. Since he wants to make and sell 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 x $10.00 = $20.00.

Now, let's calculate how much money Charlie makes from selling the candles. He sells each candle for $2.00, so he makes 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the cost from the money he made: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To find out how many hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to know how many articles she wrote each day and how long it takes her to write one article. 

Meredith writes an article in 4 hours. On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 more articles than Monday. To find 2/5 of 5, we multiply 2/5 and 5. 
2/5 * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Twice of 7 is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add the articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many Post-it notes Candice bought at the store. We know she started with 80 Post-it notes and had 23 left after using some at work.

First, let's find out how many Post-it notes she used at work. We know she put one Post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee, so she used 220 Post-it notes.

Now, let's think about how many Post-it notes she had before she used the 220. We know she had 23 left after using the 220, so before using them, she had 23 + 220 = 243 Post-it notes.

But we also know she started with 80 Post-it notes. So, the extra Post-it notes she had must have come from the package she bought. To find out how many were in the package, we subtract the 80 she started with from the 243 she had before using the 220.

243 - 80 = 163

"To find out how much John spent on ties, we need to figure out how many blue ties and red ties he bought, and then calculate the total cost.

First, let's find out how many blue ties he bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can divide $200 by $40 to get the number of blue ties. 

$200 ÷ $40 = 5

So, John bought 5 blue ties.

Now, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Since he bought 5 blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The problem also says that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To find the cost of a red tie, we need to calculate 50% of $40 and add it to $40. 

50% of $40 is $20, so a red tie costs $40 + $20 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the red ties. Since John bought 10 red ties at $60 each, the total cost is 10 * $60 = $600.

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties ($200) and the cost of the red ties ($600) to get the total amount John spent on ties.

$200 + $600 = $800

"To find out how many pieces Tracy got, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we know the wire is 48 inches long and each piece is 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces Tracy got, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

Tracy got 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the number of unoccupied units, we need to first find the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, we multiply 15 by 8.

15 * 8 = 120 units

Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply 120 by 3/4.

120 * 3/4 = 90 units

Since 90 units are occupied, we subtract this from the total number of units to find the unoccupied units.

120 - 90 = 30

"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to figure out how many eggs he sells and how much money he gets from them.

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to know how many dozens of eggs that is. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 252 by 12.

252 ÷ 12 = 21

So Lloyd sells 21 dozen eggs per day. He sells each dozen for $2, so we multiply 21 by $2 to find out how much he makes per day.

21 × $2 = $42

Now we know Lloyd makes $42 per day. To find out how much he makes per week, we multiply that by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

$42 × 7 = $294

Distance = 30 miles

Now that we know the distance, we can find out how long it takes him to get back. We know he's traveling at 6 miles per hour this time.

"Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. He has comic books that weigh 1/4 pound each and toys that weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, we need to figure out how many toys he needs to remove.

First, let's find out how much weight the comic books took off. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, we multiply 30 comic books by 1/4 pound. That's 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we need to divide 7.5 by 1/2 to find out how many toys he needs to remove. That's 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To find out how much more money the mechanic made on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate how much money the mechanic made on Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. So, for the truck tires, the mechanic made 6 x $60 = $360. For the car tires, the mechanic made 4 x $40 = $160. Adding those together, the mechanic made $360 + $160 = $520 on Thursday.

On Friday, the mechanic fixed 12 car tires and no truck tires. The mechanic charges $40 for each car tire, so the mechanic made 12 x $40 = $480 on Friday.

Since $520 is more than $480, the mechanic made more money on Thursday. To find out how much more, we subtract the smaller number from the bigger number: $520 - $480 = $40.

Marcy worked 30 years, so she worked 10 years after the 20-year mark (30 - 20 = 10). To find out how much of the pension she gets, we multiply the 10 years by 5% per year. 

10 years * 5% per year = 10 * 0.05 = 0.5 or 50%

For the second half of the year, the company charged her 10% less. To find 10% of $140, we multiply $140 by 0.1, which is $14. So, she paid $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the second half of the year. Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, we multiply $126 by 6 to get the total amount for the second half of the year: $126 * 6 = $756.

First, the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for 180 days. So, the puppy eats 180 cups of dog food in the first 180 days.

Then, the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of the year. There are 365 days in a year, so the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for 365 - 180 = 185 days.

In the remaining 185 days, the puppy eats 185 * 2 = 370 cups of dog food.

So, in the first year, the puppy eats 180 + 370 = 550 cups of dog food.

Let's see how much one flower costs in each package. For the package of 3 flowers, we divide $2.50 by 3. That's about $0.83 per flower. For the package of 2 flowers, we divide $1 by 2. That's $0.50 per flower.

Since $0.50 is less than $0.83, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better deal.

Now, let's calculate how much it costs to buy 18 flowers at the better price. We need 9 packages of 2 flowers each, because 18 divided by 2 is 9. So, 9 packages times $1 per package is $9.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the other price, he needs 6 packages of 3 flowers each, because 18 divided by 3 is 6. So, 6 packages times $2.50 per package is $15.

To find out how much money Vincent saves, we subtract the cost of the better deal from the cost of the other deal. That's $15 minus $9, which is $6.

After that, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 for a greeting card. So, we add those up too: 9 + 28 = 37 stickers.

Now, we subtract the stickers he gave away and used from the total: 54 - 37 = 17 stickers.

Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"To find Alex's weight, we need to follow the information given. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we multiply Grace's weight by 4. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds, so 4 times that is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. Now, we subtract 2 pounds from that to find Alex's weight: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, we add their weights together to find their combined weight: 
Grace's weight is 125 pounds, and Alex's weight is 498 pounds. 
125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

623"
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes, the number of roses per bush, and the number of thorns per rose.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75 roses.

Then, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600.

So, there are 600 thorns in total.

600"
"To find out how many games the football team won, we need to use the information that they won 8 more games than they lost. Let's say they lost 'x' games. Then, they won 'x + 8' games.

We know they played a total of 22 games. So, the number of games they won plus the number of games they lost is 22. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine the 'x's and the 8:
2x + 8 = 22

Now, subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

This means they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.

"Gene has been going on vacations since he was 23 years old, and now he's 34. To find out how many years he's been going on vacations, we need to subtract 23 from 34. That's 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations a year, we multiply the number of years by 4. That's 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Each vacation has one shirt, and each shirt is one quilt block. So, the total number of quilt blocks is the same as the total number of vacations.

44"
"So, the alarm rings three times a day. The first time it rang, it went off 4 times. The second time, it rang 3 times as long as the first time. That means it rang 3 x 4 = 12 times. The third time, it rang half as long as the second time. So, it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to add the number of times it rang each time. That's 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

22"
"So, Sylvie gets a 10% raise after 5 years. To find out how much more money she gets each month, we need to calculate 10% of her initial monthly salary.

10% of $600 is 0.10 x $600 = $60. So, her new monthly salary is $600 + $60 = $660.

Since she gets paid 12 times a month in a year, we multiply $660 by 12 to get her new annual salary.

$660 x 12 = $7920

This is her annual salary after 5 years, and it will stay the same for the next three years.

$7920"
"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to use the information that Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. Let's say Harald sold 'x' copies. Then Marilyn sold 10x copies.

We know that together they sold 88,000 copies. So we can write an equation: x + 10x = 88,000.

Combine the x's: 11x = 88,000.

Now, divide both sides by 11: x = 8,000.

So Harald sold 8,000 copies.

8000"
"To figure out how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to know how many she'll need. She invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them won't show up. So, we need to find out how many will show up.

If 1/4 of the friends won't show up, that's the same as saying 3/4 will show up. To find 3/4 of 16, we can multiply 16 by 3 and then divide by 4.

16 * 3 = 48
48 / 4 = 12

So, 12 friends will show up. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, which is the same as 3/4 of a gift bag per guest. To find the total number of gift bags, we multiply 12 by 3/4.

12 * 3/4 = 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now we know Christina needs 9 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so we multiply 9 by 2 to find the total cost.

9 * 2 = 18

"To figure out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate how much the adults and kids will eat.

Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad. There are 20 adults, so we multiply 20 x 10 = 200 pounds for the adults.

Each kid eats half as much as an adult, which is 10 / 2 = 5 pounds. There are 5 kids, so we multiply 5 x 5 = 25 pounds for the kids.

Now, we add the amount for the adults and kids: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"To find the total number of pets, we need to figure out how many pets each person has.

Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, let's add up the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

"To find Jackson's age, we need to figure out the ages of the other kids first. We know James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Now, we know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. So, Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

We also know Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. To find Jackson's age, we need to subtract 5 from Amy's age. So, Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Jackson is 4 years old."
"To find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet, we need to first figure out how fast he used to run. We know Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and Gerald used to be 2 seconds slower than Lee. So, Gerald's original time would be 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. This means he's now 10% faster, or 90% as slow as he used to be. To find 90% of his original time, we multiply 40 by 0.9. 

40 * 0.9 = 36

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

36"
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to figure out how many dogs, cats, and rabbits there are.

We know there are 60 dogs. Since there are two cats for every dog, we multiply the number of dogs by 2 to get the number of cats. So, 60 * 2 = 120 cats.

Now, we add the number of dogs and cats together: 60 + 120 = 180.

The problem says the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we subtract 12 from 180 to get the number of rabbits: 180 - 12 = 168.

Finally, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats together to get the total number of pets: 168 + 60 + 120 = 348.

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know there are 200 students in total, and 2/5 of them are boys. To find the number of boys, we multiply 200 by 2/5, which is the same as multiplying 200 by 0.4. So, the number of boys is 200 * 0.4 = 80.

Since there are 200 students in total, and 80 of them are boys, the number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120.

Now, we know 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we multiply 120 by 2/3, which is the same as multiplying 120 by 0.67 (approximately). So, the number of girls in the girl scout is 120 * 0.67 = 80.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to 80.

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls. So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 120 - 80 = 40.

"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to first figure out how many hours James slept. Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can calculate this by multiplying 2/3 by the number of hours Harry slept.

Harry slept 9 hours, so James slept (2/3) * 9 hours. To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator (2) by the whole number (9), then divide by the denominator (3). 

(2 * 9) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we need to find the difference between the hours Harry slept and the hours James slept. 
9 hours (Harry) - 6 hours (James) = 3 hours.

"To figure out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to work backwards. We know she made 32 ounces of sauce, but the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. So, the sauce must have come from 64 ounces of canned tomatoes, because 64 divided by 2 is 32.

Now, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes are in 64 ounces. Each can is 16 ounces, so we divide 64 by 16. This gives us 4 cans.

Since each can has 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3. So, 4 cans times 3 tomatoes per can is 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. We know that 30 cars were originally on the motorway. Some of them took an exit, so they didn't have to drive through the traffic jam. There were 5 cars that took the exit.

We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in total, we subtract the cars that took the exit from the total number of cars. 

Total number of cars = 30
Cars that took the exit = 5
Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = Total number of cars - Cars that took the exit
= 30 - 5
= 25

Now, we know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we subtract the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total cars that drove through the traffic jam.

Cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes = Total cars that drove through the traffic jam - Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes
= 25 - 20

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to figure out how many she has now and subtract the number she's giving away.

Mary already has 2 plants on each of 40 window ledges. So, she has 2 x 40 = 80 plants. Then, she got 18 more plants, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 plants.

She's giving away 1 plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she's giving away 40 plants.

To find out how many plants she'll have left, we subtract the number she's giving away from the total number of plants: 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to figure out how many times each friend pressed the doorbell.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. That's easy.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find 1/4 of 20, we can multiply 20 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 20 by 4. 20 ÷ 4 = 5. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. We know that for sure.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175

"To figure out how many pages Solo needs to read per day, we need to first find out how many pages he has left to read. He has to read 4 pages from Science, 20 pages from Social Studies, 7 pages from History, and 8 pages from Geography. 

So, let's add all those pages together: 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages. 

But Solo already read 15 pages on Monday, so we need to subtract those from the total: 39 - 15 = 24 pages left.

Now, Solo has 4 days to finish reading those 24 pages. To find out how many pages he needs to read per day, we divide the total pages left by the number of days: 24 ÷ 4 = 6 pages per day.

"So, John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and also before he goes to bed. That's 4 glasses of water each day. He does this every weekday, which is 5 days. So, on weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water.

On weekends, it's a little different. He still drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but he has soda with dinner. So, that's 3 glasses of water each day on weekends. There are 2 weekend days, so he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends. That's 20 + 6 = 26.

"To figure out how long it'll take for the fog to cover the whole city, we need to know how many groups of 3 miles are in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 by 3.

42 miles / 3 miles = 14

This means the fog will cover the city in 14 groups of 3 miles. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each group of 3 miles, we multiply 14 by 10.

14 * 10 minutes = 140 minutes

So, it'll take 140 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.

"To find out how many jigsaw pieces are left, we need to figure out how many pieces Poppy and her mom placed.

First, Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces. A quarter is the same as 1/4, so we multiply 1000 by 1/4. That's 1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces.

Now, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Next, her mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces. A third is the same as 1/3, so we multiply 750 by 1/3. That's 750 * 1/3 = 250 pieces.

So, Poppy and her mom placed a total of 250 + 250 = 500 pieces.

To find out how many pieces are left, we subtract 500 from 1000. That's 1000 - 500 = 500.

"To find the inner volume of each box, we need to figure out the space inside the box after considering the thickness of the walls. 

The box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. So, we subtract 1 inch from each side for the length and width, and also from the top and bottom for the height.

Length (L) = 5 - 1 - 1 = 3 inches
Width (W) = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4 inches
Height (H) = 4 - 1 - 1 = 2 inches

Now, we multiply these dimensions to get the inner volume of one box: L * W * H = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3: 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to figure out how many hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

So, the total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Now, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1.5 hours is 1.5 x 60 = 90 minutes.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes per episode to find out how many episodes he watched. 90 / 30 = 3.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. Let's say he made x cookies last year. Then, he wants to make 2x cookies this year.

But, he actually made 15 more cookies than he meant to. So, the total number of cookies he made is 2x + 15.

Then, he dropped 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left. This can be simplified to 2x + 10 cookies.

We know that he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up an equation:

2x + 10 = 110

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. First, we can subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Then, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry made 50 cookies last year.

"To figure out how much the gas will cost after the cashback rewards, we need to do a few simple math steps.

First, we need to find out how much the gas costs before the cashback. The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons. So, we multiply the price per gallon by the number of gallons:

$3.00 per gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00

Next, we need to find out how much cashback the person will get. The app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons. So, we multiply the cashback per gallon by the number of gallons:

$0.20 per gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost of the gas to find out how much the gas will cost after the cashback rewards:

$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

Now, we add the roll-ups they both ate: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the total roll-ups by 2, because there are 2 people. So, 90 / 2 = 45.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to figure out how far Julia rowed to reach the shore. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, we can find out how many feet she rows per second by dividing 20 feet by 16 seconds.

20 feet ÷ 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second

Now, we know the shore was 64 seconds away. We can multiply the time by the speed to find the total distance.

1.25 feet/second × 64 seconds = 80 feet

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10 to find out how many 10-foot intervals she rowed.

80 feet ÷ 10 feet = 8 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by 2 to find the total amount of water.

8 intervals × 2 liters/interval = 16 liters

There are 4 teachers, and each teacher teaches 2 lessons per day. So, the total number of lessons per day is 4 x 2 = 8 lessons.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times in each lesson. To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned, we multiply the number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson: 8 lessons x 3 cleanings/lesson = 24.

The whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. We also know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. 

Let's use a variable to represent the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold. We'll call it B. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's, we can set up the equation:
1800 = 6 * B

To find B, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 6:
B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now we know that Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs. The problem also tells us that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 

Let's use a variable to represent the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. We'll call it x. Since Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds, we can set up the equation:
300 = 50 * x

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 50:
x = 300 / 50
x = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph.

"To find out how much profit Sasha makes, we need to figure out how much she paid for the lumber and how much she sells it for.

She has 10 boards that are 2 x 4 x 10, and she paid $10 for each one. So, 10 x $10 is $100. She also has 5 boards that are 4 x 4 x 10, and she paid $16 for each one. So, 5 x $16 is $80. The total amount she paid is $100 + $80, which is $180.

Since the prices went up by 50%, she can sell the lumber for 50% more than what she paid. To find the selling price, we multiply the cost by 1.5. For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $10 x 1.5, which is $15 per board. For 10 boards, that's 10 x $15, which is $150. For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $16 x 1.5, which is $24 per board. For 5 boards, that's 5 x $24, which is $120. The total amount she gets from selling the lumber is $150 + $120, which is $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price. So, $270 - $180 is $90.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. We can divide 120 by 20 to find out how many groups of 20 parts she used. 120 ÷ 20 = 6.

Since the sugar is 7 parts, we multiply 7 by 6 to find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used. 7 × 6 = 42.

The number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42."
"To find out how much John paid, we need to figure out how many shoes he bought and then multiply that by the cost of each shoe.

John has 3 kids, and he buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of them. Since each pair has 2 shoes, that's 2 x 2 = 4 shoes per kid. For 3 kids, that's 4 x 3 = 12 shoes.

Each shoe costs $60, so we multiply 12 shoes by $60:
12 x $60 = $720

"To find the number of containers that were imported on the second day, we need to figure out how many vehicles were already at the port from the first day. There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles.

The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day. To find out how many vehicles came in on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day: 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles from the second day by 5: 20 ÷ 5 = 4.

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary. To do this, we need to find 40% of $40,000. We can do this by multiplying $40,000 by 0.4. 
$40,000 * 0.4 = $16,000
So, his salary increased by $16,000. Now, we add this to his old salary to get his new salary.
$40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago. We can set up an equation to do this. Let's say Lylah's salary is x. Then, Adrien's salary is x + 30% of x. We know Adrien's salary is $40,000, so we can set up the equation:
x + 0.3x = 40,000
Combine like terms:
1.3x = 40,000
Now, divide both sides by 1.3:
x = 40,000 / 1.3
x = 30,769

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. We can calculate her new salary by multiplying her old salary by 0.4 and adding that to her old salary.
$30,769 * 0.4 = 12,308
$30,769 + 12,308 = 43,077

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:
$56,000 + 43,077 = 99,077

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Each pad has 30 sheets of paper. So, we multiply 2 pads by 30 sheets to get the total sheets he uses in a week: 2 * 30 = 60 sheets.

There are about 4 weeks in a month. To find out how many sheets he uses in a month, we multiply the sheets he uses in a week by 4: 60 * 4 = 240.

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to figure out how many fruits Morisette and Kael each brought.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. To find the total number of fruits she brought, we add 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, let's calculate the number of fruits Kael brought. Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 apples. Kael brought half as many oranges as Morisette, so that's 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. To find the total number of fruits Kael brought, we add 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, we add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought: 13 + 14 = 27.

"So, Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. Then, for the next two days, she slept 2 hours less because she had to do some assignments. That means she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

Since she slept 6 hours on each of those days, that's 6 + 6 = 12 hours total for Tuesday and Wednesday.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday. So, she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day from Thursday to Sunday. There are 4 days from Thursday to Sunday, so that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add up all the hours she slept: 8 hours on Monday, 12 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday, and 28 hours from Thursday to Sunday. That's 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down. 

First, Rosie runs 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time. 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

After 3 hours, Rosie has 4 hours left. In these 4 hours, she runs 5 miles per hour. We multiply the speed by the time again.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, we add the two distances together to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours.
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

"Jennie has 60 letters that need stamps, and she stamps one-third of them. To find out how many she stamps, we need to divide 60 by 3. 
60 / 3 = 20

So, Jennie stamps 20 letters. Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many were in the pile when Jennie began, we subtract the number of letters she stamped from the total number of already-stamped letters.
30 - 20 = 10

"To solve this problem, let's think about what we know. Julia had a total of 12 spoons when she went to set the table. Her husband gave her 5 spoons. So, if we subtract the 5 spoons from the total, we get the number of spoons Julia had before her husband gave her the 5 new spoons.

12 - 5 = 7

Now, we know that Julia used 3 spoons to taste her stew. To find out how many spoons Julia bought, we need to add the 3 spoons she used to the 7 spoons she had.

7 + 3 = 10

So, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages to find the total number of sausages.

Total number of sausages = 38 + 44 = 82

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to figure out the cost of each item and then multiply it by how many he's buying.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. A watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper, so it's 3 x $15 = $45. An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so it's $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- 4 watermelons: 4 x $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 x $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 x $40 = $400

To find the total, we add these amounts together: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To find the profit the hospital makes, we need to figure out how much they pay the doctors and how much they charge the patients.

First, let's calculate how many hours the doctors work. There are 500 patients and each patient takes 24 minutes. We need to convert the minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 24 minutes by 60 to get 0.4 hours per patient.

Now, we multiply 500 patients by 0.4 hours to get the total hours the doctors work: 500 * 0.4 = 200 hours.

The hospital pays the doctors $150 per hour, so the total cost is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, so the total revenue is 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

The profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost. So, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

"To find out how many tickets Pam and Fred used, we need to figure out how many rides they took in total. 

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times. So, she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. 
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times. So, he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Together, they rode 4 + 6 = 10 rides. 

Each ride costs 6 tickets. To find the total number of tickets, we multiply the number of rides by the cost per ride. 
10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to figure out how many miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday first.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. So, we multiply 4 miles by 6 to get 24 miles for Tuesday.

Now, let's add the miles for Monday and Tuesday: 4 miles + 24 miles = 28 miles.

We know Walt walked a total of 41 miles from Monday to Wednesday. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles for Monday and Tuesday from the total miles: 41 miles - 28 miles = 13 miles.

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does. So, we multiply Brian's original number of video games (25) by 3, then subtract 5.

3 * 25 = 75
75 - 5 = 70

Bobby has 70 video games.

First, we know there are 27 unicorns in total. One third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. To find one third of 27, we divide 27 by 3. 

27 ÷ 3 = 9

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Now, we know that two thirds of these Scottish unicorns are female. To find two thirds of 9, we multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3.

9 × 2 = 18
18 ÷ 3 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies. 

The subs cost $7.50 each, and she ordered 2, so that's 2 x $7.50 = $15.00. 
The chips cost $1.50 each, and she ordered 2, so that's 2 x $1.50 = $3.00. 
The cookies cost $1.00 each, and she ordered 2, so that's 2 x $1.00 = $2.00. 

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

There's also a 20% delivery fee. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20, which is $4.00. 
So, the total cost with the delivery fee is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Finally, Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip. So, the final cost is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

Mark's second test had 100 questions, and he had 6 hours to finish it. He still answers 5 questions per hour. So, in 6 hours, he answered 6 x 5 = 30 questions.

In total, Mark answered 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

Both tests had 75 + 100 = 175 questions.

So, Mark left 175 - 70 = 105 questions incomplete.

First, we need to find four times the number of blue gumballs. Since there are 12 blue gumballs, we multiply 12 by 4. 
4 * 12 = 48

Now, we add 22 to this result to find the number of pink gumballs.
48 + 22 = 70

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

Let's subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars to find the number of semi-automatic cars. 
20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4

So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars. Now, we need to find what percentage 4 is of 20. To do this, we divide 4 by 20 and multiply by 100.

(4 / 20) * 100 = 20%

"To find the number of worker bees, we need to figure out the number of queens and baby bees first. Let's say the number of queens is Q. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is 2Q. 

Now, since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2 times 2Q, which is 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write an equation: Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. 

Combine the Q's: 7Q = 700. 

Now, divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

So, there are 100 queens. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, there are 2 x 100 = 200 baby bees.

Finally, since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, there are 2 x 200 = 400 worker bees.

"To find the total cost, we need to add up the prices of all the items John bought. 

First, let's add up the prices of the food items: 
Milk costs $2 and eggs cost $3. So, the total cost of food items is $2 + $3 = $5.

Next, let's add up the prices of the non-food items: 
Light bulbs cost $3, cups cost $3, and roach traps cost $4. So, the total cost of non-food items is $3 + $3 + $4 = $10.

Now, we need to add a 10% tax to the non-food items. To do this, we multiply the total cost of non-food items by 0.10 (which is the same as 10%). 
$10 * 0.10 = $1

So, the total cost of non-food items with tax is $10 + $1 = $11.

Finally, we add the total cost of food items and non-food items to get the total cost of everything: 
$5 + $11 = $16

"To find out how much profit Kim will make, we need to know how much he spends on supplies and how much money he gets from his clients. 

Kim has 3 clients now, and he thinks he'll get 5 more, so that's 8 clients. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The bleach costs $2 per bottle, so 2 bottles cost 2 x $2 = $4. The cloths cost $5 per pack. So, for each client, Kim spends $4 for bleach and $5 for cloths, which is $4 + $5 = $9.

For 8 clients, Kim will spend 8 x $9 = $72 on supplies. He thinks he'll make $92 from his clients. To find the profit, we subtract the money he spends from the money he makes: $92 - $72 = $20.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to do a few calculations.

First, we need to find out how many pineapples John has in total. He has 10 hectares of pineapple field, and each hectare has 100 pineapples. So, we multiply 10 hectares by 100 pineapples per hectare:
10 * 100 = 1000 pineapples

This is how many pineapples John can harvest every 3 months. But we want to know how many he can harvest in a year. There are 12 months in a year, and John can harvest every 3 months. So, we divide 12 months by 3 months:
12 / 3 = 4

This means John can harvest 4 times in a year. Now, we multiply the number of pineapples he can harvest each time (1000) by the number of times he can harvest in a year (4):
1000 * 4 = 4000

"To figure out how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, let's break it down step by step.

First, 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, half of those bees came back. Half of 30 is 15, so 15 bees returned.

Next, in the following 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours left the hive. That's 2 x 30 = 60 bees.

Now, let's count how many bees left the hive and didn't come back yet. We had 30 bees leave in the first 6 hours, and 15 came back, so that's 30 - 15 = 15 bees still out. Then, 60 more bees left, so we have 15 + 60 = 75 bees that left and didn't come back yet.

Finally, in the last 6 hours, all the bees that left and didn't come back yet returned to the hive. That's 75 bees.

"To figure out how long the winner will be waiting, we need to calculate how long it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile. So, Steve lives 3 miles away, which is 3 x 5280 = 15840 feet. Tim lives 2 miles away, which is 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home. Steve bikes at 440 feet per minute, so it will take him 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes to get home. Tim skateboards at 264 feet per minute, so it will take him 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes to get home.

Since Steve gets home in 36 minutes and Tim gets home in 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time. So, 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.

"To find out how much money Shawnda made, we need to figure out how many tires she inflated and multiply that by the cost per tire.

First, let's calculate the number of tires inflated. 5 people came with bicycles, and each bicycle has 2 tires, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 tires. Then, 3 people came with tricycles, and each tricycle has 3 tires, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 tires. And 1 person came with a unicycle, which has 1 tire. 

So, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. To find the total amount made, we multiply the number of tires by the cost per tire: 20 x 25 cents = 500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 500 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Dave ate 14 fries. Then, a seagull ate half of that, which is 7 fries. So, the seagull ate 7 fries.

Next, three pigeons came and each ate 3 fries. That's a total of 3 x 3 = 9 fries.

Now, let's say there were x fries in the pack when Dave bought it. After Dave and the seagull ate their share, there were x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 fries left.

Then, the pigeons ate 9 fries, so there were x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 fries left.

After that, a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. This means 1/3 of the fries were left. We know that the ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, 1/3 of the remaining fries is equal to 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

We can set up an equation to solve for x:
1/3 * (x - 30) = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3:
x - 30 = 18

Now, we can add 30 to both sides:
x = 48

So, there were 48 fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends in class, we need to figure out how many hours he spends in class each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a semester.

Kimo has class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. On those days, he has 3 classes that are 1 hour each. So, that's 3 hours per day. Since he has class on 3 of those days, that's 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes that are 2 hours each. So, that's 4 hours per day. Since he has class on 2 of those days, that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

So, in a week, Kimo spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours in class.

First, let's find the length of the rolls. Each roll is 4 inches long, and there are 300 rolls. So, the total length of the rolls is 300 * 4 = 1200 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert this to feet by dividing by 12: 1200 / 12 = 100 feet.

Next, let's find the length of the croissants. Each croissant is 6 inches long, and there are 120 croissants. So, the total length of the croissants is 120 * 6 = 720 inches. Converting this to feet, we get 720 / 12 = 60 feet.

Finally, let's find the length of the baguettes. Each baguette is 2 feet long, and there are 60 baguettes. So, the total length of the baguettes is 60 * 2 = 120 feet.

Blake ran back and forth 15 times. Since the field is 100 yards long, each round trip is 200 yards. So, we multiply 15 by 200 to get the total yards Blake ran: 15 x 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly ran back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then she ran to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each of these trips is 80 yards (40 yards each way). So, we multiply 34 by 80 to get the total yards for these trips: 34 x 80 = 2720 yards. We add this to the 200 yards she ran at the beginning: 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Now we compare the total yards each person ran. Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards. To find out how much farther Blake ran, we subtract Kelly's yards from Blake's yards: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The price of the bag of marbles increases by 20% every 2 months. To find 20% of the original price, we multiply $20 by 0.20, which is $4. So, the price increase every 2 months is $4.

After 2 months, the price will be $20 + $4 = $24.
After 4 months, the price will be $24 + 20% of $24 = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.
After 6 months, the price will be $28.80 + 20% of $28.80 = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.
We can keep doing this, but it's easier to notice a pattern. Every 2 months, the price increases by 20% of the previous price.

Since 36 months is 18 periods of 2 months, we can calculate the price after 36 months by multiplying the original price by 1.20 (which is 1 + 0.20) 18 times.

$20 * (1.20)^18 ≈ $532.39

"To find the total cost of all the toys, we need to figure out how much each type of toy costs and then add them up.

First, let's look at the red cars. We know that one red car costs $4, so 5 red cars will cost 5 x $4 = $20.

Next, we have the action figures. One action figure costs $5, so 3 action figures will cost 3 x $5 = $15.

Now, let's talk about the doll. It costs as much as 3 action figures, which is $15.

Finally, we add up the cost of all the toys: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

"So, Jackie has two options: do her taxes herself or hire an accountant. If she does them herself, she'll lose 3 hours of work that she could've gotten paid for. She gets $35 per hour, so that's 3 x $35 = $105 she won't get.

If she hires the accountant, she'll have to pay $90.

To figure out how much more money she'll have if she hires the accountant, we need to subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the money she would've lost if she did the taxes herself. That's $105 - $90 = $15.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to add up the cost of the computer and all the accessories she bought. 

The computer costs €1090. The scanner costs €157, the CD burner costs €74, and the printer costs €102. Let's add all these up:
€1090 + €157 = €1247
€1247 + €74 = €1321
€1321 + €102 = €1423

So the total cost is €1423. Now, let's subtract this from Elvira's budget of €1500:
€1500 - €1423 = €77

"To figure out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to know how many eggs she needs for the Spanish flans and how many eggs she gets each time she babysits.

She needs 3 eggs for each Spanish flan, and she has to make 15 flans. So, we multiply 3 eggs/flan by 15 flans to get the total number of eggs she needs: 3 * 15 = 45 eggs.

Since she gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs she needs (45) by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job (9): 45 ÷ 9 = 5.

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"Let's break down the problem. We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If Brooke's age is x, then Seth's age is 2x.

In 2 years, Brooke will be x + 2 years old, and Seth will be 2x + 2 years old. The problem says that in 2 years, their ages will add up to 28. So, we can write an equation: x + 2 + 2x + 2 = 28.

Combine the x's and the numbers: 3x + 4 = 28.

Now, subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 8.

So Brooke is 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to figure out twice the amount of money Ethel has. Since Ethel has $8, we multiply that by 2.

On weekends, he walks 10 miles a day. There are 2 weekend days, so he walks 2 x 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

To find the total miles he walks in a week, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

First, the hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so we multiply $25 by 3 to get $75.

Next, we need to find the cost of the pants. The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket, which is $25 + $75 = $100. Then, we divide by 2 to get $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Next, let's find the number of legs of the insects. There are 90 insects and each insect has 6 legs. So, the total number of legs of the insects is 90 * 6 = 540.

Lastly, let's find the number of legs of the mutant invertebrates. There are 3 mutant invertebrates and each has 10 legs. So, the total number of legs of the mutant invertebrates is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together:

"To figure out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to add up the minimum payments for her student loans, credit card, and mortgage. 

The minimum payments are:
- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month
So, the total minimum payment is $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month.

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% of $1000, we multiply $1000 by 0.5. 
$1000 * 0.5 = $500

Now, we add the extra $500 to the minimum payment:
$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply $1500 by 12 to find the yearly payment:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To find out how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to figure out how long it takes him to peel and cut one potato, then multiply that by the number of potatoes he has.

It takes Billy 1 minute and 30 seconds to peel a potato. To make the math easier, let's convert the 30 seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 30 seconds is half a minute. So, peeling a potato takes 1.5 minutes.

It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut a potato. We need to convert this to minutes too. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 5 seconds is 5/60 = 0.0833 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to peel and cut a potato: 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes = 1.5833 minutes.

Billy has 60 potatoes, so we multiply the time it takes to prep one potato by 60: 1.5833 minutes * 60 = 95 minutes.

The final answer is: 95"
"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to figure out how many gallons of lemonade they made and then multiply that by the cost of lemons per gallon.

First, let's find out how much money they make from each gallon of lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon, and each glass costs $0.50. So, they make 20 * $0.50 = $10 per gallon.

It costs them $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar to make one gallon, so the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. 

Now, let's find out how much profit they make per gallon. Profit is the money they make minus the money they spend. So, profit per gallon is $10 - $5 = $5.

They made a total profit of $25. To find out how many gallons they made, we divide the total profit by the profit per gallon: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Now, we know they made 5 gallons of lemonade. Since it costs $3 for lemons per gallon, the total cost of lemons is 5 * $3 = $15.

"To find out how much money Zaid will have left, we need to figure out how much he spends and donates.

First, let's calculate how much he spends on rent and car fuel. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500. He also spends 1/3 on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000.

So, he spends 1500 + 2000 = 3500 in total on rent and car fuel.

Now, let's subtract this from his total salary: 6000 - 3500 = 2500.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250.

After donating, he has 2500 - 1250 = 1250 left.

He also gives his daughter 200 and his wife 700, which is 200 + 700 = 900.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so we add 10 to Monic's crabs. That's 36 + 10 = 46 crabs for Rani.

Now, we add up all the crabs: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

"To figure out how many red roses Sandra ordered, we need to start with the information about the pink calla lilies. We know there are 200 pink calla lilies, and that's five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's use a variable, x, to represent the number of white carnations. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation: 5x = 200. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5. This gives us x = 200 / 5, which equals 40. So, there are 40 white carnations.

Now, we know Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. To find the number of red roses, we multiply the number of white carnations by 4. 

Number of red roses = 4 * 40

The less well-rounded team has the first runner running at 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run at 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run at 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run at 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time taken by this team is:

"So, Jerry is rolling a six-sided die, and we want to know how much more likely it is that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

First, let's think about rolling a number greater than 3. There are 6 numbers on the die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Out of these, 4, 5, and 6 are greater than 3. So, there are 3 good numbers out of 6. This means the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, which is the same as 1/2 or 0.5.

Now, let's think about rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on the die: 2, 4, and 6. So, the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6, which is also 1/2 or 0.5. But Jerry is rolling the die twice, so we need to multiply the probabilities together: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. To make it a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to figure out how many pieces of straw are given to the rats. We know that 160 pieces of straw are given out in total, and 20 of those go to the rabbits. So, the rats and hamsters get 160 - 20 = 140 pieces of straw.

The hamsters get 5 pieces of straw each, and there are 10 hamsters. So, the hamsters get 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw. This means the rats get 140 - 50 = 90 pieces of straw.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we can divide 90 by 6 to find out how many rats there are. 90 / 6 = 15. There are 3 cages of rats, so we divide 15 by 3 to find out how many rats are in each cage. 15 / 3 = 5.

First, let's see how many trees Tom plants and chops down in a year. He plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so that's a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Tom does this for 10 years, so he plants 10 * 10 = 100 trees and chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees. That's a net gain of 100 - 20 = 80 trees.

Tom started with 50 trees, so after 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens. Each bag had 9 pens, so she got 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens. Each bag had 6 pens, so she got 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

So, she bought 54 + 12 = 66 pens.

Now, we add the pens she already had to the pens she bought: 32 + 66 = 98.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we need to figure out the total score she needs to get an average of 93. Since Mr. Bert allows her to remove the lowest score, we'll only consider the 5 highest scores.

There are 6 tests, but she can remove the lowest score, so we'll think of it as 5 tests. To get an average of 93, she needs a total score of 93 * 5 = 465.

Now, let's look at her scores so far: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We'll ignore the lowest score, which is 71. So, we add up the other scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

To get a total score of 465, we subtract 367 from 465: 465 - 367 = 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 4 weeks and the last 3 weeks.

In the first 4 weeks, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week. Since there are 4 weeks, he rode 5 * 4 = 20 times. Each time he rode 25 kilometers, so he rode a total of 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers in the first 4 weeks.

In the last 3 weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week. Since there are 3 weeks, he rode 2 * 3 = 6 times. Each time he rode 60 kilometers, so he rode a total of 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers in the last 3 weeks.

Now, we add the kilometers from the first 4 weeks and the last 3 weeks: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to figure out how much the chocolate bars and the candied apples weigh.

First, let's look at the chocolate bars. We know there are 25 chocolate bars and each one weighs 40g. So, we multiply the number of chocolate bars by the weight of each one: 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Now, let's look at the candied apples. We know there are 80 of them, but we don't know how much each one weighs. The problem says that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, if a chocolate bar weighs 40g, a candied apple weighs half of that, which is 40g / 2 = 20g.

Now that we know the weight of each candied apple, we can multiply the number of candied apples by the weight of each one: 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Finally, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to get the total weight of Joe's bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"So, let's break down the problem. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes. That's easy.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. To find that out, we multiply 4 by 3, which is 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, we multiply 12 by 5, which is 60 cakes.

Now, we just need to add up all the cakes she bought: 4 + 12 + 60. That's 76 cakes.

"To find the cost of each cup, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since half a dozen is 6, and each plate costs $6000, we multiply 6 by $6000. That's 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, we subtract $1200 from $36000. That's $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Next, we need to find out how many cups are in 20 dozen. Since 1 dozen is 12, we multiply 20 by 12. That's 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

Finally, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups ($34800) by the number of cups (240). That's $34800 / 240 = $145.

"To figure out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

The total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, Sara still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4). 

$40 / $4 = 10

So, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jerry has red chickens and white chickens. The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.

We also know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r'. Then, the number of white chickens is 'r + 2'.

Now, let's think about the total number of eggs. The red chickens lay 3 eggs each, so 'r' red chickens will lay 3r eggs. The white chickens lay 5 eggs each, so 'r + 2' white chickens will lay 5(r + 2) eggs.

We know that the total number of eggs is 42, so we can set up an equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Now, let's simplify the equation. We can start by multiplying 5 by (r + 2):

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Next, we can combine the 'r' terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Now, let's subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Finally, let's divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to figure out how far he walks and then divide that by how fast he walks.

The park is a rectangle, so we need to find the distance around it. To do that, we add the length and width, and then multiply by 2. The length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

First, add the length and width: 6 + 1.5 = 7.5
Then, multiply by 2: 7.5 * 2 = 15 miles

So, Gary walks 15 miles. Now, we need to divide that by his speed, which is 3 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to figure out how many customers were there on the first two days. 

On the first day, there were 100 customers. On the second day, there were 50 more customers than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

Now, let's add the customers from the first two days: 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We know that by the third day, the total number of customers was 500. To find out how many customers were there on the third day, we subtract the total from the first two days from the total: 500 - 250 = 250.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that both pools are leaking at the same rate, 4 gallons per minute. We also know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Let's call the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago ""x"". Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water.

Since then, both pools have lost 16 gallons of water (4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes). So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16.

The problem says that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can write this as an equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

To solve for x, we need to simplify the equation. Let's start by multiplying the 4 to the terms inside the parentheses:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Now, let's add 16 to both sides of the equation:

2x = 4x - 48

Next, let's subtract 2x from both sides:

0 = 2x - 48

Now, let's add 48 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Finally, let's divide both sides by 2:

24 = x

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

24 - 16 = 8

"To figure out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to add the cost of the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. 

So, the total cost is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Now, we need to divide the total cost by how much she makes per hour, which is $8.00. 

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours.

"To find out how much Janeth still owes, we need to figure out how much she has to pay back in total. She borrowed $2000 and promised to pay 10% more. 10% of $2000 is $200, so she has to pay back $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth is paying $165 each month for 12 months. To find out how much she's paying in total, we multiply $165 by 12. That's $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount she's paying ($1980) from the total amount she owes ($2200). That's $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to know how many dahlias and roses there are. We already know there are 4 roses. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can find the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses.

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to know their current ages and then add 3 years to each.

We know Harriet is 21 years old now. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. So, Zack is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

Now, we add 3 years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
- Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.
- Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi, which is 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by the other three from the total: 251 - 197 = 54.

120 - 90 = 30

So, there were 30 liters of water left in the tank.

Then, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. This means she collected 2 times 30 liters of water.

2 x 30 = 60

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to know how many cards James has in total and how many of those are water type cards.

James started with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. That's a total of 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards.

But then he lost 8 water type cards, so he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards left.

He also bought 14 more grass type cards, so now he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

So, the new total number of cards is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards. That's 32 / 96, which is about 0.3333.

Next, we need to find the tax. The tax is 10% of the cost of the cars. To find 10% of $240,000, we multiply $240,000 by 0.1. So, the tax is $240,000 x 0.1 = $24,000.

Then, we need to find the registration fees. The registration fee for each car is $1000. Since Mark buys 12 cars, the total registration fee is 12 x $1000 = $12,000.

"To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to consider the initial pens and the pens he makes from the empty ones.

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens.

When the ink runs low in these 25 pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

Now, he has 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens.

We can see a pattern here. Every time the ink runs low, he can make 1/5 of the total pens into new pens. 

Let's calculate the total number of pens he can have:

25 + 25/5 + 30/5 + 36/5 + ... 

This is an infinite geometric series with a first term of 25 and a common ratio of 1/5. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula:

S = a / (1 - r)

where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 25 / (1 - 1/5)
S = 25 / (4/5)
S = 25 * 5/4
S = 31.25 * 5
S = 156.25 * 5 / 5
S = 156.25

However, the number of pens must be a whole number. We can calculate the number of pens by adding the initial pens and the pens he makes from the empty ones, until the number of new pens is less than 1.

25 + 25/5 + 30/5 + 36/5 + ... = 156.25

Since the number of pens must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number.

The total number of pens Ram gets to have is approximately 156.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the exact number of pens.

Let's calculate the number of pens again:

25 + 25/5 + 30/5 + 36/5 + ... = 25 + 5 + 6 + 7.2 + 8.64 + 10.368 + ... 

We can see that the number of new pens is increasing by a factor of 1.2 each time (6/5 = 1.2, 7.2/6 = 1.2, etc.).

Let's calculate the number of pens again:

25 + 5 + 6 + 7.2 + 8.64 + 10.368 + ... 

We can see that the number of new pens is increasing by a factor of 1.2 each time.

25 * (1 + 1/5 + (1/5)^2 + (1/5)^3 + ...)

This is an infinite geometric series with a first term of 1 and a common ratio of 1/5.

The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula:

S = a / (1 - r)

where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 1 / (1 - 1/5)
S = 1 / (4/5)
S = 1 * 5/4
S = 5/4

Now, multiply this by 25:

25 * 5/4 = 125/4
= 31.25

However, the number of pens must be a whole number. We can calculate the number of pens by adding the initial pens and the pens he makes from the empty ones, until the number of new pens is less than 1.

25 + 25/5 + 30/5 + 36/5 + ... = 31.25 * 5

Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so we subtract 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23. That's Mary's age.

Now, we add up all their ages: 
20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68

"To find out how many students went out through exit C, we need to figure out how many went out through exits A and B first.

First, 30% of the students went out through exit A. To find 30% of 1000, we multiply 1000 by 0.3. 
1000 * 0.3 = 300

So, 300 students went out through exit A. That means 1000 - 300 = 700 students were left.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find 3/5 of 700, we multiply 700 by 3 and then divide by 5.
(700 * 3) / 5 = 420

So, 420 students went out through exit B. That means 700 - 420 = 280 students were left.

The students who were left went out through exit C. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many candies James and Robert have. We know John has 54 candies and that he has twice as many as Robert. So, if we divide John's candies by 2, we get Robert's candies. 

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we add 6 to Robert's candies to get James' candies.

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Finally, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We do this by subtracting James' candies from John's candies.

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

To find the total number of books they read, we add the books Dolly read and the books Pandora read. That's 3 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to figure out how many pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

Mike is pen pals with 3 people (he stopped being pen pals with 2 out of 5). Each of these 3 people sends him 2 letters a week, and he writes back to each of them. So, he writes 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week. Since each letter is 5 pages long, he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.

Now, we know Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing a week, we multiply the number of pages he writes by the time it takes to write a page: 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

He also made some other calls that added up to 300 minutes. So, we need to add those minutes to the minutes he used talking to his boss.

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we need to subtract the total minutes he used from his monthly limit to find out how many minutes he has left.

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Griffin started with 24 french fries. Then, Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.

Next, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle. Since Kyle took 5, Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.

After that, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took. Kyle took 5, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to subtract the number of fries Griffin had left from the total number of fries Griffin ended up with. So, Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we need to find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. 

The first aquarium has 4 snails, and the second aquarium has 32 snails. So, the difference is 32 - 4 = 28.

The problem says that the difference in the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can think of it as 2 times the number of fish in one aquarium, times 2 (because there are 2 aquariums). 

Let's use a variable, ""x"", to represent the number of fish in each aquarium. Then, the equation would be: 2 * 2 * x = 28.

Combine like terms: 4x = 28.

Now, divide both sides by 4: x = 28 / 4 = 7.

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To figure out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate how many hours the makeup artist worked and multiply that by the hourly rate. Then we need to subtract the discount.

The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week. So that's 6 * 4 = 24 hours a week. The movie takes 5 weeks, so the makeup artist works 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour, so 120 hours * $250 is $30,000. But Jean gets a 10% discount because the makeup artist did a lot of work. To find 10% of $30,000, we multiply $30,000 by 0.1, which is $3,000.

So Jean gets a $3,000 discount. To find out how much she paid, we subtract the discount from the total: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

$12 + $43 = $55
$55 + $15 = $70
$70 + $4 = $74
$74 + $22 = $96

So the total cost of the party supplies is $96. Since Isabelle and her parents split the cost evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

4 x 50 = 200 pounds

Now, we know that 1 pound of onions costs $1.50. To find the total cost, we multiply the total weight (200 pounds) by the cost per pound ($1.50).
200 x $1.50 = $300

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to figure out how many cookies each of them ate.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's sister: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we multiply the total number of cookies by 200 to find the total calories consumed:
Sue's sister: 18 x 200 = 3600 calories
Sue: 46 x 200 = 9200 calories

Now, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since there are 30 girls in the school, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Now, we know the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls. So, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

Now, let's think about today. We know Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. We also know he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

If he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and he killed 12 cougars, then he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves today.

So, today Rick killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars, for a total of 36 + 12 = 48 animals.

There are 20 cows in each of the original 10 stalls, so that's 10 x 20 = 200 cows.

Then, Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and puts an equal number into each of the 20 stalls. To find out how many cows he puts in each stall, we divide 40 by 20, which is 2.

Now, each stall has 20 cows (from the original 10 stalls) + 2 cows (the new ones) = 22 cows.

We want to know how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. So, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 x 8 = 176.

"To find out how much money Brady has, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and the dollar bills, then add them together.

First, let's start with the pennies. Brady has 100 pennies, and each penny is worth 1 cent. So, 100 pennies is equal to 100 cents, which is $1.

Next, let's look at the nickels. Brady has 40 nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents. So, 40 nickels is equal to 40 * 5 = 200 cents, which is $2.

Then, there are the dimes. Brady has 20 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 20 dimes is equal to 20 * 10 = 200 cents, which is $2.

Finally, let's add the value of the dollar bills. Brady has 40 dollar bills, and each bill is worth $1. So, 40 dollar bills is equal to 40 * $1 = $40.

Now, let's add all the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. To find out how many bananas Andrea has, we divide Jamal's bananas by 2: 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's add up all the fruits:
Andrea has 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.
Jamal has 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits.
To find the total number of fruits, we add Andrea's and Jamal's fruits: 76 + 92 = 168.

"To figure out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to know how many dozens of cookies she's making. Since a dozen is 12 cookies, we can add the cookies she's making today and tomorrow, then divide by 12.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so she's making a total of 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

Now, we divide 66 by 12 to get the total number of dozens. 
66 ÷ 12 = 5.5 dozen cookies

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. So, to find out how many cups Carla needs, we multiply 5.5 by 2.
5.5 * 2 = 11 cups

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to do a few steps. 

First, we need to find two thirds of 9,300. To do this, we multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3. 

(9,300 * 2) / 3 = 18,600 / 3 = 6,200

So, two thirds of the pennies is 6,200. Now, we need to convert this to dollars. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 pennies, we can do this by dividing 6,200 by 100.

6,200 / 100 = 62

The final answer is: $62"
"Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. To find out how many marbles she has in total from the boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box. 

5 boxes * 50 marbles per box = 250 marbles

Then, she gets 20 more marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she has now, we add the marbles she got from her friend to the marbles she already had.

250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many trees Ferdinand and Harry have. 

First, we know Chris has 6 trees. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, we can find Ferdinand's trees by dividing Chris's trees by 2. 
Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. We know Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. To find this, we multiply Ferdinand's trees by 2 and add 5.
Harry has (3 * 2) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand. To do this, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has.

"To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the extra fees first. 

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. 5% of $350,000 is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price. 12% of $350,000 is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

Now, we add the selling price and the fees: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to figure out how much money he got and subtract the money he had to pay.

Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. He had to pay some fees for the transfer, which is 3% of the selling price. To find 3% of $400,000, we multiply $400,000 by 0.03. That's $12,000.

He also had to pay a brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price. To find 5% of $400,000, we multiply $400,000 by 0.05. That's $20,000.

Mr. Tan also had to pay $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house.

Now, let's add up the money he had to pay: $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we subtract the money he paid from the money he got: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

"To figure this out, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. To find 40% of 20 minutes, we multiply 20 by 0.4, which is 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

The total time to warm the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes. Now, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. So, it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook.

To find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we add the time it took to warm the oil and the time it took to cook. That's 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.

The number of blue golf balls is 4."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to figure out how many M&Ms are in each bag. 

The first bag has 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so we add 12 to 300. That's 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms in the second bag.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. To find half of 300, we divide 300 by 2. That's 300 ÷ 2 = 150 M&Ms in the third bag.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

But that's not all - there are 4 more windows in each house that aren't in the bedrooms. So, we add those to the 6 windows in the bedrooms to get 6 + 4 = 10 windows in each house.

Since there are 2 houses, we multiply 10 windows by 2 to get the total number of windows. 10 x 2 = 20.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

The whole sweater is 1800 stitches, so the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to figure out how many cards are left after we subtract the cards with A, B, and C.

First, let's find the number of cards with A. Since 2/5 of the cards have A, we multiply 80 by 2/5. To do this, we multiply 80 by 2 and then divide by 5. This gives us 160/5, which is 32.

Now, we subtract 32 from the total number of cards, which is 80. This gives us 80 - 32 = 48.

Next, we find the number of cards with B. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards have B, we multiply 48 by 1/2. This gives us 48/2, which is 24.

Now, we subtract 24 from the remaining cards, which is 48. This gives us 48 - 24 = 24.

Then, we find the number of cards with C. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards have C, we multiply 24 by 5/8. To do this, we multiply 24 by 5 and then divide by 8. This gives us 120/8, which is 15.

Now, we subtract 15 from the remaining cards, which is 24. This gives us 24 - 15 = 9.

So, the number of cards with the letter D is 9.

First, let's find the time for the small holes. Matthew digs 30 small holes, and each one takes 3 minutes. So, we multiply 30 by 3 to get 90 minutes.

Next, let's find the time for the large holes. Matthew digs 15 large holes, and each one takes 10 minutes. So, we multiply 15 by 10 to get 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for the small holes and the large holes together: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

Since we want to know the time in hours, we need to convert the minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 240 by 60 to get 4 hours.

Now, let's think about what happens in 9 years. Ruby's age will be 6S + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9.

The problem says that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can set up an equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

To solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations. First, let's multiply 3 by (S + 9). This gives us 3S + 27.

Now our equation looks like this: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Next, let's get all the S terms on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3S from both sides. This gives us 3S + 9 = 27.

Now, let's get rid of the 9 on the left side by subtracting 9 from both sides. This gives us 3S = 18.

Finally, let's solve for S by dividing both sides by 3. This gives us S = 6.

Now, we can find the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, so the total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800. There are 60 mambas, so the total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we add the total spots on cobras and mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Now, we add the team members, coaches, and guests: 15 + 24 = 39 people.

Since each pizza can serve 3 people, we need to divide 39 by 3 to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs. 39 / 3 = 13.

He does this for 50 weeks a year, so that's 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year.

Now, we need to find out how much he pays for those miles. He pays $2 per mile, so that's 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000 per year.

But that's not all - he also gives his driver a $150 bonus each month. There are 12 months in a year, so that's $150 * 12 = $1,800 per year.

So, to find the total cost, we add the cost of the miles and the bonus: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

"To figure out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to first find out how many minutes he exercised on Sunday and Monday combined. 

On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. To find the total, we add those two numbers together: 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice that amount on Tuesday, we need to multiply 39 by 2. 

39 * 2 = 78 minutes

"To figure out how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to think about how the pages are arranged. When you fold the paper, the front and back of each page are paired together.

Imagine you have 32 pages, and you pair them up like this:

Page 1 and Page 32
Page 2 and Page 31
Page 3 and Page 30
...and so on.

Since each pair of pages is printed on one piece of paper, we can count the number of pairs. There are 16 pairs of pages.

But here's the thing: each pair of pages is printed on the same piece of paper, just on different sides. So, we don't need to count each pair as two separate pieces of paper.

The final answer is: 8"
"So Annika went to the town fair with $50. She spent half of that on food and snacks. Half of $50 is $25. Then she spent $10 more on rides. So in total, she spent $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's see how much money she has left. We subtract the money she spent from the money she had: $50 - $35 = $15.

"To find out how much money Elise made in the second year, we need to figure out how many books she sold that year. 

We know she started with 250 books and has 50 left, so she sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in total.

We also know she sold 45 books this year and twice as many in the first year, which is 2 * 45 = 90 books.

So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Each book sells for 20$, so she made 65 * 20 = 1300$ in the second year.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to figure out how much he makes in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. That's 10 x 5 = 50 hours a week. He gets $10 per hour, so he makes 50 x $10 = $500 a week.

He also gets a $300 bonus each week if the company does well. So, in a week, Watson makes $500 + $300 = $800.

Since there are about 4 weeks in a month, Watson makes $800 x 4 = $3200 in a month.

$3200"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to figure out what 20% of 20 is. Since he beat 80%, that means he lost 20% of the matches.

20% is the same as 0.20. So, we multiply 0.20 by 20.

0.20 * 20 = 4

So, John lost to 4 people.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to figure out a few things. 

First, the bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day. Then, two-thirds of those loaves are sold in the morning. To find two-thirds of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and then divide by 3. That's (60 * 2) / 3 = 120 / 3 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total to find out how many are left: 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Next, half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"So, Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To figure out how much he loses in a week, we need to divide 8 by 4. That's 2 pounds a week.

Now, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, that means Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

We want to know how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. If she loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, to lose 8 pounds, it will take her 8 / 2 = 4, and then multiply that by 4, which is 4 * 4 = 16 weeks.

Next, let's look at the milk. Each packet is discounted by $0.5. If you buy 4 packets, you'll save 4 x $0.5 = $2.

Now, let's add the savings from the ice cream and the milk: $4 + $2 = $6.

"To figure out how many new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow, we need to think about how often new arms and legs grow.

New arms grow every 3 days. So, in 15 days, we need to divide 15 by 3 to find out how many new arms will grow. 15 ÷ 3 = 5. That means 5 new arms will grow.

New legs grow every 5 days. So, in 15 days, we need to divide 15 by 5 to find out how many new legs will grow. 15 ÷ 5 = 3. That means 3 new legs will grow.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the new arms and new legs together. 5 (new arms) + 3 (new legs) = 8.

"To figure out how much money Theo has left to spend on gifts, we need to calculate how much he spent and how much he wants to save.

First, let's add up how much he spent on business suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600. Then, he bought 3 suitcases for $50 each, so that's 3 * $50 = $150. 

Next, we need to find out how much the flight ticket cost. It cost $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. A business suit cost $100, so 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up all the money he spent: $600 for suits + $150 for suitcases + $1200 for the flight ticket = $1950.

Theo started with $6000 and wants to save $2000. So, if we subtract the money he spent and the money he wants to save from the money he started with, we get: $6000 - $1950 - $2000 = $2050.

"To find out how many eggs the family will eat in a week, we need to figure out how many eggs they eat in a day and then multiply that by 7.

Three people in the family eat 3 eggs each day, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 eggs. The other two people eat 2 eggs each day, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 eggs. 

So, in total, the family eats 9 + 4 = 13 eggs each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 13 by 7 to get the total number of eggs eaten in a week. 

13 x 7 = 91

"To find the population of Chile now, we need to follow these steps:

First, we know Cera is 46 years old now. Six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

Next, we know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

Then, we know that six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Lastly, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. So, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

Population of Chile now: 120,000"
"Let's break down the problem. We know there are 105 members on the football team. The offense has twice as many players as the defense, and the special teams have half as many players as the defense.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is D. Then, the offense has 2D players, and the special teams have D/2 players.

We can add these up to get the total number of players: D + 2D + D/2 = 105.

To make it easier, let's multiply everything by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2D + 4D + D = 210.

Now, let's combine the D's: 7D = 210.

To find D, we need to divide both sides by 7: D = 210 / 7 = 30.

"To figure out how many people are coming to Martha's party, we need to first find out how many people she invited. There are 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people. There are also 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 people. 

So, Martha invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Now, we need to subtract the people who can't come. 8 people are sick, and 1/4 of 8 people have other plans. To find 1/4 of 8, we can divide 8 by 4, which is 2. 

So, 8 people are sick and 2 people have other plans. That's 8 + 2 = 10 people who can't come.

To find out how many people are coming, we subtract the people who can't come from the total number of people invited. That's 24 - 10 = 14.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has, we need to know how many marbles he has in total. 

Solomon started with 50 marbles. Then he bought 20 more from Johanna, so now he has 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.

His dad gave him some more marbles, but not as many as he bought from Johanna. His dad gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles from Johanna, we need to find 2/5 of 20. To do this, we multiply 20 by 2 and then divide by 5. So, 20 * 2 = 40, and 40 / 5 = 8. His dad gave him 8 marbles.

Now, Solomon has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so to find the total weight, we multiply the number of marbles by the weight of each marble. 78 * 2 = 156.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has is 156 kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to figure out how many cubic feet of water it can hold. We do this by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the pool.

The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. So, we multiply these numbers together:
6 * 4 * 5 = 120

This means the pool can hold 120 cubic feet of water. Now, we need to multiply this by the cost per cubic foot, which is $0.1.
120 * 0.1 = 12

So, it costs $12 to fill the pool.

"To find out how many women are left, we need to figure out how many people left the party. There were 25 men and 15 women, so 25 + 15 = 40 people in total.

Since 1/4 of the people left, we need to find 1/4 of 40. To do this, we can divide 40 by 4, which is 10. So, 10 people left the party.

We know that 22 men stayed, so to find out how many men left, we subtract 22 from the total number of men: 25 - 22 = 3 men left.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. To find out how many women left, we subtract 3 from 10: 10 - 3 = 7 women left.

Since there were 15 women initially, and 7 left, we subtract 7 from 15 to find out how many women stayed: 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to figure out how many junior and senior programmers there are and how much they get paid.

First, let's find out how many junior programmers there are. We know that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. Since there are 100 employees, we can multiply 100 by 2/5 to get 40 junior programmers.

Now, we know there are 100 employees in total and 40 are junior programmers. So, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Junior programmers get paid $2000 per month. Senior programmers get paid $400 more than junior programmers, which is $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

Now, let's calculate how much the company pays to junior programmers per month. We multiply the number of junior programmers (40) by their salary ($2000), which is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Next, we calculate how much the company pays to senior programmers per month. We multiply the number of senior programmers (60) by their salary ($2400), which is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

Finally, we add the amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers to get the total amount paid to all programmers per month. $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

We know that at the second stop, 7 people got off and 8 people got on. So, the net change at the second stop is 8 - 7 = 1. This means that 1 more person got on the bus than got off.

Before the second stop, there were some people on the bus who got on at the terminal, and 5 more people got on at the first stop. Let's call the number of people who got on at the terminal ""x"". Then, the total number of people on the bus before the second stop is x + 5.

After the second stop, the total number of people on the bus is x + 5 + 1, because 1 more person got on than got off. We know that this total is 20, so we can set up an equation:

x + 5 + 1 = 20

x + 6 = 20

Subtract 6 from both sides:

x = 14

So, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, let's break it down step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. On his way to school, he eats 2, so we subtract 2 from 24. That's 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Then, he gives 14 lollipops to his friends. So, we subtract 14 from 22. That's 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

After that, Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. He gave 14, so twice that is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, we add 28 to the 8 lollipops he already had. That's 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

Later that night, Oscar eats 3 more lollipops. So, we subtract 3 from 36. That's 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, in the morning, Oscar eats 2 more lollipops. We subtract 2 from 33. That's 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Job B pays $42,000 per year, but Nick has to pay $6,000 in property tax. So, he'll have $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000 left. Then, he has to pay 10% of that in taxes. 10% of $36,000 is $3,600. So, Nick will have $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400 left.

Now, let's see which job is better. Job B pays $32,400, and Job A pays $24,000. So, Job B is better.

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price increase and decrease.

Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the initial total value is 8 x $8 = $64.

In the first year, the price increases by 50%. To find 50% of $8, we multiply $8 by 0.5, which is $4. So the new price per share is $8 + $4 = $12. Now we have 8 shares worth $12 each, so the total value is 8 x $12 = $96.

In the second year, the price decreases by 25%. To find 25% of $12, we multiply $12 by 0.25, which is $3. So the new price per share is $12 - $3 = $9. Now we have 8 shares worth $9 each, so the total value is 8 x $9 = $72.

The final value of all Maria's shares is $72."

Combine the x's:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

"To find the total weight of the container with all the animals, we need to know how much each animal weighs. We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, they also weigh 50 pounds each.

The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so we add 10 pounds to 50 pounds. That's 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so we subtract 20 pounds from 50 pounds. That's 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals and the container:
Pink frog: 50 pounds
Blue beetle: 50 pounds
Green toad: 50 pounds
Yellow snake: 60 pounds
Red bird: 30 pounds
Container: 20 pounds

We add all these numbers together: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds.

"Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits. Then, she got twice that many at her baby shower. Twice 24 is 48. So, she got 48 outfits at the baby shower. After that, her mom gave her 15 more outfits. To find the total number of outfits, we need to add them all together: 24 + 48 + 15.

Let's do the math: 24 + 48 is 72, and 72 + 15 is 87.

"So, Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more. To find 1/5 of 5000, we multiply 5000 by 1/5, which is the same as dividing by 5. 5000 / 5 = 1000. So, 1/5 of 5000 is 1000. 

Now, we add 1000 to 5000 to get the new distance. 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day.

Since June has 30 days, we multiply 6000 by 30 to get the total distance. 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to know the prices of both. 

Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it's 4 + 5 = 9 dollars. Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it's 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, let's see how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B. Juice Box C is 11 dollars and Juice Box B is 9 dollars. To find the difference, we subtract 9 from 11, which is 11 - 9 = 2.

"To figure out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to know how many cookies her son and husband eat first. 

Her son gets 4 cookies in his lunch 5 days a week, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day, and there are 7 days in a week, so that's 1 * 7 = 7 cookies. 

Now, we add the cookies her son and husband eat: 20 + 7 = 27 cookies. 

There are 36 cookies in the bag, and her son and husband eat 27, so we subtract 27 from 36: 36 - 27 = 9.

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts, we need to first find the total cost of the shirts. Each shirt costs $30, so 2 shirts will be 2 x $30 = $60.

Since Davos got a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $60. To do this, we multiply $60 by 0.40. 
$60 x 0.40 = $24

This is the amount of discount Davos got. To find out how much he paid, we subtract the discount from the total cost.
$60 - $24 = $36

"To find out how much more money the factory is making now, we need to calculate how much they used to make and how much they make now.

When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day for $100 each. So, they made 10 x $100 = $1000 a day.

Now, they sell 5 silos a day for $220 each. So, they make 5 x $220 = $1100 a day.

They're making $1100 - $1000 = $100 more per day now.

To find the percentage, we need to divide the extra money by the original amount and multiply by 100. 

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to figure out how much she spends per month and then multiply that by 12.

First, let's calculate the monthly cost of food. Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100.

Next, we add the monthly cost of treats, which is $20, and the monthly cost of medicine, which is $100. So, the total monthly cost is $100 + $20 + $100 = $220.

Now, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 to get the total yearly cost. $220 * 12 = $2640.

On Monday, Peyton has a 1-hour yoga class. On Tuesday, she has a cooking class that's 3 times as long as the yoga class, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours. On Wednesday, she has a cheese-tasting event that's half an hour long, or 0.5 hours. On Thursday, she has a museum tour that's half as long as the cooking class, so that's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours. On Friday, she has 2 hours of errands.

"So, April needs to give the school some plant pots. They want 30 for the daisies, and they want twice as many for the roses. Twice as many as 30 is 60, so they need 60 for the roses. To find the total, we add 30 + 60, which is 90.

April already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left, we subtract the number she needs from the number she bought. So, 100 - 90 is 10.

Andrea saved $21."
"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to figure out how much time he spent in total. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. Half of 6 is 3, so he spent 3 hours swimming. That's 6 + 3 = 9 hours for boating and swimming.

He also watched 3 shows that were 2 hours each. So, that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours of watching shows.

Now, let's add the time he spent boating, swimming, and watching shows. That's 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

It says that the time he spent boating, swimming, and watching shows is 30% of the total time. To find the total time, we can use a simple equation. If 15 hours is 30% of the total time, then we can divide 15 by 0.3 to get the total time. 

15 / 0.3 = 50

So, John spent 50 hours in total.

Now, we know that he spent 40% of his time sightseeing. To find out how much time that is, we can multiply 50 by 0.4.

50 * 0.4 = 20

"To figure out how much Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate how much money she has now. 

First, let's look at her jobs. At her first job, she earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours. So, she earns 10 * 20 = $200. 

At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours. So, she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

Now, let's add the money she earned to the money she already had. She had $80 and earned $200 + $75 = $275. So, now she has 80 + 275 = $355.

The phone costs $400. To find out how much more she needs, we subtract the money she has from the price of the phone. So, 400 - 355 = $45.

- Go-karts cost $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so that's $10 * 2 = $20
Adding all that up, it's $5 + $5 + $20 = $30 per person.

Now, we need to divide the total budget ($90) by the cost per person ($30). 
$90 / $30 = 3

But wait, Morgan is also going to be there, so we need to subtract 1 from the total number of people.

"Marisa gets $5 every day from her parents. She spends some of this money on lollipops. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 of them. To find out how much she spends, we need to multiply the cost of one lollipop by 4.

4 lollipops * 25 cents = 100 cents
Since 100 cents is equal to $1, she spends $1 on lollipops every day.

Now, let's subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves:
$5 - $1 = $4

So, Marisa saves $4 every day. To find out how much she saves in 5 days, we multiply her daily savings by 5:
$4 * 5 = $20

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to figure out how much money he spent on gumballs and then work our way back.

Billy bought 40 gumballs at 5 cents each. To find the total cost of the gumballs, we multiply the number of gumballs by the cost per gumball: 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, that means he had $2 * 2 = $4 in change.

We know Billy started with $10, so to find out how much he spent on candy, we subtract the change from the original amount: $10 - $4 = $6.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds Billy bought, we divide the amount he spent on candy by the cost per pound: $6 / $1.5 = 4.

"To find the son's age, we need to use the information given in the problem. Carver is 45 years old, and his age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. Let's call the son's age 'x'. 

We can write this as an equation: 45 = 2x - 5. To solve for 'x', we need to get 'x' by itself. First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation. This gives us 50 = 2x.

Next, we divide both sides by 2. This gives us 25 = x. So, the son is 25 years old.

"To figure out how many days the train goes between services, we need to know how many miles it travels in a day and how many miles it can travel before needing service.

The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and then it travels 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two trips to get back to the first city. The combined distance of the first two trips is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, let's add up the miles for the whole trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles. But the train does this trip 3 times a day, so it travels 300 * 3 = 900 miles in a day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide 18,000 miles by 900 miles per day.

18,000 / 900 = 20

The train goes 20 days between services."

Now, let's calculate how much stuffing Mark needs for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. For the chihuahua beds, he needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds. For the collie beds, he needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

To find the total amount of stuffing needed, we add the amount needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 + 15 = 23.

"To find the total time of the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, let's find the time it took John to drive to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles. So the total distance is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. He drove at a speed of 70 miles per hour. To find the time, we divide the distance by the speed: 210 miles / 70 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Next, let's find the time it took John to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles, and he drove at a speed of 80 miles per hour. To find the time, we divide the distance by the speed: 240 miles / 80 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Finally, we add the time it took to drive to his friend's house and the time it took to drive back home: 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know 3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks. Then, we're told a number equal to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. So, we multiply 3 by 4, which is 12, and then subtract 5. That gives us 12 - 5 = 7 people kicked out for shoplifting.

Next, we're told three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. Since 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting, we multiply 7 by 3, which is 21. So, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, let's add up the people kicked out for these reasons: 3 (masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31.

First, let's find the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the frames is 44 x $20 = $880.

Next, we need to add the cost of etching the logo on each frame. The etching costs 20% more than the frame. To find 20% of $880, we multiply $880 by 0.2, which is $176. So, the total cost of the frames and etching is $880 + $176 = $1056.

Now, let's add the cost of the pins. Two seniors will get pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 x $5 = $10.

Finally, we need to add the cost of the cords. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, and they will get cords. One-fourth of 44 is 11. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is 11 x $12 = $132.

The interest rate is 10% per year, but she's borrowing the money for 5 months, which is less than a year. So, we need to calculate the interest for 5 months. 

There are 12 months in a year, so 5 months is 5/12 of a year. To calculate the interest, we multiply the amount she borrowed ($3,650) by the interest rate (10% or 0.10) and then by the time (5/12).

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * (5/12) = $152.08

Now, we add the interest to the amount she borrowed to get the total amount she has to pay.
Total amount = $3,650 + $152.08 = $3,802.08

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to figure out what 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares. If 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares, then we can multiply 12.8 by 5/2 to find the total amount of land he had.

12.8 * 5/2 = 12.8 * 2.5 = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how many people sang in the performance, we need to figure out how many girls were in the choir and how many of them made it to the show.

The choir has 52 members, and half of them are girls. So, the number of girls is 52 / 2 = 26.

But, half of the girls couldn't make it to the show because their bus broke down. That means only half of the 26 girls made it. So, 26 / 2 = 13 girls made it to the show.

The 3 teachers also sang with them, so we need to add 3 to the number of girls who made it. That's 13 + 3 = 16.

"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to add up all his test scores and then divide by the number of tests. 

Let's add up the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Now, we divide the sum by 5 (the number of tests):
400 / 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of 6 erasers. Since one eraser costs $2, we multiply 6 by $2. This gives us 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, we find the cost of 8 pencils. Since one pencil costs $3, we multiply 8 by $3. This gives us 8 * $3 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of erasers and pencils together: $12 + $24 = $36.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to figure out how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add that to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu. To do this, we multiply the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 * 66
To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (1) and then divide by the denominator (3).

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 1 * 66 / 3
= 66 / 3
= 22

Now, we add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages.

Total number of messages = 66 + 22
= 88

"To figure out how much money David saves, we need to compare the cost of his ride bracelet to the cost of Dasha's ride tickets.

Dasha needs to ride all 9 rides, and each ride costs 2 tickets. So, she needs 9 x 2 = 18 tickets. Each ticket costs $2, so she'll spend 18 x $2 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which lets him ride all 9 rides.

Now, let's see how much David saves. We subtract the cost of his ride bracelet from the cost of Dasha's tickets: $36 - $30 = $6.

"To figure out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to add up the total number of gifts she has to wrap. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. 

So, the total number of gifts is 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon (144 inches) by the total number of gifts (12). This will give us the amount of ribbon she can use for each gift bow.

Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total gifts = 144 / 12 = 12

"So we know the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. To find out how many popsicles they each have, we need to figure out what one part of the ratio is equal to.

We know they have a total of 165 popsicles together. Since the ratio is 5:6, we add 5 + 6 to get 11 parts in total. Now, we divide 165 by 11 to find out what one part is equal to: 165 ÷ 11 = 15.

Since Betty has 5 parts, we multiply 5 by 15 to find out how many popsicles she has: 5 x 15 = 75.

Since Sam has 6 parts, we multiply 6 by 15 to find out how many popsicles he has: 6 x 15 = 90.

Now, to find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

"So, Tim is switching from cable to streaming services. He's getting Netflix for $10 a month. He's also getting Hulu and Disney Plus, but he gets a discount for getting them together. They usually cost $10 each, but with the discount, he saves 20%.

First, let's figure out how much he saves on Hulu and Disney Plus. If they cost $10 each, that's $20 together. 20% of $20 is 0.20 x $20, which is $4. So, he saves $4. That means he pays $20 - $4 = $16 for Hulu and Disney Plus.

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix. $16 + $10 = $26. That's how much he pays for all his streaming services.

He used to pay $60 for cable. Now he pays $26 for streaming. To find out how much he saves, we subtract $26 from $60. $60 - $26 = $34.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to first find the total time she spent on the song.

She spent 4 hours writing the song. 
She spent half that time recording it, which is 4 / 2 = 2 hours.
She spent 90 minutes editing it. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 90 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. So, 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up the time she spent on the song: 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time she spent editing, we need to divide the time she spent editing (1.5 hours) by the total time (7.5 hours), and then multiply by 100.

(1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to figure out how many cards she had at first and then subtract the ones she gave away, and add the ones she got.

Erica made 20 cards herself. Her dad brought her 2 boxes with 15 cards in each box. So, she got 2 x 15 = 30 cards from her dad. Now, add the cards she made to the cards her dad brought: 20 + 30 = 50.

Then, Erica gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. So, she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards in total.

Now, subtract the cards she gave away from the total cards she had: 50 - 29 = 21.

Finally, Erica got 17 cards from her family and friends. So, add those to the cards she has left: 21 + 17 = 38.

First, we know she saw 90 spiders. Then, we need to find out how many millipedes she saw. It says she saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. So, we multiply 90 by 1/3, which is the same as dividing by 3. 90 / 3 = 30, so she saw 30 millipedes.

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs she saw. It says she saw twice as many stink bugs as millipedes, minus 12. So, we multiply 30 by 2, which is 60. Then, we subtract 12, which gives us 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs to multiply the ingredients by 4. The recipe calls for 3 cups of flour, so for a quadruple batch, he needs 3 * 4 = 12 cups of flour. Since flour comes in 2-cup bags, he'll need 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

The recipe also calls for 1 cup of milk, so for a quadruple batch, he needs 1 * 4 = 4 cups of milk. Since milk comes in 2-cup bottles, he'll need 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

Now, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

"To find out how much energy Mel will save, we need to figure out how much energy he uses in a day and then how much he'll use after reducing the time.

Mel's air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since he uses it for 8 hours a day, we multiply 900 watts by 8 hours to get the total energy used in a day. That's 900 * 8 = 7200 watt-hours. To make it easier, we can convert this to kilowatt-hours by dividing by 1000 (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts). So, 7200 watt-hours is 7.2 kilowatt-hours.

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours, he'll be using it for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. We multiply 900 watts by 3 hours to get the new energy usage: 900 * 3 = 2700 watt-hours, or 2.7 kilowatt-hours.

To find out how much energy Mel will save, we subtract the new energy usage from the original energy usage: 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours.

Since we want to know how much energy Mel will save in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30: 4.5 kilowatt-hours * 30 = 135 kilowatt-hours.

So, Tyson needs to make 5 sandwiches. Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Since he's making 5 sandwiches, he'll need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 x $7.00 = $35.00. The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese. $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to calculate how much they paid each month.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week and got paid $15 per hour. So, each employee made $15 * 40 = $600 per week. Since there are about 4 weeks in a month, each employee made $600 * 4 = $2400 in May. Since there are 40 employees, the company paid 40 * $2400 = $96000 in May.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts ended. This means 1/4 of 40 employees left, which is 10 employees. So, there were 40 - 10 = 30 employees left in June. Each employee still made $600 per week, and $2400 per month. Since there are 30 employees, the company paid 30 * $2400 = $72000 in June.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $1200. To do that, we multiply $1200 by 0.20. That's $1200 x 0.20 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

First, we know Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees. She gathered half that amount from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.

Now, let's think about her sister. Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne did, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples. She also gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne did, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

We know the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Let's add up the apples we know about so far:

Joanne's apples: 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) = 45 apples
Her sister's apples: 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105 apples

Now, let's add those together: 45 + 105 = 150 apples

But we know they gathered 500 apples in total. So, the number of apples they haven't accounted for yet is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.

Since Joanne's sister didn't gather any apples from the average trees, all of those 350 apples must have been gathered by Joanne from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we need to use two equations. Let's say the number of camels is 'c' and the number of dromedaries is 'd'. 

Since each camel and dromedary has one head, the total number of heads is the sum of the number of camels and dromedaries. We know there are 180 heads, so we can write the equation:
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump. Since there are 304 humps in total, we can write the equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, let's solve these two equations. We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to get:
c = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries. We can substitute c = 124 into the first equation:
124 + d = 180
d = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the answer, we need to figure out the original prices of both jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than that. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

We know Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of that from the jogger jeans, which is $2. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's find the original prices. The jogger jeans originally cost $22 + $2 = $24. The tattered jeans originally cost $28 + $4 = $32.

The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. But the jogger jeans actually cost less. So, we need to find the difference and make it negative. The difference is $32 - $24 = $8. Since the jogger jeans cost less, the answer is -$8.

"To figure out how many employees can go on the day trip, we need to calculate how many people each type of vehicle can hold and then add them all together.

The buses can hold 4 x 60 = 240 people. 
The minibuses can hold 6 x 30 = 180 people. 
The minivans can hold 10 x 15 = 150 people.

Now, let's add all those people together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570.

"So Lillian has 3 bird feeders that she made herself and 3 that she bought. Each bird feeder gets 20 birds, but the ones she made get 10 more birds than the ones she bought. 

First, let's figure out how many birds the homemade feeders get. Since they get 10 more than the store-bought ones, that's 20 + 10 = 30 birds per feeder. And since she has 3 of them, that's 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

The store-bought feeders get 20 birds each, and she has 3 of those, so that's 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

To find the total number of birds, we add the birds from the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders: 90 + 60 = 150.

"To find out how much Aleksandra paid for dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item. 

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25. That's $1. So the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel. Half of $4 is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of all items: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

"To figure out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to find out how much money he made from selling his cards. He spent $100 on the ticket and had $50 left, so he must have made $150.

Since he sold each card for $1.5, we can divide the total amount of money he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5) to find the number of cards he sold:

$150 ÷ $1.5 = 100 cards

But this is the number of cards he sold, not the number he started with. We know that he kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with ""x"". Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3x.

We know that 2/3x = 100, so we can solve for x. To do this, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To figure this out, we need to know how many hotdogs the caterer made and how many hotdogs the guests wanted.

The caterer was told to make hotdogs for 36 guests. He made enough for half of them to have two hotdogs. Half of 36 is 18, so he made 18 x 2 = 36 hotdogs for those 18 guests. For the other 18 guests, he made 18 x 1 = 18 hotdogs. So, in total, he made 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

But then, 40 guests showed up, and they all wanted two hotdogs. That's 40 x 2 = 80 hotdogs. The caterer didn't have that many, so some guests didn't get a second hotdog.

To find out how many guests didn't get a second hotdog, we need to subtract the number of hotdogs the caterer made from the number of hotdogs the guests wanted. That's 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. Since each guest who didn't get a second hotdog is missing one hotdog, 26 guests didn't get a second hotdog.

"To find the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we need to do a few simple steps. 

First, we know Indras has 6 letters in her name. Now, we need to find the number of letters in her sister's name. It's given that her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of 6 is 6 / 2 = 3. Now, we add 4 to this number to find the number of letters in her sister's name. So, 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) and her sister's name (7) to find the total. 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to add up the prices of all the items she bought. 

She bought a set of pot and pans for $120.00, a set of mixing bowls for $20.00, and 5 separate utensils for $5.00 each. So, the utensils cost 5 x $5.00 = $25.00. 

Now, let's add up the prices: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

But, the store is having a 20% off sale. To find the discount, we need to multiply $165.00 by 0.20 (which is the same as 20%). The discount is $165.00 x 0.20 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

First, let's add up the cost of the items: 
The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, the total cost is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and her mom gave her $16, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Dora has from the total cost of the items: 
$19 (total cost) - $18 (Dora's money) = $1.

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to figure out how many each prince slew.

First, Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Then, Prince Arthur slew three-quarters of that, which is like 3/4 of 100. To find that, we multiply 100 by 3 and then divide by 4. So, 100 * 3 = 300, and 300 / 4 = 75. Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons.

Next, Prince Walter slew twice as many as Prince Arthur. So, we multiply 75 by 2, which is 150. Prince Walter slew 150 dragons.

Finally, Prince Bruce slew one-fifth of what Prince Walter slew. To find that, we multiply 150 by 1 and then divide by 5. So, 150 / 5 = 30. Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that 15 gallons of gas were divided into 5 containers. To find out how many gallons are in each container, we divide 15 by 5. 

15 ÷ 5 = 3 gallons per container.

Now, Josey needs 1/4 of a container. To find 1/4 of 3 gallons, we multiply 3 by 1/4 or 0.25.

3 * 0.25 = 0.75 gallons.

Since we need the answer in pints, we need to know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, we multiply 0.75 gallons by 8 pints/gallon.

0.75 * 8 = 6 pints.

"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to figure out how much money he spent on chips and then subtract that from the total amount he spent.

George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x 40 = 120 cents on chips.

Since George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, that means he spent 99% of $5. To find 99% of $5, we multiply $5 by 0.99, which is $4.95. We convert this to cents: $4.95 x 100 = 495 cents.

Now, we subtract the amount spent on chips (120 cents) from the total amount spent (495 cents): 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we divide the remaining amount spent (375 cents) by the cost of a candy bar (75 cents): 375 / 75 = 5.

George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends got, we need to figure out how many lollipops he shared with them. Ray started with 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his 4 friends, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many lollipops each friend got.

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to figure out how much cake Rory and her mom ate. Since they each had a piece, that's 2 pieces in total. The cake was cut into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs the same amount. 

Let's divide the total weight of the cake (20 ounces) by the number of pieces (8) to find the weight of each piece:

20 ounces ÷ 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece

Now, we multiply the weight of each piece by the number of pieces eaten (2):

2.5 ounces per piece * 2 pieces = 5 ounces

So, Rory and her mom ate 5 ounces of cake. To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the eaten cake from the total weight:

20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to add the number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is 34 + 22 = 56.

Now, we need to find out how many people are sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so that's 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 friends = 8 people.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people. That's 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

"To find the cost per serving of Antoine's french onion soup, we need to figure out how much the ingredients cost and then divide that by the number of people the soup serves.

First, we need to find out how much the onions cost. Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that, so he needs 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions cost $2.00 per pound, so 4 pounds of onions will cost 4 x $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, we need to find out how much the beef stock costs. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so 2 boxes will cost 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost. $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Finally, we divide the total cost by the number of people the soup serves, which is 6. $12.00 ÷ 6 = $2.00.

"So, Bernadette wants to get to the movie premiere before Wayne. We know it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater from his hotel. But Bernadette's drive is way longer - it takes 4 times as long as Wayne's drive. 

To figure out how long Bernadette's drive is, we multiply Wayne's drive time by 4. That's 4 x 4 = 16 minutes. 

Now, we need to find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne. We do that by subtracting Wayne's drive time from Bernadette's drive time. That's 16 - 4 = 12 minutes.

But wait, Bernadette wants to get there 5 minutes before Wayne. So, we add those 5 minutes to the 12 minutes. That's 12 + 5 = 17 minutes.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we need to know the length and width. We know the length is 3 yards, but we need to convert it to feet. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, we multiply 3 yards by 3 feet per yard to get 9 feet.

We also know the area of the room is 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length and width. So, we can use the area to find the width. We divide the area (360) by the length (9) to get the width, which is 40 feet.

Now that we have the length (9 feet) and width (40 feet), we can find the perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the length and width, then multiplying by 2. So, we add 9 + 40 to get 49, then multiply by 2 to get 98.

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to figure out how many beads each sister bought. 

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. That's 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads. 
Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. That's 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads.

Each pack has 20 beads. So, we multiply the number of packs by 20 to find the total number of beads:
Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads.
Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other. To do that, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number:
140 (Margareth's beads) - 60 (Elizabeth's beads) = 80 beads.

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to do a few steps. 

First, we need to figure out how much the temperature went up when Marcus was baking. He baked for 3 hours, and the temperature went up 5 degrees each hour. So, we multiply 3 hours by 5 degrees per hour, which is 3 x 5 = 15 degrees. Now we add this to the starting temperature of 40 degrees. 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Next, we need to figure out how much the temperature went down when Marcus opened the window. The window was open for 30 minutes, and the temperature went down 2 degrees every 10 minutes. Since 30 minutes is 3 groups of 10 minutes, we multiply 2 degrees by 3. 2 x 3 = 6 degrees. Now we subtract this from the temperature after baking, which was 55 degrees. 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we need to know how long it took Jon to do the whole triathlon and how long James took for the swim and bike ride.

Jon's total time is 40 minutes for the swim, 80 minutes for the bike ride, and 50 minutes for the run. So, Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. 10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes. So, James finished the swim in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. Jon took 80 minutes, so James took 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' time for the run. James' total time is 180 minutes, and he took 36 + 85 = 121 minutes for the swim and bike ride. So, James' run time is 180 - 121 = 59 minutes.

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to start with Movie C. It's 1.25 hours long, but we need the time in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 1.25 by 60.

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to Movie C.

Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find one-fourth of something, we divide by 4.

Movie A = 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

"To figure out how much change Michael has after buying hay, we need to do a few things. First, we need to find out how far his horse ran. We know the horse ran for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert 30 minutes to hours.

30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Now we can find the distance the horse ran by multiplying the speed (32 miles per hour) by the time (0.5 hours).

Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, so for 16 miles, it will eat 16 * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails will cost 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has 6 five-dollar bills, which is 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the money Michael has.

$30 - $24 = $6

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's think about it step by step. 

If you buy the super ticket, it costs $20, and you get a popcorn and a soda for just $1 extra. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

Now, if you don't buy the super ticket, you can buy a regular ticket for $12 and get a popcorn and a soda separately. We know that the soda costs $3.

The problem says that if you don't buy the super ticket, you save $2. This means that the total cost of the regular ticket, popcorn, and soda is $21 - $2 = $19.

We already know that the regular ticket and soda cost $12 + $3 = $15. To find the cost of the popcorn, we need to subtract $15 from $19.

"To find out how much the potting soil will cost Bob, we need to figure out how many bags he needs to buy. 

First, we need to find the volume of one raised bed. To do that, we multiply the width, length, and height of the bed. The width is 2 feet, the length is 8 feet, and the height is 2 feet. So, the volume of one bed is 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we multiply the volume of one bed by 10. That's 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Now, we know that each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we divide the total volume of the beds (320 cubic feet) by the volume of one bag (2 cubic feet). That's 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

"To find the total number of cards, we need to figure out how many green cards and yellow cards there are.

First, let's find the number of green cards. We know there are 60% more green cards than red cards. To find 60% of 15, we multiply 15 by 0.6. 

15 * 0.6 = 9

So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards. Since there are 15 red cards, we add 9 to 15 to get the number of green cards.

15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know there are 24 green cards.

Next, let's find the number of yellow cards. We know that the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards. So, we add the number of red cards (15) and the number of green cards (24).

15 + 24 = 39

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed first.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, and each box weighs 1 pound. So, the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

He also buys 4 bags of carrots, and each bag weighs 12 pounds. So, the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

The farmer buys 42 bales of hay, and each bale weighs 75 pounds. So, the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

He buys 20 sacks of oats, and each sack weighs 65 pounds. So, the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs, we'll divide the total weight of the feed by the weight the truck can carry: 4500 / 2250 = 2.

"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate the tip first. The tip is 1/5 of the amount she ordered. To find 1/5 of $15, we can divide $15 by 5. $15 ÷ 5 = $3.

So the tip is $3. Now, we add the tip to the original amount: $15 + $3 = $18.

"To figure out Finley's final position, let's go through what happened in the race. 

Finley started in 1st place. Then, she fell back 5 spots, so she was in 6th place. After that, she moved ahead 2 spots, which put her in 4th place. Next, she fell behind 3 spots, so she was in 7th place. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot.

So, if she was in 7th place and jumped ahead 1 spot, that means she finished in 6th place.

"Miss Maria has a lot of sports cards. She has 6 decks of basketball cards, and each deck has 25 cards. So, she has 6 x 25 = 150 basketball cards. She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards, and each box has 40 cards. So, she has 5 x 40 = 200 baseball cards.

In total, Miss Maria has 150 + 200 = 350 cards. But she keeps 50 cards for herself, so she gives 350 - 50 = 300 cards to her students.

Each student gets 10 cards, so to find out how many students she has, we need to divide the number of cards she gave away (300) by the number of cards each student gets (10). That's 300 ÷ 10 = 30.

"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to figure out how much each of them paid for the apples.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply 20 by 0.45. That's 20 x 0.45 = $9. But Becky got a $1 discount, so she paid $9 - $1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. To find the total cost, we multiply 20 by 0.50. That's 20 x 0.50 = $10. Kelly got a 10% discount, which is 10% of $10. To find 10% of $10, we multiply $10 by 0.10. That's $10 x 0.10 = $1. So Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $9.

Now, let's find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. We subtract the amount Becky paid from the amount Kelly paid. That's $9 - $8 = $1.

"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to figure out how many of each thing is in a room, then multiply that by the number of rooms.

Each room has 2 sheets. It also has 1 comforter. For pillow cases, it's twice as many as sheets, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 pillow cases. For towels, it's twice as many as pillow cases, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 towels.

So, in each room, there are 2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels. That's 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry per room.

Now, we multiply that by the number of rooms, which is 80. So, 15 x 80 = 1200.

"Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. He gets more shoes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. We need to figure out how many shoes he gets on those days.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, that's 5 x 2 = 10 shoes. On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs, which is 15 x 2 = 30 shoes. On Friday, he gets 30 pairs, which is 30 x 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add all the shoes he got: 200 (the shoes he already had) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes.

But then, on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, we subtract 180 from 300: 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes on Sunday.

"To figure out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to find out how many cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. Since she has 6 jars of sprinkles and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes, we multiply 6 by 8.

6 x 8 = 48

This means she can decorate 48 cupcakes. Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide 48 by 12.

48 ÷ 12 = 4

So, Mary should bake 4 pans of cupcakes.

"To find the change Theo received, we need to figure out how much she spent on the pen and the paper. The pen cost $2. The paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Three times the price of the pen is 3 x $2 = $6. $1 less than that is $6 - $1 = $5.

So, the pen cost $2 and the paper cost $5. The total cost is $2 + $5 = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $10. $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find out how many pencils were left, we need to do a few calculations.

First, we need to find out how many pencils there were at the beginning of the year. Since there are 30 students and each student has 10 pencils, we multiply 30 by 10. This gives us 300 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many pencils were used after two months. We know that 1/5 of the total pencils were used, so we multiply 300 by 1/5. This gives us 60 pencils used.

Now, we need to find out how many pencils were left after two months. We subtract the pencils used from the total pencils: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

Finally, we need to find out how many pencils were left at the end of the year. We know that only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left, so we multiply 240 by 1/3. This gives us 80 pencils.

"To figure this out, let's use a variable to represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. Let's call it 'x'. Since Matt gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, we can write an equation.

The number of cookies Matt gets is half of 'x', which is x/2, plus 2. We know Matt wants 5 cookies, so we can set up the equation like this:

x/2 + 2 = 5

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x/2 = 3

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to get 'x' by itself:

x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras is, we need to convert the length of the shark to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the shark is 10 * 12 = 120 inches long.

The remoras are 6 inches each, and there are two of them, so their combined length is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we can calculate the percentage by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiplying by 100:

(12 / 120) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of students, we need to figure out how many students are in the whole group. We know that 3/4 of the students have a desktop computer, so 1/4 of the students don't have one. Since 20 students don't have a desktop computer, we can use that to find the total.

Let's think of the total number of students as a group of 4 parts. If 1 part is 20 students, then we can multiply 20 by 4 to find the whole group.

20 x 4 = 80

So, there are 80 students in that grade level.

3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days

Now, we know Jason needs to walk a total of 240 minutes to break in his shoes. To find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total minutes by the number of days.

240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day

$300 ÷ $15 = 20 books

Now that we know Sarah bought 20 books, we need to divide that number by the number of kids she has, which is 4. This will tell us how many books each kid got.

20 books ÷ 4 kids = 5 books per kid

"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to figure out how many kids are allergic to at least one thing. We know 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 are allergic to peanuts. But if we just add those numbers together, we'll be counting the kids who are allergic to both twice. So, we need to subtract the 3 kids who are allergic to both.

Let's do the math: 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15. Then, subtract the 3 kids who are allergic to both: 15 - 3 = 12. This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one thing.

Now, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic to at least one thing from the total number of kids in the class: 32 (total kids) - 12 (kids allergic to at least one thing) = 20.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and since there are two people, we need to multiply $5000 by 2. That's $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

The hotel costs $1500 per day, but it's 20% more expensive because it's a busy weekend. To find 20% of $1500, we multiply $1500 by 0.2. That's $1500 * 0.2 = $300. So the hotel costs $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

They're staying for 3 days, so we multiply $1800 by 3. That's $1800 * 3 = $5400.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to know the weight of both pennies. We already know the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. Now, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny.

The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. To find three-quarters of 48, we can multiply 48 by 3 and then divide by 4.

Three-quarters of 48 = (48 * 3) / 4
Three-quarters of 48 = 144 / 4
Three-quarters of 48 = 36

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains. Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies:
Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 + 48
Combined weight = 84

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, they eat 10 x 4 = 40 pounds of oats per day.

For five days, they will eat 40 x 5 = 200 pounds of oats.

First, let's find out how much she'll pay for 2 packs of razors. Since it's buy one get one free, she'll only pay for 1 pack. So, she'll pay $4.00 for 1 pack. But she has a $2.00 coupon, so she'll get a discount. 

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Now, we know she'll pay $2.00 for 2 packs of razors. Since each pack has 4 razors, 2 packs will have 8 razors. 

To find out how much each razor costs, we'll divide the total cost by the number of razors:

"To figure out how many guests are needed for the two venues to cost the same, we need to think about the costs of each venue.

The first venue costs $200 no matter how many guests come, and then it's $5 per guest for food. The second venue costs $25 per guest, and that includes the food.

Let's say there are 'x' guests. The cost of the first venue would be $200 + $5x. The cost of the second venue would be $25x.

We want these two costs to be the same, so we can set up an equation:

Now, let's solve for 'x'. We can subtract 5x from both sides of the equation:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x

Next, we can divide both sides by 20:

x = 200 / 20
x = 10

So, there need to be 10 guests for the two venues to cost the same.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to figure out how many insects each person found.

Let's start with what we know: David found half of what Bodhi found. If we call the number of insects Bodhi found ""B"", then David found B/2.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David. So, if David found B/2, then Lily found B/2 + 7.

We're also told that together, they found 43 insects. We can write this as an equation: B + B/2 + (B/2 + 7) = 43.

Combine like terms: B + B/2 + B/2 is the same as 2B/2, which is just B. So, the equation becomes: B + B + 7 = 43.

Combine like terms again: 2B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find out how many David found: David found B/2, which is 18/2, or 9.

Finally, we can find out how many Lily found: Lily found B/2 + 7, which is 9 + 7, or 16, but we also know that B = 18 and B/2 = 9, so David found 9 and Lily found 7 more than David, so 9 + 7 = 16, but we also know that 18 + 9 + L = 43, so 27 + L = 43, L = 43 - 27, L = 16.

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so we multiply 12 pairs by $12.00 to get the total cost. That's 12 x $12.00 = $144.00.

"To figure out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate how much she spends on bus trips each week. 

Janet takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. So, she takes 2 * 5 = 10 bus trips a week. Each trip costs $2.20, so she spends 10 * $2.20 = $22.00 a week on bus trips.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00.

"To find the total number of animals, we need to figure out how many cows and sheep are at the farm and the zoo.

First, we know the farm has 30 cows. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 x 30 = 60 cows.

Next, we know the zoo has 20 sheep. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's count the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, which is 30 + 10 = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, which is 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

To find the total number of animals, we add the number of animals at the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to figure out how many she bought compared to Rose. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can divide the number of items Rose bought by 4.

Rose bought 12 onions, so we divide 12 by 4 to get 3. This means Sophia bought 3 onions. 

Rose bought 4 potatoes, so we divide 4 by 4 to get 1. This means Sophia bought 1 potato.

In total, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato, which is 3 + 1 = 4 items.

"To figure out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to know how many days Andy has to lose 30 pounds. Today is December 31st, and his birthday is on July 19th. Let's count the days: December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days, March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and 19 days in July. That's a total of 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days.

Now, we know that Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. Since he wants to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn 30 x 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days: 105,000 ÷ 201 ≈ 522 calories.

The final answer is: 522"
"Gerald works at a daycare and gets paid $30 every day. He worked for a whole week, which is 7 days. So, we need to multiply the amount he gets paid per day by 7 to find out how much he made in a week.

$30 per day * 7 days = $210

Now, we know he spent $100. To find out how much he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he made.

$210 - $100 = $110

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to figure out how far she's running and then multiply that by how much water she needs per kilometer.

First, we need to find the total distance. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she's running 8 laps, we multiply 8 by 0.25. 

8 x 0.25 = 2 km

Now that we know she's running 2 km, we multiply that by the amount of water she needs per kilometer, which is 60 ml.

2 km x 60 ml/km = 120 ml

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to figure out how much she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, she spent 20% of her $500 on clothes. To find 20% of $500, we multiply $500 by 0.20. 
$500 * 0.20 = $100

So, she spent $100 on clothes. Now, we subtract $100 from $500 to find out how much she had left.
$500 - $100 = $400

Then, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find 25% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.25.
$400 * 0.25 = $100

Now, we subtract $100 from $400 to find out how much she had left.
$400 - $100 = $300

"To find the cost of the house, let's think about it like this: if the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can say the lot costs a certain amount, and the house costs three times that amount.

Let's call the cost of the lot ""x"". Then the cost of the house is 3x. We know that the total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000. So, we can set up an equation:

x (the cost of the lot) + 3x (the cost of the house) = 120,000

When we add x and 3x, we get 4x. So, our equation becomes:
4x = 120,000

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides by 4:
x = 120,000 / 4
x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot is $30,000, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying it by 3:
3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find out how much profit Tara made, we need to figure out how much she spent and how much she earned.

First, let's calculate how much she spent. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, so she bought 8 x 5 = 40 bags. Each bag cost $4, so she spent 40 x $4 = $160.

Next, let's calculate how much she earned. She sold 40 bags at $8 each, so she earned 40 x $8 = $320.

Now, let's find the profit. Profit is the amount of money you earn minus the amount of money you spend. So, Tara's profit is $320 - $160 = $160.

"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we need to figure out how long the fight lasted and multiply that by how many punches he throws per minute.

The fight is 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes. So, we multiply 5 rounds by 3 minutes to get the total minutes of the fight. 
5 x 3 = 15 minutes

Now, we know Joe throws 25 punches per minute. To find the total punches, we multiply the total minutes by the punches per minute.
15 minutes x 25 punches/minute = 375 punches

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to figure out how many Josh made first. We know Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Suzanne made 36 cookies. 

So, Josh's cookies are 1/4 of 36. To find one-fourth of 36, we can divide 36 by 4. 
36 ÷ 4 = 9

Now we know Josh made 9 cookies. Since Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we multiply Josh's cookies by 2.
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find out how much money Ali has left after buying dinner, we need to do a few steps.

First, let's calculate how much money Ali has in total. He has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 x $10 = $40. He also has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 x $20 = $120. So, the total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Next, Ali gives half of the money to his sister. Half of $160 is $160 ÷ 2 = $80. So, Ali gives his sister $80 and is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of $80, we can multiply $80 by 3 and then divide by 5. This is ($80 x 3) ÷ 5 = $240 ÷ 5 = $48.

Finally, we subtract the money Ali spent on dinner from the money he had left. So, $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find out how many minutes Royce takes to shingle a house, we need to first figure out how many minutes it takes Rob. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 2 hours by 60.

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time. So, we need to double Rob's time. Double Rob's time is 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes. Then, we add 40 minutes to this.

240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

"To figure out how many skeins of wool Martha needs, we need to calculate how many skeins each item requires and then multiply it by 3, since she's making one of each for her 3 grandchildren.

A hat needs 2 skeins, so 3 hats will need 2 x 3 = 6 skeins. 
A scarf needs 4 skeins, so 3 scarves will need 4 x 3 = 12 skeins. 
A sweater needs 12 skeins, so 3 sweaters will need 12 x 3 = 36 skeins. 
A pair of mittens needs 1 skein, so 3 pairs will need 1 x 3 = 3 skeins. 
A pair of socks needs 2 skeins, so 3 pairs will need 2 x 3 = 6 skeins.

Now, let's add up all the skeins: 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63.

That means he has 100 - 48 = 52 problems left. On Wednesday, he does one-quarter of those, which is 52 / 4 = 13. So now he's done 48 + 13 = 61 problems.

That means he has 100 - 61 = 39 problems left to do on Thursday.

First, we need to figure out how many loaves they sold. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. So, we add those two numbers together: 93 + 39 = 132 loaves.

Now, we know they baked 200 loaves and sold 132 loaves. To find out how many they have left, we subtract the number of loaves sold from the number of loaves baked: 200 - 132 = 68 loaves.

But wait, a grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. So, we need to add those 6 loaves to the 68 loaves they had left: 68 + 6 = 74 loaves.

"To find the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to figure out how many rows of red tulips and blue tulips he can make.

First, let's look at the red tulips. Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row, and he bought 36 red tulips. To find out how many rows he can make, we divide the total number of tulips by the number of tulips per row. So, 36 ÷ 6 = 6 rows of red tulips.

Next, let's look at the blue tulips. Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, and he bought 24 blue tulips. Again, we divide the total number of tulips by the number of tulips per row. So, 24 ÷ 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips to find the total number of rows. 6 rows (red) + 3 rows (blue) = 9 rows.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total cups of raisins by 3 since she's using them for 3 different things: cookies, granola, and snack mix. 

27 cups / 3 = 9 cups for the cookies.

Now, we know that a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we need to divide 9 by 3/4. 

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its opposite (or reciprocal). The opposite of 3/4 is 4/3. 

9 * 4/3 = 9 * 4 / 3 = 36 / 3 = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate how much electricity she uses before and after adding the new device.

Ada uses 12 kilowatts per hour, and the new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour. So, after adding the new device, she will use 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

There are 24 hours in a day, so we multiply the number of kilowatts per hour by 24 to get the total kilowatts per day. Before adding the new device, Ada uses 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatts per day. After adding the new device, she uses 14 * 24 = 336 kilowatts per day.

Since we want to know the weekly cost, we multiply the daily kilowatts by 7. Before adding the new device, Ada uses 288 * 7 = 2016 kilowatts per week. After adding the new device, she uses 336 * 7 = 2352 kilowatts per week.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt. So, we multiply the weekly kilowatts by $1.50 to get the weekly cost. Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly cost is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024. After adding the new device, her weekly cost is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

"To solve this problem, let's think about it step by step.

First, if one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it means they can paint the whole house in 10 days. This is because painting the whole house is like painting two halves, so it takes twice as long.

Next, we need to figure out how many hours it takes to paint the whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so if it takes 10 days, that's 10 x 24 = 240 hours.

Now, if one person can paint the whole house in 240 hours, we need to find out how long it would take for 5 people to do the same job. If one person takes 240 hours, five people can do it in 1/5 of the time. To find 1/5 of 240, we can divide 240 by 5.

240 ÷ 5 = 48

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint the whole house.

"To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to figure out how many chairs Ophelia and Jenna have.

Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we add 2 to 20 to find the number of chairs she has. So, Ophelia has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. To find the number of chairs Jenna has, we multiply Ophelia's chairs by 3. Jenna has 22 * 3 = 66 chairs.

Now, we need to find the number of sofas Jenna has. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we subtract 2 from 66. Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's add up all the sofas and chairs:
Ophelia's sofas: 20
Jenna's sofas: 64
Total sofas: 20 + 64 = 84
Ophelia's chairs: 22
Jenna's chairs: 66
Total chairs: 22 + 66 = 88
Total number of sofas and chairs: 84 + 88 = 172

$44 ÷ $4 = 11

This means Tom could have bought 11 CDs with the money he spent on the headphones. But he already bought 1 CD, so he could have bought 11 more CDs if he didn't buy the headphones.

"Josh worked out for 8 weeks. He usually worked out for 4 hours a week, but there were a few weeks where he worked out more. 

Let's first find out how many weeks he worked out for 4 hours. We know he worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week. So, he worked out for 4 hours for 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 weeks.

Now, let's calculate the total hours he worked out for 4 hours a week. 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours.

He also worked out for 5 hours a week for 2 weeks. So, 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours.

8 * 5 = 40

Now, we add the 40 new people to the 40 people already on the bus:
40 + 40 = 80

On the second stop, 21 people get off, so we subtract 21 from 80:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer people get on than got off. Since 21 people got off, we divide 21 by 3:
21 / 3 = 7

Now, we add the 7 new people to the 59 people already on the bus:
59 + 7 = 66

There are 66 people on the bus after the second stop.

"To find out how many years separate Jame and his cousin's age, we need to figure out how old they are now.

Jame will be 27 in 5 years, so we subtract 5 from 27 to get his current age. That's 27 - 5 = 22. So, Jame is 22 years old now.

Now, let's think about Jame's cousin. In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old. His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years. Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 2 * 30 = 60. So, his cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

Since his cousin will be 55 in 8 years, we subtract 8 from 55 to get his current age. That's 55 - 8 = 47. So, Jame's cousin is 47 years old now.

Now, we subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age to find the difference. That's 47 - 22 = 25.

"To figure this out, we need to know how many days are in April. April has 30 days. We can split this into two halves: the first 15 days and the last 15 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half. Let's say he saves 'x' dollars each day in the first half. Then, in the second half, he will save 2x dollars each day.

We know Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April. So, we can set up an equation to represent this:

15x (savings in the first half) + 15(2x) (savings in the second half) = 1125

Combine the terms:
15x + 30x = 1125
45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So, Elvis needs to save $25 each day in the first half. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2x = 2 * 25 = 50 dollars per day in the second half.

Since he works 5 days a week, we multiply the miles he walks each day by 5. That's 6 miles * 5 days = 30 miles.

"Elise is writing the alphabet a bunch of times. First, she writes it all the way through twice. That's 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters. Then, she writes half of it, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters. Now, she re-writes everything she's already written. That's the 52 letters from the first two times, plus the 13 letters from the half time, so that's 52 + 13 = 65 letters re-written.

To find the total, we add the letters from each step: 52 (the first two times) + 13 (the half time) + 65 (the re-written letters) = 130 letters.

"So, let's break this down step by step. 

Ali calls 3 families in the first round. Then, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families in the second round. To find out how many families are called in the second round, we multiply 3 (the number of families Ali called) by 3 (the number of families each of them calls). That's 3 x 3 = 9.

In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families. So, we multiply 9 by 3 to get 27.

Now, in the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families. We multiply 27 by 3 to get 81.

"So Mark was sick for 3 months and lost 10 pounds each month. We need to figure out how much weight he lost in total. To do that, we multiply the weight he lost each month (10 pounds) by the number of months he was sick (3 months). 

10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now we know he lost 30 pounds. His final weight was 70 pounds. To find his initial weight, we add the weight he lost to his final weight.

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To figure out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first find out how many toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. James has 80 toys, so five times that is 5 x 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys, we can subtract 2 from 400 to find out how many toys he currently has. 

400 - 2 = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

"To find out how much Daniel has to spend, we need to add up the cost of all the things he wants to buy. 

He wants 5 notebooks, and each notebook costs $1.50. So, 5 * $1.50 is $7.50. 
He also wants 2 pens, and each pen costs $0.25. So, 2 * $0.25 is $0.50. 
He wants 1 calculator, which costs $12, and 1 geometry set, which costs $10.

Now, let's add all these costs together: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

The shop gives a 10% discount, which means we need to find 10% of $30 and subtract it from $30. To find 10% of $30, we multiply $30 by 0.1, which is $3. 

So, we subtract $3 from $30: $30 - $3 = $27.

"To find out how much change Carly gets back, we need to calculate the total cost of the food she bought. 

First, let's find the cost of the hamburgers. She bought 5 hamburgers at $4 each. So, 5 x $4 = $20.

Next, let's find the cost of the potato fries. She bought 10 packs at $0.30 each. So, 10 x $0.30 = $3.

Then, let's find the cost of the fruit drinks. She bought 5 cans at $2 each. So, 5 x $2 = $10.

Now, let's add the costs together: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly paid with a $50 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from $50: $50 - $33 = $17.

"To figure out how much Antonella earned, we need to look at the two parts of her sales. The first part is the $1000, and the second part is the $1500 she sold after that.

For the first $1000, she gets 30% of that. To find 30% of $1000, we multiply $1000 by 0.30. That's $300.

For the $1500 she sold after that, she gets 40% because she gets an extra 10% for selling more than $1000. So we multiply $1500 by 0.40. That's $600.

Now we add the two amounts together: $300 + $600 = $900.

"To figure out how many more water bottles Bill needs, we need to do some math. First, we need to find out how many bottles he wants for his guests. He has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles for each guest. So, we multiply 70 by 2.

70 x 2 = 140

This means Bill wants 140 bottles of water for his guests. Now, we need to find out how many bottles he already has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, we multiply 2 by 24.

2 x 24 = 48

Bill already has 48 bottles of water. Now, we need to find out how many more bottles he needs. We subtract the number of bottles he already has from the number of bottles he wants.

140 - 48 = 92

So, Bill needs to buy 92 more bottles of water.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water, and then we'll assume that's the same as hot water since the problem doesn't give us the exact time for hot water.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, it takes him 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Twice as long as 16 minutes is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 more minutes makes it 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, let's calculate how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To figure out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to know how much he makes in a week. 

John gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. So, in a day, he makes $2 * 5 = $10. 

He works 4 days a week, so in a week, he makes $10 * 4 = $40.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take him to make $80. We can do this by dividing $80 by $40. 

$80 / $40 = 2

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

"To find the total number of holes in the buttons, we need to figure out how many holes are in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes.

First, let's find out how many holes are in the buttons with 2 holes. There are 7 buttons with 2 holes, so we multiply 7 by 2:
7 * 2 = 14 holes

Now, we need to find out how many buttons have 4 holes. There are 21 buttons in total, and 7 have 2 holes, so we subtract 7 from 21:
21 - 7 = 14 buttons

These 14 buttons have 4 holes each, so we multiply 14 by 4:
14 * 4 = 56 holes

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons:
14 + 56 = 70 holes

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to figure out the size of Zack's locker first. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, so Zack's locker is 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.

Now, we know Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker size = 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches.

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we need to know how much each of them weighs. Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so we subtract 20 from 150 to get Susan's weight: 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Now, we know Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. To find Bob's weight, we multiply Susan's weight by 2: 130 * 2 = 260 pounds.

Now that we know the weights of all three friends, we can add them up: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to think about the angle of the pyramid and how the sun is moving. The pyramid is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun is moving straight up from the tip of the pyramid at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, we can think of it as starting at the same angle as the pyramid, which is 32 degrees. After 10 hours, the sun will have moved 5 degrees per hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.

So, to find the new angle from the ground to the sun, we add the angle the sun has moved to the initial angle of the pyramid: 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to figure out how many pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights. So, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

We know Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes, we need to divide 105 by 1.5 and then multiply by 2. 

105 / 1.5 = 70
70 * 2 = 140

So, Judy read 140 pages in the first week. In the second week, she read 100 pages. 

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week:
140 + 100 = 240

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to figure out how many Cody and Trevor ate. 

Cody ate 1/3 of the sandwiches. Since they had 12 sandwiches, we can divide 12 by 3 to find out how many Cody ate. 12 / 3 = 4. So Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate 1/4 of the sandwiches. We can divide 12 by 4 to find out how many Trevor ate. 12 / 4 = 3. So Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

Now, we need to add the number of sandwiches they ate. 4 (Cody's sandwiches) + 3 (Trevor's sandwiches) = 7 sandwiches.

They started with 12 sandwiches, and they ate 7. To find out how many are left, we subtract 7 from 12. 12 - 7 = 5.

Mark's score = 80 - 20
Mark's score = 60

We also know Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, we can find Anna's score by subtracting 45 from Richie's score.
Anna's score = 80 - 45
Anna's score = 35

Peter has $70 and wants to spend the same amount each day for 7 days. So, we divide $70 by 7 to get $10 per day.

From Sunday to Wednesday, he buys wooden action figures that cost $5 each. Since he spends $10 per day, he can buy 2 wooden action figures per day. He does this for 4 days, so he buys 2 * 4 = 8 wooden action figures.

From Thursday to Saturday, he buys plastic action figures that cost $2 each. He still spends $10 per day, so he can buy 5 plastic action figures per day. He does this for 3 days, so he buys 5 * 3 = 15 plastic action figures.

"Maggie's oven is off by some percentage, and we need to figure out what temperature she should set it to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. 

First, let's find out how much the oven is off. When Maggie sets it to 450, it's actually 468. To find the difference, we subtract 450 from 468, which is 18. 

Now, we need to find what percentage 18 is of 450. To do that, we divide 18 by 450, which is 0.04. To turn that into a percentage, we multiply by 100, which is 4%. 

So, Maggie's oven is off by 4%. Now, we need to find the temperature she should set it to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. If we call the temperature she should set it to ""x"", then the actual temperature will be x + 4% of x. 

We know the actual temperature should be 520, so we can set up an equation: x + 4% of x = 520. To find 4% of x, we multiply x by 0.04, which is 0.04x. 

Now our equation is x + 0.04x = 520. We can combine the x's to get 1.04x = 520. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 1.04, which gives us x = 500.

"To find out how much each pair of contacts will cost, we need to figure out the total cost of 2 boxes and then divide it by the total number of contacts.

First, we need to find out how much 1 box costs after the discount. The original price is $100, but it's 10% off. To find 10% of $100, we multiply $100 by 0.10, which is $10. So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $100 - $10 = $90.

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, we multiply the cost of 1 box by 2: $90 * 2 = $180.

Now, we need to find out how many contacts are in 2 boxes. Since 1 box has 90 contacts, 2 boxes will have 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

Since a pair of contacts is 2 contacts (1 for each eye), we need to divide the total number of contacts by 2 to find the total number of pairs: 180 contacts / 2 = 90 pairs.

Now, let's add the calories she burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many 200-calorie groups she burned, we divide 1600 by 200: 1600 ÷ 200 = 8.

Since she needs 100 ml of water for each group, she needs 8 x 100 = 800 ml of water.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using a variable to represent the number of blue jelly beans. We'll call this number B.

Since the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 99% of B, or 0.99B. The jar also contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is 101% of B, or 1.01B.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up an equation:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide by 3:

B = 1500

Now we can find the number of red jelly beans and the number of green jelly beans:

Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:

1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the average of Jared's typing speed, we need to know all three measurements. We already know the first two: 47 words per minute (WPM) and 52 WPM. The third measurement is 5 WPM more than the second one, so it's 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we add the three measurements: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156. 

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 ÷ 3 = 52.

"To figure out the difference in weight, we need to see how much weight Martin will lose or gain with each breakfast option over 5 weeks.

If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds every week. So, in 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds every week. So, in 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

Now, we need to find the difference between the weight gained and the weight lost. To do this, we add the weight lost to the weight gained (since the weight lost is like a negative number): 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds.

"To figure out how many seats Alex needs, we need to add up all the people who are coming.

First, Alex invites 100 people by email. But that's not all - each of those people is also inviting 2 friends. So, we need to add 100 (the people invited by email) + 200 (2 friends for each of the 100 people) = 300 people.

Then, Alex calls 10 friends and invites them too. And 8 of those friends are bringing their spouses. So, we need to add 10 (the friends invited by phone) + 8 (the spouses) = 18 people.

Now, we add the people invited by email and their friends (300) to the people invited by phone (18). That's 300 + 18 = 318.

So, Alex needs 318 seats."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to figure out the weights of the other dogs first.

The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so we multiply 10 by 2. That's 20 pounds.

Next, the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. To find one-fourth of 20, we divide 20 by 4. That's 5 pounds.

Now, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. We multiply 5 by 44. That's 220 pounds.

"To figure out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both Amazon and eBay.

First, let's look at Amazon. The boots cost $16 and shipping is $4. So, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Now, let's look at eBay. The boots cost $13, which is cheaper than Amazon. But, the shipping on eBay is twice as much as Amazon, so it's $4 * 2 = $8. The total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

So, the boots on eBay cost $21 and on Amazon they cost $20. To find out how much more expensive they are on eBay, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

"To figure this out, let's see how tall the beanstalk gets each day. It starts at 4 feet and doubles every day.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 8 feet (because 4 x 2 = 8)
Day 3: 16 feet (because 8 x 2 = 16)
Day 4: 32 feet (because 16 x 2 = 32)

The window is 20 feet off the ground, so the beanstalk needs to be at least 20 feet tall to be taller than the window. On Day 3, it's still too short, but on Day 4, it's way taller than the window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to figure out how much protein is in the mushrooms he eats each day. 

First, we need to know how much protein is in 100 grams of mushrooms. It's 3 grams. Now, we need to find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. Since 200 grams is twice 100 grams, we multiply 3 grams by 2. That's 6 grams of protein per day.

Now, we need to find out how much protein John gets in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply 6 grams by 7. That's 42 grams of protein per week.

"Let's think about this problem. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means if we go back 5 years, his age at that time multiplied by 2 is his current age.

Let's say Jerry's current age is 'x'. So 5 years ago, his age was 'x - 5'. Since his current age is twice his age 5 years ago, we can write this as an equation: x = 2(x - 5).

Now, let's solve for 'x'. If we multiply 2 by (x - 5), we get 2x - 10. So the equation becomes x = 2x - 10. 

Now, let's get all the 'x's on one side. If we subtract 'x' from both sides, we get 0 = x - 10. Then, if we add 10 to both sides, we get 10 = x.

So Jerry is 10 years old right now. To find out how old he'll be in 3 years, we just add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13.

"So George needs to pay for dental work. He's getting 2 implants, and each one costs $2000. That's 2 x $2000 = $4000. But he also wants a special crown on one of them, and that's $500 extra. So now we're at $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He already paid $600, so we subtract that from the total: $4500 - $600 = $3900. That's how much more he needs.

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs ($3900) by how much he makes per hour ($15). That's $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the fact that the three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Let's say the smallest angle is x. Then, the other two angles are 2x and 3x.

We can write an equation based on the fact that the three angles add up to 180 degrees:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine the x terms:

6x = 180

Now, divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. Now, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, let's convert the coins into cents. We have 8 quarters, which is 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents. Then we have 6 dimes, which is 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents. We also have 14 nickels, which is 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents. And lastly, we have 15 pennies, which is 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents.

Now, let's add all the cents together: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy. 

Number of gumballs = 345 / 5 = 69

Birds have 2 legs each, and there are 10 birds. So, the total number of legs for birds is 10 x 2 = 20.

Now, we add the total number of legs for each type of pet: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

"So, Steve gets a console and 5 games for his birthday. Then, he buys 1 game a month for a year, which is 12 games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so that's 12 + 5 = 17 games in the first year. But we have to add the 5 games he got for his birthday, so that's 17 + 5 = 22 games.

In the second year, he buys 2 games a month, which is 24 games. He gets 5 more games for Christmas, so that's 24 + 5 = 29 games. Now we add the games from the first year, so 22 + 29 = 51 games.

In the third year, he buys 4 games a month, which is 48 games. He gets 5 more games for Christmas, so that's 48 + 5 = 53 games. Now we add the games from the first two years, so 51 + 53 = 104 games.

Now that we know the plane's speed, we can use it to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make in 12 hours.

First, let's find out how many chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. We know Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. So, we divide 120 by 2 to get Ruiz's hourly production. 
120 / 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Now, let's find out how many chocolates Marissa makes in an hour. We know Marissa makes 3/4 times as many chocolates as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. But we need to compare it to Ruiz's hourly production. So, we calculate 3/4 of Ruiz's hourly production.
3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Now, we calculate the amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours.
Ruiz makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates in 12 hours.
Marissa makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates in 12 hours.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260.

In the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour. Since he did this for 4 hours, he sold 15 * 4 = 60 cups. Each cup cost $0.50, so he made 60 * $0.50 = $30 in the first 4 hours.

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour. Since he did this for 2 hours, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups. Each cup cost $0.60, so he made 20 * $0.60 = $12 in the next 2 hours.

"To figure out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find out how many times the tire rotates in a month. We know that the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles. So, we need to find out how many times it rotates per mile. To do that, we divide 725 by 2.

725 ÷ 2 = 362.5

Now we know the tire rotates 362.5 times per mile. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so we multiply 362.5 by 400.

362.5 × 400 = 145,000

So, the tire rotates 145,000 times a month. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 145,000 by 12.

145,000 × 12 = 1,740,000

Now we know the tire rotates 1,740,000 times a year. The tire can only rotate 10,440,000 times before it needs to be replaced. To find out how many years that is, we divide 10,440,000 by 1,740,000.

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, that means the bottle has 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The bottle costs $24.00, which is 2400 cents. To find the cost of each pump, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of pumps.

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = 2400 cents / 240 pumps

"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the discount and subtract it from the initial $50.

First, we add the cost of the shirt and the shorts. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

The store has a 30% off sale, which means we get 30% off the total cost. To find 30% of $60, we multiply $60 by 0.3. This gives us $18. So, we get a discount of $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost: $60 - $18 = $42.

Since the sales tax is already included, we don't need to add anything else. Now, we subtract the final cost from the initial $50 to find out how much money Joe will have left: $50 - $42 = $8.

Now, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the rest of the week:
30 + 24 = 54

"To figure out how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to know how many inches he needs to grow. The roller coaster requires a height of 4 feet, which is the same as 48 inches (since 1 foot is 12 inches). 

Adam is currently 40 inches tall, so we subtract that from the required height: 
48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Adam grows 2 inches every year, so we need to divide the number of inches he needs to grow (8) by the number of inches he grows each year (2):
8 / 2 = 4 years.

"To find out how much James made, we need to figure out how much profit the company made from selling the cars, and then find 10% of that.

The company sold 10 cars for $25,000 each. They paid 30% of $25,000 to get each car. 30% of $25,000 is 0.3 x $25,000 = $7,500. So, the company paid $7,500 for each car.

The profit on each car is the selling price minus the cost price. That's $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500 per car.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 x $17,500 = $175,000.

James gets 10% of the profit. 10% of $175,000 is 0.1 x $175,000 = $17,500.

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to do a few steps. 

First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25. This is like finding 25% of 100. 
100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright. Now, we need to find out how many of these riders are women. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women. To find this, we multiply 25 by 0.6. 
25 * 0.6 = 15

This means 15 of the riders who can stay upright are women. To find the number of men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright. 
25 - 15 = 10

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to figure out the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

The diamond jewel costs $2000. The gold jewel costs 4/5 of what the diamond jewel costs. To find 4/5 of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 4 and then divide by 5. 
4 * $2000 = $8000
$8000 / 5 = $1600

So, the gold jewel costs $1600. The silver jewel costs $400 less than the gold jewel. 
$1600 - $400 = $1200

Now, we add up the prices of all three jewels to find the total price.
$2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to figure out how many of each type of stamp he bought.

We know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add up the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps:
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

"To figure out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to think about how fast Tom is catching up to Bob. Since they're both driving in the same direction, we subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed.

Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour, and Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour. So, the speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

Now, we know that Tom needs to cover the 75-mile gap between them. To find out how long it will take, we divide the distance by the speed at which Tom is catching up:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Now we know Darren caught 11 fish. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we add 3 to 11.

11 + 3 = 14

Tommy caught 14 fish.

"So, Manny signed up for Karate classes that cost $60 total. His parents said they won't sign him up again if the classes end up costing more than $10 each. There are 10 classes in total.

To figure out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to find out how many classes he can attend before the cost goes over $10 per class. We can do this by dividing the total cost ($60) by the maximum cost per class ($10).

$60 ÷ $10 = 6

This means Manny can attend 6 classes before the cost goes over $10 per class. Since there are 10 classes in total, we subtract 6 from 10 to find out how many classes he can miss:

10 - 6 = 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total number of customers Julie and Jewel process in a week, we need to first figure out how many customers they process in a day. We know Jewel processes 50 customers daily.

Since Julie is twice as fast as Jewel, she can process twice as many customers. So, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers daily.

Together, they process 50 + 100 = 150 customers daily.

There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply 150 by 7 to find the total weekly production. 

150 * 7 = 1050

We also know Reggie ran 3 miles more than Lynn. To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total. 

Let's do the math: 20 miles (Reggie's total) - 3 miles = 17 miles.

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to figure out the cost of each item first.

Four apples cost $5.20, so one apple costs $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30. If Clyde buys 5 apples, it will cost him 5 x $1.30 = $6.50.

Three oranges cost $3.30, so one orange costs $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10. If Clyde buys 5 oranges, it will cost him 5 x $1.10 = $5.50.

Now, we add the cost of the apples and oranges together: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to figure out how much dirt he has to move. The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. To find the total amount of dirt, we multiply these numbers together.

6 feet (long) * 4 feet (wide) = 24 square feet
24 square feet * 3 feet (deep) = 72 cubic feet

Now that we know Bob has to move 72 cubic feet of dirt, and it takes him 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot, we can multiply the total amount of dirt by the time it takes to shovel 1 cubic foot.

72 cubic feet * 3 seconds/cubic foot = 216 seconds

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add up the cost of the base truck and all the extra features.

The base truck costs $30,000. The king cab upgrade costs $7,500. The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$30,000 (base truck) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000

"To find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and add the bonus.

First, we need to find 5% of his current salary. To do this, we multiply $20,000 by 0.05.
$20,000 * 0.05 = $1,000

Now, we add this to his current salary to get his new monthly salary.
$20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

The bonus is half a month's salary, so we divide the new monthly salary by 2.
$21,000 / 2 = $10,500

Now, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12 to get his yearly salary.

"To find the total cost of James' new wardrobe, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the suits. James bought 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 x $750 = $7,500.

Next, let's find the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits, which is $750 / 5 = $150. James bought 10 dress pants, so the total cost of the dress pants is 10 x $150 = $1,500.

Now, let's find the cost of the dress shirts. James bought 3 dress shirts for each suit, and he bought 10 suits, so he bought 3 x 10 = 30 dress shirts. The dress shirts cost $60 each, so the total cost of the dress shirts is 30 x $60 = $1,800.

"To solve this problem, we need to use two equations. Let's say the number of sheep is S and the number of geese is G.

We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. So, the total number of legs is 4S + 2G. We are told that the total number of legs is 70, so we can write an equation:
4S + 2G = 70

We also know that each animal has one head. So, the total number of heads is S + G. We are told that the total number of heads is 20, so we can write another equation:
S + G = 20

Now, we can solve these equations. Let's multiply the second equation by 2 to make the G's the same:
2S + 2G = 40

Now, subtract this equation from the first equation:
(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
This simplifies to 2S = 30

Now, divide both sides by 2:
S = 15

"To find out how much candy each of them would have, we need to add up all the candy they have. Robert had 3 pounds, Cindy had 5 pounds, and Aaron had 4 pounds. 

So, we add 3 + 5 + 4. This equals 12 pounds of candy. Now, we need to divide this by 3, because they're sharing it equally among themselves. 

12 divided by 3 is 4.

"To find out how much change Adam got, we need to figure out how much he spent on the candies first. 

He bought 7 candies of type A, and each one costs $0.5. So, 7 x $0.5 is $3.5. He also bought 10 candies of type B, and each one costs $0.75. So, 10 x $0.75 is $7.5. 

Now, we add the cost of both types of candies: $3.5 + $7.5 = $11. This is the total amount Adam spent.

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find out how much change he got, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he paid: $15 - $11 = $4.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to figure out how many good days Christina had in total, including the extra three days. 

We know that Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days. Her first 8 days were good, and then the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. So, that's 2 more good days. 

Now, we add those 2 extra good days to the 12 good days she already had. That's 12 + 2 = 14 good days in total.

But we want to know how many good days were left after the first 30 days. Since we already know she had 12 good days in the first 30 days, we subtract those from the total good days. 

So, 14 (total good days) - 12 (good days in the first 30 days) = 2.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Janey has 21 books and that she has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has.

Let's say Sally has 'x' books. Then, Janey has 2 times 'x' plus 3 books. We can write this as an equation: 2x + 3 = 21.

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation. This gives us 2x = 18.

Next, we divide both sides by 2. This gives us x = 9.

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from its current height to 600 inches.

First, we need to convert the current height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12.

20 x 12 = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo is currently 240 inches tall. We want to know how many days it will take to reach 600 inches. To do this, we subtract the current height from the target height.

600 - 240 = 360 inches

This means the bamboo needs to grow 360 more inches to reach 600 inches. Since it grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the number of inches it needs to grow by the growth rate.

360 ÷ 30 = 12

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from its current height to 600 inches.

The final answer is: 12"
"So James has a dog shelter and he needs to get more toys for the dogs. He already has 4 toys for 4 dogs, but then 8 more dogs come in. That makes 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. 

Then, when James comes back, there are twice as many dogs as before. So, we need to multiply 12 by 2, which is 24 dogs. But then, 3 dogs leave, so we subtract 3 from 24, which is 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to figure out how much Dylan and Frances invested first.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200. To find 2/5 of $1200, we can multiply 2 * $1200 and then divide by 5. So, 2 * $1200 is $2400, and $2400 / 5 is $480.

Now, we subtract $480 from the total amount to find out how much money is left. $1200 - $480 is $720.

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720. To find 2/3 of $720, we can multiply 2 * $720 and then divide by 3. So, 2 * $720 is $1440, and $1440 / 3 is $480.

Now, we subtract $480 from the remaining amount to find out how much money is left for Skyler. $720 - $480 is $240.

Skyler's investment is $240."
"To figure out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to add the number of signatures they already have. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44. So together, they have 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

The sisters want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more they need, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal. 

100 (goal) - 64 (current signatures) = 36

So the sisters need to collect 36 signatures to reach their goal.

"To find out how much Karen earns, we need to know her hourly wage. We know Lorie earns $10 per hour, and Karen earns twice that. So, Karen earns 2 x $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to figure out how many hours Karen works in two days. She works 3 hours per day, so in two days, she works 2 x 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 x 6 = $120.

"To figure this out, we need to know how many hash browns one potato can make. Since 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can divide 36 by 6 to find out how many hash browns one potato makes.

36 ÷ 6 = 6

So, one potato makes 6 hash browns. Now, we can multiply the number of hash browns one potato makes by the total number of potatoes we have, which is 96.

6 * 96 = 576

So, we can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes.

"To find out how much they exceeded the maximum load, we need to calculate the total weight of the people in the elevator. There are 9 people in total, including Jack. 

Each person weighs 80 kg on average. So, we multiply the number of people by the weight of each person.

9 people * 80 kg/person = 720 kg

The elevator can only hold 700 kg. To find out how much they exceeded the limit, we subtract the maximum weight from the total weight.

720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

They exceeded the maximum load by 20 kg.

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to figure out how many cookies each person has.

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find Max's cookies by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies. So, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Now, we know Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. To find the Cookie Monster's cookies, we subtract 12 from Max's cookies. So, the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Lastly, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. We can find Summer's cookies by adding 23 to Max's cookies. So, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies: 
Katarina has 68 cookies
Max has 73 cookies
The Cookie Monster has 61 cookies
Summer has 96 cookies

68 + 73 = 141
141 + 61 = 202
202 + 96 = 298

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Shania's dress is extended by 50% of its original length. This means the new length is 1.5 times the original length. If we call the original length 'x', then the new length is 1.5x.

She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We know the final length is 140cm. We can set up an equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Now, let's solve for x. First, subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Next, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"To figure out how long it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to find out how long it took him to mow half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode.

First, let's look at the turtle mode. It takes Chris 1 hour to mow the whole lawn in turtle mode. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it takes him 60 minutes to mow the whole lawn. To mow half the lawn, it will take him half of 60 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

Next, let's look at the rabbit mode. It takes Chris 40 minutes to mow the whole lawn in rabbit mode. To mow half the lawn, it will take him half of 40 minutes, which is 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time it took him to mow half the lawn in turtle mode (30 minutes) and the time it took him to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode (20 minutes). 
30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

"To figure out how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time they have.

First, let's add up the time they've spent walking so far. It took them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is, and then another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. So, the total time they've spent walking is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time they've spent walking from the total time they have. They have 30 minutes to get to school, and they've already spent 19 minutes walking. So, the time remaining is 30 - 19 = 11 minutes.

"Let's break this down step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. We can start by using variables to represent their ages. Let's say the age of one twin is T and the age of one triplet is t.

Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation: T = t + 7.

Now, we know that there are two twins and three triplets. So, the total age of the twins is 2T and the total age of the triplets is 3t. The total combined age of all of them is 44. We can write another equation: 2T + 3t = 44.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. We get: 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44.

This can be simplified to: 2t + 14 + 3t = 44.

Combine like terms: 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtract 14 from both sides: 5t = 30.

Divide both sides by 5: t = 6.

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin: T = t + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13.

"To figure out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to know how much time he has before dinner and how much time he spends on homework.

John has 3 hours before dinner. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes to get the total minutes: 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John spends on homework: 
- 20 minutes of math homework
- 40 minutes of reading homework
- 20 minutes of history homework
Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner:
Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Total homework time
Time for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes
Time for nap = 100 minutes

"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the total cost of 5 lollipops is 5 x $0.40 = $2.00.

Now, we subtract the cost of lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. To find the cost of one candy, we divide $1.20 by 4: $1.20 ÷ 4 = $0.30.

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. 
10 lollipops cost 10 x $0.40 = $4.00
10 candies cost 10 x $0.30 = $3.00
The total cost is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to figure out how many coins each of them saves per year and then multiply that by 10.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 20 by 12 to get the number of coins Rong saves per year. That's 20 x 12 = 240 coins per year. Now, we multiply 240 by 10 to get the number of coins Rong saves in 10 years. That's 240 x 10 = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many coins that is, we multiply 20 by 2/5. That's (2/5) x 20 = 8. So Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. Now, we multiply 28 by 12 to get the number of coins Neil saves per year. That's 28 x 12 = 336 coins per year. We multiply 336 by 10 to get the number of coins Neil saves in 10 years. That's 336 x 10 = 3360 coins.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to figure out the total bill first. The dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each. So, the total cost of the vaccines is 2 x $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 60% of x, which is 0.6x. The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so we can write the equation:
x = $40 + 0.6x

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation:
0.4x = $40

Next, we divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for x:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25

Next, we know that an orange costs three times as much as a banana. So, we multiply the price of a banana ($1) by 3 to get the price of an orange, which is $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas cost 5 x $1 = $5
- 12 apples cost 12 x $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges cost 7 x $3 = $21

Finally, we add up the cost of all the fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

Next, she has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so she has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

Finally, she has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add up all the squares: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

"To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to figure out how many quarts of each flavor the factory can make in one hour.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. So, to find out how many quarts it makes in one hour, we divide 100 by 2. That's 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream per hour.

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find out how many quarts it makes in one hour, we divide 50 by 4. That's 12.5 quarts of vanilla ice cream per hour.

Now, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream the factory makes in one hour. That's 50 + 12.5 = 62.5 quarts per hour.

To find the total quarts made in 48 hours, we multiply 62.5 quarts per hour by 48 hours. That's 62.5 * 48 = 3000 quarts.

"To find the total bill, we need to add up the cost of all the items Marcus bought. 

He bought 5 croissants for $3 each, so that's 5 x $3 = $15. 
He bought 4 cinnamon rolls for $2.50 each, so that's 4 x $2.50 = $10. 
He bought 3 mini quiches for $4 each, so that's 3 x $4 = $12. 
He bought 13 blueberry muffins for $1 each, so that's 13 x $1 = $13.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $15 + $10 + $12 + $13 = $50.

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To find 10% of $50, we multiply $50 by 0.10, which is $5. 

So, we subtract $5 from the total cost: $50 - $5 = $45.

"To figure out how many scoops Erin can buy, we need to think about the deal. She gets 1 scoop free when she buys 2 scoops. Each scoop costs $1.50.

When Erin buys 2 scoops, she pays $1.50 * 2 = $3.00. But she gets 1 scoop free, so she gets 3 scoops for $3.00.

Erin has $6.00. If she spends $3.00, she has $6.00 - $3.00 = $3.00 left. She can buy another set of 3 scoops with the remaining $3.00.

So, Erin can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops. That's 2 * 3 = 6 scoops.

The answer is: 6"
"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to figure out how much candy each of them has left.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. There are 14 days in two weeks. So, Ginger eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy in two weeks. She started with 100, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy. She started with 100, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

Now, let's see how much more candy Amy has than Ginger. Amy has 58 pieces, and Ginger has 44 pieces. So, Amy has 58 - 44 = 14 more pieces of candy.

"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we first need to figure out how much of his bathroom he wants to cover. He wants to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom. 

To find two thirds of 36, we multiply 36 by 2 and then divide by 3. So, (36 * 2) / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24 sq ft.

Now that we know he's covering 24 sq ft, and he needs 24 mosaic tiles per square foot, we multiply 24 by 24 to get the total number of tiles. 24 * 24 = 576.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to figure out how much it cost him to pick the blueberries and compare it to how much it would have cost him to buy them at the store.

First, let's calculate how much it cost James to pick the blueberries. He had to pay $20 just to go picking, and then he had to pay $1.5 per pound. He picked 30 pounds, so we multiply 30 by $1.5 to get $45. Then we add the $20 he paid to go picking, so the total cost is $20 + $45 = $65.

Now, let's calculate how much it would have cost James to buy the blueberries at the store. The store charges $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds. So we multiply 30 by $2.5 to get $75.

Now we know that it would have cost James $75 to buy the blueberries, but it only cost him $65 to pick them. To find out how much he saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. There are 6 eggs, and each egg has 75 calories. So, the total calories from the eggs are 6 x 75 = 450 calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese. There are 2 ounces of cheese, and each ounce has 120 calories. So, the total calories from the cheese are 2 x 120 = 240 calories.

Finally, let's calculate the calories from the ham. There are 2 ounces of ham, and each ounce has 40 calories. So, the total calories from the ham are 2 x 40 = 80 calories.

Now, let's add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

"To find out how many people accept the job at Google, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many people get an interview. Since 30% of the 100 people get an interview, we multiply 100 by 0.3. 
100 * 0.3 = 30

So, 30 people get an interview. Now, we need to find out how many of them get a job offer. Since 20% of the people who get an interview get a job offer, we multiply 30 by 0.2. 
30 * 0.2 = 6

Now, we know that 6 people get a job offer. Finally, we need to find out how many of them accept the job. Since a third of the people who get a job offer accept the job, we divide 6 by 3. 
6 / 3 = 2

"Helga is a super fast clog dancer. We need to figure out how many times she taps her feet in 5 minutes. 

When her arms are at her sides, her right foot taps 300 times per minute and her left foot taps 250 times per minute. So, together, that's 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. She does this for 3 minutes (because 5 minutes - 2 minutes with arms raised = 3 minutes). So, in 3 minutes, she taps 550 * 3 = 1650 times.

When her arms are raised, both feet tap 200 times per minute. Since she does this for 2 minutes, she taps 200 * 2 * 2 = 800 times (the second 2 is because she has 2 feet).

Now, we add the taps together: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

"To figure out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to think about how much it costs him to fix it and how much it would cost if he didn't.

If Ron fixes the pothole, he has to buy 3 buckets of asphalt. Each bucket costs $25, so that's 3 x $25 = $75. He also might get a fine of $120 for fixing the pothole himself. So, the total cost is $75 + $120 = $195.

If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, it will cost him $450 to fix his car. 

So, to find out how much money Ron saves, we subtract the cost of fixing the pothole from the cost of not fixing it: $450 - $195 = $255.

"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the chairs that were sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's look at the normal chairs. The restaurant had 170 normal chairs and 20 of them were sent for repair. So, the number of normal chairs left is 170 - 20 = 150.

Next, let's look at the baby chairs. The restaurant had 23 baby chairs and 13 of them were sent for repair. So, the number of baby chairs left is 23 - 13 = 10.

Now, we add the number of normal chairs left and the number of baby chairs left to find the total number of chairs left. 150 + 10 = 160.

"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to figure out how many slices were eaten and subtract that from the total number of slices.

There were 5 pizzas, and each pizza had 12 slices. So, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, we need to find 2/3 of 12 slices for each of them. To do that, we multiply 12 by 2 and divide by 3. That's (12 x 2) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8 slices per person. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 3 x 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. We need to find ¾ of 12 slices for each of them. To do that, we multiply 12 by 3 and divide by 4. That's (12 x 3) / 4 = 36 / 4 = 9 slices per person. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x 9 = 18 slices.

Now, we add the slices eaten by both groups: 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

Finally, we subtract the slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 42 = 18.

"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we need to know how long it takes each of them. The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the time the cat takes.

So, we need to find 2/3 of 30 minutes. To do this, we multiply 30 by 2 and then divide by 3. 
2 * 30 = 60
60 / 3 = 20

This means the dog eats the sausages in 20 minutes. Now, we add the time it takes the cat (30 minutes) and the dog (20 minutes), then divide by 2 to find the average.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's use a variable, x, to represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can write an equation based on this information:
9x + 10 = 100

To solve for x, we need to get x by itself. First, we'll subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
9x = 90

Next, we'll divide both sides by 9:
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find out how many windows Hannah smashed, we need to figure out how many windows she smashed from the students' cars and the teachers' cars.

First, let's look at the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. So, the total number of windows is 64 x 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashed a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we need to find a quarter of 256. A quarter is the same as 1/4, so we multiply 256 by 1/4. This is the same as dividing 256 by 4, which is 64.

Now, let's look at the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows is 32 x 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashed 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we need to find 3/4ths of 64. To do this, we multiply 64 by 3/4. This is the same as multiplying 64 by 3 and then dividing by 4. 64 x 3 = 192, and 192 / 4 = 48.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed from the students' cars (64) and the teachers' cars (48). 64 + 48 = 112.

Next, let's add up all the spools: 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 spools.

Now, let's divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools: 60 / 150 = 0.4

"To find out how many people hadn't voted by 16:00, we need to figure out how many people had voted by that time.

At the start, there were 5000 people. By midday, 2/5 of them had voted. To find 2/5 of 5000, we multiply 5000 by 2 and then divide by 5. That's (5000 * 2) / 5 = 2000 people.

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted, and 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were left.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. To find 2/3 of 3000, we multiply 3000 by 2 and then divide by 3. That's (3000 * 2) / 3 = 2000 people.

Now, we add the people who voted by midday (2000) and the people who voted by 16:00 (2000). That's 2000 + 2000 = 4000 people.

Finally, we subtract the total number of people who voted (4000) from the initial number of people (5000). That's 5000 - 4000 = 1000.

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores, so we need to divide 24 s'mores by 8. That's 24 ÷ 8 = 3 sleeves. 

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 ÷ 3 = 1 box.

Dora is 15 years old. Her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we multiply Dora's age by 2 and add 8. That's 2 x 15 + 8 = 38. So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. To find her age, we subtract 4 from Dora's father's age. That's 38 - 4 = 34. So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we add up the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87.

Candidate A got 20% of the votes. To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.2. So, 100 * 0.2 = 20 votes for candidate A.

Now, candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. To find 50% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.5. So, 20 * 0.5 = 10. This means candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

So, candidates A and B together got 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Since there were 100 voters, we subtract the votes of A and B from 100 to find the votes of candidate C. 100 - 50 = 50.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to figure out how much water he used for each type of ice cube.

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes. Since each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water and Peter made 3 of them, we multiply 3 by 4. That's 3 x 4 = 12 ounces.

Next, we calculate the water used for the medium cubes. Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water, and Peter made 7 of them. So, we multiply 7 by 2. That's 7 x 2 = 14 ounces.

Lastly, we calculate the water used for the small cubes. Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water, and Peter made 8 of them. To multiply 8 by 0.5, we can multiply 8 by 1 and then divide by 2. That's 8 x 1 = 8, and 8 / 2 = 4 ounces.

Now, we add up the water used for all the cubes: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

There are 50 students in total, so the number of students who like to play video games or play music is 50 - 15 = 35.

We also know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to play music from the total number of students who like to play video games or play music.

The vendor buys 500 tomatoes a day. Before, he paid 50 cents for each tomato, so he paid 500 x 50 cents = $250 each day. Now, he pays 40 cents for each tomato, so he pays 500 x 40 cents = $200 each day.

He saves $250 - $200 = $50 each day. To find out how much he saves in a week, we multiply $50 by 7. $50 x 7 = $350.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many marbles Carl and Cal have. We know Sean has 56 marbles. 

Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2. So, Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

Now, we know Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. To find out how many marbles Carl has, we multiply Sean's marbles by 4. So, Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add the number of marbles each of them has: 112 + 224 = 336.

"To figure this out, we need to know how many students are in each group. Since there are 54 students and 6 groups, we divide 54 by 6. This gives us 9 students per group.

The activity needs 12 groups, but we can only make groups with the students we have. Since each group has 9 students, we can't make 12 groups with 54 students. We already know we can make 6 groups with 54 students.

To find out how many more groups are needed, we subtract the number of groups we can make from the number of groups needed. So, 12 (groups needed) - 6 (groups we can make) = 6.

"To find the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to figure out how many chairs she rents in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks.

There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week. On weekdays, she rents 60 chairs per day, and on weekends, she rents 100 chairs per day.

So, in a week, she rents:
- 60 chairs/day * 5 days = 300 chairs on weekdays
- 100 chairs/day * 2 days = 200 chairs on weekends
- Total chairs rented in a week = 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Since there are 8 weeks in two 4-week months, we multiply the chairs rented in a week by 8:
- 500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

"Let's break down what happened to Gunther's bananas.

Gunther started with 48 bananas. Then, Arnold took half of them. To find half of 48, we can divide 48 by 2, which is 24. So, Arnold took 24 bananas, and Gunther was left with 48 - 24 = 24 bananas.

The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas to his pile. Now he has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. But then, Arnold took 12 more bananas. So, Gunther was left with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas to his pile. Now he has 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile."
"To figure out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to first find out how much the electricity costs for the whole year. 

The electricity bill is $100 each month. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply $100 by 12:
$100 * 12 = $1200

Now, we need to divide this by the number of people, which is 5 (Jenna and her 4 roommates). 
$1200 / 5 = $240

"To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to first figure out how many he had in the beginning. 

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. Since 1 dozen is 12, we multiply 8 by 12 to get the number of glasses, and 4 by 12 to get the number of plates.

Glasses: 8 * 12 = 96
Plates: 4 * 12 = 48

So, Jeff had 96 glasses and 48 plates, for a total of 96 + 48 = 144 items.

But then, some of them got broken. 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. That's a total of 10 + 6 = 16 broken items.

To find out how many items Jeff has now, we subtract the number of broken items from the total number of items: 144 - 16 = 128.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 27, so she trades 27 small stickers for 9 large buttons (since 3 small stickers = 1 large button). Now she has 3 small stickers left and 9 large buttons.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 20, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons. Now she has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons, and 20 large stickers left.

Then, she trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker = 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons. Now she has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons, and 60 small buttons.

She also had 9 large buttons from before, so she has 29 + 9 = 38 large buttons. Since 1 large button = 3 small buttons, 38 large buttons = 38 * 3 = 114 small buttons. Now she has 3 small stickers and 114 + 60 = 174 small buttons.

Since 1 small sticker = 1 small button, we can convert the small stickers to small buttons. So she has 3 + 174 = 177 small buttons.

The final answer is: 177"
"So, Joey played football last week. He played 2 matches on Monday and 1 match on Friday. On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday. To find out how many matches he played on Saturday, we need to multiply the number of matches he played on Monday by 2. That's 2 x 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add up all the matches he played: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many votes were in favor of the new regulation. We know that there are 33 people on the council and that the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against.

Let's say the number of votes against is x. Then, the number of votes in favor is 2x. Since the total number of votes is 33, we can set up an equation: x + 2x = 33.

Combine the x terms: 3x = 33.

Now, divide both sides by 3: x = 11.

So, the number of votes against is 11. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2 * 11 = 22.

"To find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we need to figure out how many students need each size.

First, we know 11 students need extra-small shirts. Since twice as many students need small shirts as extra-small, we multiply 11 by 2 to get 22 students who need small shirts.

Next, we find out how many students need medium shirts. We know it's four less than the number of students who need small shirts, so we subtract 4 from 22 to get 18 students who need medium shirts.

Now, we need to find out how many students need large shirts. Since half as many students need large shirts as medium, we divide 18 by 2 to get 9 students who need large shirts.

Finally, we find out how many students need extra-large shirts. We know it's six more than the number of students who need large shirts, so we add 6 to 9 to get 15 students who need extra-large shirts.

To find the total number of shirts, we add up the number of students for each size: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we need to multiply the number of Pomeranian girls by 3, since one third of them are girls.

6 Pomeranian girls * 3 = 18 Pomeranians

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. This means that the Pomeranians are 2/3 of the total puppies. To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply the number of Pomeranians by 3/2.

Think of it like this: if 2/3 of the puppies are Pomeranians, then the total puppies would be 3/2 times the number of Pomeranians.

18 Pomeranians * (3/2) = 27 puppies

So, Jana has 27 puppies.

The second house needs twice as many as the first house, so it needs 2x. The third house needs twice as many as the first house, so it also needs 2x.

We know that all three houses need 250 cases in total. So, we can write an equation: x + 2x + 2x = 250.

Combine the x's: 5x = 250.

600 ÷ 3 = 200 movies

These movies cost 1/6 of the price of a normal movie. A normal movie costs $10, so we can multiply $10 by 1/6 to find the price of a series movie.
$10 × 1/6 = $1.67 per series movie

Now, we multiply the number of series movies by the price of a series movie to find the total cost of the series movies.

Ava and Emma get points for jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and having time left on the timer. They get 10 points for each enemy, 5 points for each berry, and 30 points for each second left.

Let's say Emma jumps on 'x' enemies and collects 'y' berries, and finishes the level with 'z' seconds left. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 'x + 8' enemies. She collects 3 more berries than Emma, so she collects 'y + 3' berries. She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she has 'z - 4' seconds left.

Now, let's calculate their scores. Emma's score is 10x + 5y + 30z. Ava's score is 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(z - 4). 

When we simplify Ava's score, we get 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30z - 120. This simplifies to 10x + 5y + 30z - 25.

Now, let's find the difference between their scores. The difference is Ava's score minus Emma's score. So, it's (10x + 5y + 30z - 25) - (10x + 5y + 30z).

The two pizzas that cost 30 dollars together cost 30 dollars. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars.

So, the cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 30 = 34 dollars.

But, they also ride twice as much on 2 other days. Twice as much as 3 rides is 2 x 3 = 6 rides per day. For 2 days, that's 2 x 6 = 12 rides.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Bob had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 orange and 4 white. He bought 17 more fish, and after adding them to his pond, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's say the number of white fish he bought is x. Then, the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - x (since he bought 17 fish in total).

We know that after adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, the total number of orange fish is 2 times the total number of white fish.

The total number of white fish is the number of white fish he already had (4) plus the number of white fish he bought (x). So, the total number of white fish is 4 + x.

The total number of orange fish is the number of orange fish he already had (3) plus the number of orange fish he bought (17 - x). So, the total number of orange fish is 3 + 17 - x = 20 - x.

Since the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish, we can set up the equation:

20 - x = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 - x = 8 + 2x

Adding x to both sides gives:

20 = 8 + 3x

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives:

12 = 3x

Dividing both sides by 3 gives:

4 = x

However, this doesn't seem right, since we're trying to find the number of white fish Bob bought, and he already had 4 white fish. Let's try again.

We know that the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish. So, the total number of orange fish is 2(4 + x). We also know that the total number of orange fish is 3 + 17 - x = 20 - x.

Setting up the equation, we get:

20 - x = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 - x = 8 + 2x

Adding x to both sides gives:

20 = 8 + 3x

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives:

12 = 3x

Dividing both sides by 3 gives:

4 = x

However, we need to remember that x is the number of white fish Bob bought, not the total number of white fish. Let's try again.

We know that the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish. So, the total number of orange fish is 2(4 + x). We also know that the total number of orange fish is 3 + (17 - x) = 20 - x.

Setting up the equation, we get:

2(4 + x) = 20 - x

Expanding the left side gives:

8 + 2x = 20 - x

Adding x to both sides gives:

8 + 3x = 20

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives:

3x = 12

Dividing both sides by 3 gives:

"To figure out how much money Andy's car is using per week, we need to know a few things. First, we need to know how far he drives each day. Since he drives to work and back home, that's 2 trips. The distance from his home to work is 5 miles, so the round trip is 5 miles + 5 miles = 10 miles.

He does this 5 days a week, from Monday to Friday. So, the total miles he drives in a week is 10 miles/day x 5 days = 50 miles.

Now, we need to know how much gas his car uses. His car gets 10 miles per gallon. To find out how many gallons he uses, we divide the total miles by the miles per gallon: 50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons.

The price of gas is $3 per gallon. To find out how much money he spends on gas per week, we multiply the gallons by the price: 5 gallons x $3/gallon = $15.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Carrie had 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so we multiply 140 by $0.25:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Carrie spent 3/5 of her twenties. She had 10 twenties, so we multiply 10 by 3/5:
10 * 3/5 = 6

Since each twenty is worth $20, we multiply 6 by $20:
6 * $20 = $120

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount spent:
$35 + $120 = $155

"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get, we need to calculate the yield from both tomato and eggplant plants.

First, let's find out how many tomatoes Ricardo will get. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes, and he has 5 plants. So, we multiply 22 by 5, which is 110 tomatoes.

Next, let's find out how many eggplants Ricardo will get. Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and he has 8 plants. So, we multiply 4 by 8, which is 32 eggplants.

Now, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits. 110 + 32 = 142.

"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we need to figure out how many of the other TVs were sold first.

One-fourth of the TVs sold were smart TVs. To find one-fourth of 40, we can divide 40 by 4. 40 ÷ 4 = 10, so 10 smart TVs were sold.

One-eighth of the TVs sold were analog TVs. To find one-eighth of 40, we can divide 40 by 8. 40 ÷ 8 = 5, so 5 analog TVs were sold.

Now, we add the number of smart TVs and analog TVs together. 10 + 5 = 15.

Since the rest of the TVs were OLED TVs, we subtract 15 from the total number of TVs sold. 40 - 15 = 25.

That's how much the school is paying. Now, we need to subtract that from the total cost to find out how much John needs to pay.

$300 - $150 = $150

But John already has $50, so we need to subtract that from the amount he needs to pay.

$150 - $50 = $100

"To figure out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to find out how cold it is at night. We know it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and it was 45 degrees during the day. So, we subtract 33 from 45.

45 - 33 = 12

This means it's 12 degrees at night. The pipes will freeze if it's below 32 degrees, so we need to get the temperature up to at least 32 degrees. To do this, we need to know how many degrees the temperature needs to rise.

32 - 12 = 20

Each log of wood makes the house 5 degrees warmer. To find out how many logs Carson needs, we divide the number of degrees the temperature needs to rise by the number of degrees each log makes the house warmer.

20 ÷ 5 = 4

Carson needs to burn 4 logs to keep the pipes from freezing.

"To find the total number of seashells, we need to figure out how many groups there are and how many people brought seashells.

There are 90 people, and they're divided into groups of 9. To find the number of groups, we divide 90 by 9.

90 ÷ 9 = 10

So, there are 10 groups. Now, 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3 and then divide by 5.

(10 * 3) ÷ 5 = 30 ÷ 5 = 6

This means 6 groups brought seashells. Since each group has 9 members, we multiply 6 by 9 to find the total number of people who brought seashells.

6 * 9 = 54

Each of these people brought 2 seashells, so we multiply 54 by 2.

54 * 2 = 108

$40 * 0.25 = $10

So the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price.

$40 - $10 = $30

The sale price is $30. Mike pays with a $50 bill, so we subtract the sale price from $50 to find out how much money he'll have left.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays its employees after three months, we need to know how many employees the company has after three months. 

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 more each month. So after three months, the company will have:

200 (employees at the start) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3)
= 200 + 20 + 20 + 20
= 260 employees

Each employee gets $4000 per month. So, the total amount of money the company pays its employees in one month is:

260 (total employees) * 4000 (monthly salary per employee)
= 1,040,000

Since we want to know how much the company pays after three months, we multiply the monthly salary by 3:

Sally makes $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, so she makes $10.50 per hour.

They both work 20 hours. To find out how much they make, we multiply the hours they work by how much they make per hour.

Billy makes 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230.
Sally makes 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210.

To find out how much more Billy makes than Sally, we subtract Sally's pay from Billy's pay: $230 - $210 = $20.

Now, we know she wants the stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let's say she buys x stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x.

We can set up an equation to solve for x. Since 30% is the same as 30/100 or 0.3, we can write the equation as:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x):
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Now, let's subtract 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To figure out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days. 
She plays 0.5 hours a day, so in 14 days, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. 
There are 7 days in a week, so she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

So, in total, Kris has played 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Now, we need to find out how far apart they will be. Since the second car is going faster, it will be ahead of the first car. To find the distance between them, we subtract the distance the first car traveled from the distance the second car traveled:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

"To find out how much James paid, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold. The diamond cost $600 and the gold cost $300. 

$600 + $300 = $900

Now, we need to add the 30% premium. To do that, we need to find 30% of $900. We can do that by multiplying $900 by 0.3.

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost.

$900 + $270 = $1170

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to know how many students passed the test and how many students took the test in total.

340 out of 500 third-graders passed, and 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed. We can add these numbers together: 340 + 40 = 380.

Now, we need to find out how many fifth-graders passed. We know that the pass rate of the fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth-graders. The pass rate of the fourth-graders is 40 out of 100, or 40%. Twice that is 80%. So, 80% of the 400 fifth-graders passed. To find 80% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.8: 400 * 0.8 = 320.

Now we add the number of fifth-graders who passed to the total: 380 + 320 = 700.

The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.7 * 100 = 70.

"To figure out how long Milo's mosaic can be, we need to know how many square inches he can cover with the glass chips he has. 

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag has 72 chips. So, he has 2 x 72 = 144 chips in total.

It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch of the mosaic. To find out how many square inches Milo can cover, we divide the total number of chips by 12. That's 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we need to find the length. Think of it like a rectangle - the area (square inches) is the length times the height. We know the area (12 square inches) and the height (3 inches), so we can find the length by dividing the area by the height. That's 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the party, we need to figure out how much tea was consumed and add it to the leftover tea.

First, let's calculate how much tea the four students drank. Each of them drank 1.5 quarts, so we multiply 4 by 1.5:
4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts

Next, we calculate how much tea the 16 students drank. Each of them drank 2 quarts, so we multiply 16 by 2:
16 * 2 = 32 quarts

Now, we add the tea consumed by both groups:
6 + 32 = 38 quarts

We also know that there are 10 quarts of tea left, so we add that to the total amount consumed:
38 + 10 = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we divide the total amount of tea by 4 to get the number of gallons:
48 / 4 = 12 gallons

"Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies that he wanted to sell. But then he ended up selling 150 candies. Wait, how did he sell 150 if he only had 100? That's because he ordered more. He ordered 100 more candies.

So, let's add the candies he had at first to the candies he ordered later. That's 100 + 100 = 200 candies in total.

Now, we need to find out how many candies he still needs to sell. We know he already sold 150 candies. To find out how many are left, we subtract the number of candies he sold from the total number of candies. That's 200 - 150 = 50.

We start with 10 students. 
- In January, the number doubles to 20.
- In February, it doubles again to 40.
- In March, it doubles to 80.
- In April, it doubles to 160.
- In May, it doubles to 320.

Now, we need to find out how many more students joined. To do that, we subtract the number of students we started with (10) from the number of students at the end of May (320).

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to figure out how many branches he climbed in total. We know he made $105 and that he charges $0.25 per branch. 

So, we divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25). 

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420

This means Felix climbed 420 branches in total. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total branches by 7 to find the average branches climbed per day.

420 ÷ 7 = 60

"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each type of flower. 

First, Rose picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each. So, 3 x 5 = 15 petals. 

Then, she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each. So, 4 x 6 = 24 petals.

Next, she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each. So, 5 x 4 = 20 petals.

Lastly, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each. So, 6 x 7 = 42 petals.

Now, let's add all the petals together: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

But wait, Rose dropped 1 flower of each type. So, we need to subtract the petals from the dropped flowers. 
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Total petals dropped: 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals.

Now, subtract the dropped petals from the total petals: 101 - 22 = 79 petals.

"To figure out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to know how many marshmallows are left. They started with 35 marshmallows. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. That's a total of 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows used or dropped.

Now, let's subtract the marshmallows they used or dropped from the total number of marshmallows they started with. 35 - 21 = 14. So, there are 14 marshmallows left.

Since there are 2 kids, we'll divide the remaining marshmallows by 2. 14 / 2 = 7.

"To find out how much money they used, we need to figure out how many quarters each person used. 

Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. They played for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. So, Jack used 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends aren't as good, so they can only play for half as long. That's 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They played for 240 minutes, so they used 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. There are two of them, so they used 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is really good and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack. That's 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He played for 240 minutes, so he used 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Now, we add up all the quarters: 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so they used 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"To find out how many ounces of oil Tanya uses, we need to break down the information given. 

Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. She also uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's say the amount of zest is 1 ounce. Then the amount of fragrance is also 1 ounce. Since she uses twice as much salt as zest, the amount of salt is 2 ounces. And since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also 2 ounces.

Now, she uses twice as much oil as salt. So, the amount of oil is 2 * 2 = 4 ounces.

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. Let's check if our calculation is correct:
1 (zest) + 1 (fragrance) + 2 (salt) + 2 (sugar) + 4 (oil) = 10 ounces

Yes, it's correct. So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"Let's break this down step by step.

First, we know Robert has 20 cars. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, we multiply Robert's cars by 2. So, Joe has 2 x 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2. This gives us 40 x 0.2 = 8 cars sold.

Now, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mom. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 x 8 = 16 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the cars he sold and gave away from his total. So, 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

Joe has 16 cars left."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount that came from organizations from the total amount raised. 

The total amount raised is $175,000, and $50,000 came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we need to divide the amount raised by the students by the number of students. There are 20 students, and they all raised the same amount. 

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day. Half of 8 hours is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

Now, we need to convert the total time from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 12 hours by 60: 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

"To figure out how much John makes in a week, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how much he makes per cycle. Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, we multiply the number of tasks by the amount each task pays:
5 tasks * $1.20 per task = $6 per cycle

Now, we know John does 30 cycles a day. To find out his daily earnings, we multiply the amount he makes per cycle by the number of cycles:
$6 per cycle * 30 cycles = $180 per day

Since John works 7 days a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7 to find out his weekly earnings:

"To find out how many cards Becca has, we need to figure out how many cards PJ and Smendrick have first. We know that Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has. Let's say PJ has x cards. Then Smendrick has 3x cards.

We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick. So, Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341. We can write an equation to represent this:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine the x terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

So PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3 times that, which is 3 * 47 = 141 cards.

Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

Becca has 153 cards."
"So Cindy has a bunch of Easter eggs, and we need to figure out how many she has in total. Let's break it down by color.

First, she has 5 green eggs. Then, she has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. That means she has 2 x 5 = 10 blue eggs.

Next, she has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs. So, she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Finally, she has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. To find this, we divide the number of pink eggs by 3. That's 9 ÷ 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

"To figure out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book back and how much Amazon will refund her.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound, and the book weighs 4 pounds. So, the cost for the weight is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. They also charge $0.08 per mile, and the distribution center is 20 miles away. So, the cost for the distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. Adding these together, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, let's calculate the refund amount. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which was $32. To find 75% of $32, we multiply $32 by 0.75, which is $24.00.

Now, let's calculate the total loss. We subtract the refund amount from the book's cost and add the shipping cost. So, the total loss is $32 - $24.00 + $3.00 = $11.00.

First, let's look at the time she spends recording videos. She records 18 videos a week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, she spends 18 x 4 = 72 minutes a week recording videos. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 72 x 4 = 288 minutes a month recording videos.

Next, let's look at the time she spends writing songs. She spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is equal to 2 x 60 = 120 minutes a week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 120 x 4 = 480 minutes a month writing songs.

Finally, let's look at the time she spends doing her makeup. She spends 15 minutes a day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. So, she spends 15 x 6 = 90 minutes a week doing her makeup. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 90 x 4 = 360 minutes a month doing her makeup.

Each extra item costs $15.00. So, we need to add up the cost of the extra items: 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 extra items. 

13 extra items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. So, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. So, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it takes one kangaroo to cross the highway. Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, we can multiply 18 by 3 to find the time for one kangaroo. This is because if 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, one kangaroo would take 3 times as long. 

18 * 3 = 54 hours. This is how long it takes one kangaroo to cross the highway.

Now, we know that the turtles are half as fast as the kangaroos. This means they take twice as long to cross the highway. So, we multiply the time it takes one kangaroo by 2.

54 * 2 = 108 hours. This is how long it takes one turtle to cross the highway.

Since all the turtles are moving at the same speed, it will still take them 108 hours to cross the highway, even if there are four of them.

Now, we know Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, we multiply the number of socks Jack has by 2.

2 * 30 = 60 socks

Next, we know Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, we divide the number of dishes Jack has by 2.

60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, let's add up the total number of socks and dishes they have together.

Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

Total number of socks and dishes they have together = Total socks + Total dishes = 90 + 90 = 180

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to figure out how many students are good at both math and English, and then add the students who are good at math only.

There are 20 students in total. Out of these, 5 are good at math only and 8 are good at English only. So, if we subtract these two groups from the total number of students, we can find out how many students are good at both math and English.

20 (total students) - 5 (good at math only) - 8 (good at English only) = 7

This means 7 students are good at both math and English. Now, we add these 7 students to the 5 students who are good at math only.

7 (good at both) + 5 (good at math only) = 12

"To figure out how many groups can perform, we need to know how long the concert is and how long each group takes. The concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. There's also a 10-minute break, so we subtract that: 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to get off stage. That's 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.

Now, we divide the total time by the time per group: 110 / 10 = 11.

"To find out how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to figure out how much interest she earns each year. The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is $300. Three-quarters of $300 is the same as 3/4 * $300. 

To find three-quarters of $300, we can multiply $300 by 3 and then divide by 4. 
$300 * 3 = $900
$900 / 4 = $225

So Brenda earns $225 in interest each year. Since it's simple interest, she earns the same amount each year. To find the total interest she earns in 3 years, we multiply $225 by 3.
$225 * 3 = $675

Now, we add the total interest to the original amount to find the total amount after 3 years.
$300 (original amount) + $675 (total interest) = $975

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many white shirts have no collars and how many floral shirts have no buttons.

First, let's look at the white shirts. We know that half of the 40 white shirts have collars. Half of 40 is 20, so 20 white shirts have collars. That means the other 20 white shirts have no collars.

Now, let's look at the floral shirts. We know that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons. To find out how many have no buttons, we subtract 20 from 50. 50 - 20 = 30, so 30 floral shirts have no buttons.

Finally, we need to find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars. We already know that there are 30 floral shirts with no buttons and 20 white shirts with no collars. To find the difference, we subtract 20 from 30. 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to figure out how many trays he can fill with the eggs. Each tray holds 30 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray.

900 eggs ÷ 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Now that we know the farmer has 30 trays, we can multiply that by the price per tray to find the total earnings.

30 trays × $2.5 per tray = $75

"To find the total number of goats left, we need to figure out how many goats are left in each farm and then add them together.

Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so now Farm X has 55 - 10 = 45 goats.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 x 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, Farm Y now has 45 - 20 = 25 goats.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

"To find out how much James pays for each pair of shoes, we need to know how many pairs he buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs a month, we multiply that by 12 months.

2 pairs/month * 12 months = 24 pairs/year

Now we know James buys 24 pairs of shoes a year. We also know he spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays for each pair, we divide the total amount he spends by the number of pairs he buys.

$2640 ÷ 24 pairs = $110 per pair

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food baskets and the cost of the red food baskets separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the green food baskets. Since each basket costs $25, 3 baskets will cost 3 * $25 = $75.

Next, let's find the cost of the red food baskets. Each basket originally costs $18, but we get a $2 discount for each basket. So, the cost of each red food basket after the discount is $18 - $2 = $16. Since we're buying 3 baskets, the total cost is 3 * $16 = $48.

Now, let's add the cost of the green food baskets and the cost of the red food baskets to find the total cost: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to do a few steps. 

First, we need to know how many rooms are one-half of 90. To do that, we divide 90 by 2. 90 / 2 = 45. So, one-half of the rooms is 45 rooms.

Next, we need to know how many minutes it takes to clean 45 rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so we multiply 45 by 20. 45 * 20 = 900 minutes.

Now, we need to convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 900 by 60. 900 / 60 = 15.

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

So, after two years, they will have 12 + 36 = 48 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes they have built so far. This means they will build 48 * 2 = 96 new homes.

To find the total number of homes built over the three years, we need to add the new homes built in the third year to the total number of homes built in the first two years. This is 48 + 96 = 144.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that you are three years younger than your brother, and you are 2 years older than your sister. Let's say your brother's age is B, your age is Y, and your sister's age is S.

Since you are three years younger than your brother, we can write an equation:
Y = B - 3

Since you are 2 years older than your sister, we can write another equation:
Y = S + 2

We also know that your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age. Let's say your mom's age is M:
M = 3B - 1

When you add all your ages, you get 87. So, we can write the equation:
B + Y + S + M = 87

Now, let's try to find your age. We can start by guessing your brother's age. If your brother is 20 years old, then you are 17 years old (since you are 3 years younger). Your sister would be 15 years old (since you are 2 years older than her). Your mom would be 59 years old (since her age is one less than three times your brother's age).

Let's add up these ages:
20 + 17 + 15 + 59 = 111 (this is not 87)

If your brother is 19 years old, then you are 16 years old. Your sister would be 14 years old. Your mom would be 56 years old.

Let's add up these ages:
19 + 16 + 14 + 56 = 105 (this is not 87)

If your brother is 18 years old, then you are not a whole number of years old (since you are 3 years younger). This doesn't make sense.

If your brother is 21 years old, then you are 18 years old. Your sister would be 16 years old. Your mom would be 62 years old.

Let's add up these ages:
21 + 18 + 16 + 62 = 117 (this is not 87)

If your brother is 20 is too high, and 19 is too high, let's try 18 again, but this time, let's try 17 and 16 for your brother's age.

If your brother is 17 years old, then you are 14 years old. Your sister would be 12 years old. Your mom would be 50 years old.

Let's add up these ages:
17 + 14 + 12 + 50 = 93 (this is not 87)

If your brother is 16 years old, then you are 13 years old. Your sister would be 11 years old. Your mom would be 47 years old.

Let's add up these ages:
16 + 13 + 11 + 47 = 87 (this works)

However, we can also try 20 for your brother's age again, but this time, let's try 35 for your mom's age.

If your brother is 20 years old, then you are 17 years old. Your sister would be 15 years old. Your mom would be 59 years old.

Let's add up these ages:
20 + 17 + 15 + 59 = 111 (this is not 87)

However, if your mom is 35 years old, then 3B - 1 = 35. 
3B = 36
B = 12

If your brother is 12 years old, then you are 9 years old. Your sister would be 7 years old.

Let's add up these ages:
12 + 9 + 7 + 35 = 63 (this is not 87)

However, if your brother is 20 years old, then 3B - 1 = 59. 
3B = 60
B = 20

However, if your mom is 35 years old, then 3B - 1 = 35. 
3B = 36
B = 12

If your brother is 12 years old, then you are 9 years old. Your sister would be 7 years old.

"To figure out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to find out how many glue sticks he needs in total. There are 27 students in his class, and each student needs 2 glue sticks. So, we multiply 27 by 2 to get the total number of glue sticks needed: 27 * 2 = 54.

The glue sticks come in packs of 8, so we need to divide 54 by 8 to find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs. When we do the division, we get 6.75. But, we can't buy a fraction of a pack, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Since we can't buy 0.75 of a pack, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to make sure every student gets 2 glue sticks.

"So, we're trying to figure out how much water is passing through the river after a couple of days. 

First, we know that there are 4000 gallons of water passing through the river. Then, after a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. That means we need to multiply 4000 by 2, which is 8000 gallons.

Now, on the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons. To find the total amount of water, we need to add 8000 and 6000. 

8000 + 6000 = 14000

"To figure out how many people are infected after three days, we need to break it down day by day.

On the first day, 10 people are already infected. Each of them infects 6 others, so that's 10 x 6 = 60 new infections. Now, we add those to the original 10, so 10 + 60 = 70 people are infected after the first day.

On the second day, those 70 people infect 6 others each, so that's 70 x 6 = 420 new infections. We add those to the 70 already infected, so 70 + 420 = 490 people are infected after the second day.

On the third day, those 490 people infect 6 others each, so that's 490 x 6 = 2940 new infections. We add those to the 490 already infected, so 490 + 2940 = 3430 people are infected after the third day.

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer has left, we need to figure out how many she gave away and subtract that from the total.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. She also gave 3 oranges to her son. So, in total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the oranges she gave away from the total oranges she bought: 12 - 9 = 3.

Jennifer has 3 oranges left."
"To figure out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we need to know how many badges each of them earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month, so in a year, she earns 12 badges. Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. That means Amber earns 6 badges in a year.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Now, let's see how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber. We subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To figure out how much money Paige raised, we need to know how many slices of banana bread she sold and how much each slice cost.

Paige baked for 5 hours, from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. She can bake 2 loaves of banana bread per hour, so she baked 5 * 2 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she had 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice costs 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find out how much money she raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to figure out how many silver coins she had. We know there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if she had 70 gold coins, we can subtract 30 from that to find the number of silver coins.

Number of silver coins = 70 - 30
= 40

Now, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins to find the total.

Total number of coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver)

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to figure out how many of the other colored cars there are. 

First, we know there are 12 red cars. The problem says there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars. So, to find the number of green cars, we subtract 2 from 12. That's 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

Next, it says there are 3 times as many blue cars as green cars. To find the number of blue cars, we multiply the number of green cars by 3. That's 10 * 3 = 30 blue cars.

Now, let's add up the number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

The problem says there are 75 cars in total. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of other cars from the total. That's 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have a total of 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's say Fawn has x books. Then, Anne has x - 12 books, and Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 books.

We can write an equation to represent the total number of books:
x + (x - 12) + (x - 12 + 25) = 85

Combine like terms:
x + x - 12 + x - 12 + 25 = 85
3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3x = 84

Divide by 3:
x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To figure out how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to do a few calculations. First, we need to find out how many jello cups he needs. Since there are 30 kids and each kid gets 4 jello cups, we multiply 30 by 4.

30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Now, we know that one box of jello makes 10 jello cups. So, to find out how many boxes Greg needs, we divide 120 jello cups by 10 jello cups per box.

120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Finally, we need to find out how much 12 boxes of jello will cost. Since each box costs $1.25, we multiply 12 boxes by $1.25.

12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

"To find out how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate how many pieces he ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To do this, we multiply 60 by 2 and then divide by 5. 
60 * 2 = 120, and 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To do this, we multiply 26 by 7 and then divide by 13. 
26 * 7 = 182, and 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add the pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to figure out how much one bottle of each costs.

Seven bottles of soda cost $21.00, so we divide $21.00 by 7 to get the cost of one bottle of soda. That's $3.00 per bottle.

Four bottles of water cost $8.00, so we divide $8.00 by 4 to get the cost of one bottle of water. That's $2.00 per bottle.

Now, we multiply the cost of one bottle of soda by 3, since David wants 3 bottles. That's $3.00 x 3 = $9.00. We multiply the cost of one bottle of water by 2, since David wants 2 bottles. That's $2.00 x 2 = $4.00.

Finally, we add the cost of the soda and the water to get the total cost. That's $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

Now, Paul has 80 marbles. But then, he lost 1/4 of them. To find 1/4 of 80, we can divide 80 by 4:
80 ÷ 4 = 20

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many he has left, we subtract 20 from 80:
80 - 20 = 60

Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find out how many points Amy scores, we need to figure out how many questions she gets right in each type.

For the multiple-choice questions, there are 10 questions and she gets 80% of them right. To find 80% of 10, we multiply 10 by 0.8, which is 8. So she gets 8 multiple-choice questions right. Since each one is worth 1 point, she gets 8 points.

For the true/false questions, there are 20 questions and she gets 90% of them right. To find 90% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.9, which is 18. So she gets 18 true/false questions right. Since each one is worth 1 point, she gets 18 points.

For the long-answer questions, there are 5 questions and she gets 60% of them right. To find 60% of 5, we multiply 5 by 0.6, which is 3. So she gets 3 long-answer questions right. Since each one is worth 5 points, she gets 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, let's add up all her points: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41.

"To find out how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to figure out how many chickens he's selling and how much money he'll make from selling them.

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. To find out how many chickens that is, we multiply 300 by 3/5. 
3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

He's selling each chicken for $50, so to find the total amount of money he'll make, we multiply 180 chickens by $50.
180 * $50 = $9000

We know he wants to make a profit of $2000, so to find out how much he paid for the chickens, we subtract $2000 from $9000.
$9000 - $2000 = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to subtract the number of glasses Julie sold from the total number of glasses sold. Then we divide the result by 2, because Micah and Mitchell sold the same number of glasses.

Total glasses sold = 32
Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by the boys = 32 - 14 = 18
Since Micah and Mitchell sold the same number of glasses, we divide 18 by 2 to find out how many glasses Micah sold.
Glasses sold by Micah = 18 / 2 = 9

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

"To find out how much Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of her manicure and pedicure.

First, let's find the cost of the manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, we multiply $400 by 1/4. 

$400 * 1/4 = $400 / 4 = $100

So, the manicure cost $100. Now, let's find the cost of the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure. We multiply $100 by 3/4.

$100 * 3/4 = $100 * 3 / 4 = $300 / 4 = $75

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to figure out how much she makes from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate how much money Sarah gets from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend is buying it for $2 per meter. So, we multiply 20 meters by $2 per meter, which is 20 * $2 = $40.

Next, we need to find out how much the new rope costs. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and Sarah is buying a rope that's also 20 meters long. So, we multiply 20 meters by $1.5 per meter, which is 20 * $1.5 = $30.

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah made from selling the rope. That's $40 - $30 = $10.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left, we need to add up the cost of all the items in her cart and then subtract that from her budget.

First, let's start with the bacon. 5 packs of bacon cost $10. 

Next, we have the chicken. Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since 5 packs of bacon cost $10, 1 pack of bacon costs $2. So, 1 pack of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, so that's $4 * 6 = $24.

Now, let's look at the strawberries. Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4. So, that's $4 * 3 = $12.

Finally, we have the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so that's $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:
$10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60

Kelly's budget is $65, so she has:

20% is the same as 0.2, so we multiply 0.2 by 50. 
0.2 * 50 = 10

So, 10 microphones didn't fit. Now, we subtract 10 from the total number of microphones to find out how many were left.

"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we need to first figure out how many plants are flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants. So, 1/4 of 100 is 25. That means there are 25 indoor plants.

Now, we subtract the indoor plants from the total to find out how many plants are left. 100 - 25 = 75.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, 2/3 of 75 is 50. That means there are 50 outdoor plants.

Now, we subtract the outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find out how many flowering plants there are. 75 - 50 = 25.

So, there are 25 flowering plants. To find the percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, that's probably for one time. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times, which would be 3 * $6 = $18.

The next week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once for $6, she mowed Alba's lawn five times, which would be 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's add up the money she made from mowing lawns: $6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) + $30 (Alba) = $54.

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed, we need to figure out how far Anis rowed. We know Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

To find 1/5 of 50 miles, we multiply 50 by 1/5. This is the same as dividing 50 by 5, which is 10 miles. So Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. 

Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles. 

Now, we add the distance Dijana rowed and the distance Anis rowed to get the total distance. 
Total distance = 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles.

"To figure out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the material needed for the small masks and the large masks separately.

First, let's look at the small masks. Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. We need to find out how many groups of 4 small masks are in 20 small masks. We can do this by dividing 20 by 4, which is 5. This means we need 5 groups of 2 yards of material, which is 5 x 2 = 10 yards.

Next, let's look at the large masks. Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. We need to find out how many groups of 3 large masks are in 8 large masks. We can do this by dividing 8 by 3, which is 2.67. This means we need 2.67 groups of 2.25 yards of material. To find the total yards, we multiply 2.67 by 2.25, which is 6 yards.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to figure out how many tickets she bought and then divide the total amount she spent by that number.

Deepa saw 9 movies, and she saw each one 3 times. So, she saw a total of 9 x 3 = 27 movies. Since she saw each movie in the theatre, that means she bought 27 tickets.

We know she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

"To figure out how much free time Harold has, we need to know how many hours are in a day and how many hours he spends doing other things.

There are 24 hours in a day. Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works for 8 hours (because he works 2 hours less than he sleeps), and walks his dog for 1 hour.

So, let's add up the hours he spends doing other things: 10 hours (sleep) + 8 hours (work) + 1 hour (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours he spends doing other things from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"To find out how many shoe boxes are left, we need to figure out how many Tim used. He used 3 blue shoe boxes. For the red shoe boxes, he used 1/3 of them. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes, we can find 1/3 of 9 by dividing 9 by 3, which is 3.

So, he used 3 blue and 3 red shoe boxes. Now, let's subtract the ones he used from the total number of each color. 

Blue shoe boxes left: 7 (total) - 3 (used) = 4
Red shoe boxes left: 9 (total) - 3 (used) = 6

Now, we add the number of blue and red shoe boxes left to find the total number of shoe boxes left: 4 + 6 = 10

"To find out how many books Joseph has, we need to figure out how many books he had before he lost some. Since Joseph had twice as many books as Sarah, and Sarah has 9 books, we multiply 9 by 2. 

9 * 2 = 18

So Joseph had 18 books before he lost 2. Now, we subtract 2 from 18 to find out how many books he has left.

18 - 2 = 16

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to figure out how many he gave away. 

First, let's calculate the marbles he gave to Jamie. Since Dean gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie, we need to find 1/5 of 30. To do this, we can divide 30 by 5, which equals 6. So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, we know Dean gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

Now, let's add the marbles he gave away: 6 (to Jamie) + 10 (to Donald) = 16 marbles.

Finally, we subtract the marbles he gave away from the total: 30 - 16 = 14.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out Adam's current age first. We know that Duncan is 60 years old now. Eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

We are also told that eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. Let's think about this: if Adam is A years old now, then four years ago, he was A - 4 years old.

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can set up an equation:

52 = 2(A - 4)

To solve for A, we need to get rid of the 2 that's being multiplied by (A - 4). We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

52 / 2 = (2(A - 4)) / 2
26 = A - 4

Now, we need to get A by itself. We can do this by adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

26 + 4 = A - 4 + 4
30 = A

So, Adam is 30 years old now. To find out how old he'll be in 8 years, we just need to add 8 to his current age:

30 + 8 = 38

"To find the total number of acres, we need to figure out how big Farmer Smith's farm is. We know it's 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 

So, we multiply 200 by 2 to get 400. Then we add 100 to get 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, we add the two farms together: 200 acres (Farmer Brown) + 500 acres (Farmer Smith) = 700 acres.

"To find out how much Colby earns in a day, we need to figure out how many packages he makes in a day and multiply that by how much he gets paid per package.

Colby makes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, he makes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works 8 hours a day, we multiply 40 packages per hour by 8 hours. That's 40 * 8 = 320 packages per day.

Colby gets paid $0.20 per package. To find out how much he makes in a day, we multiply 320 packages by $0.20. That's 320 * 0.20 = $64.

"To figure this out, we need to know how long it takes John to do an extreme sudoku puzzle. We know a normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and an extreme one takes 4 times that long. 

So, we multiply 45 minutes by 4 to get the time for the extreme sudoku: 
45 * 4 = 180 minutes

Now, we know John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is 30 minutes. To find out how many bottles he drinks, we divide the total time by 30 minutes:
180 minutes / 30 minutes = 6

John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving the extreme sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many yellow balloons Benny had. We know he threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. We also know he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna and that 20 of the balloons were red.

First, let's find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons. Since there were 20 red balloons and 2 pieces of bologna were thrown at each one, we multiply 20 x 2 = 40. This means 40 pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, so we subtract the 40 pieces thrown at the red balloons: 58 - 40 = 18. This means 18 pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we divide 18 by 3 to find the number of yellow balloons: 18 / 3 = 6.

"To figure out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to know how many miles he drives in a month. Since he drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, we multiply 100 miles by 30 days.

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, we know Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs, we divide the total miles he drove (3000 miles) by the miles required for a tune-up (1000 miles).

3000 miles / 1000 miles = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups."
"To find out how many hours Bruce works in total, we need to figure out how many hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours. That's a given.

On Wednesday, he works twice as long as he did on Tuesday. So, we multiply 5 hours by 2, which is 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than he did on Wednesday. So, we subtract 2 from 10, which is 8 hours.

Now, let's add up all the hours: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

"To figure out how much money Julia and Nadine's mom gave each of them, we need to add up the cost of everything they bought. 

First, they bought a cake for $11. Then, they bought a dozen balloons. Since a dozen is 12, and the balloons were sold 2 for $0.5, we need to divide 12 by 2 to get 6. Then, we multiply 6 by $0.5 to get $3. 

Next, they bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. So, 2 * $7 is $14. 

Now, we add up the cost of everything: $11 + $3 + $14 = $28. This is the total amount of money they had. 

Since they combined their allowance, we need to divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each of them got. $28 / 2 = $14.

"To find out how much money the class raised, we need to figure out how much they made from selling lollipops and then subtract how much they spent on buying the lollipops.

First, let's find out how many lollipops they sold. There are 30 students, and each student sold 10 lollipops on average. So, they sold 30 x 10 = 300 lollipops.

Each lollipop was sold for $0.8, so the total amount of money they made is 300 x $0.8 = $240.

Now, let's find out how much they spent on buying the lollipops. They bought 300 lollipops for $0.5 each, so they spent 300 x $0.5 = $150.

To find the profit, we subtract the amount they spent from the amount they made: $240 - $150 = $90.

"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to figure out how many of each type of pet he has.

First, Larry has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Larry also has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.

Lastly, he has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. To find 1/3 of 21, we can divide 21 by 3, which is 7.

Now, let's add up all the pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

Together, they eat 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices a day. Now, we need to divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the number of slices they eat in a day (6).

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find out how many shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to figure out how many months she's been collecting them. She started collecting shells when she was 5 years old, and she's been collecting one shell every month.

There are 12 months in a year, so from 5 years old to 10 years old is 5 years. We multiply 5 years by 12 months to get the total number of months: 5 x 12 = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, she will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to figure out how many cups Lana used for mint and chamomile tea. We know she had 27 cups and used 15 for cinnamon tea. So, we subtract 15 from 27 to get the number of cups used for mint and chamomile tea: 27 - 15 = 12 cups.

Since Lana put the cups into 3 rows, we divide 12 by 3 to find out how many cups are in each row: 12 / 3 = 4 cups. But we know that in each row, there's an equal amount of mint and chamomile tea. So, we divide 4 by 2 to find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row: 4 / 2 = 2 cups.

"To figure this out, we need to know how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since each trip takes 4 hours, we can divide 8 hours by 4 hours to find the number of trips.

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Now, we know the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. If he makes 2 trips, we can divide the total number of berries by the number of trips to find out how many berries he needs to pick up per trip.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

So, the sloth needs to pick up at least 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many gallons of water will be left in the tank after 6 days, we need to do a few steps. 

First, we need to know how much water is in the tank. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool. The pool has 10000 gallons of water. So, half of that is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water in the tank.

Next, we need to know how much water is used from the tank each day. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day. So, in 6 days, 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons of water will be used.

Now, we need to subtract the amount of water used from the amount of water in the tank. 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons of water.

"To figure out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he's already spent. 

He saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and those tickets cost $10 each. So, that's 5 x $10 = $50. 
He saw 8 movies on other days, and those tickets cost $7 each. So, that's 8 x $7 = $56. 
He had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each one costs $8. So, that's 2 x $8 = $16. 
He had 4 boxes of candy, and each one costs $2. So, that's 4 x $2 = $8.

Now, let's add up all the money he spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

Colby's parents gave him $150, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Tonight, he wants to get a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2). So, he'll have $20 - $8 - $2 = $10 left for a movie ticket.

Since it's a Friday, the movie ticket costs $10, which is exactly what he has left. So, he can see 1 more movie.

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to figure out how many calories are in each mini pastry. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one, we need to divide 600 by 3. 600 / 3 = 200 calories. So, a mini cinnamon roll has 200 calories. Andrew made 200 of these, so we multiply 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so we divide 450 by 3. 450 / 3 = 150 calories. Andrew made 300 of these, so we multiply 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Now, we add the calories from the cinnamon rolls and the blueberry muffins. 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to us. We know that Peter, Paul, and John's ages add up to 100 years. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than John, and that Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages.

Let's start by using the information that Paul is 10 years older than John. If John's age is J, then Paul's age is J + 10.

We also know that Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages. So, Peter's age is J + (J + 10).

Now, we can write an equation using the fact that the sum of their ages is 100:

J + (J + 10) + (J + 10) = 100

Combine like terms:

3J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3J = 80

Divide by 3:

J = 20 (John's age is 20)

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age:

Paul's age = J + 10
= 20 + 10
= 30

Now that we know Paul and John's ages, we can find Peter's age:

Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age
= 30 + 20
= 50

They also have 10 boxes already, so we add those to the total. 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Now, we know they can fit 2 boxes on each table. To find out how many tables they need, we divide the total number of boxes by 2. 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

First, let's find out how many widgets each machine can make in a day. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets a day. The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets a day.

Now, let's find out how many widgets each machine can make in a month. There are 30 days in a month. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets a month. The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets a month.

Each widget sells for $6. So, the Widgeteer 3000 will make 43200 * 6 = $259200 a month. The WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32400 * 6 = $194400 a month.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we need to subtract the amount of money she'll make from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the amount of money she'll make from the Widgeteer 3000. That's $259200 - $194400 = $64800.

So, 5 hours x 70 pesos per hour is 350 pesos. Adding this to the 1000 pesos, we get 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's see how much Cameron would save if he chooses the second option. To do this, we subtract the cost of the second option from the cost of the first option: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that is 5 x 2 = 10 pounds. Then, we subtract 3 pounds: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. So, each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

For the goats: 15 goats x 5 pounds = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep x 7 pounds = 84 pounds

Now, we add the labor cost to the visit charge and the cost of parts, which is $60.

Total charge = Visit charge + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60
Total charge = $205

"So James bought 10 CDs for $15 each. That's a total of 10 x $15 = $150. But he got them for 40% off, which means he only paid 60% of the price. To find 60% of $150, I multiply $150 by 0.6, which is $90.

Then, James sold 5 of the CDs for $40. To find out how much money he was out, I subtract the $40 he got back from the $90 he paid. That's $90 - $40 = $50.

"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of root crop and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the yams. Jen has 6 yams and each yam costs $1.5. So, 6 * $1.5 = $9.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potatoes. Jen has 10 sweet potatoes and each sweet potato costs $2. So, 10 * $2 = $20.

Lastly, let's calculate the cost of the carrots. Jen has 4 carrots and each carrot costs $1.25. So, 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the costs together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break it down into three parts: the time he swam the first part, the time he rested, and the time he swam the last part.

First, James swam 60% of the 20-mile lake. To find 60% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.6, which is 12 miles. James swims at 2 miles per hour, so to find the time it took him to swim 12 miles, we divide 12 by 2, which is 6 hours.

Next, James rested for half as long as he swam the first part. Half of 6 hours is 3 hours.

Now, James has to swim the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. But this time, he swims at half his original speed, which is 1 mile per hour. To find the time it took him to swim 8 miles at this speed, we divide 8 by 1, which is 8 hours.

To find the total time, we add the time he swam the first part, the time he rested, and the time he swam the last part: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to follow the information given in the problem. 

First, we know Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had. 

So, we need to multiply 70 by 7. 
7 * 70 = 490

Now, we subtract 40 from that number. 
490 - 40 = 450

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has, we need to do a little math. 

First, she got 15 stickers for participating in class. Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. So, we subtract 7 from 15, which is 15 - 7 = 8. 

After that, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. So, we add 5 to 8, which is 8 + 5 = 13.

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end."
"To find out how much commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper and then add them together.

First, let's find the commission from the New York Times. Cayley sold 6 copies, and each copy costs $5. So, the total amount of money from the New York Times is 6 * $5 = $30. Cayley gets a 10% commission, which means he gets 10% of $30. To find 10% of $30, we multiply $30 by 0.10, which is $3.

Next, let's find the commission from the Wall Street Journal. Cayley sold 10 copies, and each copy costs $15. So, the total amount of money from the Wall Street Journal is 10 * $15 = $150. Cayley gets an 8% commission, which means he gets 8% of $150. To find 8% of $150, we multiply $150 by 0.08, which is $12.

Now, let's add the commission from both newspapers: $3 + $12 = $15.

"To find Leo's age, we need to figure out how old Marcus is first. We know Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is 5 years younger than her. So, we subtract 5 from 26 to get Marcus' age: 26 - 5 = 21.

Now, we know Marcus is half of Leo's age. This means Leo's age is twice Marcus' age. To find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus' age by 2: 21 * 2 = 42.

"Let's break down the problem. We know Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. 

Let's say Azibo scored x points. Then Bahati scored x + 20 points, and Dinar scored (x + 20) - 10 = x + 10 points.

We also know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can write an equation: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms to get 3x + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides to get 3x = 15.

Divide both sides by 3 to get x = 5.

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to figure out how many pages are in one inch of the book. Since each paper has two pages (one on each side), and there are 100 papers in one inch, we multiply 100 by 2.

100 papers/inch * 2 pages/paper = 200 pages/inch

Now, we know the book is 1.5 inches thick. To find the total number of pages, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book.

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to figure out how many 15-minute periods are in 15 hours. 

First, we need to convert 15 hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Now, we need to divide 900 minutes by 15 minutes to find out how many 15-minute periods are in 900 minutes. 900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 periods.

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply 60 periods by 30 reports. 60 * 30 = 1800 reports.

1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept, we need to figure out how many minutes she would have slept if she hadn't gotten up early and if she hadn't sleepwalked. 

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. That's 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 8 hours is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

But she woke up 5 minutes early, so we subtract those 5 minutes: 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

She also got up and sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m. To find out how many minutes that is, we can subtract the start time from the end time. 2:38 - 2:15 is 23 minutes. We subtract those 23 minutes from the total: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept 452 minutes on her bed that day.

"To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has left, we need to figure out how many measuring spoons and cups he has.

Jonathan has 2 dozen cups. A dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Now, let's find out how many measuring spoons he has. It says he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as cups. To find 2/3 of 24, we can multiply 24 by 2 and then divide by 3. So, (24 x 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16. Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

But then he gives 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. So, he has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

Now, we add the number of cups and measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has left: 24 cups + 10 measuring spoons = 34.

"To find the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to do some math.

First, we know the hospital has 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. To find 1/5 of 1000, we can divide 1000 by 5. 
1000 ÷ 5 = 200

So, 200 beds are occupied. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract 200 from 1000.
1000 - 200 = 800

Now, we know 50 patients are admitted each day. We need to find out how many patients are admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days.
50 patients are admitted each day, so in 14 days, 50 * 14 = 700 patients are admitted.

Now, we add the patients already in the hospital (200) to the new patients (700). 
200 + 700 = 900

So, 900 beds are occupied. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract 900 from 1000.
1000 - 900 = 100

"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of those, 7 are work emails. So, the non-work emails would be 16 - 7 = 9.

Now, we know that 2/3 of the non-work emails are to her family. To find 2/3 of 9, we can multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3. That's (9 * 2) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6.

So, 6 emails are to her family. That means the remaining emails are 9 - 6 = 3.

Out of these 3 emails, 1/3 are to her boyfriend. To find 1/3 of 3, we can divide 3 by 3. That's 3 / 3 = 1.

"To find Shawna's father's age, we need to figure out how old Shawna is first. We know Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. So, Shawna's age is 3 x 3 = 9 years.

Now, we know Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. To find his age, we multiply Shawna's age by 5. Shawna's father's age is 5 x 9 = 45 years.

"To figure out how many people really attended the concert, we need to find out how many people Courtney overcounted by. Since Kelly said Courtney made a mistake of 20%, we need to find 20% of 48.

20% is the same as 0.20. So, we multiply 48 by 0.20 to get 9.6. This means Courtney overcounted by 9.6 people.

Now, we subtract 9.6 from the number Courtney said, which is 48. So, 48 - 9.6 = 38.4. Since you can't have a part of a person, we round down to 38.

The final answer is: 38"
"So, we know Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, that means Jordan carried 2 x 2 = 4 balls.

Now, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. To find out how many balls Jeffrey carried, we need to divide Jason's balls by 2. So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

To find the total number of balls, we add up the balls each boy carried: 4 (Jordan) + 2 (Jason) + 1 (Jeffrey) = 7.

Total number of balls: 7"
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to figure out how many holes they had before that day and how many they had after.

On the first day, they dug 10 holes. On the second day, they dug 13 more holes, so now they have 10 + 13 = 23 holes. On the third day, they dug 8 more holes, but then they filled in 2 holes, so now they have 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

The problem says that by the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. Since they had 10 holes at the end of the first day, four times that is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

So, on the fourth day, they must have dug 40 - 29 = 11 holes before finding the treasure.

"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to figure out how many Collins got and add that to what Amora and Lainey got. 

We know Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips. Collins got 15 more than them, so Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we add up the corn chips each person got:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to us. Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'x' Pokémon. 

Since Stan caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, we can write an equation for Stan's Pokémon: 4x - 13.

Alex caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex's Pokémon is (4x - 13) + 5.

We know that together they caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation:
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon Stan caught:
Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 147

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to figure out how far the bird traveled in each direction.

First, the bird flew south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles.

Then, the bird flew north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. We multiply the speed by the time: 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

Finally, the bird flew south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. We multiply the speed by the time: 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, we need to find the total distance between the two homes. Since the bird flew north for a while, we need to subtract that distance from the total distance south. So, we add the two south distances and subtract the north distance: 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

Next, we have the racquets that need polyester string. It takes Andy 22 minutes to string each one, and there are 5 of them. So, 5 x 22 = 110 minutes.

Finally, we have the racquets that need hybrid sets. It takes Andy 18 minutes to string each one, and there are 4 of them. So, 4 x 18 = 72 minutes.

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to figure out how long the fence is going to be. Since it's a rectangle, we need to find the perimeter. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the shape.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet.

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

This means the fence will be 50 feet long. Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total slats = 2 * 50
Total slats = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to figure out how many oranges she had at first. She bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box has 20 oranges. So, we multiply 12 boxes by 20 oranges per box to get the total number of oranges:
12 * 20 = 240 oranges

Then, she gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, which is 4 boxes total. Since each box has 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, we subtract the oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges:
240 - 80 = 160 oranges

Next, she kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges. To find 1/4 of 160, we can divide 160 by 4:
160 ÷ 4 = 40 oranges

So, she kept 40 oranges and sold the rest. To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the oranges she kept from the remaining oranges:

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to figure out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

In total, Sunny sold 10 + 15 = 25 boxes of gingerbread.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

In total, Sunny sold 11 + 15 = 26 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we multiply the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie by their costs. Gingerbread costs $6 per box, and apple pie costs $15 per box.

25 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $150
26 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $390

Adding these amounts together, we get the total amount Sunny earned:

But we want to know how old his dad is now, so we need to subtract 5 years from 48, because 5 years will pass before Emil turns 24. So, his dad is 48 - 5 = 43 years old now.

Now, let's think about Emil's brother. When Emil turns 24, he'll be twice as old as his brother. This means when Emil is 24, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

111 x 12 = 1332 inches

Each plant takes up 12 inches, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space each plant takes up is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space each plant takes up.

1332 ÷ 30 = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants. But Pat already has 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

44 - 17 = 27 flowers

Each flower costs $6, so Pat will spend:

27 x $6 = $162

"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to figure out how many he eats in a day first. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we need to divide the number of pretzels Edgar eats by 2. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. Half of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9. So, Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day.

Now, we need to find out how many pretzels he eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7.
9 * 7 = 63

"To find out how much Katherine will spend, we need to figure out the cost of the flowers and vines for all 5 baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost of the petunias. Each basket needs 3 petunias, and there are 5 baskets. So, 3 x 5 = 15 petunias. Each petunia costs $3.00, so 15 x $3.00 = $45.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines. Each basket needs 2 vines, and there are 5 baskets. So, 2 x 5 = 10 vines. Each vine costs $2.50, so 10 x $2.50 = $25.00.

Now, we add the cost of the petunias and the vines to get the total cost. $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

$70.00"
"To figure out how many roses Artemis and her dad can plant, we need to know how much soil they have left after planting the sunflowers and carnations.

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they're planting 4 sunflowers. So, the sunflowers will need 4 x 3 = 12 pounds of soil.

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they're planting 10 carnations. So, the carnations will need 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.

Now, we add the soil needed for the sunflowers and carnations: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

They started with 30 pounds of soil, so we subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations: 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

"To figure out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to know how much money she sets aside each month for shoes. She makes $2,000 a month and puts 25% of that away. To find 25% of $2,000, we multiply $2,000 by 0.25.

$2,000 * 0.25 = $500

So, Jessica sets aside $500 each month for shoes. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply $500 by 12 to find out how much she'll have in a year.

$500 * 12 = $6,000

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000. To find out how many shoes she can buy, we divide $6,000 by $1,000.

$6,000 / $1,000 = 6

"To figure out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's look at peeling. Emily can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute. To find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we need to divide 90 by 6. 90 ÷ 6 = 15 minutes. So, it takes Emily 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp.

Next, let's look at cooking. Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp, we need to figure out how many groups of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp. 90 ÷ 30 = 3. Since it takes her 10 minutes to cook 30 shrimp, it will take her 3 x 10 = 30 minutes to cook 90 shrimp.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp (15 minutes) and the time it takes to cook the shrimp (30 minutes). 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.

"To find out how many degrees lower the final temperature was, we need to figure out how much the room cooled down and how much it warmed up.

First, the air conditioner was on low for 3 hours. It cools 2 degrees per hour, so it cooled 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours. It cools 3 degrees per hour, so it cooled 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

So, the total cooling was 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After that, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours. The room warms up 2 degrees per hour, so it warmed up 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

Now, we need to find the net change. The room cooled 18 degrees, but then it warmed up 4 degrees. So, the net change is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to figure out how old he was when he saw it for the second time. We know Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet. Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times as old as his dad was when he saw it. So, Bill was 3 x 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since the comet comes around every 75 years, we need to subtract 75 from 90 to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. 

90 - 75 = 15

"Buford writes checks for different bills every month and year. Let's break it down:

He writes a check for the electric bill every month, so that's 12 checks a year. He also writes a check for the gas bill every month, which is another 12 checks a year. 

He writes a check to the church twice a month, so that's 2 checks a month. Since there are 12 months in a year, that's 2 * 12 = 24 checks a year.

Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service every quarter. There are 4 quarters in a year, so that's 4 checks a year.

Now, let's add up all the checks: 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many flights the first plane makes in a day. We know the second plane makes 44 trips, but that's only half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, if we multiply 44 by 2, we get the number of trips the first plane makes: 44 * 2 = 88.

Now, we know the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. To find out how many flights that is, we multiply 88 by 3/4. To do that, we can multiply 88 by 3 and then divide by 4: 88 * 3 = 264, and 264 / 4 = 66. So, the first plane goes to Greece 66 times.

That means the first plane goes to other places 88 - 66 = 22 times. We know those 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find out how many flights go to France, we divide 22 by 2: 22 / 2 = 11.

"To find the total time the three wolves howl, we need to know how long each wolf howls. 

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of the three wolves' howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide 120 by 60 to get the total time in minutes: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Now, let's add the money Adam got from his mom and dad: $6 + $12 = $18.

The trousers cost $30. To find out how much Adam had to use from his savings, we subtract the money he got from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

"To find Wilfred's age, we need to figure out the ages of the other kids first. We know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. We also know that the total age of all four kids is 20.

Let's start by adding the ages of Akbar and Alessandro: 
3 (Akbar's age) + 4 (Alessandro's age) = 7

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. To find the average age, we divide the total age by the number of kids: 
20 (total age) / 4 (number of kids) = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we multiply the average age by 2: 
2 * 5 = 10

So, Helene is 10 years old. Now, let's add up the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene: 
3 (Akbar's age) + 4 (Alessandro's age) + 10 (Helene's age) = 17

To find Wilfred's age, we subtract the total age of the other three kids from the total age: 
20 (total age) - 17 (total age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene) = 3

Walter's friend gave him $200, but that's not part of the amount the lawyer is matching.

The lawyer said he would give three times as much as the neighbors and the online fund. So, we multiply $2000 by 3.

100 * 15 = 1500 cookies

The bride gave half of the cookies to the church, so we need to find half of 1500.

1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Now we know the church got 750 cookies. Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we divide 750 by 15.

750 / 15 = 50

"To find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to figure out how many slices the kids and adults get in total. 

Let's say each kid gets one slice. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can think of it as two kid slices. 

There are 4 kids, so they get 4 slices. There are 2 adults, so they get 2 x 2 = 4 slices (since each adult gets 2 kid slices). 

In total, there are 4 kid slices + 4 adult slices = 8 slices.

Now, each adult gets 2 slices, so to find the percentage, we divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (2 slices / 8 slices) * 100
= (1/4) * 100
= 25%

"To figure out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate how much time he spends on other things.

First, he has to check on 9 inpatients. It takes 20 minutes per inpatient, so that's 9 x 20 = 180 minutes. Then, he has 10 appointments that take 30 minutes each, so that's 10 x 30 = 300 minutes. 

Now, we add those two times together: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 480 by 60 to get the total hours: 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

Doctor Jones is at the clinic for 9 hours, so we subtract the time he spends on other things from that: 9 - 8 = 1.

Now, we know that 8 boxes have 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in one box, we need to divide 64 by 8.

64 ÷ 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many chocolate bars Peter and Martha have in each box. 

First, let's start with Peter. He has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and he has a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars he has in each box, we need to divide 64 by 4.

"To find out how many porcupines will be in the park after a year, we need to do some math.

First, we need to find out how many female porcupines there are. We know that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. So, we multiply 50 (the total population) by 3/5.

Number of female porcupines = 50 * 3/5 = 30

Now, we know that each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, in one month, the total number of babies born is:

Number of babies per month = 30 * 4 = 120

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of babies per month by 12 to find the total number of babies born in a year:

Number of babies per year = 120 * 12 = 1440

Finally, we add the initial population (50) to the number of babies born in a year (1440) to find the total number of porcupines after a year:

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"To solve this problem, let's start by using the information that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. If we say the number of large stuffed animals is L, then the number of small stuffed animals is 2L.

We also know that each small stuffed animal costs $4. Since the large stuffed animals cost three times as much as the small ones, they cost $4 * 3 = $12.

Now, let's think about how much money Teresa made from selling the large and small stuffed animals. She made 12L dollars from the large ones and 4 * 2L = 8L dollars from the small ones. 

Since she made a total of $120, we can set up an equation: 12L + 8L = 120.

Combine the L terms: 20L = 120.

Now, divide both sides by 20: L = 6.

Since the number of small stuffed animals is 2L, we multiply 6 by 2: 2 * 6 = 12.

The number of small stuffed animals sold is 12."
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in a week, we need to know how many they eat in a day and then multiply that by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches a day, the wife eats 4, and the son eats 2. So, if we add those together, we get 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 11 by 7. That's 11 x 7 = 77.

"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate how much she made from selling cookies and cupcakes, then subtract the money she gave to her sisters.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so she made 80 x $1 = $80 from cookies. She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so she made 60 x $4 = $240 from cupcakes. 

Now, let's add the money she made from cookies and cupcakes: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away 2 x $10 = $20.

Finally, let's subtract the money she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

"To find out how many eggs the friends found, we need to figure out how many eggs were left after the Smith twins found theirs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

Now, we know that 10 eggs were not found by anyone. So, we need to subtract the eggs found by the Smith twins and the 10 eggs that were not found from the total number of eggs.

Let's do the math: 100 (total eggs) - 60 (eggs found by the Smith twins) - 10 (eggs not found) = 30

"To find out how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to do some math.

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. If he uses an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

Now, if he uses a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. To find 50% of 24, we multiply 24 by 0.5, which is 12. Then we add 12 to 24, which is 36 pounds per day.

Since there are 40 dwarves, we multiply 36 by 40, which is 1440 pounds per day. Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30, which is 43,200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to figure out how much one sandwich costs. 

Let's look at the first package: 2 sandwiches for $3. If we divide $3 by 2, we get $1.50 per sandwich.

Now, let's check the second package: 4 sandwiches for $6. If we divide $6 by 4, we also get $1.50 per sandwich.

Since both packages have the same price per sandwich, we can use this to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. If one sandwich costs $1.50, then 8 sandwiches will cost $1.50 * 8 = $12.

"Tom bought a new bedroom set for $3000. He sold his old bedroom set for $1000, so he used that money to help pay for the new one. Now, he has to pay 10% of what's left each month.

First, let's figure out how much he still owes. He paid $1000, so we subtract that from the total cost: $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Now, we need to find 10% of $2000. To do that, we multiply $2000 by 0.10 (because 10% is the same as 0.10). 

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 each month.

"To find out how many balloons Sally had when she went into school, we need to figure out what happened to each color of balloons.

First, Sally had 25 red balloons, but 40% of them popped. To find 40% of 25, we multiply 25 by 0.4, which is 10. So, she lost 10 red balloons. Now she has 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

The green balloons weren't affected, so she still has 7 green balloons.

Next, Sally let go of half of her 12 yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she let go of 6 yellow balloons. Now she has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons in a tree and took 75% of them. To find 75% of 8, we multiply 8 by 0.75, which is 6. So, she took 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up all the balloons she has: 
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"To figure out the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to think about all the ways he might not have to turn it in.

First, there's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. That's one way he won't have to turn it in.

If the regular teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. Since there's a 50% chance the regular teacher will come in, we multiply 50% by 40% to get 20%. That's another way he won't have to turn it in.

If the regular teacher comes in and doesn't give everyone an extension (that's 50% * 60% = 30%), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his homework and get a personal extension. So, we multiply 50% * 60% * 20% to get 6%. That's another way he won't have to turn it in.

Now, let's add up all the ways he won't have to turn it in: 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%. That means there's a 76% chance he won't have to turn it in.

To find the chance that he will have to turn it in, we subtract 76% from 100%: 100% - 76% = 24%.

"To figure out how many tickets each graduate would get, we need to know how many seats are left for friends and family. The Fine Arts Center has 6000 seats. We subtract the seats for graduates (950) and faculty (300) from the total.

6000 - 950 = 5050
5050 - 300 = 4750

So, 4750 seats are left for friends and family. Now, we need to divide these seats by the number of graduates. Since 950 seats are for graduates, we can assume there are 950 graduates.

4750 ÷ 950 = 5

Each graduate would get 5 tickets for their friends and family.

"To figure out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to break it down step by step. We know it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill him up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we multiply 75 by 2. That gives us 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we're told that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans he can eat, we multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3. That's 150 * 3 = 450.

"To figure out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to do a few calculations.

First, let's find out how many hours she worked. She worked 6 hours a day for 3 days, so we multiply 6 hours by 3 days: 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

Next, let's calculate how much money she made. She gets paid $15 per day, and she worked for 3 days, so we multiply $15 by 3: $15 * 3 = $45.

Now, let's calculate her expenses. She pays $3 for parking each day, and she worked for 3 days, so we multiply $3 by 3: $3 * 3 = $9.

To find out how much money she has left after paying for parking, we subtract her expenses from her pay: $45 - $9 = $36.

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour, we divide the money she has left by the number of hours she worked: $36 ÷ 18 hours = $2 per hour.

24 ÷ 3 = 8 bottles

Now, we know Richard starts at the first bottle, so he only needs to move to the other 7 bottles. It takes him 5 seconds to get from one bottle to the next. 

To find the total time, we multiply the number of bottles he needs to move to (7) by the time it takes to get to each one (5 seconds).

"To find out how much money Amor has left, we need to figure out how much she spent on cheese. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese. It's $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds. So, 2 x $11 is $22.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese. It's $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds. So, 3 x $6 is $18.

Now, we add the cost of both cheeses together: $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the cost of the cheese from the initial amount: $50 - $40 = $10.

"So Jim is going to college and he's getting $50,000 in loans each year. He's in college for 4 years, so that's a lot of money he's borrowing. To figure out how much, we multiply $50,000 by 4. That's $200,000.

Before college, Jim was making $25,000 a year. He didn't work for 4 years, so we need to figure out how much money he didn't make. We multiply $25,000 by 4, and that's $100,000.

Now we add the money he borrowed and the money he didn't make: $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000. That's how much money Jim needs to make to pay back his loans and make up for the money he didn't make.

After college, Jim's new job pays him $25,000 x 3 = $75,000 a year. To figure out how long it'll take him to make $300,000, we divide $300,000 by $75,000. That's 4 years.

"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we need to figure out the size of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long, and the fabric needs to be 2 feet longer, so the fabric is 6 + 2 = 8 feet long.

The bed is 8 feet wide, and the fabric needs to be 2 feet wider, so the fabric is 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

Now, we need to find the area of the fabric. To do that, we multiply the length by the width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. But Jim needs two pieces of fabric, so we multiply 80 by 2.

80 * 2 = 160

"To find the total number of letters delivered, we need to figure out how many letters were delivered each day and then add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of what they delivered on Monday. To find one-fifth of 425, we divide 425 by 5, which is 85. Then we add 17 to that, so they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102, which is 204. Then we add 5 to that, so they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day:

"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

First, Johnny's dad lost $5 on the first race.

Then, on the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won 2 * $5 = $10, and then $1 more, which is $10 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's add up the amounts: -$5 (lost) + $11 (won) - $16.50 (lost) = -$10.50. Since he won $11, we can think of it as a loss of -$10.50.

There were 3 races, so to find the average, we divide the total amount lost by 3: -$10.50 / 3 = -$3.50.

Since the question asks how much he lost on average, we consider the absolute value of the amount, which is $3.50.

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so now he's 50 + 2 = 52 inches tall.

Now, we can find the difference in their heights by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

"To find the share of the first person, let's use a variable, x, to represent the amount the first person gets. 

The second person gets $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person gets twice what the second person gets, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

We know the total amount is $1920, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine the x's and the numbers:

4x + 240 = 1920

Now, subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find out how many hours each painter worked, we need to figure out how many hours the whole team worked and then divide that by the number of painters.

First, we need to know how many hours they worked in a day. They worked 3/8 of a day, which is a fraction. To make it easier, let's convert it to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so we multiply 24 by 3/8.

24 * 3/8 = 24 * 0.375 = 9 hours

So, the team worked 9 hours a day. Now, we need to know how many days they worked. They worked for 3 weeks, which is 21 days (3 * 7 = 21).

Now, let's multiply the hours they worked in a day by the number of days:
9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

The whole team worked 189 hours. Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4:
189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours

"To solve this problem, let's use a variable to represent the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set. Let's call it x.

We know that in the first set, Rory retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set. So, the number of balls in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. So, the number of balls in the third set is x/2.

We also know that the total number of balls Rory retrieved is 19. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

To make it easier to solve, let's multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

This simplifies to:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to figure out how much it goes down in value each year. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year.

First, let's find out how much it goes down in value in the first year (2008). To do this, we multiply the initial price ($20000) by the depreciation rate (21% or 0.21).

$20000 * 0.21 = $4200

So, the price of the car in 2008 is:
$20000 - $4200 = $15800

Now, let's do the same thing for the second year (2009). We multiply the price in 2008 ($15800) by the depreciation rate (0.21).

$15800 * 0.21 = $3328

The price of the car in 2009 is:
$15800 - $3328 = $12472

Finally, let's do it for the third year (2010). We multiply the price in 2009 ($12472) by the depreciation rate (0.21).

$12472 * 0.21 = $2618.52

The price of the car in 2010 is:

Now, we add the number of English and German books: 25 + 5 = 30. This means there are 30 books that are not in Spanish. To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract 30 from the total number of books: 50 - 30 = 20.

Then, there's the king size bed. The washing machine can only handle 1 set of king sheets at a time, so that's 1 load of laundry for the king size bed each week.

In total, Greg does 2 loads for the twin beds + 1 load for the king size bed = 3 loads of laundry each week.

The cast costs $200. The doctor charges $300 per hour, but the visit was only 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, the visit costs $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The painkillers cost $4 each, and Hannah got 30 of them. So, the painkillers cost $4 * 30 = $120.

The parking costs $6 per hour, and Hannah had to pay for 2 hours. So, the parking costs $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 + $150 = $350, then $350 + $120 = $470, and finally $470 + $12 = $482.

"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to do a few steps. 

First, we need to find out how many emails James doesn't respond to in a day. Since 20% of the emails don't need a response, we need to find 20% of 80. To do that, we multiply 80 by 0.2 (because 20% is the same as 0.2). 

80 * 0.2 = 16

So, James doesn't respond to 16 emails in a day. To find out how many emails he does respond to, we subtract 16 from 80.

80 - 16 = 64

Now we know James responds to 64 emails in a day. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply 64 by 5.

64 * 5 = 320

"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited. On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited, so that's 2 x 32 = 64 classes. On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, so that's 3 x 32 = 96 classes. On Thursday, 30 classes visited, and on Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

The total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score, we need to add up all his scores and divide by the number of tests. 

John scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so that's 100 + 100 + 100 = 300. Then he scored 80 on his 4th test, so we add that to 300 to get 380.

Now we divide 380 by 4, because there are 4 tests. 380 divided by 4 is 95.

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to figure out how many the glee club and the football team ate.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7. That's 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club. So, they have 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of their pizzas. To find 80% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.8. That's 32 pizzas eaten by the football team. So, they have 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

Now, we add the pizzas left from both groups: 6 + 8 = 14.

"Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. To find out how many big coupons he's sending, we multiply 700 by 2, which is 1400.

Now, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents, so we multiply 700 by 0.05. This gives us 35 dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, so we multiply 1400 by 0.15. This gives us 210 dollars.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons. So, 35 + 210 is 245 dollars.

"To find out how many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained, we need to figure out how many sub sandwiches Sidney had left.

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten sub sandwiches. So, that's 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Then Mark ate 4 of them, leaving Sidney with 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches.

But then Sidney ordered 3 more, so now Sidney has 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches.

Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs, so we multiply 6 (the number of sub sandwiches) by 4 (the number of meatballs in each sub sandwich). That's 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to figure out how many trucks were able to deliver. 

There were 20 trucks in total, but a quarter of them broke down. A quarter is the same as 1/4. So, we multiply 20 by 1/4 to find out how many trucks broke down:
20 * 1/4 = 20 / 4 = 5 trucks

This means 5 trucks broke down and couldn't deliver the fertiliser. To find out how many trucks were able to deliver, we subtract the number of trucks that broke down from the total number of trucks:
20 - 5 = 15 trucks

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that delivered by the tons each truck was carrying:
15 * 20 = 300

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers:

"Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter to make 6 dozen croissants. The store has a deal where if you buy one pound of butter, you get the second one half off. So, for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays for one full price and gets the other half off.

Since he needs 6 pounds, we can divide that into 3 pairs of 2 pounds. For each pair, he pays $4 for the first pound and $2 for the second pound (half off). 

So, for each pair, he pays $4 + $2 = $6. Since he has 3 pairs, he pays 3 * $6 = $18.

"To figure out how much the party will cost, we need to know how many people are coming. Kayla invited her 25 classmates, 7 dance class friends, and 13 family members. That's a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people. But 4 people said they can't come, so we subtract 4 from 45. That's 45 - 4 = 41 people.

The movie theater costs $125 for 20 people, and $6 for each extra person. We need to find out how many extra people are coming. Since 20 people are already covered, we subtract 20 from 41. That's 41 - 20 = 21 extra people.

Now, we multiply the number of extra people by $6. That's 21 * $6 = $126. We add this to the original $125. So, $125 + $126 = $251.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to figure out how much each of them spent.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money. A quarter is the same as 1/4. So, she spent 1/4 of $60. To find 1/4 of $60, we can divide $60 by 4. $60 ÷ 4 = $15. So Maggie spent $15. To find out how much she has left, we subtract $15 from $60. $60 - $15 = $45.

Riza spent one-third of her money. One-third is the same as 1/3. So, she spent 1/3 of $60. To find 1/3 of $60, we can divide $60 by 3. $60 ÷ 3 = $20. So Riza spent $20. To find out how much she has left, we subtract $20 from $60. $60 - $20 = $40.

Now, we add the money Maggie and Riza have left. $45 + $40 = $85.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to figure out how many bananas all three monkeys eat in a day. Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, we can divide that by 7 to get the number of bananas they eat in a day. 

315 ÷ 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, let's look at the first monkey. It eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so it eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

The first and second monkeys eat a total of 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total bananas eaten in a day.

45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we need to figure out how much she paid for the roses and how much change she got.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Roses cost $2 each, but you can also buy a dozen for $15. Since 15 is more than a dozen, she can buy a dozen for $15 and 3 more roses at $2 each. 

The cost of a dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 more roses is 3 * $2 = $6. So, the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny paid with 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she got, we subtract the cost from the amount she paid: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the change is given in quarters, and each quarter is $0.25, we need to divide the change by $0.25 to find out how many quarters she got: $4 / $0.25 = 16.

The first train will arrive in 10 minutes and will stay for 20 minutes. So, it will leave the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train will arrive 30 minutes after the first train leaves. So, it will arrive at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train will stay for 1/4 of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train will leave the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train will arrive 60 minutes after the second train leaves. So, it will arrive at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train will leave right away, so it will leave at 125 minutes.

The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves. So, it will arrive at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

"Melanie wants to make a toothpick sculpture that needs 200 toothpicks. She's been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she already has, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves each week by the number of weeks she's been saving them.

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs. We subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks needed.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks. We can do this by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"To find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend got, we need to figure out how much he paid for the watch and compare it to the original price.

The watch originally cost $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it for 75% of that price. To find 75% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.75.
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend for 120% of what he paid. To find 120% of $1500, we multiply $1500 by 1.20.
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

So, Mr. Rogers' friend paid $1800 for the watch. To find the discount, we subtract the price he paid from the original price.
$2000 - $1800 = $200

Now, we need to find what percentage $200 is of $2000. To do this, we divide $200 by $2000 and multiply by 100.
($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many seconds are in 4 hours. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. So, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 

Since we want to know how many seconds are in 4 hours, we multiply 3600 by 4. 
3600 * 4 = 14400 seconds

Now, we know that each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second. If there are 5 springs, then they create 5 jellyfish per second. To find the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds, we multiply 5 jellyfish per second by 14400 seconds.
5 * 14400 = 72000

So, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

James' home is 4 miles from the store. When he walked halfway, that's 2 miles. Then he walked 2 miles back home. After that, he walked the whole 4 miles to the store. So, the total distance he walked is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 miles.

We know James walks 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 8 miles, we can divide the distance by his speed. 

Time = Distance / Speed

If she bought the bananas one by one, it would have cost her 40 x $0.80 = $32.

But, she actually bought them in bunches for $3 each. So, she paid 10 x $3 = $30.

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the amount she paid from the amount she would have paid: $32 - $30 = $2.

"To figure out how much fence Sam gets, we need to think about what we know. We know that Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence in total, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Then Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence. Since they have 100 feet in total, we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

This means we add Sam's fence and Harry's fence, and it equals 100 feet. Now, let's solve for x.

First, we combine the x's: 2x + 60 = 100

Next, we subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to know how many of each type of bike he sold and how much each bike costs.

Marcel sold 300 bikes in total. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so that's 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes. 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, so that's 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes. The rest of the bikes were MTB type, so that's 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's look at the prices. An MTB bike costs $500, a BMX bike costs half of that, which is $250, and a Trekking bike costs $450.

Now, let's calculate how much Marcel earned from each type of bike:
- 105 MTB bikes * $500 = $52,500
- 45 BMX bikes * $250 = $11,250
- 150 Trekking bikes * $450 = $67,500

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay every hour. If it works for 6 hours, it'll pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales of hay.

Now, we need to find out how many bales are left. To do that, we subtract the number of bales the truck picked up from the number of bales the farmer made: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find out how many hours John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and extra learning time, then convert it to hours.

John has 8 periods per day (6 normal periods + 2 extra classes), and each class is 40 minutes long. So, he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. Let's call the total weekly minutes 'x'. Then, the extra learning time is (1/16)x. We know that the class time is 1600 minutes, and the extra learning time is (1/16)x. The total weekly minutes 'x' is the sum of class time and extra learning time.

To find 'x', we can set up an equation:

x = 1600 + (1/16)x

We can multiply both sides by 16 to get rid of the fraction:

16x = 25600 + x

Now, we can subtract x from both sides:

15x = 25600

Divide both sides by 15:

x = 25600 / 15
x = 1706.67

Now, we can convert the total weekly minutes to hours:

Total hours per week = x / 60
Total hours per week = 1706.67 / 60
Total hours per week = 28.44

Next, the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

Finally, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. To find the original weight, we need to multiply 1080 by 2, since the T-Rex only ate half.

"To find out how much it will cost to paint the room, we need to figure out how much paint we need. 

First, we need to find the area of the walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall is 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. There are two of these walls, so that's 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. There are two of these walls, so that's 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, so we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so we multiply 12 gallons by $12: 12 * 12 = $144.

Now, we add the miles run by Amber and Micah. 
8 (Amber's miles) + 28 (Micah's miles) = 36 miles.

We know that all three of them ran 52 miles in total. 
To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles. 
52 (total miles) - 36 (miles run by Amber and Micah) = 16 miles.

"Sheila started with $85.00 on her credit card. Then she returned something that cost $15.00, so we subtract that from the $85.00. 

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, she bought a frying pan that was on sale. The original price was $20.00, but it was 20% off. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20.

$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00

So the frying pan was $4.00 off. We subtract that from the original price.

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

She also bought a set of towels that was on sale. The original price was $30.00, but it was 10% off. To find 10% of $30.00, we multiply $30.00 by 0.10.

$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00

So the towels were $3.00 off. We subtract that from the original price.

$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the $70.00.

$70.00 + $16.00 = $86.00
$86.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color under the UV light. These jellyfish are a third of the large jellyfish. To find the total number of large jellyfish, we need to multiply 6 by 3, since 6 is one-third of the large jellyfish. 

6 * 3 = 18

So, there are 18 large jellyfish in the tank. Now, we know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. To find the total number of jellyfish, we need to multiply 18 by 5, since 18 is one-fifth of the total jellyfish.

18 * 5 = 90

"To find Caroline's age, we need to figure out Ben's age first. We know Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris. So, we multiply Chris's age by 2 to get Ben's age.

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben is 8 years old, we can find Caroline's age. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so we multiply Ben's age by 3.

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To figure out how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to know how much money she needs to save for retirement and how much she's saving each year.

Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current salary when she retires. Her current salary is $100,000, so 40% of that is $40,000 per year. She wants to live on that amount for 20 years, so she'll need:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000

Lauren is saving 20% of her salary each year, which is $20,000. To find out how many years it'll take her to save $800,000, we can divide the amount she needs by the amount she's saving each year:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

But Lauren wants to retire in 20 years, not 40. Since she's already been working and saving for some time, let's assume she's already saved some money. We don't know exactly how much, but we know she needs to save a total of $800,000.

Since Lauren saves $20,000 per year and she wants to retire in 20 years, she'll save an additional:

$20,000 per year * 20 years = $400,000

This means she's already saved:

$800,000 - $400,000 = $400,000

Since she's already saved $400,000 and she saves $20,000 per year, she's already worked for:

$400,000 / $20,000 per year = 20 years

But we want to know how many more years she needs to work, not how many years she's already worked. Since she's already worked for 20 years and she wants to retire in 20 years, she needs to work for the same amount of time it'll take her to save the remaining amount.

First, let's find out how long each of the 4 parts will be. We can do this by dividing 100 by 4:
100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part

Now, we know each of the 4 parts is 25 cm long. Next, we need to divide each of those parts into 5 equal parts. We can do this by dividing 25 by 5:
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

"To find the number of girls in the school, we need to first find the total number of students. We know that 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys. 

Let's think of it like this: if 40% is 240, then 1% would be 240 divided by 40, which is 6. Now, if 1% is 6, then 100% would be 6 times 100, which is 600. So, there are 600 students in total.

Now, we know that 240 of them are boys. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. 
600 - 240 = 360

Since Soledad plans to hike twice a day, we divide 310 miles by 2:

310 miles / 2 = 155 miles per hike

But Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles per time. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we subtract 125 miles from 155 miles:

But wait, the question mentions Pierre, Paul, and Jacques, but then talks about Peter and James. I'm going to assume it's actually Pierre, Paul, and Jacques, and Peter and James are actually Pierre and Jacques.

So, let's start with the 12 kg of apples they bought. Peter (or Pierre) wants a quarter of that. A quarter is the same as 1/4, so we multiply 12 by 1/4, which is 3 kg. Paul wants 1/3 of the apples, so we multiply 12 by 1/3, which is 4 kg.

Now, we add the apples Peter and Paul want: 3 + 4 = 7 kg. To find out how many apples are left, we subtract 7 from 12, which is 5 kg.

Since Jacques is the only one left, he will have 5 kg of apples.

First, let's find the distance of one round trip. Since it takes him 2 hours to drive there, it will take him 2 hours to drive back, so the total time for a round trip is 2 + 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we know his speed is 70 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 70 miles/hour * 4 hours = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the distance of one round trip by 2: 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The 2 workers who make 6 toys an hour will make 2 x 6 x 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours. The 2 workers who make 4 toys an hour will make 2 x 4 x 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours. So, the 4 workers together will make 120 + 80 = 200 toys in 10 hours.

The manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order, but they still need 20 toys after 10 hours. This means they made 400 - 20 = 380 toys in 10 hours. Since the 4 workers made 200 toys, the fifth worker must have made 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker makes per hour, we divide the total number of toys they made by the number of hours they worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. First, we know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation x + (x + 12) = 30.

Combine like terms: 2x + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2x = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 9.

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 

The difference is 21 - 13 = 8.

Next, let's find the weight of the boxes. Nik puts the crayons into groups of 8, so he needs 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together: 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we need to divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to get the total weight in pounds: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

We know Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and it takes her 40 minutes. To find her speed on the beach, we can use a simple formula: Speed = Distance / Time. 

Speed = 2 miles / 40 minutes
Speed = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we know Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk. So, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 1/20 miles per minute, which is 1/10 miles per minute.

We also know Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk. To find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk, we can use the same formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute)
Time = 10 minutes

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk is the sum of the time she spends on the beach and the time she spends on the sidewalk.

"To find the temperature of the second bottle, we need to think about how temperatures mix together. When you mix two things with different temperatures, the result is somewhere in between. 

Donny mixed 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of the other water, and it ended up being at least 40 degrees. Since there's more of the 33-degree water, the other water must be really hot to make the mixture at least 40 degrees.

Let's try to figure out the lowest temperature the other water could be. If we multiply the 4 ounces of 33-degree water by 33, we get 132. If we multiply the 1 ounce of the other water by its temperature (let's call it x), we get x. When we add these together and divide by the total ounces (5), we should get at least 40.

So, we can set up an equation: (132 + x) / 5 ≥ 40. To get rid of the division, we can multiply both sides by 5, which gives us 132 + x ≥ 200. 

Now, we subtract 132 from both sides to get x ≥ 68. This means the temperature of the other water is at least 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate how many cows and chickens were added.

Melanie's dad starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Every day, he gets 20 more cows and 10 more chickens. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks.

So, the number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows. The number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, we add these to the original number of cows and chickens. The total number of cows is 50 + 420 = 470. The total number of chickens is 20 + 210 = 230.

To find the total number of animals, we add the total number of cows and chickens: 470 + 230 = 700.

"So Russell is buying bagels online, and each pack costs $10.00 with 9 bagels in it. If he buys 4 packs, he gets a 10% discount. To find out how much each bagel costs, we need to do some math.

First, we find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels. Since each pack costs $10.00, 4 packs will cost 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Now, we need to calculate the 10% discount. To do this, we find 10% of $40.00, which is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00. So, the discount is $4.00.

We subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00. This is the amount Russell will pay for 4 packs of bagels.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, 4 packs will have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

Now, let's figure out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops.
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop to find out how many potatoes he ate.
18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to figure out how many eggs he eats in total.

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, so we multiply 3 eggs by 30 days:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Then, he eats 5 eggs a day for the next 30 days, so we multiply 5 eggs by 30 days:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both periods:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to figure out how many green and red jellybeans there are first. We know there are 17 green jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, we multiply 17 by 2 to get the number of red jellybeans. 

17 * 2 = 34

So, there are 34 red jellybeans. Now, we add the number of green and red jellybeans together.

17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51

We know there are 60 jellybeans in total. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

60 (total) - 51 (green and red) = 9

"So, Tim grows 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons every year. To find out how many lemons he gets in a year, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons each tree gives.

5 trees * 6 lemons per tree = 30 lemons per year

Now, we need to find out how many lemons he gets in 10 years, which is a decade. To do that, we multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10.

30 lemons per year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find out how many women are left on the bus, we need to first figure out how many women were on the bus in the first place. We know the ratio of men to women is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women.

The total number of people on the bus is 84. We can think of the ratio as a group of 5 men and 9 women, which makes a total of 14 people. We can divide 84 by 14 to find out how many groups of 14 people are on the bus.

84 ÷ 14 = 6

So, there are 6 groups of 14 people on the bus. Since each group has 9 women, we multiply 6 by 9 to find the total number of women.

6 * 9 = 54

There were 54 women on the bus. If 20 women get off, we subtract 20 from 54 to find out how many women are left.

54 - 20 = 34

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold in 3 days, we need to figure out how many individual sunflowers and bouquets he sold.

First, let's look at the individual sunflowers. They cost $2 each, and he made $26 from them each day. So, we divide $26 by $2 to find out how many he sold each day:
$26 ÷ $2 = 13 sunflowers per day

Since we want to know how many he sold in 3 days, we multiply 13 by 3:
13 * 3 = 39 sunflowers

Now, let's look at the bouquets. They cost $8 each, and he made $56 from them each day. So, we divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold each day:
$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we multiply 7 by 12 to find out how many sunflowers were in the bouquets each day:
7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers per day

For 3 days, we multiply 84 by 3:
84 * 3 = 252 sunflowers

Now, we add the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers in the bouquets:
39 + 252 = 291 sunflowers

"So Adam has $100 and he wants to start a rock stand. He buys rocks for $5 each and sells them for $7 each. He uses all his money to buy rocks. 

First, let's find out how many rocks he can buy. We do this by dividing the money he has ($100) by the cost of each rock ($5). 

$100 ÷ $5 = 20 rocks

He buys 20 rocks, so he spends all his money. Now, he only sells 60% of the rocks. To find out how many rocks that is, we multiply 20 by 0.6 (which is the same as 60%).

20 x 0.6 = 12 rocks

He sells 12 rocks for $7 each, so we multiply 12 by $7 to find out how much money he makes.

12 x $7 = $84

Now, we subtract the money he made ($84) from the money he spent ($100) to find out how much he loses.

$100 - $84 = $16

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days for each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

However, Lauren can work on different scenes in a single day. Let's try to combine the days.

She can do 30 large-sized scenes and 36 medium-sized scenes in 6 days. Then she can do the remaining 15 large-sized scenes in 3 days. She can also do the 49 small-sized scenes in 7 days, but she can do 42 of them in the 6 days that she is doing the first 30 large-sized scenes and the 36 medium-sized scenes, and the remaining 7 small-sized scenes in the 3 days that she is doing the last 15 large-sized scenes.

So, the total number of days is 6 + 3 = 9 days.

"To find out how much Jen spends on food in May, we need to know how many days are in May and how much food costs for her fish each day. May has 31 days. Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food per day. So, the daily cost of food for the fish is 3 * $1 = $3. Now, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: 31 days * $3 per day = $93.

"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to do a few steps. First, we subtract the roses she gave away from the initial number. She had 30 roses and gave 24 to her mom, so we do 30 - 24 = 6. That means she had 6 roses left.

Then, we add the roses she bought. She bought 15 more roses, so we do 6 + 15 = 21.

So, Patricia has 21 roses now.

"To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance Sid traveled and the total time it took him. 

First, let's find the total distance. Sid traveled 110 miles and then 140 miles more. So, the total distance is 110 + 140 = 250 miles.

Next, let's find the total time. Sid took 2 hours to travel the first 110 miles and 3 hours to travel the next 140 miles. So, the total time is 2 + 3 = 5 hours.

Now, we can find the average speed. Average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. So, the average speed is 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

Think of it like this: if you have a 20% chance of winning, and someone else has three times that chance, they have 60%. Now, to find the probability that both of you win, we multiply those numbers together.

20% is the same as 0.20, and 60% is the same as 0.60. So, we multiply 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

To turn 0.12 into a percentage, we multiply it by 100, which gives us 12%.

"To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to figure out how many seashells they collected in total.

First, let's look at Jim. He collected 27 seashells. Carlos collected 5 less than Jim, so we subtract 5 from 27 to find out how many Carlos collected: 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Now, we know Carrey collected half of what Carlos collected. To find out how many seashells Carrey collected, we divide Carlos' seashells by 2: 22 ÷ 2 = 11 seashells.

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can add them up to find the total: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Finally, we divide the total number of seashells by 3, since they divided them equally between themselves: 60 ÷ 3 = 20 seashells.

On weekends, he eats 5 carrots a day. There are 2 weekend days, so he eats 5 * 2 = 10 carrots on weekends.

To find the total number of carrots he eats in a week, we need to add the carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends. So, 20 + 10 = 30.

To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6. This gives us 3 minutes. Since the second song is 60% longer, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song. So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

Now, we add the time of the first song (5 minutes) to the time of the second song (8 minutes). This gives us 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday. That's a total of 6 devices. Each device costs $20, so he spent 6 x $20 = $120.

He sells each device for twice the price he bought it for, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, he sold 6 devices for 6 x $40 = $240.

The profit is the money he earned minus the money he spent. That's $240 - $120 = $120.

100% divided by 20% is 5. So, it takes 5 bottles to give one person all the energy they need for a day.

Now, we need to find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people. We multiply 5 bottles by 2300 people, which is 5 x 2300 = 11500 bottles.

The Hortex company already makes 4200 bottles a day. To find out how many more bottles they need to make, we subtract 4200 from 11500. That's 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

"So, Carla has 8 babies, and she dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. To find out how many babies are wearing purple and blue, we need to do some math.

3/4 of 8 is the same as 3/4 * 8, which is 6. So, 6 babies are wearing purple. 
1/4 of 8 is the same as 1/4 * 8, which is 2. So, 2 babies are wearing blue.

Now, we know that all the blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows. To find 1/3 of the purple wearers, we do 1/3 * 6, which is 2. So, 2 purple-wearers and 2 blue-wearers are wearing bows.

In total, 4 babies are wearing bows. Out of these 4, 2 are wearing purple. To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of purple-wearers with bows (2) by the total number of babies with bows (4), and multiply by 100.

(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%."

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6, which is 240. Since the last complex is 60% bigger, we add 240 to 400, which is 640 apartments.

Now, let's add up all the apartments: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he does 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections per week.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the lengths of the ropes. Let's say the length of the yellow rope is y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope. So, the length of the red rope is 4(y - 7).

The problem states that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. We can write an equation to represent this:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Now, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37

Next, let's add 35 to both sides of the equation:

6y = 72

Now, divide both sides by 6:

y = 12

So, the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter, the length of the blue rope is 12 - 7 = 5 centimeters.

Finally, the length of the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, which is 4(5) = 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how much money Ronnie and Rissa had left after giving some to their little sister.

Rissa got three times as much money as Ronnie, who got $5. So Rissa got 3 x $5 = $15.

Let's say they both gave x dollars to their little sister. Then Ronnie has $5 - x left, and Rissa has $15 - x left.

We know that Rissa has 4/5 of her money left. This means she has 4/5 of $15 left. To find 4/5 of $15, we multiply $15 by 4 and divide by 5. This gives us $12.

So, $15 - x = $12. To find x, we subtract $15 from both sides, which gives us -x = -$3. Then we multiply both sides by -1, which gives us x = $3.

This means they both gave $3 to their little sister. Now we can find out how much money Ronnie has left: $5 - $3 = $2.

Yellow paint = 12 / 2 = 6 pints

Now, we subtract the yellow paint from the total to find the amount of paint used for the other three colors.

Red, white, and purple paint = 12 - 6 = 6 pints

We know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. To find the amount of red paint, we divide the total amount of red, white, and purple paint by 3.

The special size box costs $12, so to find out how much one pod costs, we divide $12 by 120. This gives us $0.1 per pod.

"So Thomas starts with $1000 in 20 dollar bills. To find out how many 20 dollar bills he has, we need to divide 1000 by 20. That's 1000 ÷ 20 = 50.

Then, he loses 10 bills, so we subtract 10 from 50. That's 50 - 10 = 40.

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for something. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 left.

Now, we need to find out how much money he has left. Since each bill is $20, we multiply 20 by 20. That's 20 x 20 = 400 dollars.

Then, Thomas triples his money. To triple 400, we multiply it by 3. That's 400 x 3 = 1200 dollars.

Finally, he converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide 1200 by 5. That's 1200 ÷ 5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to figure out how many goals each team scored in both halves.

In the first half, team A scored 4 goals. Team B scored 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scored 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, it scored 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half. Team A scored 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals:
- Team A scored 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, so team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals.
- Team B scored 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, so team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals.
- The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then see how many days it will last.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% on Monday. To find out how much chalk that is, we multiply 5 inches by 0.45 (which is the same as 45%). So, 5 x 0.45 = 2.25 inches. That means the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday.

Now, let's find out how much chalk is left. We subtract the amount used from the total amount: 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

The teacher usually uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how much that is, we multiply 5 inches by 0.20 (which is the same as 20%). So, 5 x 0.20 = 1 inch per day.

Since the teacher has 2.75 inches left, we can see how many days it will last. If the teacher uses 1 inch per day, the chalk will last for 2.75 days. However, the teacher can't write with a very small piece of chalk, so he recycles it when it's smaller than 2 inches.

Let's see how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches. After the first day, the teacher will have 2.75 - 1 = 1.75 inches left. After the second day, the teacher will have 1.75 - 1 = 0.75 inches left. Since 0.75 inches is less than 1 inch, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after the second day of using 20% of the original chalk length per day.

So, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

The total number of students in the class is 12 + 12 = 24. To find out how many are not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students: 24 - 7 = 17.

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to follow the information given in the problem. 

First, we know Mike bought 5 face masks. Then, we need to find out how many face masks is ""thrice as many as Mike."" Thrice means three times, so we multiply 5 by 3. 
5 * 3 = 15

Now, we know Johnny bought 2 more than that. So, we add 2 to 15.
15 + 2 = 17

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to figure out how many teeth the dentist fixes in total. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth. He also caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so that's 4 + 7 = 11 teeth capped. 

In total, the dentist fixes 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

Now, we need to find what percentage 15 is of James' total teeth, which is 30. To do this, we divide 15 by 30 and multiply by 100:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

"To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to figure out how much the milk that went bad cost. 

First, we need to know how much all the milk cost. We can do that by multiplying the number of gallons by the price per gallon. 
4000 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $14,000

Now, we need to find out how many gallons of milk went bad. We know that 2/5 of the milk went bad. To find 2/5 of 4000, we can multiply 4000 by 2 and then divide by 5.
(4000 * 2) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

So, 1600 gallons of milk went bad. Now, we multiply the number of gallons of bad milk by the price per gallon to find the refund amount.
1600 * $3.5 = $5600

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. If we let C be Colin's current age, then seven years from now, Colin will be C + 7 years old. Since Wendy is five times as old as that, Wendy's current age is 5(C + 7).

We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. In 25 years, Colin will be C + 25 years old. Since that's a third of Wendy's current age, we can set up the equation: C + 25 = (1/3) * 5(C + 7).

Now, let's simplify the equation. To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 3: 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7). This becomes 3C + 75 = 5C + 35.

Next, let's get all the C's on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3C from both sides: 75 = 2C + 35.

Now, let's get rid of the 35 on the right side by subtracting 35 from both sides: 40 = 2C.

Finally, let's solve for C by dividing both sides by 2: C = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to figure out how many books he can buy in total first. We know that 100 books cost $500. So, we can divide the total amount of money Bob has ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

$27000 ÷ $500 = 54

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. To find the total number of books, we multiply 54 by 100.

54 × 100 = 5400

Now, we know Bob has 5400 books to distribute among 3 schools. To find out how many books each school gets, we divide the total number of books by the number of schools.

5400 ÷ 3 = 1800

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

"Let's break down what happened with Newton and the apples.

First, 2 apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up and put 1 in his pocket. He threw the other apple at the tree, which made 5 more apples fall. So now, there are 5 new apples on the ground, plus the 1 he already put in his pocket.

Newton picked up the 5 new apples and put 4 of them in his pocket. He threw the last one at the tree, which made 6 more apples fall. Now, there are 6 new apples on the ground, plus the 5 he already had in his pocket.

Newton picked up all the remaining apples and went home. To find the total number of apples he brought home, we need to add the apples he had in his pocket (5) to the new apples he picked up (6). 

5 (apples in pocket) + 6 (new apples) = 11

So, Newton brought home 11 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to figure out how many bags he ordered and then multiply that by the cost per bag.

First, let's find out how many bags he ordered. We know the coal comes in 50 kg bags and Ali ordered 850 kg. So, we divide 850 by 50.

850 kg ÷ 50 kg = 17 bags

Now that we know Ali ordered 17 bags, we multiply that by the cost per bag, which is $18.

17 bags × $18 per bag = $306

"To figure out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate how many slices her friends will eat. 

Her friends will eat 6 slices of cheese pizza each, and there are 6 friends. So, they will eat 6 x 6 = 36 slices of cheese pizza. Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to divide 36 by 12 to find out how many cheese pizzas Kate needs. 36 / 12 = 3, so Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas.

Her friends will also eat 4 slices of pepperoni pizza each, and there are 6 friends. So, they will eat 6 x 4 = 24 slices of pepperoni pizza. Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to divide 24 by 8 to find out how many pepperoni pizzas Kate needs. 24 / 8 = 3, so Kate needs 3 pepperoni pizzas.

In total, Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. That's 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day. 

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's 3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles. 

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles. That's 5 miles * 2 days = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles together: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

"To figure out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to think about how many snowballs he makes and how many melt.

Jay makes 20 snowballs in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 20 by 60 to find out how many snowballs he makes per minute: 20 ÷ 60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

But, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find out how many snowballs melt per minute, we can divide 2 by 15: 2 ÷ 15 = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to subtract the number of snowballs that melt from the number of snowballs Jay makes. To do this, we need to have the same denominator, which is 15. So, we can rewrite 1/3 as 5/15. Now we can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we can multiply the number of snowballs he gains per minute by the number of minutes it takes to get 60 snowballs. To do this, we can divide 60 by 3/15. This is the same as multiplying 60 by 15/3, which is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

The final answer is: 300"
"So, we know that John is 28 now and that Digimon had its 20th anniversary. This means we need to figure out how old John and Jim were 20 years ago.

John is 28 now, so 20 years ago, he was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

We also know that John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago. This means if John was 8, Jim was half of that, which is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Now, we need to find out how old Jim is now. We know Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago, so we add 20 to that: 4 + 20 = 24.

Doxa ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so that's 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so that's 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up all the slices they ate: Doxa (1) + her sister (2) + her brother (3) = 6 slices.

"To find out how many bandages they started with, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, at the end of the third day, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

However, it's given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means that they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the previous days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

Now, we know that they had 3 bandages left from the previous days at the end of the third day. This 3 bandages is the sum of the bandages left at the end of the first day (12) and the bandages left at the end of the second day. Since they used 28 bandages on the second day and only had 12 left from the first day, they must have had 28 - 12 = 16 more bandages at the start of the second day. This means they had 16 more bandages at the start of the first day.

So, the total bandages they had at the start of the first day is 50 (from the bulk pack) + 12 (left at the end of the first day) + 16 (extra bandages) = 78.

The haircut costs $30 per inch, and 2 inches were cut off. So, the haircut cost 2 x $30 = $60.

The color cost $40. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the haircut and the color: $60 + $40 = $100.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. So in one week, she works 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works 45 * 4 = 180 hours.

Jen gets $1.5 per hour, so for 180 hours, she gets 180 * $1.5 = $270. She also gets $10 extra each week for not missing any days, and since there are 4 weeks, that's 4 * $10 = $40 extra.

So, Jen gets $270 + $40 = $310.

Next, Jason did his laundry once for $3.00.

Then, he took the trash out twice. He gets $0.75 each time, so 2 x $0.75 is $1.50.

Lastly, Jason cleaned his room once for $1.50.

"So John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. To find out how much one bottle costs, we need to divide $600 by 10. That's $60 per bottle.

Now, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which is 2 x 10 = 20 bottles. The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. 50% of $60 is half of $60, which is $30. So, the cognac costs $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

To find the total cost of the cognac, we multiply 20 bottles by $90 per bottle. That's 20 x $90 = $1800.

John spent $600 on scotch and $1800 on cognac. So, the total amount he spent is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to figure out how many red jelly beans he thought were in the jar. 

First, we need to find the volume of the jar. The jar is a square prism, so we multiply the area of the base by the height. The base is 6 inches by 6 inches, so the area is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. Then we multiply that by the height, which is 15 inches. So the volume is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

But the jelly beans don't fill the whole jar, because they don't pack perfectly. They get about 80% efficiency, which means the jelly beans take up 80% of the volume. So we multiply the volume by 0.8 to get the volume of the jelly beans: 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now we need to find out how many jelly beans fit in that volume. Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we divide the volume of the jelly beans by the volume of one jelly bean: 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans.

But we're only interested in the red jelly beans, and we know that 30% of the jelly beans are red. So we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3: 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who got on at the first stop got on again. Since 40 people got on at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 more people got on at the second stop. Now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people.

At the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubled. So, 90 * 2 = 180 people are on the bus now.

"To find out how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 5 years and the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, and each visit costs $2. So, she spends 2 * 3 = $6 per year. Since she does this for 5 years, she spends 6 * 5 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit goes up by 150%. This means the new cost is the old cost ($2) plus 150% of the old cost. 150% of $2 is 2 * 1.5 = $3. So, the new cost is $2 + $3 = $5 per visit. Pauline still visits 3 times a year, so she spends 5 * 3 = $15 per year. For the next 3 years, she spends 15 * 3 = $45.

To find the total amount Pauline spent, we add the money she spent in the first 5 years ($30) to the money she spent in the next 3 years ($45). So, the total amount is 30 + 45 = $75.

"To figure out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to know how many groups of students there are. Since there are 10 students in each grade and there are 4 grades, we multiply 10 by 4 to get the total number of students.

10 * 4 = 40 students

The escape room can only hold 8 students at a time, so we divide 40 by 8 to get the number of groups.

40 / 8 = 5 groups

Each group gets 45 minutes to try and escape. To find the total time, we multiply the number of groups by the time per group.

5 * 45 = 225 minutes

The answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames.

John made 4 tables for $20 each, so the cost of the tables is 4 x $20 = $80. He also made 2 roof frames for $10 each, so the cost of the roof frames is 2 x $10 = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

"Let's break this down step by step. Ian has a 40-foot board and wants to cut it into two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. 

Let's say the shorter piece is 'x' feet long. Then the longer piece is 4x feet long. Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up an equation: x + 4x = 40.

Combine the x's: 5x = 40.

Now, divide both sides by 5: x = 8.

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece is 4 times that, which is 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

"To figure out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to know how many pounds of ground beef he's using. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants 80 meatballs, we can divide 80 by 16.

80 ÷ 16 = 5

So, Aiden is using 5 pounds of meat. Now, we know he adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat. To find the total amount of seasoning, we multiply the number of pounds by 2.

5 * 2 = 10

Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning."
"To figure out how much fabric Luke needs, we first need to find the total width of all the windows. There are 5 windows, and each one is 35 inches wide. So, we multiply 5 by 35.

5 x 35 = 175 inches

That's the total width of all the windows. But Luke needs to buy fabric that's 2 times that width. So, we multiply 175 by 2.

175 x 2 = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.

"To figure out how much a 36-minute call would cost, we need to break it down. For the first 16 minutes, it costs $0.25 per minute. So, we multiply 16 minutes by $0.25.

16 x $0.25 = $4.00

After 16 minutes, the price drops to $0.20 per minute. We have 20 minutes left (36 - 16 = 20), so we multiply 20 minutes by $0.20.

20 x $0.20 = $4.00

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost.

$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

"To solve this problem, let's start by using a variable to represent the number of cupcakes Carly made. Let's call it 'c'. We know that she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies is 3c - 2.

Since each person in her class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Now, let's simplify the equation. Combine the 'c' terms: 4c - 2 = 10. Then, add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12. Finally, divide by 4: c = 3.

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To find out how much Karen would pay, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with a discount, and then add the cost of the nail art.

First, let's find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure. A manicure costs $35 and a pedicure costs $40, so together they cost $35 + $40 = $75.

The salon gives a 20% discount if you get both. To find 20% of $75, we multiply $75 by 0.20. So, 0.20 * $75 = $15. This is the discount amount.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the manicure and pedicure. $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we need to add the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her 10 fingers, and it costs $3 per nail. So, the total cost of the nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, we add the cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art. $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to add up the number of issues from each magazine.

First, let's look at the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year. Since there are 3 of them, we multiply 3 by 12, which is 36.

Then, we have 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. We don't need to multiply this one, it's just 6.

The last magazine sends 4 times as many issues as the 6-issue magazine. So, we multiply 6 by 4, which is 24.

Now, let's add all these numbers together: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

"Let's break this down step by step. We know Samantha has 27 paintings, and she has 12 fewer than Shelley. To find out how many paintings Shelley has, we need to add 12 to Samantha's total. So, Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

Now, we know Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from Shelley's total. So, Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to do a few steps.

First, we need to find the price after it went up in December. The price went up by 80%, which means it went up by 80% of $40. To find 80% of $40, we multiply $40 by 0.8. 

$40 * 0.8 = $32

So the price went up by $32. Now we add this to the original price of $40.

$40 + $32 = $72

Now the price is $72. In January, the price went down by 50%. To find 50% of $72, we multiply $72 by 0.5.

$72 * 0.5 = $36

Now we subtract $36 from $72.

$72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"So Charlie is a tennis teacher and he charges $80 per hour for lessons. But if he's teaching a veteran, he gives them a discount of 25%. That means he only charges them 75% of the normal price.

First, let's figure out how much he makes from the regular lessons. He has 4 of those, so that's 4 x $80 = $320.

Now, let's calculate the price for the veteran lessons. 25% off of $80 is $20, so the veteran lessons cost $80 - $20 = $60 per hour. He has 2 of those, so that's 2 x $60 = $120.

To find the total amount of money Charlie makes, we add the two amounts together: $320 + $120 = $440.

210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

So, Sally's total score is 630. She took 9 quizzes. To find the mean, we divide the total score by the number of quizzes:

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to figure out how many she had left. Since she had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can multiply 20 by 1/4 or 0.25.

20 * 0.25 = 5

So, Eve had 5 pomelos left. Now, we subtract the number of pomelos she had left from the original amount to find out how many she gave away.

20 (original amount) - 5 (amount left) = 15

Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

"To find out how much money Walter received, we need to figure out how many apples he sold to his uncle.

First, Walter ate 2/5 of the 60 apples. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5. This is (60 * 2) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples. So, he had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

Next, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 25 and divide by 100. This is (36 * 25) / 100 = 900 / 100 = 9 apples. So, he had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Walter sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply 27 by 3. This is 27 * 3 = 81 dollars.

"To find out what percentage of the distance Michael covered, we need to know how far he traveled and the total distance between Alaska and Texas.

Michael's speed is 50 km/hr. He traveled for 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so he traveled for 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we multiply his speed by the number of hours he traveled to find the distance he covered:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the distance covered, we divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60

"To find out how many grapes were there at the beginning, we need to figure out how many grapes Madeline's brother and mom used.

Madeline's brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline. Since Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

Their mom used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie needs 12 grapes, so she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Now, let's add up all the grapes: Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used 30 grapes, and their mom used 48 grapes. So, 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 grapes.

"To figure out what percentage of the day the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we need to know how much time they spend cleaning and how much time they have to work.

The custodian has to clean 80 classrooms, and it takes 15 minutes to clean each one. So, the total time spent cleaning is 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes.

The custodian has 5 days to get it done, so we divide the total time by 5: 1200 / 5 = 240 minutes per day.

Now, we need to know how many minutes the custodian works each day. They work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, so they work 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

Now, we can figure out what percentage of the day they spend cleaning. We do this by dividing the time spent cleaning (240 minutes) by the total time they work (480 minutes), and then multiplying by 100.

(240 / 480) * 100 = 50%

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.

"To figure out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to know how many books one bookcase can hold. 

Each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books, and there are 2 of them. So, the middle shelves can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which is 2 x 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the books that one bookcase can hold: 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Elly has 110 books, so we need to divide 110 by 55 to find out how many bookcases she needs.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Now, let's find out how much she made. She sells 3 eggs for $1. So, she can make 60 / 3 = 20 sets of eggs. Since each set costs $1, she made 20 x $1 = $20.

Her profit is the money she made minus the money she spent. So, her profit is $20 - $12 = $8.

First, we know that half of the hats are red. Since Skyler has 100 hats, half of them would be 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.

Now, we subtract the red hats from the total to find the remaining hats: 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

Next, we're told that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find 3/5 of 50, we multiply 50 by 3 and then divide by 5: (50 * 3) / 5 = 150 / 5 = 30 blue hats.

Finally, the rest of the hats are white. So, we subtract the blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to know how much Archie paid for the bag and how many sticks are in the bag. 

Archie bought a bag of jerky that was originally $18.00, but it was on sale for $3.00 off. So, the sale price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we need to divide the sale price by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick. But first, we need to convert the sale price to cents because the question asks for the cost in cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so $15.00 is equal to 1500 cents.

Now, we can divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks: 1500 cents / 30 sticks = 50 cents per stick.

"To solve this problem, let's use a variable to represent the number of strawberry cubes. Let's call it 's'. We know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, the number of blueberry cubes is 5s - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Since the total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, we can write an equation: s + (5s - 4) = 116.

Combine the 's' terms: 6s - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6s = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: s = 20.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate each type separately.

First, let's count the flashlights. There are 4 people, and each person has a flashlight, so that's 4 flashlights. There are also 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms, which is 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights. So, the total number of flashlights is 4 + 16 = 20.

Now, let's count the candles. Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other 4 have 5 medium candles each. The total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16, and the total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20. So, the total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

First, let's look at the 4 plants that need half a cup of water each. Since half a cup is the same as 0.5 cups, we multiply 4 by 0.5. That's 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water.

Next, we have 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each. So, we multiply 8 by 1, which is 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water.

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we already know about 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the rest is 20 - 12 = 8 plants. These plants need a quarter of a cup of water each, which is the same as 0.25 cups. We multiply 8 by 0.25, which is 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to do a few calculations.

First, we need to figure out how many doughnuts Derrick's bakery makes in a day. Since Derrick's bakery makes 10 dozen doughnuts, and 1 dozen is 12, we multiply 10 by 12. That's 120 doughnuts per day.

Next, we need to find out how many doughnuts Derrick's bakery makes in June. June has 30 days, so we multiply 120 by 30. That's 3600 doughnuts.

Now, we know Derrick sells each doughnut for $2. To find out how much money Derrick makes, we multiply 3600 by $2. That's $7200.

"To figure out how many days Jade will need to upload all her photos, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to find out how many batches of photos Jade has. Since she uploads 7 photos in one batch, we divide the total number of photos (210) by the number of photos per batch (7). 

210 ÷ 7 = 30 batches

Now, we know Jade uploads 6 batches each day. To find out how many days she needs, we divide the total number of batches (30) by the number of batches per day (6).

30 ÷ 6 = 5 days

"To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to figure out how much she spends in one week first.

Alicia takes 5 blouses, 2 pants, and 1 skirt to the dry cleaners each week. The dry cleaners charge $5 for each blouse, $8 for each pair of pants, and $6 for the skirt.

So, for the blouses, it's 5 x $5 = $25. For the pants, it's 2 x $8 = $16. And for the skirt, it's $6.

Now, let's add those up: $25 + $16 + $6 = $47. That's how much Alicia spends in one week.

Since we want to know how much she spends in 5 weeks, we multiply $47 by 5: $47 x 5 = $235.

"To figure out how long it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to know how many words he can say in a minute and how many words are in 10 pages.

John's new speed is 2.5 times faster than his old speed of 150 words per minute (WPM). So, we multiply 150 by 2.5 to get his new speed:
2.5 * 150 = 375 WPM

Each page has 450 words, and John needs to speak 10 pages. To find the total number of words, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page:
10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we divide the total number of words by John's new speed to find the time it would take him to speak 10 pages:
Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 minutes

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to break it down day by day.

On the first day, there were 50 people at the beach. The next day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day. So, we multiply 70 by 2, which is 140 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people for the first three days: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

For the rest of the week, which is 4 days, Conor saw an average of 60 people per day. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we multiply 60 by 4, which is 240 people.

Finally, we add the total number of people for the first three days and the rest of the week: 260 + 240 = 500 people.

Total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:

"To find the total number of popped kernels, we need to break it down step by step.

First, 20 kernels popped in the first 30 seconds. Then, in the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 x 20 = 60 kernels.

Next, the kernels started popping four times faster than the initial rate, so in the next 30 seconds, 4 x 20 = 80 kernels popped.

After that, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels in the final 30 seconds.

When Garrett took the pan off the heat, some kernels still popped from the leftover heat. This time, it was a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up all the popped kernels: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210.

"To figure out how many lemons Tim needs, we need to break it down step by step. First, we know that for a gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice. Since he wants to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade, he'll need 4 cups of lemon juice. 

We also know that 6 lemons give us 1 cup of juice. So, to get 4 cups of juice, we multiply 4 (the number of cups needed) by 6 (the number of lemons per cup). That's 4 x 6 = 24 lemons for the regular lemonade.

Now, his friend Allen wants an extra gallon that's twice as tart. That means it needs twice as much lemon juice, which is 2 cups. Since 6 lemons give us 1 cup of juice, we multiply 2 (the number of cups needed for the extra gallon) by 6 (the number of lemons per cup). That's 2 x 6 = 12 lemons for the extra gallon.

To find the total number of lemons Tim needs, we add the lemons for the regular lemonade (24) and the lemons for the extra gallon (12). That's 24 + 12 = 36 lemons.

"To find out how much dog food the Kennel house needs in a week, we need to figure out how much food the dogs eat in a day and then multiply it by 7.

The 3 German Shepherds eat 5 kilograms of food each, so that's 3 x 5 = 15 kilograms. The 2 Bulldogs eat 3 kilograms of food each, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 kilograms. 

So, in total, the dogs eat 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms of food in a day. To find out how much they eat in a week, we multiply 21 by 7. That's 21 x 7 = 147 kilograms.

"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to figure out how many legs there are in total. 

The farm has 10 animals with 2 legs each, so that's 10 x 2 = 20 legs. The farm also has 15 animals with 4 legs each, so that's 15 x 4 = 60 legs.

Now, we add the legs together: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

Since a pair of legs has 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs: 80 / 2 = 40.

"To find the number of red blocks, we need to figure out how many yellow blocks there are first. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, we multiply 4 by 2 to get the number of yellow blocks. 

4 * 2 = 8

Now we know there are 8 yellow blocks. We also know there are 4 blue blocks. To find the total number of blue and yellow blocks, we add them together.

4 (blue blocks) + 8 (yellow blocks) = 12

The total number of blocks in the tower is 32. To find the number of red blocks, we subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks.

32 (total blocks) - 12 (blue and yellow blocks) = 20

"To figure out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to think about how far he went west and then how far he went east.

When Elvis drove west, he went 18 miles per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 18 * 5 = 90 miles. So, he went 90 miles west.

Then, he turned around and drove east for 8 hours at the same speed, 18 miles per hour. We multiply the speed by the time again: 18 * 8 = 144 miles. So, he went 144 miles east.

Since he went 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we subtract the distance he went west from the distance he went east to find out how far he is from his house: 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

Elvis is 54 miles from his house."
"To find out how much the boat is worth after three years, we need to figure out how much it depreciated each year.

First, the boat depreciated 30% in the first year. To find 30% of $9000, we multiply $9000 by 0.3. That's $2700. So, after the first year, the boat is worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

Next, the boat depreciated another 30% in the second year. We multiply $6300 by 0.3 to find 30% of $6300, which is $1890. So, after the second year, the boat is worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

Finally, the boat depreciated 20% in the third year. We multiply $4410 by 0.2 to find 20% of $4410, which is $882. So, after the third year, the boat is worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

"To find the number of pink candies, we need to figure out how many red, orange, and yellow candies there are first. 

We know there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, we multiply 54 by 2 to get 108 orange candies. 

For the yellow candies, we know there are half as many as red candies. So, we divide 54 by 2 to get 27 yellow candies.

Now, we add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

"To find out how much Helen paid for her trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the bus rides.

First, let's find the cost of the hotel. Helen stayed for 3 nights, and each night costs $80. So, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $80 = $240.

Next, let's find the cost of the bus rides. Each bus ride costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. 10% of $80 is $8. Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus rides is 7 x $8 = $56.

Now, let's add the cost of the hotel and the bus rides to find the total cost of Helen's trip. $240 + $56 = $296.

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to figure out how many marbles Dallas got from Mazie. We know Dallas has 21 marbles now, but he dropped 4 in the playground. So, before he dropped those 4 marbles, he had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins. If Dallas got 25 marbles, then we subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla got. 

52 - 25 = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

"To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets. The parents are 2 adults, and their tickets cost $12 each. So, 2 * $12 is $24. The child's ticket costs $8. Adding that to the adults' tickets, we get $24 + $8 = $32.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorns. They bought 2 popcorns for $3 each. So, 2 * $3 is $6.

Now, we add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns together: $32 + $6 = $38.

"To find the force John needs to push the car, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, the luggage, and the two children.

The car weighs 1200 pounds. The luggage weighs 250 pounds. The two children weigh 75 pounds each, so together they weigh 75 + 75 = 150 pounds. 

Now, let's add all these weights together: 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds.

The force to move the car is 1% of the weight. To find 1% of the weight, we multiply the weight by 0.01. 

So, 1600 * 0.01 = 16.

"To find out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to figure out the perimeter of his backyard fence. The perimeter is the distance around the fence. Since the fence is a rectangle, we can use a simple formula to find the perimeter: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).

The long side of the fence is 20 feet, and the short side is 15 feet. Let's plug these numbers into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2(35)
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

"To find out how much feed is left, we need to figure out how much the pigs eat in a week. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 pounds per day per pig.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, all the pigs eat 8 * 5 = 40 pounds of feed per day. In a week, that's 40 * 7 = 280 pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so we subtract the amount the pigs ate from the total amount of feed. That's 300 - 280 = 20 pounds of feed left.

"To figure out how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we need to do some math. 

First, we need to know how many hot dogs John's guests will eat. Since there are 20 guests and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, we multiply 20 by 2. That's 20 x 2 = 40 hot dogs.

John already has 4 hot dogs, so we subtract those from the total number of hot dogs he needs. That's 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Now, we need to know how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack has 6 hot dogs, so we divide 36 by 6. That's 36 ÷ 6 = 6 packs.

Next, we find the total square feet from the medium shirts. Each medium shirt is 4 square feet, so we multiply 8 shirts by 4 square feet. That's 8 x 4 = 32 square feet.

Lastly, we find the total square feet from the large shirts. Each large shirt is 6 square feet, so we multiply 6 shirts by 6 square feet. That's 6 x 6 = 36 square feet.

That means he pays full price for the first one, which is $8, and half price for the second one. Half of $8 is $4, so he pays $8 + $4 = $12 for the T-shirts.

The shoes are originally $40, but they're 40% off. To find 40% of $40, I multiply $40 by 0.4, which is $16. So, the discount is $16. That means he pays $40 - $16 = $24 for the shoes.

To find the total amount Jake spends, I add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes. That's $12 + $24 = $36.

He also needs 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, which costs $8 per pound, so that's 1.5 x $8 = $12. And he needs 2 pounds of honey, which costs $10 per pound, so that's 2 x $10 = $20. So, to make one jar, it costs him $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to follow what he did step by step.

Randy started with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. That's a total of 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies.

Then, he ate 3 cookies for a snack - one of each kind. So, he had:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

After his snack, he had 8 + 3 + 4 = 15 cookies.

Next, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he had:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 sugar cookies (no change)

After lunch, he had 6 + 3 + 4 = 13 cookies.

Then, he gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he had:
- 6 oatmeal cookies (no change)
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

After giving cookies to his friends, he had 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 cookies.

Finally, he baked 4 of each kind of cookie. So, he had:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Now, Randy has 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies.

"Matthew has 12 toy soldiers and wants to sell them. The buyer is willing to pay $5 for half of the toys and $7 for the other half. To find out how much money Matthew will get, we need to figure out how many toys are in each half.

Since Matthew has 12 toys, half of them would be 12 / 2 = 6 toys. So, he has 6 toys for $5 each and 6 toys for $7 each.

For the 6 toys that cost $5 each, he will get 6 * $5 = $30. For the 6 toys that cost $7 each, he will get 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount of money Matthew will get, we add $30 and $42 together. $30 + $42 = $72.

"So Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day, and he does this for 14 days while Nate is on vacation. To find out how many holes the dog dug, we multiply 6 holes per day by 14 days.

6 * 14 = 84 holes

Now, when Nate gets home, he fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes per day.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day.

84 / 3 = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the number of days by 7 to find the number of weeks.

28 / 7 = 4 weeks

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is than the enrollment at Butler High School, we need to first figure out how many students Butler High School enrolls.

Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, we can find 3/4 of 4000 by multiplying 4000 by 3 and then dividing by 4.

3 * 4000 = 12000
12000 / 4 = 3000

So, Butler High School enrolls 3000 students. Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment by subtracting the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School.

4000 - 3000 = 1000

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family made, we need to know the total number of cookies and the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies. 

The total number of cookies is 7995. The number of rainbow cookies is 2595, and the number of oatmeal cookies is 3075. 

First, we add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies: 2595 + 3075 = 5670. 

Now, we subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies: 7995 - 5670 = 2325.

"So, Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to get 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. But Igor messed up. He got half the test tubes, which is 16 / 2 = 8. He got 2 more Petri dishes than he was supposed to, so that's 14 + 2 = 16. And he got some beakers, but we don't know how many yet.

We do know that the total number of things Igor got is 29. So, let's add up the things we know: 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes = 24. That means the number of beakers he got is 29 - 24 = 5.

But Dr. Grumpus asked for 7 beakers. So, to find out how many beakers Igor lost, we subtract the number he got from the number he was supposed to get: 7 - 5 = 2.

Number of beakers Igor lost: 2"
"To figure out how many screws James will have left over, we need to find out how many screws he needs for the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is making 4 tables, he needs 4 x 8 = 32 screws in total. He has 40 screws, so we subtract the screws he needs from the screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"So, we have 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first one. To find out how many eggs are in the second basket, we need to multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2. 

10 eggs * 2 = 20 eggs

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30.

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to figure out how much each person raised. 

Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750. 

Sarah raised $300. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the money they all raised: 
$430 + $750 = $1180
$1180 + $300 = $1480
$1480 + $700 = $2180

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it took Vanessa to run her part of the race. We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron ran half that distance, which is 2 miles.

We also know that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means that if Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, it would take Vanessa twice as long to run the same distance. So, if Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, Vanessa would run 2 miles in 16 * 2 = 32 minutes.

Since Vanessa actually ran 4 miles, and it takes her 32 minutes to run 2 miles, it would take her twice as long to run 4 miles. Therefore, Vanessa took 32 * 2 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To figure out how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we need to find out how much line he needs in total. He wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there's 200 feet of dock. So, we multiply 200 by 3.

200 * 3 = 600

This means he needs 600 feet of line. But he already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract that from the total.

600 - 6 = 594

"To figure out how much money Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate how much money each group of people spends when they come to the restaurant. They order 2 meals that cost $5 each, so that's 2 x $5 = $10. They also buy a $5 bottle of wine. So, in total, each group spends $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 groups of people per night, we multiply the amount each group spends ($15) by the number of groups (6). That's 6 x $15 = $90 per night.

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so we multiply the amount they make per night ($90) by the number of days they're open (2). That's 2 x $90 = $180.

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to first find out how much the vendor paid for each watermelon. 

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, to find the cost of one watermelon, we divide $80 by 50. 

$80 ÷ 50 = $1.60

This means the vendor paid $1.60 for each watermelon. The vendor sold the watermelons at a 25% profit. To find the profit amount, we need to calculate 25% of $1.60.

25% of $1.60 = 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40

Now, we add the profit to the cost price to find the selling price.

Selling price = Cost price + Profit
= $1.60 + $0.40
= $2.00

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to figure out how old he is now. 

First, let's find out how old Dora is. Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she's 12 - 3 = 9 years old now.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

John was 19 years old when James was born. So, John is 18 + 19 = 37 years old now.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To figure this out, we need to know how many oranges Ana and Jane can peel in an hour. 

Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can divide 60 by 3 to find out how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour. 
60 / 3 = 20 oranges

Jane takes 4 minutes to peel an orange. We can divide 60 by 4 to find out how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour. 
60 / 4 = 15 oranges

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana can peel than Jane. We can do this by subtracting the number of oranges Jane can peel from the number of oranges Ana can peel. 
20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5

"So Mark needs a new radiator for his car and it costs $400. But he's smart and finds one at a junk shop for 80% off. That means he only pays 20% of the original price. To find 20% of $400, I multiply $400 by 0.20. That's $80.

Then, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours. So, the mechanic's labor costs $50 * 3 = $150.

To find the total cost, I add the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's labor. That's $80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information we have about the total number of animals and their legs. Let's say the number of chickens is 'c' and the number of cows is 'w'. We know that c + w = 20, because there are 20 animals in total.

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. So, the total number of legs can be represented as 2c + 4w. We are told that the total number of legs is 70, so we can write the equation:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can try to solve these two equations. We can start by solving the first equation for 'c':

c = 20 - w

Now, we can substitute this expression for 'c' into the second equation:

2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

Expanding the equation, we get:

40 - 2w + 4w = 70

Combine like terms:

40 + 2w = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides:

2w = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'w' into the equation c = 20 - w:

c = 20 - 15
c = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To figure out how many slices each person can have, we need to know the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, we multiply 7 pizzas by 8 slices to get the total number of slices: 7 x 8 = 56 slices.

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people: Henry and his 3 friends. So, we divide 56 slices by 4 people: 56 ÷ 4 = 14 slices per person.

Answer: 14"
