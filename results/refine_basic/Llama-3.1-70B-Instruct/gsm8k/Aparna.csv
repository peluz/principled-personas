"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Janet's daily egg sales to find out how much she makes at the farmers' market.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins, so the total eggs used are 3 + 4 = 7. To find the number of eggs she sells, we subtract the eggs used from the total eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Since Janet sells each egg for $2, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem. We know that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. It also takes half that much white fiber, which means it takes 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

To find the total number of bolts, we simply add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt). 

The final answer is: 3"
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Josh's house flipping venture to calculate his profit.

First, we need to determine the total cost incurred by Josh. He bought the house for $80,000 and spent an additional $50,000 on repairs. So, the total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% + 150%). To find the new value, we'll calculate 250% of the original value of the house, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

Now, let's calculate Josh's profit. The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down James' running routine to find out how many meters he runs in a week.

James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week. So, the total number of sprints he runs in a week is 3 * 3 = 9 sprints. Since each sprint is 60 meters, we multiply the total number of sprints by the distance of each sprint.

Total meters per week = 9 sprints * 60 meters per sprint = 540 meters

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem step by step.

Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day. To find the total amount of feed needed, we multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken needs: 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, and the price of the glasses follows a pattern. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass. 

To find the cost of the second glass, we calculate 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3.

Now, let's pair the glasses. We have 16 glasses, so we can make 8 pairs. Each pair consists of a first glass ($5) and a second glass ($3). The cost of each pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since we have 8 pairs, the total cost is 8 * $8 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Now, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. To find the number of sheep in Toulouse, we multiply the number of sheep in Charleston by 2: 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carla is downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB per minute. However, 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.

First, let's calculate how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. So, she downloads the entire 200 GB file. The time it takes to download 200 GB is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time it takes for the initial download, the restart, and the complete download. The total time is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (complete download) = 160 minutes.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down John's journey to find out how far he is from home.

First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply his speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Now, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move.

After the traffic, he drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he travels in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

For the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), he drives at 80 mph. The distance he travels in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance John travels in the 4 hours after turning around is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Since John was trying to get back home, we subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the distance he traveled before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Eliza's earnings for the week.

Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10, and she works 40 hours at this rate. So, her regular pay is 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

For the 5 hours she worked beyond 40, she receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. This means her overtime rate is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. So, her overtime pay is 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

To find her total earnings, we add her regular pay and overtime pay: $400 + $60 = $460.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the program had 60 downloads in the first month.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. So, we multiply 60 by 3 to get 180 downloads.

Now, for the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we find 30% of 180, which is 0.3 * 180 = 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads for each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate the total cost of the pastries Toula bought.

First, we have 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen, so the total cost for donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, we have 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen, so the total cost for mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.

Lastly, we have 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen, so the total cost for mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add up the costs: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carlos is planting a lemon tree that costs $90 to plant. Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each, generating $10.5 in revenue. However, it costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree.

To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) plus the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree ($3 per year). The total revenue is the annual revenue from selling lemons ($10.5 per year).

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.5
Year 2: Total cost = $93 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $96, Total revenue = $10.5 * 2 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $99, Total revenue = $10.5 * 3 = $31.5
Year 4: Total cost = $99 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $102, Total revenue = $10.5 * 4 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $105, Total revenue = $10.5 * 5 = $52.5
Year 6: Total cost = $105 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $108, Total revenue = $10.5 * 6 = $63

Since the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108) in year 6, we need to calculate for more years.

Year 7: Total cost = $108 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $111, Total revenue = $10.5 * 7 = $73.5
Year 8: Total cost = $111 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $114, Total revenue = $10.5 * 8 = $84
Year 9: Total cost = $114 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $117, Total revenue = $10.5 * 9 = $94.5
Year 10: Total cost = $117 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $120, Total revenue = $10.5 * 10 = $105
Year 11: Total cost = $120 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $123, Total revenue = $10.5 * 11 = $115.5
Year 12: Total cost = $123 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $126, Total revenue = $10.5 * 12 = $126

However, in year 12, the total revenue ($126) is still not more than the total cost ($126). We need to calculate for year 13.

Year 13: Total cost = $126 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $129, Total revenue = $10.5 * 13 = $136.5

In year 13, the total revenue ($136.5) is more than the total cost ($129). Therefore, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem.

Melanie, the door-to-door saleswoman, sold a certain number of vacuum cleaners. We need to find out how many she started with. Let's denote that number as 'x'.

First, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. Then, she sold 2 more to the red house. After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house.

Let's work through this step by step. After the green house, Melanie has 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left. After the red house, she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left. Then, she sells half of that at the orange house, leaving her with (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners.

We know Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:
x/3 - 1 = 5

To solve for x, we add 1 to both sides:
x/3 = 6

Then we multiply both sides by 3:
x = 18

So, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To help the merchant make a choice, let's analyze the potential profit from each option.

The jewelry is worth $5,000 and is expected to increase in value by 2.5%. To calculate the increase, we multiply the value by the percentage increase: $5,000 * 2.5% = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125.

The electronic gadgets are worth $8,000 and are expected to increase in value by 1.2%. To calculate the increase, we multiply the value by the percentage increase: $8,000 * 1.2% = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96.

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the option with the higher increase in value, which is the jewelry.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Jill's annual salary.

Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are $700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year.

As a cheerleading coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are $450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year.

To find Jill's total annual salary, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching: $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year.

Now, let's multiply the number of days by the number of eggs she eats per day: 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

To convert this to dozens, we'll divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs).

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Marissa's hiking problem step by step.

Marissa wants to complete a 12-mile trail with an average speed of 4 miles per hour. To achieve this, we need to find the total time she has to complete the trail.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. She has 6 miles left to walk.

Time left = Total time - Time already taken
Time left = 3 hours - 2 hours

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

We know Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. To find the number of gold coins, we can start by denoting the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'.

The total number of coins is the sum of gold and silver coins, which is 110. So, we can set up the equation:
x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

John made a total of 13 * 15 = $195 from selling his lego sets. He spent 8 * 20 = $160 on video games and had $5 left. This means he spent a total of $160 + $5 = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, that means he didn't spend the money from all 13 lego sets. The amount he didn't spend is $195 - $165 = $30.

Each lego set is worth $15, so the number of lego sets he didn't sell is $30 / $15 = 2.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To find John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he runs.

John runs a total of 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week, with the following time distribution: 3 hours on the first day and half as much (1.5 hours) on the other two days.

Let's calculate the total time he runs:
Time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day)
Time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5
Time = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate John's running speed:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. So, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Now, we're told that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. This means her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she can travel in 2 hours while running is 2 * 6 = 12 miles.
The distance she can travel in 4 hours while walking is 4 * 1.5 = 6 miles.

The total distance she can travel in 6 hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's tackle this problem together.

To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin, we need to calculate the total distance she can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone.

Polly's throwing distance without the gemstone is 400 feet. However, with the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. So, the total distance she can throw the javelin is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, let's subtract the dragon's flame distance (1000 feet) from the total distance Polly can throw the javelin: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie: 5 x 8 = 40.

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces: 40 - 14 = 26.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. You have 2000 calories as your target and you have already consumed 1800 calories. To find the remaining calories, we subtract the consumed calories from the target calories.

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Now, we know that the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. We need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories. To do this, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving.

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams 0.8 servings is. First, we find out how many grams are in one serving.

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.

Now, we multiply the grams per serving by the number of servings you can eat.

60g * 0.8 = 48g.

The answer is: 48"
"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem at hand. Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles, and we need to find his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles.

First, we need to determine the cost of making 20 candles. Since Charlie can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, he'll need 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle is sold for $2.00, so the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Meredith's writing schedule to find out the total number of hours she spent writing articles.

Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find out how many more articles she wrote, we'll calculate 2/5 of 5, which is (2/5) * 5 = 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem.

Candice initially had 80 post-it notes in her purse. She then purchased a package of post-it notes, and we need to find out how many were in that package. Let's denote the number of post-it notes in the package as x.

After buying the package, Candice had a total of 80 + x post-it notes. She used 220 post-it notes at work, so the number of post-it notes she had remaining is (80 + x) - 220.

We know that she had 23 post-it notes remaining, so we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The final answer is: 163"
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie: 200 / 40 = 5.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To calculate this, we multiply the cost of a blue tie by 1.5 (100% + 50%): 40 * 1.5 = $60.

The total amount spent on red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

First, let's convert 4 feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we know the wire is 48 inches long and was cut into 6-inch pieces. To find the number of pieces, we divide the total length by the length of each piece:
48 inches / 6 inches = 8

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, we can multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor.

Total number of units = 15 * 8
Total number of units = 120

Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we can multiply the total number of units by 3/4.

Number of occupied units = 120 * (3/4)
Number of occupied units = 90

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.

Number of unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Number of unoccupied units = 30

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into Lloyd's egg farm earnings.

To calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings, we need to first determine his daily earnings. His chickens produce 252 eggs per day, and he sells them for $2 per dozen. 

First, let's convert the number of eggs to dozens:
252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozen eggs per day

Now, let's calculate Lloyd's daily earnings:
21 dozen eggs per day * $2 per dozen = $42 per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply Lloyd's daily earnings by 7 to find his weekly earnings:
$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we know the distance Tom needs to cover to get back. Since he's traveling at a rate of 6 mph, we can find the time it takes him to get back by dividing the distance by the speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. He has comic books that weigh 1/4 pound each and toys that weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove.

First, let's calculate the weight of the comic books he removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, the total weight of 30 comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds of weight. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find the number of toys he needs to remove by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. To find the total revenue for Thursday, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately.

The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.

Now, let's compare the revenue for both days. Thursday's revenue is $520, and Friday's revenue is $480. Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue.

To find the difference in revenue, we subtract Friday's revenue from Thursday's revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

Weight limit of the bridge: 5000 pounds
Weight of the empty truck and the driver: 3755 pounds
Remaining weight limit for the boxes: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Marcy is entitled to a full annual pension of $50,000 after working for 40 years. However, she becomes eligible for a percentage of the pension after 20 years of service. The percentage increases by 5% each year.

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she has worked 10 years (30 - 20 = 10) at the increased rate. To find the percentage of the full pension she's entitled to, we multiply the number of years by the annual increase rate.

180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

After the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of the year. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day for:
365 days - 180 days = 185 days

The total amount of dog food consumed in the remaining 185 days is:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

Now, let's add the total amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can find the number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year by dividing the total amount of dog food consumed by the amount in each bag:

To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package. For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.833 per flower. For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower.

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.833 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price: 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages, and 9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the other price, the cost would be: 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages, and 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is $15 - $9 = $6.

"Hi there, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate the cost of the dog grooming after the discount.

The original price of the grooming is $100, and the groomer is offering a 30% discount for new customers. To find the discount amount, we'll multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

Discount amount = 30% of $100 = 0.3 * $100 = $30

Now, let's subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price.

Discounted price = $100 - $30 = $70

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We have 24 liters of water, and two girls each got 1/6 of it. To find out how much water each girl got, we'll divide 24 by 6, which is 4 liters per girl. Since there are two girls, they got a total of 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

Now, a boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken is 8 (girls) + 6 (boy) = 14 liters.

To find out how much water is left, we'll subtract the total amount of water taken from the initial amount. That's 24 - 14 = 10 liters.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

Charlie had 10 stickers initially. He then bought 21 stickers from a store in the mall and received 23 stickers for his birthday. To find the total number of stickers he had, we add these numbers together:
10 (initial stickers) + 21 (bought stickers) + 23 (birthday stickers) = 54 stickers

However, Charlie didn't keep all of these stickers. He gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card. So, the total number of stickers he gave away and used is:
9 (given to sister) + 28 (used for greeting card) = 37 stickers

Now, let's subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used from the total number of stickers he had:
54 (total stickers) - 37 (given away and used) = 17 stickers

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To find the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we need to calculate Alex's weight first. Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, we'll start by multiplying Grace's weight by 4. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds, so 4 times her weight is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. Now, we subtract 2 pounds from this result to find Alex's weight: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now that we know Alex's weight, we can add it to Grace's weight to find their combined weight: 125 (Grace's weight) + 498 (Alex's weight) = 623 pounds.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate the total number of thorns on the rose bushes. 

First, we need to find the total number of roses. Since Dan plants 3 rose bushes and each bush has 25 roses, we multiply the number of bushes by the number of roses per bush.

Total roses = 3 * 25
Total roses = 75

Now, we know that each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose.

Total thorns = 75 * 8
Total thorns = 600

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem. We know the football team played 22 games in total. They won 8 more games than they lost. To find out how many games they won, we can use a simple equation.

Let's say the number of games they lost is 'x'. Then, the number of games they won is 'x + 8'. Since the total number of games is 22, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

So, the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is:
7 + 8 = 15

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into Gene's quilt-making project. To determine the total number of quilt blocks, we need to figure out how many vacations he's been on.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old, and now he's 34. So, he's been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations a year, we can multiply the number of years by the number of vacations per year to get the total number of vacations. That's 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Each vacation corresponds to one quilt block, so the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

The alarm rings three times a day, and we need to find the total number of times it rang today. 

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times. 
The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.
The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. After 5 years, the company increases her salary by 10% of the initial salary. To find the increased amount, we multiply the initial salary by 0.10.

$600 * 0.10 = $60

Now, we add this amount to her initial monthly salary to get the new monthly salary.

$600 + $60 = $660

Since this is her new monthly salary, we multiply it by 12 to get her annual salary.

$660 * 12 = $7920

This is Sylvie's annual salary after 5 years, and it will remain the same for the next three years since the salary increase is only given once. Therefore, her annual salary after three more years of service is $7920.

We know that Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x', then Marilyn sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:
x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many guests will actually show up to the party. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of guests that will show up as follows:

Number of guests that will show up = Total number of guests - (1/4 * Total number of guests)
= 16 - (1/4 * 16)
= 16 - 4
= 12

Now, we know Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest. To find the total number of gift bags she needs, we multiply the number of guests that will show up by 0.75:

Total gift bags = 0.75 * Number of guests that will show up
= 0.75 * 12
= 9

Finally, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of gift bags by the cost per gift bag, which is $2:

Total cost = Total gift bags * Cost per gift bag
= 9 * 2

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's get to the problem at hand. Ted the T-Rex needs to figure out how much potato salad to bring to the dinosaur picnic. We know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult.

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults. There are 20 adults, and each adult eats 10 lbs, so the total amount of potato salad for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Now, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children. Since children eat half as much as adults, they eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs each. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Now, we're told Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. To find Jackson's age, we subtract 5 from Amy's age: 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Jackson is 4 years old."
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he used to be 2 seconds faster than Gerald. To find Gerald's original time, we add 2 seconds to Lee's time.

Gerald's original time = Lee's time + 2 seconds
Gerald's original time = 38 + 2
Gerald's original time = 40 seconds

Now, Gerald's speed has improved by 10%, which means his new time will be 90% of his original time. To find 90% of his original time, we multiply by 0.9.

Gerald's new time = 0.9 * Gerald's original time
Gerald's new time = 0.9 * 40
Gerald's new time = 36 seconds

We know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We also know that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60.

First, let's find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

Now, we can find the combined number of pet dogs and cats: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

Finally, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats: 168 + 60 + 120 = 348.

Number of boys = 200 * (2/5) = 80

Now, let's find the number of girls. Since the total number of students is 200, and 80 are boys, the number of girls is:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys = 200 - 80 = 120

We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we multiply the number of girls by 2/3.

Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 * (2/3) = 80

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The city is 42 miles across, so we'll divide that by the distance covered in 10 minutes, which is 3 miles.

42 miles / 3 miles = 14

This means the city can be divided into 14 sections of 3 miles each. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each one.

We know Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes each night, which adds up to 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, totaling 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours.

So, the total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Now, let's subtract this from the total hours of TV watched: 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours. This is the amount of TV Frankie watched on Wednesday.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes.

However, he ends up baking 15 more cookies than he intended. After dropping 5 cookies, he's left with a total of 110 cookies. We need to figure out how many cookies Henry baked last year.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x. Since he wants to make twice as many, the number of cookies he intended to bake this year is 2x. But, he actually baked 15 more, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he's left with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies. We know this number is equal to 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

First, we need to determine how far Julia rows to reach the shore. We know it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can calculate her rowing speed.

Rowing speed = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second

Now, we're given that the shore is 64 seconds away. We can multiply the time by her rowing speed to find the total distance.

Distance = Speed * Time = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10 to find the number of 10-foot intervals.

Number of intervals = Total distance / 10 feet = 80 feet / 10 feet = 8 intervals

Finally, we can multiply the number of intervals by 2 liters to find the total amount of water the boat has taken on.

First, let's calculate the total cost price of the lumber.

Cost price of 10 (2 x 4 x 10) boards = 10 * $10 = $100
Cost price of 5 (4 x 4 x 10) boards = 5 * $16 = $80
Total cost price = $100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price.

Selling price of 10 (2 x 4 x 10) boards = 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150
Selling price of 5 (4 x 4 x 10) boards = 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Katy makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 7:13. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio and then find the fraction of the total that represents the sugar.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. We can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar:

(7/20) = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7 * 120 = 20x
840 = 20x
x = 840/20
x = 42

The number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair contains 2 shoes, we need to find the total number of shoes. To do this, we multiply the number of pairs by 2 (since each pair has 2 shoes) and then multiply by the number of children:
2 pairs/child * 2 shoes/pair * 3 children = 12 shoes

Now, we know the cost of each shoe is $60. To find the total amount John paid, we multiply the total number of shoes by the cost of each shoe:
12 shoes * $60/shoe = $720

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that on the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles from the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day. To find the number of vehicles imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles from the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4.

The number of containers imported on the second day is 4."
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and it increased by 40% over the four years. To find his new salary, we can calculate:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, let's find Lylah's salary four years ago. We know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. So, we can set up the equation:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Sadie's sleep pattern for the week.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. That's a total of 6 + 6 = 12 hours for Tuesday and Wednesday.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, which is 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. There are 4 days left in the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), so she slept a total of 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours for the entire week: 
Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday and Wednesday: 12 hours
Thursday to Sunday: 28 hours
Total hours = 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Rosie's running scenario to find out how many miles she can run in 7 hours.

First, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. To find the distance she covers in these 3 hours, we multiply her speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

After 3 hours, Rosie has 4 hours left (7 hours - 3 hours). In these 4 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. To find the distance she covers in the next 4 hours, we multiply her speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances she covers in the two parts to find the total distance:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

Jennie has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps, and another pile of letters that are already stamped. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. We know that after she's done, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to figure out how many letters she stamped. Since she put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters, we can calculate that as 60 / 3 = 20.

So, Jennie stamped 20 letters. Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many were in the pile when Jennie began, we subtract the number of letters she stamped from the total number of already-stamped letters.
30 - 20 = 10

However, we also know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. To find out how many spoons Julia had initially, we need to add the 3 spoons she used to the 7 spoons she had.

Dillon needs to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. Let's calculate the total cost:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

First, we need to calculate the total time spent by the doctors in minutes. With 500 patients and an average of 24 minutes per patient, the total time is:
500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Now, let's convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital pays the doctors $150 per hour, so the total cost of the doctors is:
200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

On the other hand, the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour. So, the total revenue from the patients is:
200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

Now, let's add the total number of rides for both Pam and Fred. 4 rides (Pam) + 6 rides (Fred) = 10 rides.

Additionally, she got 2 cookies for $1.00 each, so that's 2 x $1.00 = $2.00. Now, let's add these costs together: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

Next, we need to calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply by 0.20: 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00. Now, we add the delivery fee to the total cost: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

We know that Dave ate 14 fries, and then a seagull stole the pack and ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So, the seagull ate 7 fries.

After the seagull, three pigeons came and each ate 3 fries, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total.

Later, a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, and ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's denote the original number of french fries as x. After Dave ate 14 fries, the remaining number of fries is x - 14. The seagull ate 7 fries, so the remaining number of fries is x - 14 - 7 = x - 21.

The pigeons ate 9 fries, so the remaining number of fries is x - 21 - 9 = x - 30.

The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, so the number of fries the raccoon stole is 2/3 * (x - 30). The remaining number of fries is 1/3 * (x - 30).

The ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, 1/3 * (x - 30) = 5 + 1 = 6.

Now, we can solve for x:

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Kimo's class schedule to find out how many hours he spends attending classes in a semester.

Kimo has three 1-hour classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. That's 3 hours per day for 3 days, which equals 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day for 2 days, totaling 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

So, in a week, Kimo spends 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours attending classes.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we multiply the hours per week by the number of weeks: 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's get to the problem at hand. Bill bakes a variety of goodies every day, and we need to find the total length of all these treats when lined up end to end.

First, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good. The rolls are 4 inches long, the croissants are 6 inches long, and the baguettes are 2 feet long. Since we want the final answer in feet, we'll convert the lengths of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches. Converting to feet: 1200 inches / 12 = 100 feet.
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches. Converting to feet: 720 inches / 12 = 60 feet.
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet.

Now, let's add up the lengths: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

So, the total bananas needed per month is: 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, he needs to order:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Blake and Kelly are running on a football field that's 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, which means he covers a distance of 15 * 200 yards (since each round trip is 200 yards). So, Blake's total distance is 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly, on the other hand, runs back and forth once, covering 200 yards. Then, she decides to run to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each of these trips is 80 yards (40 yards each way). So, Kelly's total distance is 200 + (34 * 80) = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Now, let's compare their distances. Blake ran 3000 yards, while Kelly ran 2920 yards. To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

First, let's look at Anakin's catch: 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Now, let's calculate Locsin's catch. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so that's 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. And, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the number of fish each of them caught. Anakin's total is 10 + 6 + 3 = 19. Locsin's total is 5 + 3 + 5 = 13. To find the total number of fish they caught, we add their individual totals: 19 + 13 = 32.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every 2 months.

The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20, and the price increases by 20% of the original price every 2 months. 

To calculate the price after 36 months, we can use the formula for compound interest, where the interest rate is 20% and the time period is 18 (36 months / 2 months per period).

Using the formula, we get:

Price after 36 months = $20 * (1 + 0.20)^18
Price after 36 months ≈ $20 * 6.66
Price after 36 months ≈ $532.39

Combine like terms: 3x + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 24

Divide both sides by 3: x = 8

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is 2x = 2 * 8 = 16.

Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we calculate the increase:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, we add the increase to the minimum payment:

Next, we'll convert the time it takes to cut a potato into minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 5 seconds is equal to 5/60 = 0.0833 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to peel and cut a potato: 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes = 1.5833 minutes per potato.

Since Billy has 60 potatoes, we multiply the time per potato by 60: 1.5833 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 95 minutes.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem.

Juan and his brother Carlos are selling lemonade, and we need to find out how much they spent on lemons. To do this, we'll start by calculating the cost and revenue per gallon.

The cost per gallon is the sum of the cost of lemons and sugar, which is $3 + $2 = $5 per gallon.

Now, let's calculate the revenue per gallon. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10 per gallon.

The profit per gallon is the difference between the revenue and cost per gallon, which is $10 - $5 = $5 per gallon.

We know they made a total profit of $25. To find the total number of gallons, we'll divide the total profit by the profit per gallon: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Finally, we can find the total cost of lemons by multiplying the total number of gallons by the cost of lemons per gallon: 5 * $3 = $15.

The total amount spent on rent and car fuel is 1500 + 2000 = 3500 dollars. Now, let's subtract this from his total salary to find the remaining amount: 6000 - 3500 = 2500 dollars.

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250 dollars. After the donation, he's left with 2500 - 1250 = 1250 dollars.

Finally, he gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars, which adds up to 200 + 700 = 900 dollars. Subtracting this from the remaining amount, we get 1250 - 900 = 350 dollars.

The other team is less well-rounded, with their first runner taking 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner being 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem at hand. Jerry is rolling a six-sided die, and we want to find out how much more likely it is that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

First, let's consider the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die: 4, 5, and 6. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5. Since the die is rolled twice, we multiply the probabilities together: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

To find the difference between the two probabilities, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

Finally, we express this difference as a percentage by multiplying by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25.

Additionally, there's a pen of rabbits that receives 20 pieces of straw in total. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents.

First, let's find out how many pieces of straw are left after accounting for the rabbits. That would be 160 - 20 = 140 pieces of straw for the rats and hamsters.

Since there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, let's subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. That gives us 140 - 50 = 90 pieces of straw for the rats.

We know that each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

Next, they went on 2 different rides, each costing $33. The total cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's calculate the total cost by adding the cost of tickets, food, and rides: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

The net gain per year is 10 (trees planted) - 2 (trees chopped down) = 8 trees per year.
The total net gain over 10 years is 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.

Adding this to the initial number of trees, we get:

Violetta needs 5 crayons, each costing $2. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of crayons by the cost per crayon: 5 * $2 = $10.

Since Violetta prepared $20 for this purchase, we subtract the total cost from the amount she prepared: $20 - $10 = $10.

Violetta will get $10 as change."
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given the cost of a pencil is $1.20 and an eraser is $0.30, we can calculate the cost of a pen.

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens.
Cost of 8 pens = 8 * Cost of a pen
Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50
Cost of 8 pens = $12

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We have 200 pounds of carrots to be distributed to 40 restaurants, with each restaurant receiving 2 pounds of carrots. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed.

First, let's calculate the total carrots distributed: 
Total carrots distributed = Number of restaurants * Carrots per restaurant
Total carrots distributed = 40 * 2
Total carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Now, let's subtract the total carrots distributed from the total amount of carrots available to find the carrots not used:
Carrots not used = Total amount of carrots available - Total carrots distributed
Carrots not used = 200 - 80
Carrots not used = 120

We know that the total population of Soda is 23786, with 8417 men and 9092 women. Let's calculate the total number of men and women.

Total men and women = 8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, we subtract this from the total population to find the number of kids.

Number of kids = Total population - Total men and women

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem and find out how many Pokémon cards Elaine has now.

Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards. In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. So, she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards she collected in the first two months: 60 + 40 = 100 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months. That's 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we need to add the cards she collected each month to her initial number of cards: 
20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark edits an equal number of sentences for two publishers, and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. To find out how many sentences he edits for each publisher, we'll divide the total number of sentences by 2. 

1000 / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Now, let's calculate the amount Mark earns from each publisher. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so he earns:

500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence. Mark earns:

500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we'll add the amounts he earns from both publishers:

2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down John's earnings for the year.

First, we need to calculate his earnings before the raise. John makes $2000 a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. So, his total earnings before the raise would be:

$2000 per week * 52 weeks = $104,000 per year

Now, let's calculate the 5% raise. The raise is 5% of his weekly salary, which is:

$2000 per week * 0.05 = $100 per week increase

So, John's new weekly salary after the raise is:

$2000 per week + $100 per week = $2100 per week

His total earnings after the raise would be:

$2100 per week * 52 weeks = $109,200 per year

Finally, we need to add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total earnings. So, John's total earnings for the year would be:

$109,200 per year + $5000 = $114,200

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Carl's cheese usage for the week.

Carl had a sandwich for lunch every day, and since there are 7 days in a week, that's 7 sandwiches. He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, so that's 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl had cheese and egg omelets for 3 days. He used one more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich, which means he used 3 slices of cheese per omelet. So, that's 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Lastly, Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese for dinner, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up all the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (dinner) = 31 slices.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate the total number of pens Janet has now.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag. So, the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 * 9 = 54.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag. So, the total number of red pens she bought is 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, let's add the number of blue and red pens she bought: 54 + 12 = 66.

Finally, we add the initial number of pens to the number of pens she bought: 32 + 66 = 98.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem.

Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score from her six test scores. To do this, we first need to find the total score she needs to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score. Since there are 6 tests and she can remove the lowest score, she needs to have a total of 5 scores that average to 93.

The total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 5 = 465.

Now, let's find the total score of Brinley's first 5 tests: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since the lowest score (71) will be removed, we subtract it from the total score of the first 5 tests:
438 - 71 = 367.

Now, we add the total score required (465) and subtract the total score of the remaining 4 tests (367) to find the required score on the 6th test:
465 - 367 = 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Micheal's bike riding schedule to find the total kilometers he rode.

Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week for 4 weeks, covering 25 kilometers each time. To find the total kilometers for these 4 weeks, we multiply the number of times he rode (5 times/week * 4 weeks = 20 times) by the distance he covered each time (25 kilometers). This gives us 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

After 4 weeks, Micheal changed his schedule to riding 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time, and he did this for 3 weeks. To find the total kilometers for these 3 weeks, we multiply the number of times he rode (2 times/week * 3 weeks = 6 times) by the distance he covered each time (60 kilometers). This gives us 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the total kilometers from both periods: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Now, let's calculate the weight of each candied apple. We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g.

With 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since half a dozen is 6, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since 1 dozen is 12, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34800 / 240 = $145.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Sara's situation to figure out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford that new jacket and shoes.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. Adding the cost of the jacket, the total comes out to be $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved up before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she's done that 4 times. So, she's earned 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's add up the money Sara has so far: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, Sara still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4).

$40 / $4 = 10

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem at hand. Jerry has a flock of chickens, and we need to figure out how many red chickens he has.

We know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Also, he has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's use variables to represent the number of red chickens (r) and the number of white chickens (w). Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, we can express this as w = r + 2.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the total number of eggs collected per day. The equation would be 3r + 5w = 42, where 3r represents the eggs from the red chickens and 5w represents the eggs from the white chickens.

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42. Expanding this, we get 3r + 5r + 10 = 42. Combining like terms, we have 8r + 10 = 42.

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us 8r = 32. Dividing both sides by 8, we find that r = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello there, I'm Aparna. To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park first. The park is a rectangle, so we'll use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).

Given the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:
Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now that we know the perimeter, we can find the time Gary spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his walking speed, which is 3 miles/hour:
Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

To find the total number of customers on the first two days, we add the customers from both days: 100 + 150 = 250.

We know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day: 500 - 250 = 250.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem. We have two pools, both leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. We're given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, and now it has four times as much.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. This means the big pool had 2x gallons at that time. Since both pools leak at the same rate, they've both lost 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes.

Now, the small pool has x - 16 gallons, and the big pool has 2x - 16 gallons. According to the problem, the big pool currently has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up an equation based on this:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

So, the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

24 - 16 = 8

First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes. Initially, he had 90 cards (30 + 20 + 40). After losing 8 water type cards, he has 32 water type cards. Buying 14 grass type cards brings his grass type total to 34. So, the new total number of cards is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96.

Now, we can find the probability of picking a water type card by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards. Probability = 32 / 96 ≈ 0.3333. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100. Percentage chance = 0.3333 * 100 ≈ 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

Next, he pays 10% tax on the cars. To calculate the tax, we multiply the total cost by 0.1: $240,000 * 0.1 = $24,000.

In addition to the tax, Mark also pays $1000 for registration on each car. For 12 cars, the total registration fee is 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000.

$276,000"
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem.

Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert on Monday, and Robert collects 20 shells. To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Monday, we add 5 to Robert's total. 
20 (Robert's shells) + 5 = 25 shells

Now, on Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. We multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2.
25 * 2 = 50

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden, and there were 50 ants. To find the number of bugs, we can simply divide the number of ants by 2.

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
= 50 / 2
= 25

Now, we add the number of bugs to the number of ants to find the total number of insects:
Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
= 25 + 50
= 75

Total number of insects: 75"
"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem. We have 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow, and we need to find out how many are left after some of them jump in the ocean and others go inside the cave.

First, let's calculate the number of penguins that jump in the ocean. Since one-third of them jump in, we can divide 36 by 3, which gives us 12 penguins.

Next, another one-third of the penguins go inside the cave to eat their dinner. Again, we divide 36 by 3, and we get 12 penguins.

Now, we need to find the total number of penguins that left sunbathing. We add the penguins that jumped in the ocean and those that went inside the cave: 12 + 12 = 24.

Finally, to find the number of penguins still left sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the original number: 36 - 24 = 12.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem of Steve's cherry tomato vines.

Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day, and his girlfriend eats half of what he eats, which is 3 tomatoes per day. To find their combined daily consumption, we add their individual consumption:

6 tomatoes/day (Steve) + 3 tomatoes/day (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes/day

Now, let's calculate their combined weekly consumption:

9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week

We know that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide their combined weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine:

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/week/vine = 21 vines

So, Steve needs 21 vines to meet their combined weekly consumption.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's figure out how many pizzas John needs to order for his friends.

First, we need to calculate the total number of slices required. There are 20 friends, and each friend needs 4 slices, so the total number of slices required is:
20 friends * 4 slices/friend = 80 slices

Now, since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, we can divide the total number of slices required by 8 to find the number of pizzas needed:
80 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas

John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem.

Ram buys 25 pens and uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low. He can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we'll consider the initial pens and the pens he makes from the empty ones.

Initially, Ram has 25 pens. When the ink runs low, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens. Now, he has 25 + 5 = 30 pens.

We can see a pattern emerging. Each time the ink runs low, Ram can make new pens from the empty ones. Let's calculate the total number of pens he can make.

We can represent the number of pens Ram has after each refill as a geometric series:

25 + 25/5 + 25/5^2 + 25/5^3 + ...

This is an infinite geometric series with the first term a = 25 and the common ratio r = 1/5. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula:

S = a / (1 - r)

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 25 / (1 - 1/5)
S = 25 / (4/5)
S = 25 * 5/4
S = 125/4
S = 31.25

However, we can't have a fraction of a pen, so we'll consider only the whole number part, which is 31. But this is not the total number of pens Ram gets to have. We need to add the initial 25 pens to this number.

Total pens = 25 + 31
Total pens = 56 + 25 (from the first refill) - 25 (initial pens already counted)
Total pens = 56

However, this is still not the correct answer. We need to consider the fact that Ram can make new pens from the empty ones multiple times.

Let's recalculate the total number of pens:

25 + 25/5 + 25/5^2 + 25/5^3 + ...

We can simplify this expression by multiplying both sides by 5:

125 + 25 + 25/5 + 25/5^2 + ...

Now, subtract the original expression from this new expression:

100 = 25 + 25/5 + 25/5^2 + ...

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Johnny starts with his allowance of $20 and adds an extra $10 to it. To find the total amount he has initially, we simply add these two values together: $20 + $10 = $30.

Now, we're told that this sum triples in a year. To find the final amount, we multiply the initial sum by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

So, after a year, Johnny has a total of $90.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Jessa is 20 years old. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years.

Now, Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years.

To find the sum of their ages, we add their individual ages together: 
20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that there were 1000 students in the school hall initially. After the meeting, 30% of the students left through exit A. To find the number of students who left through exit A, we'll calculate 30% of 1000.

Number of students who left through exit A = 30% of 1000
= 0.3 * 1000
= 300

Now, let's find the number of students remaining after 300 students left through exit A.

Number of students remaining = 1000 - 300
= 700

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B. To find the number of students who left through exit B, we'll calculate 3/5 of 700.

Number of students who left through exit B = 3/5 * 700
= 420

Now, let's find the number of students remaining after 420 students left through exit B.

Number of students remaining = 700 - 420
= 280

Since the rest of the students left through exit C, the number of students who left through exit C is 280.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. To find out how many candies Robert has, we can divide John's candies by 2: 54 / 2 = 27. So, Robert has 27 candies.

Now, we're told that James has 6 more candies than Robert. To find James' total, we add 6 to Robert's candies: 27 + 6 = 33. Therefore, James has 33 candies.

Finally, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We can do this by subtracting James' candies from John's candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

Dolly will read her 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so that's 3 books for Dolly.

Pandora will read her 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so that's 3 books for Pandora.

To find the total number of books they collectively read, we add the books read by Dolly and Pandora: 3 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike initially had 5 pen pals, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he's now pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of these 3 pen pals sends him 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. This means he writes 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week. Since each letter is 5 pages long, he writes a total of 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.

We're told that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find the total time he spends writing a week, we multiply the total number of pages he writes by the time it takes him to write a page: 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes.

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Jason's phone usage to find out how many minutes he has left.

Jason has a daily 15-minute call with his boss, and this month has 30 days. So, the total minutes used for these calls are:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

In addition to these daily calls, Jason had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. To find the total minutes used, we add these extra minutes to the daily calls:
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, let's subtract the total minutes used from Jason's monthly limit of 1000 minutes:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem and figure out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin.

Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Next, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. After Colby took his share, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.

Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, we can calculate the number of fries Ginger gave him. To do this, we subtract the number of fries Griffin had before Ginger gave him some from the total number of fries he ended up with: 27 - 7 = 20.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem. We have two aquariums with different numbers of snails - one has 4 snails and the other has 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can start by finding the difference in the number of snails.

The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

Now, we know that this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x. We can set up the equation: 2 * 2x = 28.

Combine like terms and solve for 'x': 
4x = 28
x = 28 / 4
x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total hours of makeup work required for the movie. The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, for 5 weeks. So, the total hours per week is 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week. For 5 weeks, the total hours would be 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost would be 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Since the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount would be 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount Jean paid. We subtract the discount from the total cost: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much each person paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies first. Isabelle spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on birthday presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags for the party guests.

Total cost = cost of cake + cost of presents + cost of decorations + cost of invitations + cost of goodie bags
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many cookies Sue and her sister ate. On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's find the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's sister: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue's sister: 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
Sue: 46 * 200 = 9200 calories

Now, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 3 classes with 20 students each, making a total of 3 * 20 = 60 students in the school. Given that the school has an equal number of boys and girls, we can divide the total number of students by 2 to find the number of boys and girls. So, there are 60 / 2 = 30 boys and 30 girls.

Now, let's look at the number of girls in each class. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls: 30 - (15 + 12) = 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls, we can find the number of boys by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in the class: 20 - 3 = 17.

First, we know that last night Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, for a total of 10 + 15 = 25 animals.

Now, let's calculate the number of animals he killed today. We know that he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say he killed x cougars. Then, he killed 3x wolves. We also know that he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so x = 15 - 3 = 12.

So, today Rick killed 3x = 3 * 12 = 36 wolves and 12 cougars, for a total of 36 + 12 = 48 animals.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. Now, subtract 9 from 30: 30 - 9 = 21. So, Anne went down the slide 21 times.

Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4: 21 * 4 = 84.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we have 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows initially is 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

However, the problem states that Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls. This implies that there are actually 20 stalls in total, not just 10. Since 10 stalls already have 20 cows each, the other 10 stalls must be empty initially.

Now, Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls. So, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

The 10 stalls that already had 20 cows each now have 20 + 2 = 22 cows each. The other 10 stalls, which were empty, now have 2 cows each.

To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we need to know which stalls we're considering. Since the problem doesn't specify, let's assume we're considering 8 of the stalls that initially had 20 cows each. In that case, the total number of cows in 8 stalls is 8 * 22 = 176.

Next, we have 20 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. Therefore, 20 dimes equal 20 * 10 cents = 200 cents, which is also $2.

Lastly, Brady has 40 pieces of dollar bills, and each bill is worth $1. So, 40 dollar bills equal 40 * $1 = $40.

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the tree.

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

However, termites ate 30% of the tree, so we need to subtract 30% of the total weight from the total weight.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds
Weight after termites ate 30% = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

In addition to the cost of the overdue books, Nancy also has to pay a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. To find the total amount she has to pay, we add the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee:

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate the total amount Peter paid for the popsicles and ice cream bars.

First, we'll find the cost of the popsicles. Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. He bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so the total cost of the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.

Now, let's add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid. $5 + $2 = $7.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem.

We know that a cobra has 70 spots, which is twice the number of spots on a mamba. To find the number of spots on a mamba, we can simply divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2.

Number of spots on a mamba = 70 / 2 = 35

Now, let's calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas.

Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70 = 2800
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35 = 2100
Total spots on all snakes = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

We're asked to find half the number of spots they all have combined. To do this, we'll divide the total number of spots by 2.

Half the number of spots = 4900 / 2 = 2450

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out the total number of people attending the soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so that's a total of 12 + 3 = 15 people.

In addition to the team members and coaches, each team member brings 2 guests. So, the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24.

Now, let's add the team members, coaches, and guests to get the total number of people attending: 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas are needed: 39 / 3 = 13.

Finally, we need to calculate the total amount Maddy will spend. Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount is 13 * 15 = 195.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and each gemstone is 1 inch long. To find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones, we multiply the number of gemstones by their length.

Total length of topaz gemstones = 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

Since each necklace is 25 inches long, we subtract the length of the topaz gemstones to find the length taken up by the sterling silver beads.

Length of sterling silver beads = 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Now, we know that each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we divide the total length of the beads by the length of each bead.

Number of sterling silver beads = 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. To find the total number of stories in the first week, we add these numbers together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120.

Now, let's calculate the number of stories each of them wrote in the second week. Since they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week, we multiply their first-week totals by 2:
Alani: 20 * 2 = 40 stories
Braylen: 40 * 2 = 80 stories
Margot: 60 * 2 = 120 stories

The total number of stories in the second week is 40 + 80 + 120 = 240.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the first-week and second-week totals: 120 + 240 = 360.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have a 76-star flag with three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

Three rows of 8 stars will have 3 * 8 = 24 stars, and two rows of 6 stars will have 2 * 6 = 12 stars. So, the total number of stars in these rows is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Now, let's subtract the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag. This will give us the number of stars in the 5-star rows: 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, we can divide the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows. So, 40 / 5 = 8 rows.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

To find the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

First, we'll find the total weight of the flagstones by multiplying the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone. 
Total weight of flagstones = Number of flagstones * Weight of each flagstone
Total weight of flagstones = 80 * 75
Total weight of flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, we'll divide the total weight of flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck to find the number of trucks needed.
Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of each truck
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

So, the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip is 3."
"Hello, I'm Aparna. To solve this problem, we need to find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane.

First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance of 480 miles.

time = distance / speed
time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
time = 16 hours

Together, Ali and Izzy have a total of 22 + 17 = 39 medals. Now, it's given that they have 10 times less medals than the total number of medals given out for counting. To find the total number of medals given out, we need to multiply the number of medals Ali and Izzy have by 10.

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 * 39 = 390.

There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. To find out the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get, we multiply the number of adults by the number of chocolate bars each adult gets: 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars will be shared equally among them. To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Susan's earnings from her online task.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so we subtract that from the total time: 
3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, we convert 2.5 hours to minutes: 
2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 10: 
150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15

First, let's calculate the points for each player:
Mike has 21 points.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, in the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Mike and Tony have over 20 points, so they each get 1 extra point. Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.

After the extra points have been distributed, the total points for each player are:
Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
Jim: 18 points (no change)
Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

The total points for all three players after the extra points have been distributed is: 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

First, let's find the age of the youngest son. Since he's half as old as the oldest, he's 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Now, let's add the ages of the two sons to find the total number of oranges they washed: 8 (oldest son) + 4 (youngest son) = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, so the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Darren's exercise routine for the first two days.

On the first day, Darren did 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

On the second day, he increased his pushups by 20, so that's 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. He did 10 fewer squats, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats. For dumbbell presses, he doubled the number, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

Now, let's add up the total number of activities for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much rice each person consumes in a day. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal and there are two meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

Now, we multiply this by the number of people in the household, which is 5:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To find the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Finally, we divide the total weight of the rice bag (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

- Carmen bids $250 + $50 = $300.
- The second person bids $300 + $50 = $350.
- Carmen bids $350 + $50 = $400.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year. John's work is 30 miles away, and he goes to work and back each day, so the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 * 5 = 300 miles. He does this for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 300 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total cost per year for miles driven. John gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost per year for miles driven is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

In addition to the cost per mile, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem of determining the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid.

When creating a simple folding newspaper or tabloid, the pages are arranged in a specific way. The paper is folded vertically, and the pages are printed on both the front and back. To figure out the number of pieces of paper used, we need to consider how the pages are paired.

Imagine the paper being folded and unfolded. You'll notice that the pages are paired in a way that the front and back of each pair are visible when the paper is folded. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them up as follows:

Page 1 (left back) and Page 2 (left front)
Page 3 (left back) and Page 4 (left front)
...
Page 31 (right back) and Page 32 (right front)

Notice that each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper. To find the number of pieces of paper used, we can divide the total number of pages by 2, but that's not the correct approach in this case.

A better way to think about it is to consider the number of pairs of pages that can be printed on a single piece of paper. Since each piece of paper has a front and back, we can print two pages on each side. This means we need 16 pieces of paper to print 32 pages, but that's still not the correct answer.

The correct approach is to realize that the pages are arranged in a way that requires 8 pieces of paper for the front and 8 pieces of paper for the back, but these are the same 8 pieces of paper, just viewed from different sides.

60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks (8 pounds), we need to divide the total weight by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks.

Since Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, to lose 8 pounds, it will take her 8 / 2 * 4 = 16 weeks.

Next, he buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so the total cost of the suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150.

The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that amount is $500. Adding the extra $700, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total expenses: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so we subtract his total expenses from his budget and then subtract the amount he wants to save: $6000 - $1950 = $4050, and then $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

We also know that the number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, which is D/2.

Since the total number of players is 105, we can set up an equation:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify, let's multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

Next, his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find this, we multiply 20 by 2/5, which is 8 marbles.

Now, we add the marbles his father gave him to the marbles he already had: 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156."
"Hello there, I'm Aparna. To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet and then multiply it by the cost per cubic foot.

The volume of the pool is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth. Given that the pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, we can calculate the volume as follows:
Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Now, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot, which is $0.1. 
Cost = volume * cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * 0.1
Cost = 12

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys. To find the number of girls, we multiply the number of boys by 3:
Number of girls = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we're told there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find this number, we multiply the number of boys by 1/10:
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children:
Total children = 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 pole / 3 wires = x poles / 45 wires

We can then cross-multiply and solve for x:

3x = 45
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of people who left the party. Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as 1/4 * 40 = 10.

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of men who left, we subtract the number of men who stayed from the initial number of men: 25 - 22 = 3.

This means that the remaining 7 people who left must be women (since 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men).

To find the number of women who stayed, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women: 15 - 7 = 8.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. To find out how many pencils are in each box, we subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total: 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in the boxes.

Since there are 3 boxes, we divide the total pencils in the boxes by 3 to find out how many pencils each box can hold: 24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils, so together they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold: 72 / 8 = 9.

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem. Shannon's iced coffee is cooled by 13 degrees for each ice cube added, and it also becomes 12 milliliters weaker. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need to determine how many ice cubes are required. 

65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker. Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

Total weakening = 60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters

To find out how many old records they brought in, we can use the trade-in ratio. Since 1 new record is traded for 2 old records, we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to get the total number of old records.

So, 7 new records would be traded for 7 * 2 = 14 old records.

The final answer is: 14"
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of junior programmers. Since they make up 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as 2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Now, to find the number of senior programmers, we subtract the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees: 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Next, we know that junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their salary is $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

Finally, we add these two amounts together to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that at the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. This means the net change at the second stop is 8 - 7 = 1.

Now, let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x. At the first stop, 5 more people got in, making the total x + 5. Then, at the second stop, the net change was 1, so the total number of people heading to the third stop is x + 5 + 1 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

Subtracting 6 from both sides gives us:

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Oscar's lollipop adventure step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school. That leaves him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes out 14 lollipops to his friends, so he's left with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave away 14, he buys 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has a total of 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, Oscar enjoys 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he's left with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To determine how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge needed and then multiply it by the time it takes to charge 1 percentage-point.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%). Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, it will take 40 * 3 minutes to charge the remaining 40%.

40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem to determine which job has a higher net pay rate.

First, we'll calculate the net income for Job A. The gross income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year, which equals $30,000/year. With a 20% total tax rate, the taxes would be $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. So, the net income for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Now, let's calculate the net income for Job B. The gross income is $42,000/year, and there's a $6,000 property tax. After deducting the property tax, the net income before tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. With a 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax, the taxes would be $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. Therefore, the net income for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Since Job B has a higher net income, we need to find the difference between the two net incomes. The difference is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have a class of 200 students divided into 3 groups. Two of the groups have an equal number of students, and the third group, which is the smallest, has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups.

Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. The smallest group then has x - 10 students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up an equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, and they're all either chickens or cows. He has twice as many chickens as cows. To start, let's say the number of cows is x. Since he has twice as many chickens, the number of chickens is 2x.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of animals:
x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:
3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 20

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2x = 2(20) = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs. 
Total legs = (number of cows * 4) + (number of chickens * 2)

Morgan has a budget of $90 for her party. She wants to make sure each guest, including herself, gets to play one round of mini-golf ($5), have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice ($10 per ride). 

First, let's calculate the total cost per person:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts (2 rides): $10 * 2 = $20
Total cost per person: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, let's divide the total budget by the cost per person to find out how many people Morgan can invite in total:
$90 / $30 = 3

Since Morgan is also attending the party, we need to subtract 1 from the total number of people:
3 - 1 = 2

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Marisa's savings.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day, and she buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each. To find out how much she spends on lollipops, we need to calculate the total cost. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 25 cents is $0.25. So, the total cost of lollipops is:
4 * $0.25 = $1

Now, let's subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 - $1 = $4

Marisa saves $4 each day. To find out how much she saves in 5 days, we multiply her daily savings by 5:
$4 * 5 = $20

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem and figure out how many pounds of candy Billy bought.

We know Billy spent half his change on 40 gumballs, which cost $.05 each. To find the total cost of the gumballs, we multiply the number of gumballs by the cost per gumball: 40 * .05 = $2.

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, the total change he had must have been 2 * 2 = $4.

Now, let's think about the initial amount Billy had. His father gave him $10, and after buying candy, he had $4 in change. So, the amount he spent on candy is 10 - 4 = $6.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, and Billy spent $6 on it. To find the number of pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount spent by the cost per pound: 6 / 1.5 = 4.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Carver is 45 years old, and his age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. To find the son's age, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the son's age as 'x'. The equation would be:

45 = 2x - 5

Now, let's solve for 'x'. First, we'll add 5 to both sides of the equation:

50 = 2x

Next, we'll divide both sides by 2:

25 = x

So, the son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The train travels between three cities, covering 75 miles from the first city to the second, 100 miles from the second to the third, and then a certain distance back to the first city. This distance is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip three times a day, the total daily distance is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we'll divide the total distance by the daily distance: 18,000 / 900 = 20.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of dog bed and then calculate the total amount needed.

First, let's find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, which is the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. The average is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. For the chihuahua beds, we need 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing. For the collie beds, we need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

The total amount of stuffing needed is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down John's trip to calculate the total time taken.

First, we need to find the time taken for John to drive to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the total distance is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. He drives at a speed of 70 mph. To find the time taken, we divide the distance by the speed: 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate the time taken for John to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. Again, we divide the distance by the speed: 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

To find the total time taken for the trip, we add the time taken for each part of the trip: 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that there are 96 fourth-graders at Small Tree School, out of which 43 are girls. To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.

Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls
Number of boys = 96 - 43
Number of boys = 53

Now, we're told that 4 fourth-grade boys were absent on Friday. To find the number of boys present, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

Number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of boys absent
Number of boys present = 53 - 4
Number of boys present = 49

Jane scored 15 points on her first test and 18 points on her second test. So, the total points she has scored so far is 15 + 18 = 33.

Since she needs a total of at least 42 points to pass, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total required: 42 - 33 = 9.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. Then, we're told that a number equal to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. So, we calculate that as 4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

Next, we're told that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. That's 3 * 7 = 21.

Now, let's add up the number of people kicked out for these reasons: 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31.

We're given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the given reasons from the total: 50 - 31 = 19.

We know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. To find out how many points Erin has now, we can multiply Sara's points by 3.

Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's points
Erin's current points = 3 * 8
Erin's current points = 24

Now, we are given that Erin scored 14 points. To find out how many points Erin had before, we can subtract 14 from her current points.

Erin's points before = Erin's current points - 14
Erin's points before = 24 - 14

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames. Since each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to add the cost of etching the logo on each frame, which is an additional 20% of the frame's cost. This comes out to be 0.2 * $880 = $176. So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is $880 + $176 = $1056.

Now, let's consider the pins. Only 2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. Therefore, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Moving on to the cords, 1/4 of the seniors are officers and will receive cords that cost $12 each. Since there are 44 seniors, 1/4 of them is 44 / 4 = 11 seniors. The total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Finally, we add up the costs of the picture frames with etching, the pins, and the cords to get the total cost of the senior gifts: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of pairs sold each day to find the total number of pairs sold:
14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs

Since each pair contains 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100 shoes.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each half. Since there are 30 sheep in total, half of them is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the milk from the first half. 15 sheep give 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

Next, let's calculate the milk from the other half. 15 sheep give 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

The total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 45 kg.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be: 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18, so her total profit will be: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells 4 cups per hour, the total number of hours she spends running the stand is: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Next, we're told the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Let's calculate that.

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Now, we just need to add up the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to get the total.

Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48
Total number of bugs = 168

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Erica is 30 years old. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age by adding 5 to Erica's age: 30 + 5 = 35 years.

Now, we're told Alice is 7 years older than Beth. To find Alice's age, we add 7 to Beth's age: 35 + 7 = 42 years.

The question asks for the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages. To find this, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age: 42 - 30 = 12 years.

First, we need to find out the total ounces of milk John drank. Since he had 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces, the total ounces of milk he drank is:
2 glasses * 8 ounces/glass = 16 ounces

Now, we know that milk has 3 calories per ounce. To find the total calories John consumed, we multiply the total ounces of milk by the calories per ounce:
16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The builder works 4 weeks every month and 6 days every week. To find the total number of days he works in a month, we multiply the number of weeks by the number of days per week:
4 weeks/month * 6 days/week = 24 days/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of days he works in a month by 12 to get the total number of days he works in a year:
24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year

Now, let's calculate his total earnings in a year. The builder earns $50 per day, so we multiply the total number of days he works in a year by his daily wage:
288 days/year * $50/day = $14,400/year

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's get to the problem at hand. Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies, and we need to figure out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk he needs to buy.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. So, for a quadruple batch, Mark will need 3 * 4 = 12 cups of flour and 1 * 4 = 4 cups of milk.

Now, let's see how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy. Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so he'll need 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour. Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so he'll need 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we simply subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day, which means the air conditioner consumes 900 watts of energy every hour. To find the total energy consumption per day, we multiply the power rating by the number of hours it's used.

Energy consumption per day = Power rating * Time
= 900 watts * 8 hours
= 7200 watt-hours

Since we want the answer in kilowatts, we'll convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours by dividing by 1000 (1 kilowatt = 1000 watts).

Energy consumption per day = 7200 watt-hours / 1000
= 7.2 kilowatt-hours

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new usage time becomes 8 - 5 = 3 hours.

New energy consumption per day = Power rating * New time
= 900 watts * 3 hours
= 2700 watt-hours
= 2.7 kilowatt-hours

To find the energy saved per day, we subtract the new energy consumption from the original energy consumption.

Energy saved per day = Original energy consumption - New energy consumption
= 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours
= 4.5 kilowatt-hours

Finally, to find the energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30.

Energy saved in 30 days = Energy saved per day * 30
= 4.5 kilowatt-hours * 30
= 135 kilowatt-hours

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We have four zebras with different numbers of stripes. Two of them have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. Another zebra has 36 stripes, and the last one has half that many, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up all the stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes in total.

To find the average number of stripes, we need to divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras. There are 4 zebras, so the average is 88 / 4 = 22.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Tyson needs to make muffaletta sandwiches for 20 people, and each sandwich serves 4 people. To find out how many sandwiches he needs to make, we'll divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves: 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, Tyson will need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost 5 * $7.00 = $35.00. The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.

To find the total cost, we'll add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis initially, and he has 40 cannolis. To find the number of corns, we multiply the number of cannolis by 2. So, Allan has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis, making the total number of cannolis 40 + 60 = 100.

He also buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, which means he buys 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Now, we add the initial number of corns to the newly bought corns: 80 + 60 = 140 corns.

Finally, we find the combined total of corns and cannolis by adding the two: 140 + 100 = 240.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Elliott's steps to figure out how many he took during his jog.

Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps with his friend. So, before the jog, he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that before the jog, he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps taken.

Now, we subtract the steps taken before the jog from the total steps taken before the jog and after the jog: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

First, we need to find out how many words are in the book. The book is 45 pages long, and it averages 200 words per page. So, the total number of words in the book is:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Toby to read the book. Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find the time it takes him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time Toby needs is:
30 minutes (to read the book) + 10 minutes (to get to the airport) = 40 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport. To find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the total time he needs from the time he has:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount paid to the employees in May. The company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

Now, let's move on to June. 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600. The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we add the total amount paid in May and June: $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each. The total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up all her expenses: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage: 20% of $1200 is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

However, 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. If she makes 50000 candles, we need to find out how many of them will both smell like wet dog and explode.

First, we need to find the number of candles that will explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% will explode. 

Number of candles that will explode = 1% of 50000
= 0.01 * 50000
= 500

Now, let's find the number of candles that will smell like wet dog. 5% of the more dangerous candles (which are the ones that explode) will smell like wet dog. 

Number of candles that will smell like wet dog = 5% of the number of candles that will explode
= 0.05 * 500

Therefore, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Joanne's apples + Sister's apples = 500
(30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500

Combine like terms:

(45 + x) + 105 = 500

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We have a herd consisting of camels and dromedaries. We know that there are 180 heads in total and 304 humps. Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each. We need to find the number of dromedaries.

Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the equation:
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Since there are 304 humps in total, we can write the equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now, we can substitute c = 124 into the first equation to find d:
124 + d = 180
d = 56

The number of dromedaries is 56."
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Tom's trip to calculate the total distance he traveled.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first four days. To find this distance, we calculate 30% of 800 km, which is 0.3 * 800 = 240 km.

On the 7th day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance covered on that day is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

Cole bought two pairs of jeans, tattered and jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is 1/3 * $6 = $2. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we add the savings to the sale price: $22 + $2 = $24.

To find the original price of the tattered jeans, we add the savings to the sale price: $28 + $4 = $32.

The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, we subtract the original price of the jogger jeans from the original price of the tattered jeans: $32 - $24 = $8. However, since the jogger jeans cost less, we express this as a negative difference.

The jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling his cards. Since he spent $100 on the ticket and had $50 left, he must have made $150.

Now, let's divide the total amount of money he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5) to find the number of cards he sold:

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

However, this is the number of cards he sold, not the number he started with. We know that he kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with ""x"". Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3x.

We know that 2/3x = 100, so we can solve for x:

2/3x = 100
x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26. 

Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

First, we need to find out how many gallons of gas were in each container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can divide 15 by 5.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Now, Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. To find out how many gallons that is, we can multiply 3 gallons by 1/4.

1/4 * 3 gallons = 0.75 gallons

Finally, we need to convert 0.75 gallons to pints. Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we can multiply 0.75 gallons by 8.

0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. To find out how much he actually spent, we need to calculate 99% of $5. We can do this by multiplying $5 by 0.99, which gives us $4.95. Converting this to cents, we get 495 cents.

Now, let's calculate how much George spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x 40 = 120 cents on chips.

To find out how much he spent on candy bars, we subtract the amount spent on chips from the total amount spent: 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we can find out how many candy bars George bought by dividing the remaining amount spent (375 cents) by the cost of a candy bar (75 cents): 375 / 75 = 5.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

Ray had 25 lollipops and decided to keep 5 for himself. To find out how many lollipops he shared, we subtract the number of lollipops he kept from the total number of lollipops.

25 (total lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept) = 20 lollipops

Now, Ray shared these 20 lollipops equally among his 4 friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends.

20 (lollipops shared) ÷ 4 (number of friends) = 5

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's get to the problem at hand. We have a cake that weighs 20 ounces, cut into 8 equal pieces. If Rory and her mom each have a piece, we need to find the weight of the remaining cake.

First, we'll find the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight by the number of pieces:

20 ounces ÷ 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece

Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, they ate a total of 2 pieces. To find the weight of the eaten cake, we multiply the number of pieces eaten by the weight of each piece:

2 pieces × 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces

Now, we subtract the weight of the eaten cake from the total weight to find the weight of the remaining cake:

20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces

There are 2 people (Sitti and Juris) and 6 friends, making a total of 8 people. Now, let's divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people = 56 / 8 = 7.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount. So, he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

In addition to the onions, he needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are also on sale for $2.00 a box. The total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the ingredients. The total cost is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings. The cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

We know that Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's drive. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Now, let's find the difference in their travel times. Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes, and Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, so the difference is 16 - 4 = 12 minutes.

However, Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so we need to add this extra time to the difference in their travel times. Therefore, Bernadette should leave 12 + 5 = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We're given that the area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet, and the length of his room is 3 yards. To find the perimeter of the room in feet, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, we can convert the length as follows:

Length (in feet) = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, while Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. We need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other.

First, let's calculate the total number of packs each sister bought. Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = 3 packs, and Margareth bought 3 + 4 = 7 packs.

Since each pack contains 20 beads, we multiply the number of packs by 20 to find the total number of beads:
Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads.
Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

Now, let's find out how many more beads one sister has than the other. We subtract the smaller number from the larger number:
140 (Margareth's beads) - 60 (Elizabeth's beads) = 80 beads.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Marcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase from baking is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees. Adding this to the initial temperature, we get 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equal to 3 intervals of 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease is 2 * 3 = 6 degrees. Subtracting this from the temperature after baking, we get 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

First, we need to calculate Jon's total time for the triathlon. 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Now, let's calculate James' time for the swim and bike ride. 
- James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. 
- 10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
- James' swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes
- James took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. 
- James' bike ride time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' time for the run:
- James' total time: 180 minutes
- James' swim and bike time: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes
- James' run time: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Movie C is 1.25 hours long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour.

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we're told Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B.

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

Finally, we know Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

Movie A = Movie B / 4
Movie A = 80 minutes / 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how far Michael's horse runs. We know the horse runs for 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour. To calculate the distance, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance: 
Distance = speed * time = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay.

The cost of the hay is 8 bails * $3 per bail = $24.

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30.

The change he has after buying the hay is $30 - $24 = $6.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the super ticket costs $20 and includes a movie ticket, popcorn, and a soda for an additional $1. So, the total cost of the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

On the other hand, if you buy a regular ticket, it costs $12, and you also need to buy popcorn and a soda. The soda costs $3, and let's assume the regular price of popcorn is x.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket option is $21 - $2 = $19.

We can set up an equation to represent the total cost of the regular ticket option: $12 (ticket) + $3 (soda) + x (popcorn) = $19.

Combine the constants: $12 + $3 = $15.

Now, the equation becomes: $15 + x = $19.

Subtract $15 from both sides: x = $4.

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

The total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances: 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

He buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds. The farmer also buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds. Lastly, he buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's solve for 'x'. First, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x/2 = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides by 2:

x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to get his 5 cookies.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras is, we need to first convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit.

The shark is 10 feet long, which is equal to 10 * 12 = 120 inches. The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we can calculate the percentage by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiplying by 100:

(12 / 120) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, which means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. Given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, we can set up an equation to find the total number of students.

Let's represent the total number of students as 'x'. Since one-fourth of the students do not have desktop computers, we can write the equation as:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jason wants to break in his new shoes in three weeks, and he can walk 4 days a week. To find out how many days he has in total, we multiply the number of weeks by the number of days he can walk per week:
3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days

Now, we know it takes 240 minutes of walking to break in the shoes. To find out how long Jason needs to walk each day, we divide the total walking time by the total number of days:
240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem. Sarah spent $300 on books, and each book costs $15. To find out how many books she bought, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost per book.

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Now, since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 9 kids allergic to dairy and 6 kids allergic to peanuts. However, 3 kids are allergic to both, so we can't simply add the two numbers together. If we do, we'll be counting those 3 kids twice.

To avoid this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts, and then subtract the number of kids allergic to both: 9 + 6 - 3 = 12.

This gives us the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one thing. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class: 32 - 12 = 20.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides, then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of employees. There are 3 groups with 200 employees in each group. So, the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600.

Next, we'll find the total number of tour guides. Each group has 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups. So, the total number of tour guides is 3 * 7 = 21.

Now, let's add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour. 600 + 21 = 621.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To calculate the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, we need to consider the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and since Tom is traveling with his wife, the total cost of the tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel's normal price is $1500 per day, but it's 20% more expensive due to the busy weekend. To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. So, the hotel's price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

Since they're staying for 3 days, the total hotel cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Now, let's add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

We know Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, which means Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Now, let's calculate the number of tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes: 2 + 9 = 11.

We have two kinds of pennies, a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we need to find the combined weight of the two pennies.

First, let's find the weight of the 2010 penny. Since it's three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies:
Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 + 48
Combined weight = 84

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

Stetson made a bet with Alec that he would give up $10 for each orange he eats. While at the farm, Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked. If they picked 60 oranges, we need to calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up.

First, let's find out how many oranges Stetson ate. To do this, we'll multiply the total number of oranges by the fraction he ate: (2/5) * 60. 

To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator (2) by the whole number (60), and then divide by the denominator (5). So, (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 oranges.

Now that we know Stetson ate 24 oranges, we can calculate the total amount of money he gave up. Since he gave up $10 for each orange, we multiply the number of oranges by $10: 24 * $10 = $240.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much oats each horse consumes in a day. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and they are fed twice a day, the total amount of oats consumed by each horse per day is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

Now, Uncle Ben has 4 horses, so the total amount of oats consumed by all the horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find out how much oats they consume in 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Finally, since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats consumed in 5 days by the weight of one bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have a total of 8 razors.

To find the total number of oranges they have, we add Ashley's and Brianne's oranges together: 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we divide the total number of oranges by 3 to find out how many pies they can make: 120 / 3 = 40.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem at hand. Mark is trying to decide between two venues for a surprise party, and we need to figure out how many guests it would take for the costs of both venues to be equal.

The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, plus $5 per guest for food. The second venue, on the other hand, charges $25 per guest, with food included.

To find the break-even point, we can set up an equation. Let's say the number of guests is 'x'. The total cost for the first venue would be $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost). The total cost for the second venue would be $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want the costs to be equal, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for x:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

So, the two venues would be equal in cost if there are 10 guests.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's get to the problem at hand. Mariah and her grandma used some yarn, and we need to figure out how many yards they used in total.

First, we know that Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we can calculate the yards used by each of them.

Mariah used 1/4 of 364 yards, which is 364 * 1/4 = 91 yards.

Her grandma used 1/2 of 364 yards, which is 364 * 1/2 = 182 yards.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma: 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards.

We know the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. So, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Now, we're told the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. To find the length of the couch, we add 2 feet to this: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

Since Suzie paid $7 in all, the total cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost by 2, as there are two packs. So, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $4 / 2 = $2.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem and find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make.

To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, we need to find the most cost-effective option. We have two types of wood: 2 x 4 and 2 x 8. The 2 x 4 costs $4 and gives 200 sticks, while the 2 x 8 costs $6 and gives 400 sticks.

Let's calculate the number of sticks per dollar for each option:
For 2 x 4 wood: 200 sticks / $4 = 50 sticks per dollar
For 2 x 8 wood: 400 sticks / $6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar

Clearly, the 2 x 8 wood is the better option, giving us more sticks per dollar. Now, let's see how many 2 x 8 woods Frederick can buy with his $24 budget:
$24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 wood gives 400 sticks, we multiply the number of 2 x 8 woods by the number of sticks per wood:
4 * 400 = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"

To find the total number of pairs needed, we multiply the number of dogs by the number of pairs per dog: 6 dogs * 2 pairs/dog = 12 pairs.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so we multiply the total number of pairs by the cost per pair: 12 pairs * $12/pair = $144.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the information given in the problem.

We know the farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

On the other hand, the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, which means the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at both the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

To find the combined total, we add the number of animals at the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

Now, let's subtract this amount from her initial $500: $500 - $100 = $400. This is the amount she has left after buying clothes.

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To calculate this, I'll multiply $400 by 0.25, which gives me $100. So, she spent another $100 on CDs.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know that the house costs three times as much as the lot. To make things easier, let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. This means the cost of the house is 3x.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:
x + 3x = 120,000

Combine the x terms:
4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4 to find the value of x:
x = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we multiply x by 3 to find the cost of the house:
3 * 30,000 = 90,000

Since she's dividing the raisins equally among the three, she'll use 1/3 of the raisins for the cookies. So, 1/3 of 27 cups is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Now, we know that a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make with 9 cups of raisins, we can divide 9 by 3/4.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device. Her current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour, and the new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption after adding the new device will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh):
Daily consumption before: 12 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 288 kWh
Daily consumption after: 14 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 336 kWh

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption:
Weekly consumption before: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
Weekly consumption after: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour, so we multiply the weekly consumption by the cost:
Weekly cost before: 2016 kWh * $1.50 = $3024
Weekly cost after: 2352 kWh * $1.50 = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is:

On the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer is 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get on the bus. The total number of passengers is now:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66

The number of passengers after the second stop is 66."
"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down this problem step by step.

First, we know Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. To find his current age, we subtract 5 from 27, which gives us 22.

Now, let's fast-forward 8 years. Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 2 * 30 = 60. So, Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 from 55, which gives us 47.

The difference in their current ages is 47 - 22 = 25.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400. The computer cost $1,100, and he paid $400 less for the printer than the computer. To find the cost of the printer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer: $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

Since the total cost of all three items is $2,400, we can find the cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the cost of the computer and printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Finally, to find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of 2 monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 20 kids divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, so there are 10 boys and 10 girls. The boys went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each. To find the total number of shells brought by the boys, we multiply the number of boys by the number of shells each boy brought: 10 x 60 = 600.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shells brought by the girls. The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be represented as: 600 + (4 x 600) = 600 + 2400 = 3000.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find the number of seashells brought by each girl: 3000 / 10 = 300.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We know Chenny is 10 years old, and Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. To find Alyana's age, we subtract 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4 years
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6 years

Now, we know Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. To find Anne's age, we add 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2 years
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8 years

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate the total thickness of the four books.

The first book is 31 mm thick, and the second book is 50 mm thick. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, which makes it 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together: 
31 + 50 = 81

126 + 62 = 188

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

First, we need to calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. To do this, we multiply the bill amount by 0.20.

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Since you're splitting the bill with your wife, you'll pay half of the original bill. 

Half of the original bill = $50 / 2 = $25

Now, add the half of the bill and the tip.

First, we need to find out how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys. To do this, we divide $18 by 3, which gives us $6 per boy.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

However, he spends $8, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13. After saving some more, he triples the amount he had left. To find the new amount, we multiply $13 by 3.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Elvis's savings plan for April. He wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he saves in the first half to hit his target of $1125.

Since April has 30 days, we can divide it into two halves of 15 days each. Let's assume Elvis saves 'x' dollars per day in the first half. Then, he'll save 2x dollars per day in the second half.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half. We can set up an equation to represent this:

15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Combine like terms:
15x + 30x = 1125
45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So, Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2x = 2 * 25 = 50 dollars per day in the second half.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate the change Verna received after buying fruits.

First, we need to find the total cost of the fruits. Verna bought three apples at $1.50 each, so the cost of apples is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50. She also bought five oranges at $0.80 each, so the cost of oranges is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00. Additionally, she bought six peaches at $0.75 each, so the cost of peaches is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the cost of all the fruits: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

We know that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, and they're dividing 100 dollars between them. To start, let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

The total amount they're dividing is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

So Brad gets 20 dollars, and Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Elise's alphabet-writing adventure.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, writing it twice results in 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so that's 13 more letters.

Now, Elise re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the initial 52 letters and the additional 13 letters, totaling 52 + 13 = 65 letters re-written.

To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters from each step: 52 (initial) + 13 (half) + 65 (re-written) = 130 letters.

Weight lost per month: 10 pounds
Total months: 3
Total weight lost: 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we know Mark's final weight was 70 pounds. To find his initial weight, we add the total weight lost to his final weight.

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

Now, we're told that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this total. Let's use a variable, x, to represent the number of toys Jonathan currently has. We can set up an equation:

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The cost of 1 calculator is $12
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10

Now, let's add these costs together:

$8 + $12 = $20
$20 + $10 = $30

The total cost before the discount is $30.

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1 (which is the same as 10%):

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem.

We know that Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold. When the water is warm, he takes 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. To find the time it takes him to swim a mile in warm water, we first calculate twice the time it takes in cold water, which is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim in hot water, we'll assume that the time for warm water is the same as the time for hot water, which is 34 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each. That's a straightforward calculation: 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00.

Now, let's look at the costs. The food truck spends $3.00 on a loaf of bread, which makes 10 sandwiches. They also spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for every 10 sandwiches. So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $70.00 (revenue) - $33.00 (cost) = $37.00.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem at hand. Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, and she wants to melt 8 small pieces of crayons together to make a muffin crayon. To find out how much money she can make, we need to calculate the total number of muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that by the selling price.

First, let's find the total number of crayons Kate has:
3 boxes * 64 crayons per box = 192 crayons

Since each muffin requires 8 small pieces of crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:
192 crayons / 8 crayons per muffin = 24 muffins

Now, we multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin to find the total amount of money Kate can make:
24 muffins * $1.50 per muffin = $36

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal of the old carpet, and installation of the new carpet.

First, we need to find the area of the bedroom. The area is calculated by multiplying the length and width of the room. In this case, the area is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

Now, let's calculate the cost of each component:

- The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot * 216 square feet = $2592.
- The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot * 216 square feet = $432.
- The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot * 216 square feet = $864.
- The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot * 216 square feet = $7344.

Finally, we add up the costs to find the total cost: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate the average number of birds Mack saw per day.

First, we need to find the total number of birds he saw over the week. On days one and two, Mack saw 50 birds. On day three, he didn't see any birds. Then, on days four and five, he spotted 120 birds. On day six, he saw 20 birds, and on day seven, he saw 90 birds.

Now, let's add up the total number of birds: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds.

Since Mack observed birds over 7 days, we'll divide the total number of birds by 7 to find the average. 

Average birds per day = Total birds / Number of days

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step to find the final value of the number train.

We start with a value of 20. The first operation is to add half of this value to itself. Half of 20 is 10, so we add 10 to 20, giving us 30.

Next, we divide 30 by 5, which equals 6.

Now, we need to multiply 6 by the starting value minus 12. The starting value is 20, and 20 minus 12 is 8. So, we multiply 6 by 8.

6 * 8 = 48

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's tackle this problem together.

Maggie's oven is malfunctioning, and we need to figure out the correct temperature setting for her recipe. When she sets it to 450, the actual temperature is 468. This means her oven is running hotter than it should be.

To determine the percentage by which her oven is off, we'll calculate the difference between the actual and set temperatures, then divide by the set temperature.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18. Now, let's find the percentage: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%. So, her oven is running 4% hotter than the set temperature.

Now, we need to find the correct temperature setting for Maggie's recipe, which calls for 520 degrees. Let's call the correct setting 'x'. Since her oven is 4% hotter, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

We know the actual temperature should be 520, so we can set up the equation: x + 0.04x = 520. Combining like terms, we get 1.04x = 520.

Dividing both sides by 1.04, we find that x = 500.

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

First, let's look at the first movie. It's 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the total time for the first movie is 60 minutes + 30 minutes, which equals 90 minutes.

Now, let's move on to the second movie. It's 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the hours to minutes, we get 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes. Adding the 5 minutes, the total time for the second movie is 120 minutes + 5 minutes, which equals 125 minutes.

Finally, we add the time for both movies: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value is $76,000. To find 30% of this value, we multiply it by 0.3. 
30% of Herb's house value: 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Now, we subtract this value from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value.
Juan's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we can calculate the combined value of the two houses:

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of utensils:

Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36
Her friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84
Total utensils: 36 + 84 = 120

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of one box of contacts after the discount. The original price is $100.00, and it's 10% off. To calculate the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price: $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, we multiply the discounted price by 2: $90.00 * 2 = $180.00.

Next, we need to find the total number of contacts in 2 boxes. One box contains 90 contacts, so 2 boxes contain 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

Now, we can calculate the cost of each contact by dividing the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

Since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the cost of each pair of contacts is: $1.00 * 2 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate John's total hours. He worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which means he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. On Sunday, he worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours. In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Since they are paid $10 an hour, we can calculate their earnings. Jill earned 3 * $10 = $30, and John earned 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned, we divide the total calories by 200. 1600 / 200 = 8.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem at hand. We have a jar containing red, blue, and green jelly beans at the Burger Palace restaurant. The note on the jar states that it contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. We're also given that the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500.

To solve this problem, let's assume the number of blue jelly beans is B. Then, the number of red jelly beans would be 0.99B (1% fewer than blue) and the number of green jelly beans would be 1.01B (1% more than blue).

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of jelly beans:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:

Protein content per gram of mushrooms: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms

Now, we can multiply this by the amount John eats per day, which is 200 grams.

Protein content per day: 0.03 grams/gram * 200 grams = 6 grams of protein per day

To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we multiply the daily protein content by 7.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. To represent this mathematically, let's use 'x' to denote Jerry's current age. Five years ago, Jerry's age would be 'x - 5'. Since he's twice as old now, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:
x = 2x - 10

Now, let's solve for 'x'. Subtracting 'x' from both sides gives us:
0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we find:
10 = x

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find his age in 3 years, we simply add 3 to his current age:

We're given that the three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. One angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle. To find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we can start by denoting the smallest angle as x.

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x. Now, we can write an equation based on the fact that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of rotations per month. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so we multiply the rotations per mile by the miles driven per month:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of rotations per year:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can divide the total number of rotations by the rotations per year:

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings. This means the bottle will give 120 * 2 = 240 pumps in total.

Now, let's calculate the cost of each pump. The cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is 2400 cents.

First, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, so we multiply the amount of butter needed for 1 dozen by 4:
4 * 1/4 pound = 1 pound per day

Now, since Juan wants to make croissants for a week, which has 7 days, we multiply the daily amount of butter by 7:
1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To find the cost difference, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street.

First, let's calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street. Since it costs $194 per meter and her street is 150 meters long, the total cost is 150 * $194 = $29,100.

Next, let's calculate the cost of repaving Lewis' street. His street is 490 meters long, so the total cost is 490 * $194 = $95,060.

Now, to find the cost difference, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

John initially received $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. To find the monthly funding for the first 5 months, we divide the initial funding by the number of months: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial monthly funding, which is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

The cost for the remaining 45 months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team.

The first player had a 6-ounce steak. The second player enjoyed 8 beef tips, with each tip weighing an ounce, so that's 8 ounces. The third player opted for a one-pound steak, which is equivalent to 16 ounces.

To find the total, we'll add the ounces of meat consumed by these three players: 
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they didn't contribute to the total meat consumption.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour, and he works for 10 hours a day. To find out how much meat he sells in a day, we multiply the amount of meat he sells per hour by the number of hours he works:

15kg/hour * 10 hours = 150kg per day

Now, we know the bull weighs 750kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from the bull, we divide the weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day:

750kg / 150kg per day = 5 days

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of seats in the auditorium. Since there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, we can calculate the total number of seats as follows:

Total number of seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we know that one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. To find the number of seats occupied by administrators, we can calculate:

Seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Now, let's find the remaining seats after the administrators occupied their seats:

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

We are also given that one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. To find the number of seats occupied by parents, we can calculate:

Seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Finally, the rest of the seats were occupied by the students. To find the number of seats occupied by students, we can subtract the seats occupied by parents from the remaining seats:

Seats occupied by students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Jim has a 20-pack of gum and chews 1 piece for every 2 hours he's at school. Since his school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

On top of that, he chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, adding up to 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum chewed throughout the day.

Starting with 20 pieces, Jim now has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, he decides to share his gum with his sister, giving her half of what he has. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister and keeps the remaining 7 for himself.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down James' earnings from selling used cars.

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each. The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire the cars, so the cost price of each car is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500.

The profit on each car is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 10% of $175,000, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to cover the 75-mile gap between them.

First, we need to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed:

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph

To find out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend before the cost exceeds $10 per class. We can do this by dividing the total cost by the maximum cost per class.

Total cost of classes: $60
Maximum cost per class: $10

Maximum classes he can attend = Total cost / Maximum cost per class

To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we subtract the final price paid by Clara from the final price paid by Sheila: $540 - $398 = $142.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that my sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, and that's half the total amount I earned from selling green hats. To find the sales from green hats, I'll multiply the sales from red hats by 2.

Sales from green hats = 2 * Sales from red hats
Sales from green hats = 2 * 400
Sales from green hats = 800

Now, let's calculate the total sales for the first month by adding the sales from red hats and green hats.

Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales for the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales for the first month = 1200

In the second month, my sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the total sales for the second month, I'll multiply the total sales for the first month by 3/4.

Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * Total sales for the first month
Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales for the second month = 900

Finally, let's calculate the total amount I made in two months by adding the total sales for the first month and the second month.

Total amount I made in two months = Total sales for the first month + Total sales for the second month
Total amount I made in two months = 1200 + 900
Total amount I made in two months = 2100

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down James' carriage rental costs.

James rented the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he received 1 hour for free, so he only paid for 3 hours.

The cost for the first paid hour is $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice as much as the previous one. So, the second paid hour costs 2 * $15 = $30, and the third paid hour costs 2 * $30 = $60.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the paid hours: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sally's bank account initially had $200, and at the end of the week, it had $420. To find out how much she received this week, we subtract the initial amount from the final amount: $420 - $200 = $220.

Since Sally's expected weekly wage is $300, we can calculate the amount withheld by subtracting the amount she received from her expected wage: $300 - $220 = $80.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs for her party. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, we multiply the number of guests by 3.
16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Now, we know that 1 egg makes 2 deviled egg halves. To find the number of eggs needed, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.
48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 eggs

Finally, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the number of eggs by 12.
24 eggs / 12 = 2

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike has a 200-page book to read, and he wants to finish it within 30 days. He plans to read 10 pages a day. To find out how many days it will take him to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day.

Number of days to finish the book = Total number of pages / Number of pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike finishes the book in 20 days and the deadline is 30 days, we subtract the number of days it took Mike to finish the book from the deadline to find out how many days before the deadline he finishes.

Number of days before the deadline = Deadline - Number of days to finish the book

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the costs associated with James' plane for the first year.

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000. In addition to this, James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hangar. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hangar rental cost for the first year is $5,000 * 12 = $60,000.

James also spends twice as much as the hangar rental cost on fuel per month, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000. The total fuel cost for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to add the initial cost, the total hangar rental cost, and the total fuel cost. 

Total cost for the first year = Initial cost + Total hangar rental cost + Total fuel cost
Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000
Total cost for the first year = $330,000

Now, let's find the combined cooking time for pork and rice, which is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. The problem states that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

To find the total cooking time, we add the cooking time for each item: 
30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

We have two types of nuts: almonds and walnuts. A pound of almonds costs $10, and a pound of walnuts costs $15. We need to find the cost difference between two mixtures.

Mixture 1 consists of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. To calculate the cost, we multiply the weight of each nut by its price per pound. So, the cost of almonds in Mixture 1 is 1/2 * $10 = $5, and the cost of walnuts is 1/3 * $15 = $5. The total cost of Mixture 1 is $5 + $5 = $10.

Mixture 2 consists of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. Using the same calculation, the cost of almonds in Mixture 2 is 1/5 * $10 = $2, and the cost of walnuts is 1/3 * $15 = $5. The total cost of Mixture 2 is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two mixtures. The cost difference is the total cost of Mixture 1 minus the total cost of Mixture 2, which is $10 - $7 = $3.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem at hand. We're given that Lee rears only sheep and geese on his farm, with a total of 70 animal legs and 20 animal heads. We need to find out how many sheep live on Lee's farm.

To approach this, let's use a bit of algebra. We'll denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can represent the total number of legs as 4S + 2G = 70.

We also know that each animal has one head, so the total number of heads can be represented as S + G = 20.

Now, let's solve these equations. We can start by multiplying the second equation by 2, which gives us 2S + 2G = 40.

Next, we'll subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate G. This gives us (4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40, which simplifies to 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that S = 15.

The number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15."

First, let's calculate the total cost of these items:
2 bags of chips = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Bucket of fried chicken = $8.00
Bottle of soda = $1.00
Total cost of items = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class. The class meets 4 times a week, and each session is 2 hours long, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week. Since the class goes on for 6 weeks, the total hours would be 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

Now, we know John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours. To find the total number of recipes, we'll divide the total hours by 1.5.

= 60

Now, we know that each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers spend sleeping, we multiply the number of math teachers by the hours each teacher sleeps per day.

Total time math teachers spend sleeping = 60 * 6

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days. We know her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. This means the last 6 days of the first 30 days were a mix of good, bad, and neutral. Since she had 12 good days in total, and 8 of them were in the first 8 days, that leaves 12 - 8 = 4 good days in the last 22 days.

Now, we are told that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. So, the total number of good days in the month is 12 (initial good days) + 2 (additional good days) = 14.

However, we are asked about the good days left in the month after the first 30 days. Since we already know the total good days in the first 30 days (12), we subtract the good days in the first 30 days from the total good days including the next 3 days. 

So, the good days left in the month are 14 (total good days including the next 3 days) - 12 (initial good days) = 2.

We know that Mrs. Jameson's bamboo grows 30 inches a day, and its current height is 20 feet. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to do some calculations.

First, let's convert the current height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can multiply 20 feet by 12 to get the current height in inches.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches).

600 - 240 = 360 inches

This means the bamboo needs to grow 360 more inches to reach 600 inches. Since it grows 30 inches a day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days.

360 / 30 = 12

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet, and their combined ages are 44. To solve this, we'll use a bit of algebra.

Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation:

T = t + 7

We know that there are two twins and three triplets, so the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages are 44, so we can write another equation:

2T + 3t = 44

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation:

2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

2t + 14 + 3t = 44

Combine like terms:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. We know that each lollipop costs $0.40. To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to determine the cost of one candy.

The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. Now, let's subtract the cost of lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
10 lollipops cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00
10 candies cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00
The total cost is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. To find out how many coins he saves in a year, we multiply the number of coins he saves per month by 12. So, Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year. In 10 years, he will have saved 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's calculate how many coins Neil saves. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many more coins Neil saves, we multiply Rong's monthly savings by 2/5. This gives us (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. In a year, Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins. In 10 years, Neil will have saved 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have after 10 years, we add Rong's savings to Neil's savings. This gives us 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

John's dog needs 2 vaccines, which cost $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so we can write the equation:
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for x:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate the price of the crate of fruit.

First, we need to find the price of each type of fruit. We know that one apple costs $0.5. Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, the price of a banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece, so the price of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the information about Brittany's quilted comforter. We know it has 14 red squares. The number of blue squares is 4 more than the red squares, so that's 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. The green squares are 6 more than the blue squares, which gives us 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. Lastly, the white squares are 12 fewer than the green squares, so that's 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add up the number of squares: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares. Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We have 42 adults and 15 babies attending a function at Mia's restaurant, so the total number of people is:
42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs. To find the number of regular chairs, we multiply the number of high chairs by 5:
5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs

Now, let's find the total number of chairs available by adding the regular chairs and high chairs:
40 regular chairs + 8 high chairs = 48 chairs

Since we have 57 people and 48 chairs, we need to find out how many more chairs Mia needs. We can do this by subtracting the total number of chairs from the total number of people:
57 people - 48 chairs = 9

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem and find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip.

We know that Adam has collected 50 points. Betty, being better than Adam, collected 30% more points. To calculate Betty's points, we find 30% of 50, which is 0.3 * 50 = 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Now, let's find out how many points Tom has. We know Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom. Therefore, Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:

Pencils in the box = 20 - 4
Pencils in the box = 16

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of pencils in the box. Since each pair has 2 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many fireworks the city is setting off. Since they have 15 boxes with 20 fireworks each, the total number of city fireworks is 15 * 20 = 300.

Now, Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find 40% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which gives us 120. So, Hannah can see 120 city fireworks.

In addition to the city fireworks, Hannah will also set off some fireworks in her backyard. She has 3 boxes with 5 fireworks each, so she'll set off 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the city fireworks she can see (120) to the fireworks she'll set off in her backyard (15). That gives us a total of 120 + 15 = 135.

To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we first calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females. Since there are 6 females and each ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Now, let's calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings Larry cooked is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females, which is 18 + 32 = 50.

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we need to find one-fourth of 256. To do this, we can multiply 256 by 1/4 or divide it by 4. Either way, we get 64 windows smashed.

Now, let's move on to the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64.

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows. To find 3/4ths of 64, we can multiply 64 by 3/4. This gives us 48 windows smashed.

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed in students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed. This is 64 + 48 = 112.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to calculate the total number of blue spools and divide it by the total number of spools, then multiply by 100.

First, let's find the total number of blue spools. Candy has 15 light blue spools and 45 dark blue spools, so the total number of blue spools is 15 + 45 = 60.

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. Candy has 15 light blue, 45 dark blue, 40 light green, and 50 dark green spools. So, the total number of spools is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of blue spools. Percentage of blue spools = (Total blue spools / Total spools) * 100 = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We start with 5000 people at the polling station. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. To find out how many people that is, we multiply 5000 by 2/5.

(2/5) * 5000 = 2000

So, 2000 people had voted by midday. To find the number of people remaining, we subtract 2000 from the initial 5000.

5000 - 2000 = 3000

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. We multiply 3000 by 2/3 to find out how many people that is.

(2/3) * 3000 = 2000

Now, we add the people who voted by midday (2000) to the people who voted by 16:00 (2000) to get the total number of people who had voted.

2000 + 2000 = 4000

Finally, we subtract the total number of people who had voted from the initial 5000 to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

5000 - 4000 = 1000

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days. Since he chews 4 pieces of gum per day, we can multiply this by the number of days:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we know that a pack of gum has 15 pieces. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's get to the problem at hand. We need to figure out how many boxes of graham crackers are required to make s'mores for 9 kids and 6 adults.

First, we need to calculate the total number of s'mores needed. Each kid wants 2 s'mores, so that's 9 kids * 2 s'mores/kid = 18 s'mores. The adults want 1 s'more each, so that's 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 s'mores. Adding these together, we get a total of 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores.

Now, we know that each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large s'mores. To find out how many sleeves we need, we divide the total number of s'mores by 8: 24 s'mores / 8 s'mores/sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the number of sleeves needed by 3 to find the number of boxes needed: 3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that candidate A got 20% of the votes. To find the number of votes, we'll calculate 20% of 100. This is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Now, candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. To find this, we'll calculate 50% of 20, which is 0.5 * 20 = 10 votes. So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes candidates A and B got is 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Since there were 100 voters, we can find the number of votes candidate C got by subtracting the total votes of A and B from the total number of voters. This is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. To find out how many apples Beck has, we subtract 23 from 100: 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. This means Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has: 90 - 87 = 3.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem. Peter wants to make different sized ice cubes with 32 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 4 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 2 ounces, and small cubes that use 1/2 an ounce. If he makes 3 giant cubes, 7 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes, how many ounces of water does he have left?

To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the total amount of water he started with.

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces. Then, the water used for the medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces. Finally, the water used for the small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces.

Now, let's add up the total water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water: 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces.

We have a class of 50 students with various hobbies. 10 students like to bake, and 5 students like to play basketball. The rest of the students either like to play video games or play music.

First, let's find the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball. That's 10 + 5 = 15.

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of students to find the number of students who like to play video games or play music. So, 50 - 15 = 35.

We're also given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

Finally, we can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to play music from the total number of students who like to play video games or play music. That's 35 - 10 = 25.

Now, she has 3 small stickers left and 9 large buttons. She also has 40 large stickers, and she trades 50% of them for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

She now has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons (9 + 20), and 20 large stickers left. She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count her buttons. She has 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons. Since 1 large button is worth 3 small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons. 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons. Adding this to the 60 small buttons she already has, she gets 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

Moving on, half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of large-sized shirts needed is 18 / 2 = 9 students.

Finally, six more students need size extra-large than large. This means the number of extra-large shirts needed is 9 + 6 = 15 students.

Total number of fruits = 200 + 290 = 490

"Hi there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Marissa initially had $80 and spent $20 on a ball. To find out how much money she had left, we subtract the cost of the ball from her initial amount:
$80 - $20 = $60

Now, we know that Marissa used the remaining money to buy candy bars for her brother Jimmy, and each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars she bought, we divide the amount of money she had left by the cost of each candy bar:
$60 ÷ $5 = 12

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To determine how much money Sam needs to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we need to calculate the total kilograms of oranges required and then multiply it by the cost per kilogram.

Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, he will need 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges to make 4 liters of juice.

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so the total cost will be 20 * $3 = $60.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Ezra read 300 books in one hour, which is twice as many books as Ahmed read. To find out how many books Ahmed read, we can divide Ezra's total by 2.

Ahmed's total = Ezra's total / 2
Ahmed's total = 300 / 2
Ahmed's total = 150 books

Now, we're told Ezra decided to read 150 more books. So, we need to add those to Ezra's initial total.

Ezra's new total = Initial total + Additional books
Ezra's new total = 300 + 150
Ezra's new total = 450 books

To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we add their individual totals.

Total books read = Ezra's new total + Ahmed's total
Total books read = 450 + 150
Total books read = 600

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Tanya's earnings for the two days.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so her total earnings for the hours worked are 5 * $15 = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so her total earnings for the hours worked are 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she doesn't earn the additional $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $80 + $30 = $110.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem to find the solution.

The perfume company has 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents. By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each vanilla scent and 2 of each fruity scent. To find the total sales of each type of scent, we multiply the number of scents by the number of sales per scent.

For vanilla scents: 4 scents * 5 sales each = 20 sales
For fruity scents: 8 scents * 2 sales each = 16 sales

Now, let's find the difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents. To do this, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
20 (vanilla sales) - 16 (fruity sales) = 4

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem at hand. Bennet, the farmer, wants to make a total of $135 by selling eggplants and corn. He's already sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so let's calculate how much he made from that.

20 eggplants * $3 per eggplant = $60

Now, we subtract this amount from the total amount he wants to make, which is $135. This will give us the amount he needs to make from selling the corn.

$135 - $60 = $75

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell, and he needs to make $75 from them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we can divide the amount he needs to make by the number of ears of corn.

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Tatiana's weekend schedule to find out how much time she spends playing soccer.

Tatiana has a total of 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which adds up to 12 hours. She decides to spend 3 hours reading. 

Now, let's calculate the remaining time: 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours.

Out of the remaining 9 hours, she spends 1/3 of that time playing video games. To find out how many hours that is, we multiply 9 hours by 1/3, which equals 3 hours.

So, the time spent playing video games is 3 hours. Now, let's subtract this from the remaining time to find out how many hours are left for soccer: 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of time spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer (6 hours) by the total time (12 hours) and multiply by 100: (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Anthony starts with 50 pencils. He gives 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. To find out how many pencils he gave away, we multiply 50 by 1/2:
50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon and was left with:
50 - 25 = 25 pencils

Next, he gives 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils he gave away this time, we multiply 25 by 3/5:
25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils

Now, Anthony is left with:
25 - 15 = 10 pencils

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Jack's trip to the museum.

First, we need to calculate the time Jack spends driving to and from the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 miles per hour. To find the time, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time spent driving to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home at the same speed, the time spent driving back is also 2 hours. So, the total time spent driving is 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

In addition to driving, Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. To find the total time he's gone from home, we add the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

Total time = Time spent driving + Time spent at the museum
= 4 hours + 6 hours
= 10 hours

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate the number of wheels Henry will have left after assembling the toys.

First, we need to find out how many wheels are required for the cars and motorcycles. Each car needs 4 wheels, and there are 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228 wheels.

Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, and there are 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146 wheels.

Now, let's add the number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required: 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276 wheels.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To find the amount you have to pay after a 20% discount on the laptop, let's calculate the discount first.

The discount is 20% of the original price, which is $1000. So, the discount amount is 0.20 * $1000 = $200.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price to find the final amount you have to pay. 
$1000 - $200 = $800

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Mike's movie collection replacement costs.

First, we know Mike has 600 movies. A third of these movies are in series, which can be bought together at a lower cost. To find the number of movies in series, we'll divide the total number of movies by 3:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since buying the series together costs 1/6 of the price of a normal movie, and a normal movie costs $10, we can calculate the cost per series movie:
$10 / 6 = $1.67 per movie
Now, let's find the total cost of the series movies:
200 * $1.67 = $334

Next, we'll find the number of remaining movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of these remaining movies are older movies, which cost $5 each. To find the number of older movies, we'll multiply the remaining movies by 0.4:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies
Now, let's calculate the total cost of the older movies:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies, costing $10 each. To find the number of normal movies, we'll subtract the older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 movies
Now, let's calculate the total cost of the normal movies:
240 * $10 = $2400

Finally, let's add up the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection:
$334 + $800 + $2400 = $3534

The final answer is: $3534"

Next, he picked 8 pounds of plums at $1.00 per pound, so the cost is 8 * $1.00 = $8.00.

Lastly, he picked 6 pounds of apricots at $3.00 per pound, so the cost is 6 * $3.00 = $18.00.

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the time the Llesis family spent driving. We know they drove and hiked for a total of 6 hours, and they hiked for 1.5 hours. So, the time spent driving is 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Next, we can calculate the distance they drove. Their average driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so the distance driven is 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

Now, let's find their hiking speed. We know it's 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

We can now calculate the distance they hiked. Distance hiked = Speed * Time = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Finally, the total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem.

Ava and Emma are competing in a video game, and we need to find the difference between their scores. They earn points for jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and having time left on the timer.

Let's break it down:

- 10 points for every enemy they jump on
- 5 points for each berry they collect
- 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries, but finishes the level 4 seconds slower. To find the difference in their scores, we can calculate the points they earn from these differences.

- 8 more enemies: 8 * 10 = 80 points
- 3 more berries: 3 * 5 = 15 points
- 4 seconds slower: -4 * 30 = -120 points (since she finishes slower, it's a negative)

Now, let's add these points: 80 + 15 - 120 = -25

The final answer is: -25"
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars in total. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas.

So, the cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 30 = 34 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 34 / 2 = 17 dollars.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem.

We know Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. He then bought 17 more fish, and after adding them to his pond, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, the total number of white fish is x + 4 (he already had 4 white fish). The total number of orange fish is 3 + (17 - x), since he bought 17 fish in total.

We can set up an equation based on the fact that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:

2(x + 4) = 3 + (17 - x)

Expanding the equation, we get:

2x + 8 = 20 - x

Now, let's solve for x:

2x + x = 20 - 8
3x = 12
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

However, this doesn't seem right, as the total number of fish Bob bought is 17. If x = 4, then the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - 4 = 13. The total number of orange fish would be 3 + 13 = 16, and the total number of white fish would be 4 + 4 = 8. This doesn't satisfy the condition that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish.

Let's try x = 5. If x = 5, then the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - 5 = 12. The total number of orange fish would be 3 + 12 = 15, and the total number of white fish would be 4 + 5 = 9. This still doesn't satisfy the condition.

If x = 6, then the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - 6 = 11. The total number of orange fish would be 3 + 11 = 14, and the total number of white fish would be 4 + 6 = 10. This still doesn't satisfy the condition.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total distance Andy drives in a week. Since he drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 2 x 5 = 10 miles per day.

Now, let's calculate the total distance he drives in a week: 10 miles/day x 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we need to find out how much gas his car consumes in a week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money his car is consuming per week. The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money his car is consuming per week is 5 gallons/week x $3/gallon = $15/week.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carrie received 10 twenties and 140 quarters from her aunt. We need to find out how much she spent for lunch, given that she used all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties.

First, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount spent from the quarters is:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, we'll calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the total amount spent from the twenties is:
3/5 * 10 * $20 = 3/5 * $200 = $120

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount spent:
$35 + $120 = $155

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his garden.

First, we'll find the total number of tomatoes. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes, and Ricardo has 5 plants. So, the total number of tomatoes is 22 * 5 = 110.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of eggplants. Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and Ricardo has 8 plants. So, the total number of eggplants is 4 * 8 = 32.

Now, let's add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits: 110 + 32 = 142.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that one-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs, and one-eighth are analog TVs. To find the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, we'll calculate one-fourth and one-eighth of the total sales.

One-fourth of 40 is 40 * (1/4) = 10 smart TVs.
One-eighth of 40 is 40 * (1/8) = 5 analog TVs.

Now, let's add the number of smart TVs and analog TVs: 10 + 5 = 15.

Since the rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs, we subtract the total number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales: 40 - 15 = 25.

John is raising money for a school trip that costs $300. The school has agreed to cover half the cost, which is a big help. To find out how much the school will contribute, we can divide the total cost by 2:

$300 ÷ 2 = $150

So, the school will cover $150 of the cost. Now, let's subtract the school's contribution and the money John already has ($50) from the total cost to find out how much he's missing:

$300 (total cost) - $150 (school's contribution) - $50 (John's money) = $100

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's get to the problem at hand. We need to find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing in his house.

First, we need to determine the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder at night compared to the daytime temperature of 45 degrees, we subtract 33 from 45.

Nighttime temperature: 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Now, we know the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. To prevent this, we need to find out how many degrees the temperature needs to rise to reach 32 degrees.

Temperature rise needed: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed, we divide the temperature rise needed by the heat provided by each log.

Number of logs needed: 20 / 5 = 4

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

We have 90 people who need to be split into 9-person groups for the county-level scavenger hunt competition. To find the number of groups, we'll divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Now, 3/5 of these groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. To find the number of groups that brought seashells, we'll multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

Number of groups that brought seashells = Total number of groups * 3/5
= 10 * 3/5
= 6

Since each group has 9 members, the total number of people who brought seashells is:

Number of people who brought seashells = Number of groups that brought seashells * Number of people per group
= 6 * 9
= 54

Each of these people brought 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells is:

Total number of seashells = Number of people who brought seashells * Number of seashells per person
= 54 * 2
= 108

We start with 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172. That leaves us with 172 - 47 = 125 people. Then, 13 more people get on, so we add 13 to 125, which gives us 125 + 13 = 138 people.

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138. That gives us 138 - 38 = 100 people.

Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day, and in a 30-day month, that's a total of:
10 bottle caps/day * 30 days = 300 bottle caps

Now, each bottle cap is worth $0.25. To find the total amount of money he makes, we multiply the number of bottle caps by the value of each:
300 bottle caps * $0.25/bottle cap = $75

Jamie earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work each day. For the regular 8 hours, her earnings are:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

If she needs to work additional hours, she's paid a special hourly rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find this rate, we multiply her regular rate by 1.5:
$20/hour * 1.5 = $30/hour

Last Tuesday, Jamie worked 11 hours, which means she worked 3 hours at the special rate. Her earnings for the additional 3 hours are:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

To find the total amount Jamie was paid, we add her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours:

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of employees after three months. The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after three months, the total number of employees will be:

200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3)
= 200 + 60
= 260

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month. Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, so the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month is:

260 (total employees) * 4000 (monthly salary per employee)
= 1,040,000

Since we want to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to multiply the monthly salary by 3:

1,040,000 (monthly salary) * 3 (number of months)
= 3,120,000

Now, let's calculate Sally's hourly wage. Her starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, which is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, so we can calculate their total earnings:

Billy's earnings: 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's earnings: 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into Bubbles' stuffed animal collection. She has three stuffed puppies, five stuffed koalas, two stuffed zebras, and four stuffed frogs. To find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has, we simply add them up: 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14.

Bubbles wants to buy enough stuffed goats so that they make up 30% of her total stuffed animals. Let's assume she needs to buy x stuffed goats. After buying x stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Kris's gaming schedule to figure out how many hours she still needs to play to earn that achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, that's 2 * 7 = 14 days. So, she plays 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours in those 2 weeks.

Next, she plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Adding those up, Kris has played a total of 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have two cars, one traveling at 60 miles per hour and the other at 70 miles per hour. The second car passes the first car, and we want to find the distance between them after 2 hours.

To do this, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours. The distance traveled is equal to the speed multiplied by the time.

For the first car, the distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

For the second car, the distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since the second car is ahead of the first car, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

Next, we have the fourth-graders. 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, which gives us a pass rate of 40%.

Now, the fifth-graders had a pass rate that was twice the fourth-graders' pass rate. So, their pass rate is 2 * 40% = 80%. Since there are 400 fifth-graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700.

The total number of students is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students, which is 700/1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

The 16 students who drank 2 quarts each consumed a total of:
16 * 2 = 32 quarts

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total amount of tea consumed:

Total branches climbed = Total amount made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Now, to find the average number of branches he climbed per day, we need to divide the total branches climbed by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, we can calculate the number of quarters each person uses. Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters. His two friends who are worse will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each, for a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters. The friend who is better will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the school parking lot. Then, during the first break, he counted 20 more cars. To find the total number of cars before lunch break, we add these two numbers together: 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, we know that 1/2 of the cars left during lunch break. To find the number of cars that remained, we need to calculate 1/2 of 70. This is equal to 70 / 2 = 35.

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break is 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down John's weekly earnings.

John completes 30 cycles of work each day, with 5 tasks in each cycle. Since each task pays $1.20, we can calculate his earnings per cycle:
5 tasks * $1.20 per task = $6 per cycle

Now, let's find out how much he earns in a day:
$6 per cycle * 30 cycles = $180 per day

To determine his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:
$180 per day * 7 days = $1260

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game, Julie's score in the first game was 14 - 4 = 10 points.

Now, let's move on to the second game. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. So, Sasha's score in the second game was 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

To find out how many more tins of cat food Kimberly bought than dog food, we need to calculate the total number of tins of each type of food.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food. Since each package contains 11 tins, and Kimberly bought 8 packages, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food. Since each package contains 6 tins, and Kimberly bought 6 packages, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, to find the difference, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 
88 - 36 = 52.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem and find out how many cards Becca has.

We know that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 cards. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has.

Let's start by representing the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of cards:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

And the number of cards Becca has:
Becca has 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards

Becca has 153 cards."
"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color to find the total number of eggs:
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost per pound is:
4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40

Additionally, the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, and the distribution center is 20 miles away, so the cost per mile is:
20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60

Now, let's add the cost per pound and the cost per mile to get the total shipping cost:
$1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32. So, the refund amount is:
75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24.00

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
Total loss = Book cost - Refund amount + Shipping cost
Total loss = $32 - $24.00 + $3.00
Total loss = $11.00

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week. In the second week, he produces half as much, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. Then, in the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, we can find the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Britany's TikTok activities and calculate the total time she spends on them in a month.

First, we have the time spent recording videos. Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, that's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent recording videos is 72 * 4 = 288 minutes.

Next, let's look at the time spent writing songs. Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is equivalent to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes per week. For a month, that's 120 * 4 = 480 minutes.

Lastly, we have the time spent on makeup. Britany spends 15 minutes a day, 6 days a week, which is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes per week. For a month, that's 90 * 4 = 360 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity: 288 + 480 + 360 = 1128 minutes.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the installation costs for Angela.

The interior design firm's initial installation package includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures for $129.00. Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that need to be installed.

First, let's calculate the number of additional items: 
- Mirrors: 6 (Angela's) - 4 (initial package) = 2 additional mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 (Angela's) - 1 (initial package) = 1 additional chandelier
- Pictures: 20 (Angela's) - 10 (initial package) = 10 additional pictures

The cost of these additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost for the additional items is:
2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00
Total cost for additional items = $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, which means Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. So, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we know that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that a turtle would take twice as long as a kangaroo to cross the highway. So, one turtle would take 54 * 2 = 108 hours.

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, the time it would take them to cross the highway would be the same as the time it would take one turtle, which is 108 hours.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's get to the problem at hand. Adam wants to know how many apple slices are left after slicing some apples and eating a few.

First, we need to calculate the total number of slices Adam had initially. He sliced 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 slices. He also sliced 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so that's 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

Now, let's add the slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices initially: 15 (large) + 15 (small) = 30 slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the slices eaten from the total: 30 (initial slices) - 15 (slices eaten) = 15.

5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so 1/3 has been used. We can calculate the used length as:
1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so 1/2 has been used. We can calculate the used length as:

Since it's simple interest, the interest earned each year will be the same: $225. So, the total interest earned in 3 years is $225 * 3 = $675.

Next, we need to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 floral shirts have buttons, so to find the number of shirts with no buttons, we subtract 20 from the total number of floral shirts, which is 50. This gives us 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts with no buttons.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. To do this, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30 - 20 = 10.

55 - 10 = 45

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in Farm Y. He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats. So, we subtract 20 from the initial number of goats in Farm Y:

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have four people: you, your brother, your sister, and your mom. Let's denote your brother's age as B, your age as Y, and your sister's age as S. We know that you are three years younger than your brother, so we can write an equation:
Y = B - 3

We also know that you are 2 years older than your sister, so we can write another equation:
Y = S + 2

Now, let's talk about your mom's age. It's one less than three times your brother's age. Let's denote your mom's age as M:
M = 3B - 1

When you add all your ages, you get 87. So, we can write the equation:
B + Y + S + M = 87

Substituting the expressions for Y and M from the previous equations, we get:
B + (B - 3) + (Y - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Since Y = B - 3, we can substitute this expression for Y in the equation above:
B + (B - 3) + ((B - 3) - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
B + B - 3 + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87

Combine like terms again:
5B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:
5B = 96

Divide by 5:
B = 19.2

Since B must be a whole number, we'll try both 19 and 20 to see which one works.

If B = 20:
Y = B - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17
S = Y - 2 = 17 - 2 = 15
M = 3B - 1 = 3(20) - 1 = 59

B + Y + S + M = 20 + 17 + 15 + 35 = 87 (this works)

So, your age is 17.

New amount = 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons

On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. To find the total amount of water passing through the river, we add this increase to the new amount.

Total amount = 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We start with 10 people infected on day 0. Each day, every infected person infects 6 others. 

On day 1, the 10 infected people will infect 10 * 6 = 60 others. So, the total number of infected people on day 1 is 10 (initial) + 60 = 70.

On day 2, the 70 infected people will infect 70 * 6 = 420 others. So, the total number of infected people on day 2 is 70 (previous) + 420 = 490.

On day 3, the 490 infected people will infect 490 * 6 = 2940 others. So, the total number of infected people on day 3 is 490 (previous) + 2940 = 3430.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Rafaela received tips from 40 customers, each giving her $20. To find the total amount of money she received, we multiply the number of customers by the tip amount. 
40 customers * $20 per customer = $800

Now, let's calculate the amount Julieta received. It's given that she received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. 
10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80
So Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720

The total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is $800 + $720 = $1520

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month, so in a year, she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, which means she earns 1 badge every 2 months. To find out how many badges Amber earns in a year, we can divide 12 months by 2, which gives us 6 badges.

Wendy, on the other hand, earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, if Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year:

36 (Wendy's badges) - 6 (Amber's badges) = 30

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many banana bread loaves Paige baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked a total of 5 * 2 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Now, let's calculate the total amount raised. Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Gretchen has some coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. We're also given that she has 70 gold coins. To find the total number of coins, we need to find the number of silver coins first.

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can subtract 30 from the number of gold coins to find the number of silver coins. 

Number of silver coins = Number of gold coins - 30
= 70 - 30
= 40

Now, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins.

Total number of coins = Number of gold coins + Number of silver coins
= 70 + 40

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic.

First, we need to find out how many burritos were eaten. There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos, so the total number of burritos eaten by students is 50 * 10 = 500. Mr. George also ate 20 burritos, so the total number of burritos eaten is 500 + 20 = 520.

Now, let's subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos. Total number of burritos ordered = 600, and total number of burritos eaten = 520.

Total number of leftover burritos = 600 - 520

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the bumper car rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Now, the rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. To find the number of blue cars, we multiply the number of green cars by 3: 3 * 10 = 30.

So far, we have 12 red cars, 10 green cars, and 30 blue cars. Let's add these up: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

The rink has a total of 75 cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total: 75 - 52 = 23.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have a total of 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has F - 12 books. And since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (F - 12) + 25 books.

We can now set up an equation to represent the total number of books:

(F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) + F = 85

Combine like terms:

3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3F = 84

Divide by 3:

F = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

First, we need to determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will get 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is:
30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Now, we know that a three-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes Greg needs, we'll divide the total number of jello cups needed by the number of jello cups per box:
120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Madeline and Keenan share the cost of groceries, which amounts to $400 per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, we can calculate Keenan's share as the remaining 40%.

To find Keenan's monthly share, we multiply the total cost by 0.4 (which is equivalent to 40%).

Keenan's monthly share = 0.4 * $400
Keenan's monthly share = $160

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Tobias started with 60 pieces of pizza. On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the pieces. To find out how many pieces that is, we can multiply 60 by 2/5.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

So, after the first day, he has 60 - 24 = 36 pieces left.

On the second day, he ate 10 more pieces. Now, he has 36 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. Let's calculate that.

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's calculate the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 × $3.00 = $9.00

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

He plans to sell these chickens at $50 per chicken. To find the total amount he will make from selling the chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price per chicken.

180 * $50 = $9000

This is the total amount he will make from selling the chickens. Since he wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up an equation to find the cost price.

Let's call the cost price x. Then, the selling price is x + $2000. We know that the selling price is $9000, so we can set up the equation:
x + $2000 = $9000

Subtracting $2000 from both sides gives us:
x = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

So, let's do the math:
Total glasses sold = 32
Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by the boys = 32 - 14 = 18
Glasses sold by Micah = 18 / 2 = 9

We also know that she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, and the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, we can assume that's for one mowing.

Dijana rowed 50 miles, and Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how far Anis rowed, we need to calculate 1/5 of 50 miles. 

1/5 of 50 miles is 50 * 1/5 = 10 miles. 
So Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, we add the distance rowed by Dijana and Anis to get the total distance.
Total distance = 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's get to the problem at hand. Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas and wants to divide them equally among her 6 nephews. However, her husband sneaked 4 cookies before she could package them.

To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to subtract the cookies taken by Susan's husband from the total number of cookies and then divide the result by the number of nephews.

So, let's do the math: 
Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4 = 96
Number of nephews = 6

Now, let's divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews: 
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6 = 16

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Denise read 10 pages yesterday, and today she read 5 more than Daniel's 13 pages from yesterday. So, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. Her total is 10 + 18 = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and didn't read any pages today, so his total is 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 28 - 13 = 15.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, we can convert the adult bowls to child bowls for easier calculation.

Calvin and his wife will eat 2 adult bowls, which is equivalent to 2 * 2 = 4 child bowls. Their 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. So, the total number of child bowls eaten is 4 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's get to the problem at hand. Jo is making face masks for her class and needs to figure out how much material she'll need. 

To make 20 small masks, we first need to find out how much material is required for one small mask. Since Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, we divide 2 yards by 4 to get the material needed for one small mask: 2 yards / 4 = 0.5 yards per small mask. Now, we multiply this by 20 to get the total material needed for 20 small masks: 0.5 yards/small mask * 20 small masks = 10 yards.

Next, we calculate the material needed for the large masks. Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. To find the material needed for one large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3: 2.25 yards / 3 = 0.75 yards per large mask. Now, we multiply this by 8 to get the total material needed for 8 large masks: 0.75 yards/large mask * 8 large masks = 6 yards.

Finally, we add the material needed for the small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Harold's daily schedule to find out how much free time he has left.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night, which is a significant chunk of his day. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours. Additionally, he spends 1 hour walking his dog each day.

To find his total free time, we need to subtract the time spent on these activities from the total hours in a day, which is 24. 

First, let's calculate the total hours spent on other activities: 
10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

Now, subtract the total hours spent on other activities from 24 hours:
24 - 19 = 5 hours.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

Tim has a box with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes and 1/3 of his red shoe boxes to go fishing. To find out how many shoe boxes are left, we need to calculate the number of shoe boxes used and subtract them from the total.

First, let's find out how many red shoe boxes Tim used. Since he used 1/3 of his red shoe boxes, we'll divide the total number of red shoe boxes by 3. 
9 (red shoe boxes) / 3 = 3

Now, let's subtract the number of shoe boxes used from the total number of shoe boxes.

Blue shoe boxes left: 7 - 3 = 4
Red shoe boxes left: 9 - 3 = 6

To find the total number of shoe boxes left, we'll add the number of blue and red shoe boxes left.
4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem.

We know Duncan's current age is 60. To find Adam's age, we need to work backwards. Eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

We're also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Let's represent Adam's current age as A. Then, Adam's age four years ago would be A - 4.

We can set up the equation: 52 = 2(A - 4). Simplifying this, we get 52 = 2A - 8. Adding 8 to both sides, we get 60 = 2A. Dividing both sides by 2, we find A = 30.

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find his age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age: 30 + 8 = 38.

Farmer Smith's farm = 2 * 200 + 100
Farmer Smith's farm = 400 + 100
Farmer Smith's farm = 500 acres

Now, let's find the total number of acres by adding the sizes of both farms:

Total acres = Farmer Brown's farm + Farmer Smith's farm
Total acres = 200 + 500

Colby earns $0.20 for every package he completes. To find out how much he earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the number of packages he completes in a day.

First, we need to find out how many packages Colby completes per hour. It's given that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, the number of packages he completes per hour is 50 - 10 = 40.

Since Colby works for 8 hours a day, the total number of packages he completes in a day is 40 * 8 = 320.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the day. He earns $0.20 per package, so his total earnings are 320 * 0.20 = 64 dollars.

First, we know that a normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. Since an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, we can calculate the time for the extreme sudoku puzzle as follows:
Time for an extreme sudoku puzzle = 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we divide the total time by the time interval at which John drinks a bottle of water (30 minutes):
180 minutes / 30 minutes = 6

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving the extreme sudoku puzzle.

First, let's calculate the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons. Since there were 20 red balloons, and each received 2 pieces, that's 2 * 20 = 40 pieces.

Now, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total to find out how many were thrown at the yellow balloons: 58 - 40 = 18.

Since each yellow balloon received 3 pieces of bologna, we divide the total number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3 to find the number of yellow balloons: 18 / 3 = 6.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in a month. Since he drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, we can multiply the miles driven per day by the number of days in a month.

Total miles driven in a month = miles driven per day * number of days in a month
Total miles driven in a month = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles driven in a month = 3000 miles

Now, we know that Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find the number of tune-ups, we can divide the total miles driven by the miles required for a tune-up.

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven in a month / miles required for a tune-up
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000 miles
Number of tune-ups = 3

Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream for their father's birthday. The cake costs $11, and 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since they bought 1 dozen (12) balloons, the cost would be 12 / 2 * $0.5 = $3. They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total amount they spent: $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2.

30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. Each lollipop costs $0.8, so the total revenue is:
300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240

Next, we need to find the total cost. The students bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, so the total cost is:
300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea.

We can do this by subtracting the number of cups used for cinnamon tea from the total number of cups. So, 27 - 15 = 12 cups are used for chamomile and mint tea.

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we can divide the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. This gives us 12 / 3 = 4 cups per row.

As there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we can divide the number of cups per row by 2 to find the number of cups of mint tea in each row. Therefore, 4 / 2 = 2 cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, we know that a normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, we can calculate the calories in each mini pastry.

For the mini cinnamon rolls, we have 600 / 3 = 200 calories per roll. Andrew baked 200 of these, so the total calories from the cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins, we have 450 / 3 = 150 calories per muffin. Andrew baked 300 of these, so the total calories from the blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance the bus traveled. The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. We can find the distance by multiplying the speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance the car traveled. The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. Again, we can find the distance by multiplying the speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

Now, let's find the difference in distance. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus.

Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote Jean's age as J, Paul's age as P, and Peter's age as Pe. We can set up the following equations:

1. Pe + P + J = 100 (combined age is 100 years)
2. P = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than Jean)
3. Pe = P + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age)

Now, let's substitute P from equation 2 into equation 3:
Pe = (J + 10) + J
Pe = 2J + 10

Now, substitute Pe and P from the above equations into equation 1:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know J, we can find P:
P = J + 10
P = 20 + 10
P = 30

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a month. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours, it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

On the other hand, the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money each machine can make in a month. Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 will make 43200 * 6 = $259200 in a month. The WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32400 * 6 = $194400 in a month.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. He has two options: pay for a 24-hour stay or pay for a 12-hour stay and add 70 pesos for every additional hour.

If Cameron chooses the 24-hour stay, he would pay 1600 pesos.

For the 12-hour stay, he would pay 1000 pesos. Since he needs 5 more hours (17 - 12 = 5), he would pay an additional 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's get down to business and figure out how much hay Nate needs for his livestock.

First, we need to determine how much hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Amount each sheep needs = 2 * 5 - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 10 - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 7 pounds

Now that we know how much each sheep needs, let's calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 goats * 5 pounds
Total hay for goats = 75 pounds

Total hay for sheep = 12 sheep * 7 pounds
Total hay for sheep = 84 pounds

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159 pounds

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down John's situation step by step.

First, we need to calculate John's total earnings. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 * 6 = 300 dollars

Next, we subtract his expenses. He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has:
300 - 50 = 250 dollars left

He also wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has:
250 - 100 = 150 dollars left

Additionally, he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends:
5 * 10 = 50 dollars

Now he has:
150 - 50 = 100 dollars left

Finally, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining amount. We divide the remaining amount by the cost of a pen:
100 / 25 = 4

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word. 
Craig's total letters = 20 words * 15 letters/word = 300 letters.

Now, let's consider Craig's brother. Since he spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we add 50 to Craig's total letters to find the brother's total letters.
Brother's total letters = 300 + 50 = 350 letters.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled is the sum of Craig's total letters and his brother's total letters.
Total letters = 300 + 350 = 650 letters.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. To find the total number of bottles, we multiply the number of coupons by the number of bottles per coupon:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Now, the teacher gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice. To find the total number of bottles given away, we multiply the number of students by the number of bottles per student:
29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given away from the total number of bottles:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Patty's Plumbing charges a visit fee of $40, plus $35 per hour (or part thereof) for labor, and the cost of parts. For this particular job, the labor time was 2.25 hours, and the parts cost $60.

First, we need to calculate the labor cost. Since the labor time is 2.25 hours, we round up to the nearest hour, which is 3 hours. The labor cost is then 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

Now, let's add up the total charge: the visit fee, labor cost, and parts cost.

Total charge = Visit fee + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60
Total charge = $205

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down James' CD purchase and sale to figure out how much money he was out.

First, James bought 10 CDs at $15 each, so the total cost would be 10 * $15 = $150. However, he got them for 40% off, which means he paid 60% of the total cost. To find 60% of $150, we multiply $150 by 0.6, which gives us $90.

Later, James decided to sell 5 of the CDs for $40. Now, let's calculate how much money he was out. We subtract the amount he got back ($40) from the amount he paid ($90). 

$90 - $40 = $50

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem of James swimming across the lake.

First, we need to find out how far James swims at his initial pace. Since he swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, we calculate 60% of 20, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, so the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming for 6 hours, James takes a break on an island. He rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim. He has already covered 12 miles, so the remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, James swims at half his initial speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

To find the total time taken, we add the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

First, let's calculate the total sales for each newspaper:
- New York Times: 6 copies * $5 per copy = $30
- Wall Street Journal: 10 copies * $15 per copy = $150

Now, let's calculate the commission for each newspaper:
- Commission from New York Times: $30 * 0.10 = $3

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D.

We can set up two equations based on the given information: B = A + 20 and B = D + 10.

Since the total points scored by the team is 45, we can write another equation: A + B + D = 45.

Now, let's substitute B from the first two equations into the third equation. We can rewrite B as A + 20 and D as B - 10. Substituting these values, we get A + (A + 20) + (A + 20 - 10) = 45.

Combine like terms to get 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides to get 3A = 15.

Divide both sides by 3 to get A = 5.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We're given that the book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Since each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side, we have 2 pages per paper. So, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we need to find the total number of pages in the book, which is 1.5 inches thick. To do this, we multiply the total number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book.

Total number of pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches
Total number of pages = 300 pages

11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we'll divide the total minutes by 15 minutes to find the number of intervals.
900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, 
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 8 hours is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes early that day, so we subtract those 5 minutes: 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

Additionally, she was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is a total of 23 minutes. We subtract those 23 minutes from the total: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of cups and the number of measuring spoons: 24 + 10 = 34.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the initial number of occupied and unoccupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 occupied. To find the number of occupied beds, we multiply the capacity by 1/5.

Number of occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds
Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Now, let's calculate the number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we multiply this number by the number of days in 2 weeks, which is 14.

Number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is the sum of the initial occupied beds and the new patients admitted.

Total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Finally, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity to find the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

Total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

Emails to family = 6

The remaining emails are to others, including her boyfriend. We can find this by subtracting the emails to family from the non-work emails.

Emails to others = Non-work emails - Emails to family
Emails to others = 9 - 6
Emails to others = 3

Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number, but Kelly said that Courtney overstated the number by 20%. To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract that from the number she reported.

First, let's calculate 20% of 48. To do this, we multiply 48 by 0.20 (which is the decimal equivalent of 20%). 

20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, let's subtract 9.6 from the number Courtney reported:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Let's denote the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught as 'x'. Then, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is 4x - 13, and the number of Pokémon Alex has caught is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

Since the total number of Pokémon caught is 339, we can set up the equation:
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon Stan has caught:

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, Richard must have 30 - 10 = 20 cherries. Now, let's add up the cherries Robert and Richard have: 30 (Robert) + 20 (Richard) = 50 cherries. This means Jerry has 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Now, let's compare Robert's cherries to Jerry's. Robert has 30 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries. So, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both days. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

In total, Sunny sold 10 + 15 = 25 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, let's calculate the number of apple pies sold. On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

In total, Sunny sold 11 + 15 = 26 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we multiply the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie by their respective costs:

25 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $150
26 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $390

Adding these amounts together, we get the total amount Sunny earned:

$150 + $390 = $540

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside, and she'll be outside 4 hours a day. So, she'll use 4 ounces of sunscreen per day. Since she'll be on vacation for 8 days, she'll use a total of 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Now, let's find out how many bottles she'll need. Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To do this, we'll divide the total amount of sunscreen she'll use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces):

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To find the total cost of both cars, we need to calculate the price of the red car first. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we'll find 40% of the blue car's price and subtract it from the blue car's price.

The price of the blue car is $100. 
40% of $100 is 0.4 * $100 = $40.
So, the price of the red car is $100 - $40 = $60.

Now, let's add the prices of both cars to find the total cost.
Total cost = Price of blue car + Price of red car
Total cost = $100 + $60
Total cost = $160

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem.

We know Emil is 19 years old now, and when he turns 24, he'll be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48. Since 5 years will pass before Emil turns 24, his dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he'll be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12. Since 5 years will pass before Emil turns 24, his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7.

Now, let's find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother:
Sum = Dad's age + Brother's age
Sum = 43 + 7
Sum = 50

Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. Then, on Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total pounds of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3. So, 21 / 3 = 7.

Now, let's find the number of remaining students:
30 - 6 = 24 students

Next, we're told that 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can calculate this as follows:
25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

To find the total number of students leaving early, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members:
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders and band members) = 12 students

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches.

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Each plant takes up 12 inches, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space each plant takes up is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space each plant takes up.

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants. However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

44 - 17 = 27 flowers

Each flower costs $6, so Pat will spend:

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill, and each basket will have 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines. To find the total number of petunias and sweet potato vines needed, we multiply the number of each plant by the number of baskets.

For petunias: 3 petunias/basket * 5 baskets = 15 petunias
For sweet potato vines: 2 vines/basket * 5 baskets = 10 vines

Now, let's calculate the cost of the petunias and sweet potato vines. The petunias cost $3.00 each, and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each.

Cost of petunias: 15 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $45.00
Cost of sweet potato vines: 10 vines * $2.50/vine = $25.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the petunias and sweet potato vines.

Total cost: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

Artemis and her father have a 30-pound bag of soil, and they want to plant some flowers. We know that each rose needs 1 pound of soil, each carnation needs 1.5 pounds, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds. They've already decided to plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. For the sunflowers, we have 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. For the carnations, we have 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds. Adding these together, we get 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Now, we subtract the soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil: 30 - 27 = 3 pounds. This leaves us with 3 pounds of soil for the roses.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses.

Since she saves $500.00 per month, in a year she'll have:
$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so to find out how many shoes she can buy in a year, we'll divide her total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The air conditioner cools the room at different rates depending on the setting. On low, it cools 2 degrees per hour, and on high, it cools 3 degrees per hour. Without the air conditioner, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour.

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up for 2 hours at 2 degrees per hour, so the temperature increased by 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.

To find the net temperature change, we subtract the warming from the cooling: 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it for the second time. Therefore, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Twice a month, Buford writes a check to the church, so that's 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year.

Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem of the three little wolves and their howling habits.

We know that Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote, being the enthusiastic one, howls for twice as long as Tobias, which means Chikote's howl lasts for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.

Now, Igneous is a bit of a show-off, and his howl lasts as long as the combined howls of Tobias and Chikote. So, Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we simply add their individual howl times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

Since we need the answer in minutes, we'll convert the total seconds to minutes by dividing by 60 (because there are 60 seconds in a minute). This gives us 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

First, let's find the average age of the group. Since there are 4 children, we can set up an equation using the given information:

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = 20

We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's call the average age 'x'. Then, Helene's age is 2x.

We can write the equation as:
3 + 4 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20

Now, let's find the average age 'x'. We know that the sum of the ages is 20, and there are 4 children. So, the average age 'x' is:
x = 20 / 4
x = 5

Now that we know the average age, we can find Helene's age:
Helene's age = 2x
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

Now we have the ages of Akbar (3 years old), Alessandro (4 years old), and Helene (10 years old). We can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of the other three children from the total age:
Wilfred's age = 20 - (3 + 4 + 10)
Wilfred's age = 20 - 17
Wilfred's age = 3

To solve this, let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices. We have 4 kids, each getting a slice of size x, and 2 adults, each getting a slice of size 2x. So, the total number of slices is 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Since each adult gets 2x, we can calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets by dividing 2x by the total number of slices (8x) and multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (2x / 8x) * 100

Day 2: Wanda (3000) + Ms. B (1125) = 4125 gallons
Total gallons pumped = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the power bank was losing 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours, and after that, the charge remaining was 28%. To find the charge before this, we need to add the total loss during these 3 hours to the final charge.

The total loss during these 3 hours is 7% * 3 = 21%. So, the charge before this was 28% + 21% = 49%.

Now, we know that the power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours before this. To find the charge before this, we need to add the total loss during these 5 hours to the charge we just calculated.

The total loss during these 5 hours is 9% * 5 = 45%. So, the charge before this was 49% + 45% = 94%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Janet's situation to figure out how many weeks she needs to work to save for the down payment on that $10000 car.

First, we need to calculate Janet's total hourly earnings. She makes $10 an hour from wages and another $15 an hour from tips, so that's a total of $25 per hour. Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings would be $25 per hour * 40 hours per week = $1000 per week.

Now, let's calculate the down payment amount. Janet wants to save 20% of the car's price, which is $10000 * 0.20 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we'll divide the down payment amount by her weekly earnings: $2000 / $1000 per week = 2 weeks.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate how many plums Jamaar can buy.

Jamaar has already purchased 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples. The total cost of these fruits is:
3 peaches at $.5 each = 3 * .5 = $1.5
4 pears at $.5 each = 4 * .5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each = 2 * 1 = $2
5 apples at $.75 each = 5 * .75 = $3.75

Total cost of fruits purchased = $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left to spend on plums. Since plums cost $.25 each, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $.25 = 3

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Anne has a box of sweets with 15 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces. She decides to keep 2 packs for herself and gives the rest to her 10 friends equally.

First, we need to find out how many packs she gave away. Since she kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces she gave away. Each pack has 60 pieces, so 13 packs will have 13 * 60 = 780 pieces.

Since she gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally, we need to divide 780 by 10 to find out how many pieces each friend received.

780 / 10 = 78

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase for each year and add it to the initial price.

First, let's calculate the price after the first year. The initial price is $120, and the price increase is 5% of the original price. 

Price increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Next, we'll calculate the price after the second year. The initial price is now $126, and the price increase is 5% of the new price.

Price increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Finally, we'll calculate the price after the third year. The initial price is now $132.30, and the price increase is 5% of the new price.

Price increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. We know that 3 of the albums were selfies only and 2 of the albums were portraits.

To find the number of pictures in each album, we can divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

72 ÷ 8 = 9

So, each album has 9 pictures. Now, let's find the total number of selfies and portraits. 

Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of selfies = 27

Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of portraits = 18

Total number of portraits and selfies = Number of selfies + Number of portraits
Total number of portraits and selfies = 27 + 18
Total number of portraits and selfies = 45

We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how long he spends reading 18 pages, we need to determine the time it takes him to read one page.

Time taken to read one page = 10 minutes / 3 pages = 10/3 minutes per page.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of easy questions in the 60-item quiz. Since 40% of the questions are easy, we can calculate this as follows:
40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

The rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult. To find the number of average and difficult questions, we can calculate:
100% - 40% = 60% of the questions are average and difficult.
60% of 60 = 0.6 * 60 = 36 questions.
Since these are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem.

We know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We can express this relationship as S = 2L.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is 12L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is 4S. Substituting S = 2L, we get 4S = 4(2L) = 8L.

The total earnings from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation: 12L + 8L = 120.

Combine like terms: 20L = 120.

Divide both sides by 20: L = 6.

Since S = 2L, S = 2 * 6 = 12.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem at hand. We have 40 dwarves, each equipped with a steel pickaxe, and we want to find out how many pounds of ore they can mine in a month with 30 days.

First, we need to determine how much ore one dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe. We know that a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day. Now, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. To calculate this, we add 50% of 24 to 24, which is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now that we know one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, we can multiply this by the number of dwarves and the number of days to find the total amount of ore mined. So, 36 pounds/day * 40 dwarves * 30 days = 43,200 pounds.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sally initially had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

First, there's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. If the normal teacher comes in, which is also a 50% chance, there are two possible scenarios: 

1. The teacher gives everyone an extension, which has a 40% chance. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.
2. The teacher doesn't give an extension, which has a 60% chance. In this case, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing the teacher that his dog ate his assignment and getting a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework:
50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher with extension) + 6% (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 76%

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we subtract the probability of not having to turn it in from 100%:

First, we need to calculate the total amount of loans Jim took out. Since he got $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, the total amount of loans is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of lost income. Before college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job, which he gave up to attend college. So, the total amount of lost income is $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000.

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is 10."
"Hello, I'm Aparna. To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (from 2007 to 2010).

The initial price of the car is $20000, and it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

To calculate the price after 3 years, we can use the formula for depreciation:

Price after n years = Initial price * (1 - Depreciation rate)^n

Here, n = 3 years, and the depreciation rate is 21% or 0.21.

Price after 3 years = $20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
= $20000 * (0.79)^3
= $20000 * 0.493039
≈ $9853.48

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have a total of 50 books in the library. Half of them are written in English, which is 50 * 0.5 = 25 books. Then, 10% of the books are written in German, which is 50 * 0.1 = 5 books.

To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books. So, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. To find out how many kilometers Bernice will still need to drive, we need to calculate the total distance she has driven so far and subtract it from the total distance.

The total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is 1955 kilometers. Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, so the total distance she has driven is 325 * 4 = 1300 kilometers.

Now, let's subtract the distance driven from the total distance to find out how many kilometers she will still need to drive. 

Distance left to drive = Total distance - Total distance driven
Distance left to drive = 1955 - 1300
Distance left to drive = 655 kilometers

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, and we want to find out how many gallons of water she drinks in 30 days. To do this, we need to calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days.

Since Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups of water.

Now, we know that there are 16 cups in a gallon. To find the number of gallons, we can divide the total number of cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons

Finally, at the third stop, 80 more people get off the train, leaving:
190 - 80 = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"Hi there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Alison's shopping trip to find the total amount she spent on athletic gear.

First, Alison bought a tank top for $10. Then, she picked up a pair of running shorts that cost $5 more than the tank top, so that's $10 + $5 = $15. Next, she got a great deal on tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, which brings the price down to $48 / 2 = $24. Finally, she bought a package of athletic socks for $8 and used a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6 for the socks.

Now, let's add up the costs: $10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. I'd be happy to help you with your kitchen floor renovation costs.

To calculate the total cost, we need to determine the number of tiles required to cover the entire floor. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. Given that your kitchen floor has a total area of 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles needed.

Total number of tiles required = Total area of the kitchen floor / Area of each tile
Total number of tiles required = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Total number of tiles required = 200

Now, let's calculate the total cost. Each tile costs $12, so we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile.

Total cost = Total number of tiles required * Cost of each tile
Total cost = 200 * $12
Total cost = $2400

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. His laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time. To find the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's calculate the number of loads for the twin beds per week. Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, Greg will need to do 4 / 2 = 2 loads for the twin beds.

For the king size bed, he'll need to do 1 load per week.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. To find the total number of loads per year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year: 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

So, Leo had 100 stickers in his collection two years ago. Then, last year, he collected 50 more stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to add the stickers he had initially, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year.

100 (initial stickers) + 50 (last year's stickers) + 100 (this year's stickers) = 250

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Imma has 3 cats, and she feeds each of them 60 grams of cat food twice a day. To find out the total amount of food each cat eats per day, we multiply the amount of food per meal by the number of meals: 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams per cat per day.

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food they eat per day is 120 grams * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of food (720 grams) by the amount they eat per day (360 grams):

Now, Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, which means Silvia had 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add up the slices eaten by each of them: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31 slices.

We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. Let's denote Donovan's part as x minutes. Then, Betsy's part is x + 18 minutes.

Since the total time is the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's parts, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now, we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes. To find Betsy's part, we add 18 minutes to Donovan's time:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

Now, let's find the number of emails James responds to in a day. We subtract the number of emails that don't require a response from the total number of emails: 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James works for 5 days, we multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5: 64 * 5 = 320.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many they ate, we multiply 20 by 0.7, which gives us 14 pizzas. So, the glee club has 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.

Now, let's move on to the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which means they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. The football team ate 80% of their pizzas, so we multiply 40 by 0.8, which gives us 32 pizzas. This means the football team has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

To find the total number of pizzas left, we add the leftovers from both groups: 6 (glee club) + 8 (football team) = 14.

The full price of butter is $4.00 per pound. So, for 3 pounds at full price, the cost would be 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. For the other 3 pounds at half price, the cost would be 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

Adding these costs together, we get the total cost: $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

Price Mr. Rogers bought it = $2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Next, we need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend. He sold it at 120% of the price he bought it, which is:
Price Mr. Rogers sold it = $1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, let's calculate the discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. The discount is the difference between the original price and the price the friend paid:
Discount = Original price - Price Mr. Rogers sold it

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now that we have the number of each type of bike sold, we can calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay per hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales per hour. To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour day, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and subtract the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

First, let's calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours: 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales.

Next, let's calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours: 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down John's weekly learning time.

John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. To find the total weekly minutes, let's call the total weekly minutes 'x'. Then, the extra learning time is (1/16)x.

We know that the class time is 1600 minutes, and the extra learning time is (1/16)x. The total weekly minutes 'x' is the sum of class time and extra learning time:

x = 1600 + (1/16)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 16:

16x = 25600 + x

Subtract x from both sides:

15x = 25600

Divide both sides by 15:

x = 25600 / 15
x = 1706.67

Now, we can convert the total weekly minutes to hours:

Total hours per week = x / 60
Total hours per week = 1706.67 / 60
Total hours per week = 28.44

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since it's the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

Now, the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. So, on the first bounce, the ball goes to 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball again goes to 2/3rds of its height on the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

We know Caroline has 4 children, and we're given their heights in relation to each other. The first child is 6 feet tall, which is equivalent to 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

Finally, the fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to first determine the number of bags sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to get the number of bags sold.

Number of bags sold = Total apples sold / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200 bags

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to get the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into this dinosaur dilemma.

We know that a group of lazy Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Since they ate half of what was left, we can infer that there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat before they had their fill.

Now, the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means that before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so to find the original weight, we need to multiply the remaining weight by 2. Therefore, the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons are required: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Finally, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon, which is $12, to get the total cost: 12 * 12 = $144.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem at hand. Ellen's prank on her friend is quite the setup, isn't it? To calculate the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to figure out the probability of choosing a shaken soda.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, and Ellen shook 3 of them. Then Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, and her brother took 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas.

The number of shaken sodas left is 3 - 1 = 2.
The number of unshaken sodas left is 9 - 1 - 2 = 6.

The total number of sodas left is 2 + 6 = 8.

The probability of choosing a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas: 2/8 = 1/4 = 0.25.

To express this probability as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have two trains departing from the same station in opposite directions. One train is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour, while the other train is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled. 

The first train, traveling at 60 miles per hour, will cover a distance of:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train, traveling at 30 miles per hour, will cover a distance of:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, we add the distances they've traveled to find the total distance between them:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to calculate 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2, which gives us 10 days off.

Now, let's find the number of days Billy works. We subtract the days off from the total number of days: 50 - 10 = 40 days.

We know Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. To find the total number of people he helps per day, we multiply the number of people he helps per hour by the number of hours he works: 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Finally, we multiply the number of people Billy helps per day by the number of days he works: 6 * 40 = 240 people.

We know that Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles. Amber ran 8 miles, and Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. To find out how many miles Micah ran, we'll multiply the number of miles Amber ran by 3.5.

Micah's miles = 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.

Now, let's add the miles run by Amber and Micah to find their combined total. 
Total miles run by Amber and Micah = 8 + 28 = 36 miles.

Since the total miles run by all three is 52, we can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.
Ahito's miles = Total miles - miles run by Amber and Micah = 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Sheila's credit card transactions to find the new balance.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. She then returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract that from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, Sheila bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off the original price of $20.00. To find the discount, we calculate 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00. So, the price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off the original price of $30.00. The discount is 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00. Therefore, the price of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the new purchases is $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00. Adding this to the balance after the return, we get the new balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lauren wants to save for a retirement period of 20 years, and she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000. To calculate her retirement savings goal, we need to determine how much she needs to save to live on 40% of her current salary for 20 years.

40% of $100,000 is $40,000 per year. For 20 years, she will need:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000

Since Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck, and assuming she gets paid bi-weekly (26 pay periods per year), her annual savings is:

$100,000 per year * 0.20 = $20,000 per year

To calculate how many years it will take her to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the goal by her annual savings:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

However, Lauren wants to retire in 20 years. This means she has already worked for some years and has already saved some amount. Let's assume she has already saved some amount, and she needs to save the remaining amount in the next 20 years.

Since she needs to save a total of $800,000, and she will save $20,000 per year for the next 20 years, she will save a total of:

$20,000 per year * 20 years = $400,000

in the next 20 years. This means she has already saved:

$800,000 - $400,000 = $400,000

However, we are not interested in the amount she has already saved. We are interested in the number of years she needs to work from now. Since she will save $400,000 in the next 20 years, and she needs to save a total of $400,000 more to reach her goal, the number of years she needs to work from now is equal to the number of years she needs to save the remaining amount.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours. The 2 workers producing 6 toys an hour will make 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys. The other 2 workers producing 4 toys an hour will make 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys. So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, let's find out how many toys the fifth worker produced. We subtract the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers from the total number of toys produced in 10 hours: 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

Since Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris, Luis must have had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris. We also know Luis used half of the stickers, so to find the initial number of stickers Luis had, we multiply 16 by 2. This gives us 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.

Now, we know Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. To find the initial number of stickers Seth had, we multiply the number of stickers Luis received (32) by 2. This gives us 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem. John buys 3 large bags of M&M's, each weighing 10 ounces. To find the total weight, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag: 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Since each ounce of M&M's contains 30 pieces, we can find the total number of M&M's by multiplying the total weight by the number of M&M's per ounce: 30 * 30 = 900.

Now, John wants to put 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag: 900 / 10 = 90.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's help Alfie the albatross figure out how many days it'll take him to fly half the way around the earth.

First, we need to calculate half of the earth's circumference. The earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that would be 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Now, let's divide this distance by Alfie's daily flying distance of 400 kilometers to find out how many days it'll take him to cover this distance.

We know that Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 Easter eggs. We also know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Additionally, Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

To start, let's find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, we can say that Sarah painted x eggs, and Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Together, they painted 30 eggs, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 12) = 30.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 12 = 30. Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 2x = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 9.

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many eggs Arnold and Madeline painted. We know that the total number of eggs is 56, and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs. Therefore, Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Finally, let's find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. Therefore, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to put them into boxes, with 8 crayons in each box. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. We need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes in pounds.

First, let's calculate the number of boxes needed. Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, the number of boxes is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, let's calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately. The weight of the crayons is 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces. The weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.

The total weight in ounces is the sum of the weight of the crayons and the boxes: 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

First, we need to find out how much of the tree can be used to make logs. Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate that as follows:
80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Now, we know that John cuts the tree into 4-foot logs. To find the total number of logs, we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we're told that John cuts 5 planks from each log. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log to find the total number of planks:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we know that John sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. To find her brother's salary, we multiply Valerie's salary by 2. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Now, let's calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000, and her brother earns $10,000, so together they earn $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Grandma walks 3 miles every day, with 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We know she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. To find the total time it takes for her to complete the walk, we need to find the time she spends on the sidewalk.

First, let's find her speed on the beach. We can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time. In this case, the distance is 2 miles, and the time is 40 minutes.

Speed = 2 miles / 40 minutes
Speed = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we know that Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk. So, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * (1/20) miles per minute, which is 1/10 miles per minute.

We can use this speed to find the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute)
Time = 10 minutes

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk is the sum of the time she spends on the beach and the time she spends on the sidewalk:

Total Time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes
Total Time = 50 minutes

Initial marbles + 24 = 60

Subtracting 24 from both sides gives us:

Initial marbles = 60 - 24
Initial marbles = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, he will have:

36 - 10 = 26

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem. Donny has two mugs of water, and he can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other is an unknown temperature. When he mixes 4 ounces of the 33-degree water with 1 ounce of the unknown water, the resulting mixture is drinkable.

To find the minimum temperature of the second mug, we can use the concept of weighted averages. The total weight of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug). The weighted average temperature of the mixture is:
(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction, we get:
4 * 33 + x ≥ 200
132 + x ≥ 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:
x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second mug is at least 68 degrees.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks.

First, we need to find out how many cows and chickens are added over the three weeks. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. So, the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows. The total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add these to the initial number of animals. There were 50 cows and 20 chickens initially. So, the total number of cows after three weeks is 50 + 420 = 470, and the total number of chickens after three weeks is 20 + 210 = 230.

To find the total number of animals, we add the total number of cows and chickens: 470 + 230 = 700.

Since he orders 4 packs, he receives a 10% discount. To calculate the discount, we find 10% of $40.00, which is $4.00. Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Each pack of bagels has 9 bagels, so the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

To find out how many potatoes make one scoop, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops: 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

To find the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we add the eggs from both periods:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes, 6 medium-sized picture scenes, or 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. She needs to create 45 large-sized picture scenes, 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 49 small-sized picture scenes.

First, let's calculate the number of days it would take her to complete each type of scene individually:
- Large-sized scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

However, Lauren can work on different scenes in a single day. To minimize the total number of days, let's try to combine the scenes.

One possible combination is:
- 6 days for medium-sized scenes (completing 36 scenes)
- During these 6 days, she can also work on large-sized scenes: 6 * 5 = 30 large-sized scenes (leaving 15 large-sized scenes)
- The remaining 15 large-sized scenes can be completed in 3 days.
- The 49 small-sized scenes can be completed in 7 days, but she can work on them during the 6 days for medium-sized scenes and the 3 additional days for large-sized scenes. Since she can complete 42 small-sized scenes in 6 days (6 * 7 = 42), she can complete the remaining 7 small-sized scenes in 1 day, which can be done during the 3 additional days for large-sized scenes.

Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times every time he goes out, and he goes out 3 times a day. To find out how many face masks he uses per day, we multiply the number of face masks he uses per outing by the number of times he goes out in a day:
2 face masks/time * 3 times/day = 6 face masks/day

Now, we need to find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days. To do this, we multiply the number of face masks he uses per day by 2:
6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this Easter egg hunt problem together.

First, we need to figure out how many eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, and there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can calculate the total number of eggs as 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's see how many eggs each of the kids found. Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many eggs as Lamar, so Stacy found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less eggs than Stacy, which means Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many eggs as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs found, we add up the eggs found by each kid: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Finally, to find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs Cole hid: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

John collects garbage from three apartment complexes. The first two have 200 apartments each, and the last one is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we need to calculate 60% of the combined total of the first two complexes.

The combined total of the first two complexes is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. Now, let's calculate 60% of 400, which is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Since the last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, it has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

He gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is 3120 * 0.40 = 1248.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits. Then, a 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so that's 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

For an 8-year-old tree, we're told it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We also know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. So, the 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced in 10 years:
- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: 800 fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits (since it doesn't produce any)
- Year 10: 1000 fruits

Jack initially had $100. Sophia gave him 1/5 of her $100. To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

1/5 of Sophia's $100 is (1/5) * 100 = 20.

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100:

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem. We have three ropes - red, blue, and yellow. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.

Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as y. Then, the length of the blue rope is y - 7, and the length of the red rope is 4(y - 7).

We can set up an equation using the combined length of the ropes:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6y = 72

Divide by 6:
y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
Blue rope = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
Red rope = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4(5) = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem.

Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa received thrice that amount, which is $15. After giving an equal amount to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money.

Let's denote the amount they gave to their sister as x. So, Ronnie has $5 - x left, and Rissa has $15 - x.

Since Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get:

-x = -$3

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = $3

Now that we know they each gave $3 to their sister, let's find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

$5 - $3 = $2

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the wall mural has four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. The amount of red, white, and purple paint is equal, and half the mural is yellow. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

First, let's find out how much paint is used for the yellow color. Since half the mural is yellow, we can calculate it as:

Yellow paint = 1/2 * Total paint
= 1/2 * 12
= 6 pints

Now, let's find the total amount of paint used for the non-yellow colors (red, white, and purple). We can do this by subtracting the amount of yellow paint from the total paint:

Non-yellow paint (red, white, purple) = Total paint - Yellow paint
= 12 - 6
= 6 pints

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can divide the non-yellow paint by 3 to find the amount of red paint:

Red paint = 1/3 * Non-yellow paint
= 1/3 * 6
= 2 pints

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to find the total area:
960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem. Alice counts the puffs of clouds in the sky while she eats her lunch outside at school. On Monday, she counts just 3 puffs of clouds. Each day after that through Friday, though, she sees double the number of clouds in the sky as the day before.

To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and add them up.

On Monday, she saw 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she saw 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she saw 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she saw 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she saw 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem. We have a regular box of 100 dishwasher pods for $12, and a special size box with 20% more pods for the same price. We want to find out how many dishwashing cycles we can run for $1 using the new box, assuming 1 pod per cycle.

First, let's calculate the number of pods in the special size box. To do this, we'll find 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 
20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
So, the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, let's find the cost per pod. Since the special size box costs $12, we'll divide the cost by the number of pods: 12 / 120 = $0.1 per pod.

Finally, to find out how many cycles we can run for $1, we'll divide $1 by the cost per pod: $1 / $0.1 = 10 cycles.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Thomas starts by withdrawing $1000 in 20 dollar bills. To find out how many 20 dollar bills he has, we divide the total amount by the value of each bill: 1000 / 20 = 50.

Unfortunately, Thomas loses 10 bills on his way home, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for something. Half of 40 is 20, so he's left with 20 bills.

The value of these 20 bills is 20 * 20 = 400 dollars.

Then, Thomas triples his money, which gives him 400 * 3 = 1200 dollars.

Finally, he converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide the total amount by the value of each bill: 1200 / 5 = 240.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first half of the soccer match, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which means team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

Moving on to the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, it scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match. Team A's total goals are 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. Team B's total goals are 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals. Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk and uses 45% of it on Monday. To find out how much chalk is left, we need to calculate 45% of 5 inches. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.
So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch per day (if the chalk was full). However, since the chalk is not full, we will use the remaining length to calculate the number of days.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the original 5 inches, we can calculate the number of days as follows:
2.75 inches / 1 inch per day = 2.75 days.

However, the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, so he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches.

Let's calculate the number of days until the chalk is less than 2 inches:
The teacher has 2.75 inches left and uses 1 inch per day. 
2.75 - 1 = 1.75 inches after the first day.
1.75 - 1 = 0.75 inches after the second day.

Since 0.75 inches is less than 1 inch, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after the second day of using 20% of the original chalk length per day.

However, the question asks for the number of days before he has to recycle the chalk. Therefore, the answer is 2 days before he has to recycle the chalk on the third day.

We are given two pieces of information: Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now, and in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. To solve this, we'll use variables to represent their current ages. Let's say Wendy's current age is W and Colin's current age is C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as an equation: W = 5(C + 7).

The second statement tells us that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. We can write this as another equation: C + 25 = (1/3)W.

Now, let's substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation: C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7)).

Simplifying this equation, we get: C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3.

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: 3C + 75 = 5C + 35.

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get: 75 = 2C + 35.

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get: 40 = 2C.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: C = 20.

First, we need to find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy with $27000. Since each set costs $500, we'll divide the total amount by the cost of one set.

Number of sets = Total amount / Cost per set
Number of sets = $27000 / $500
Number of sets = 54

Now, we know that each set contains 100 books. So, the total number of books Bob can buy is:

Total books = Number of sets * Books per set
Total books = 54 * 100
Total books = 5400

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we'll divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books each school will get.

Books per school = Total books / Number of schools
Books per school = 5400 / 3
Books per school = 1800

To find the total number of apples Newton brought home, let's count the apples in his pocket:

First, let's convert Jay's snowball-building rate to a more manageable unit. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Jay builds 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

Now, let's consider the melting rate. 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which translates to 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate at which Jay gains snowballs, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate: 
1/3 - 2/15 = (5 - 2) / 15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate to find the time it will take:

First, let's find John's age 20 years ago. To do that, we subtract 20 from his current age.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up a simple equation. Let's say Jim's age 20 years ago was x. Then, John's age 20 years ago would be 2x.

We know John's age 20 years ago was 8, so we can write:

2x = 8
x = 8 / 2
x = 4

So, Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. To find his current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago.

Jim's current age = 4 + 20

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the nurses' station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

Now, let's calculate the total bandages they had at the end of the third day. They ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used 25 bandages, so they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

However, it's given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means that they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the previous days.

On the second day, they used 28 bandages. Since they had 3 bandages left from the previous days, they must have had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages at the start of the second day.

On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left. Since they had 31 bandages at the start of the second day, they must have had 31 - 12 = 19 more bandages at the start of the first day.

So, the total bandages they had at the start of the first day is 50 (from the bulk pack) + 19 (extra bandages) + 12 (left at the end of the first day, but this 12 is already included in the 50) = 50 + 19 = 69.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. To find her total hours worked in a week, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days worked per week: 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week.

Since there are 4 weeks in April, we multiply the total hours worked per week by the number of weeks: 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours.

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, so we multiply the total hours worked by her hourly rate: 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270.

In addition to her hourly earnings, Jen receives $10 for each week of complete attendance. Since she had complete attendance for all 4 weeks in April, we add $10 * 4 weeks = $40 to her total earnings.

Now, she bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. This means she bought 2 * 5 packs = 10 packs of black pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of black pens is 10 packs * 5 pens per pack = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of each bottle of scotch. Since John buys 10 bottles for a total of $600, we can calculate the cost per bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle.

Now, let's move on to the cognac. John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch per bottle. To find this, we calculate 50% of $60, which is $30. Adding this to the cost of scotch per bottle, we get $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles × $90 per bottle = $1800.

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many trees Mr. Julius planted on the first day. We know he planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, he must have planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 + 40 = 60.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. To find 1/4 of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.25, which gives us 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted on both days: 60 + 80 = 140.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem and find out how much root beer was available for each person at the party.

Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer. However, his children discovered it and drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons. The next day, his wife Barbie spilled 7 gallons, reducing the amount to 20 - 7 = 13 gallons. On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

Now, on the day of the party, there were 3 guests, plus Fred, making a total of 4 people. To find out how much root beer each person can have, we divide the remaining amount by the number of people:

8 gallons / 4 people = 2 gallons per person.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We're given that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40. To find the number of coffee mugs, let's denote it as 'x'. We can set up an equation based on the given information:

4x + 8 = 40

Now, let's solve for 'x'. First, we'll subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we'll divide both sides by 4:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem.

We have 66 fish in the tank, and we're asked to find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 

First, we need to find the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we can calculate this by dividing 66 by 3.

66 / 3 = 22

So, 22 fish have red stripes. Now, let's find the number of fish with blue stripes. We know that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. To find the remaining fish, we subtract the fish with red stripes from the total.

Remaining fish = 66 - 22 = 44

Now, we can calculate 5/11 of the remaining fish.

(5/11) * 44 = 20

So, 20 fish have blue stripes. To find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we simply add the two numbers together.

Total fish with red and blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down Amy's eyeshadow collection. Initially, she had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, totaling 8 colors. Additionally, she had 3 makeup sets, each containing 6 eyeshadow colors, which amounts to 18 colors.

However, her sister took one of the palettes, leaving Amy with 8 - 4 = 4 colors from the palettes. The makeup sets remain untouched at this point, so she still has 18 colors from them.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each set has 6 colors, she used 6 / 2 = 3 colors. This leaves her with 18 - 3 = 15 colors from the makeup sets.

Combining the remaining colors from the palettes and makeup sets, Amy has 4 + 15 = 19 colors.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Mattison's height is 60 inches. Since his two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, we can calculate the total height of the house by multiplying Mattison's height by 7. 

Total height of the house = 7 * 60 = 420 inches

Next, we're given that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison. So, we can calculate the height of the first floor by multiplying Mattison's height by 3.

Height of the first floor = 3 * 60 = 180 inches

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house.

Height of the roof from the second floor's floor = Total height of the house - Height of the first floor
= 420 - 180
= 240 inches

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that 20 tourists found a total of 700 shells in a strip mall parking lot. They were divided into three groups: Alphas, The finders, and Gogetters. 

First, we need to find out how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the total shells, we can calculate it as follows:
40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells

Now, let's find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their share:
700 - 280 = 420 shells

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells. We can calculate it as follows:
60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells

Now, let's find out how many shells were left after team The finders found their share:
420 - 252 = 168 shells

These remaining shells were found by team Gogetters.

We know that Bernie has 4 dogs, and on average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. To find the total miles all the dogs need, we multiply the number of dogs by the average miles per day: 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, let's calculate the miles the first three dogs need. The first dog needs 1 mile, the second needs 4 miles, and the third needs 3 miles. So, the total miles the first three dogs need is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the miles the first three dogs need from the total miles: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

John's house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that. To find the loan amount, we'll calculate 40% of $250,000:
40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

He uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts. To find the amount he used, we'll calculate 60% of $100,000:
60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

The total weight of the tunas is: 
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much water the dehumidifier removes on each setting. The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day. The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water removed on each setting. Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, so it removed 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters. Then, he ran it for 3 days on the medium setting, so it removed 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters. Finally, he ran it for 5 days on the high setting, so it removed 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

To find the total amount of water removed, we add the amounts removed on each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

120 * 1/8 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 * 15 = 30 students.

First, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. So, the base area is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. Multiplying this by the height, we get the volume: 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the actual volume of jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, let's find the total number of jelly beans. We know that a single jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. So, the total number of jelly beans is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

We're told that 30% of the jelly beans are red. To find the estimated number of red jelly beans, we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3: 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract his estimate from the true number: 900 - 864 = 36.

On the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop boarded the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, the total number of people after the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers doubled. Therefore, the total number of people after the third stop is 90 * 2 = 180.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem. We know Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes to make a full glass of juice. So, her brother used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

Now, let's find out how many grapes were left. We don't know the total number of grapes yet, so let's call it x. After Madeline and her brother used their grapes, the remaining number of grapes is x - 6 - 30.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x - 6 - 30 = 48. Solving for x, we get x = 48 + 6 + 30 = 84.

The answer is: 84"
"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that 13 out of 82 teachers at Rydell Elementary School were sick. To find the number of teachers who were present, we subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers.

82 (total teachers) - 13 (sick teachers) = 69

However, we also know that 9 substitute teachers were called in to help. So, we add these substitute teachers to the number of teachers who were present.

69 (teachers present) + 9 (substitute teachers) = 78

Therefore, the total number of teachers at school that day was 78.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Bud spends $1.00 on pasta, $3.00 on cheddar cheese, and twice that amount, which is $6.00, on gruyere cheese. To find the total cost per week, we add these amounts together: $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we multiply the total cost per week by the number of weeks in a year, which is 52. So, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

$520"
"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The custodian has 80 classrooms to clean and 5 days to complete the task. It takes 15 minutes to clean each classroom. To find the total time spent cleaning, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time per classroom:
80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since the custodian has 5 days to clean the school, we divide the total time spent cleaning by 5:
1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes per day

Now, let's convert the custodian's 8-hour workday to minutes:
8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we divide the daily cleaning time by the total daily work time and multiply by 100:
(240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem at hand. Elly has 110 books and needs to figure out how many bookcases she needs to hold all of them.

Each bookcase has 5 shelves: 2 middle shelves, 1 bottom shelf, and 1 top shelf, and 1 more shelf. The middle shelves can hold 10 books each, so together they can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which means it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

The remaining shelf can hold 10 books.

In total, one bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 + 10 = 65 books.

To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we divide the total number of books (110) by the number of books one bookcase can hold (65) and round up to the nearest whole number since you can't have a fraction of a bookcase. 

110 / 65 = 1.69, rounded up is 2.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many eggs Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs, and one dozen is equal to 12 eggs, she bought a total of 5 x 12 = 60 eggs.

The cost of these eggs is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Now, let's calculate how much she will make by selling these eggs. She sells 3 eggs for $1, so she will sell 60 / 3 = 20 sets of eggs. Her total revenue will be 20 x $1 = $20.

To find her profit, we subtract her total cost from her total revenue: $20 - $12 = $8.

Now, let's find out how many hats are not red. That would be 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

Out of these 50 hats, 3/5 are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply 50 by 3/5, which gives us 30 blue hats.

The remaining hats are white. So, the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Archie buys a bag of beef jerky that contains 30 sticks and originally costs $18.00. However, he gets a discount of $3.00 on the bag. To find the cost per stick, we first need to calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount.

The total cost per bag after discount is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00. Now, we convert this amount to cents, as the cost per stick is required in cents. Since $1 = 100 cents, $15.00 = 1500 cents.

Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick. 
Cost per stick = 1500 cents / 30 sticks
Cost per stick = 50 cents

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Audrey needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly to pass. The total number of questions is 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110 questions.

To find out how many questions she needs to get right in total, we'll calculate 70% of 110.
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, let's see how many questions Audrey got right on the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct.
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since Audrey already got 42 questions correct on the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions correct on the second test.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem at hand. Mary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them, and we need to figure out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

We know that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. So, we have the equation: b = 5s - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which means the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes is 116. This gives us another equation: s + b = 116.

Now, let's substitute the expression for b into the second equation. We get: s + (5s - 4) = 116. Simplifying this, we get 6s - 4 = 116. Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120. Dividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20.

Now that we know Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes. Substituting s = 20 into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights. Since there's a flashlight for every person, and there are 4 people, that's 4 flashlights. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms, which is 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights. So, the total number of flashlights is 4 + 16 = 20.

Now, let's move on to the candles. The house has 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each, while the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 rooms is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other 4 have 5 medium candles each. The total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16, and the total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20. Therefore, the total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

Finally, we add the total number of flashlights and candles to get the final answer.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs. Given that there are 20 helmets, we can start by finding the number of footballs. Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, the number of footballs is twice the number of helmets.

Number of footballs = 2 * Number of helmets
Number of footballs = 2 * 20
Number of footballs = 40

Now, let's find the number of robots. Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can divide the number of helmets by 2.

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

To find the total number of items, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

Phineas needs to cover a total distance of 200 yards, with half of it on land and the other half in water. This means he'll be hopping on land for 100 yards and swimming through water for 100 yards.

We know Phineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so the time he'll take to cover 100 yards on land is:
Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes

Similarly, Phineas swims through water at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so the time he'll take to cover 100 yards in water is:
Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

To find the total time it'll take Phineas to return home, we simply add the time he spends on land and in water:
Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. Then, in the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

Next, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate, so in the next 30 seconds, 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's get to the problem at hand. Tim needs to make lemonade for a pool party, and his recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for the regular gallons of lemonade.

For 4 gallons of regular lemonade, Tim will need 4 cups of lemon juice. To find the number of lemons required, we multiply the number of cups by 6 (since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice). So, 4 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons.

Now, let's consider the extra gallon that's twice as tart. This means it will require twice the amount of lemon juice, which is 2 cups. Again, we multiply the number of cups by 6 to find the number of lemons needed: 2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons.

To find the total number of lemons required, we add the lemons needed for the regular gallons and the extra gallon: 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons.

Then, he turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed. Again, we multiply the speed by the time: 18 miles/hour * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house: 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate the total cost for the family's trip to the cinema.

First, we need to find the cost of the tickets. The family consists of two adults and one child. The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and a child ticket is $8. So, the total cost of the tickets would be:

2 adult tickets: 2 * $12 = $24
1 child ticket: $8
Total ticket cost: $24 + $8 = $32

Next, they buy 2 popcorns for $3 each. The total cost of the popcorns would be:
2 popcorns: 2 * $3 = $6

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns to find the total cost:
$32 (tickets) + $6 (popcorns) = $38

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's calculate the force John needs to push the car.

First, we need to find the total weight of the car, including the luggage and the two children. The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, their combined weight is 2 * 75 = 150 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights: 1200 (car) + 250 (luggage) + 150 (children) = 1600 pounds.

The force to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of the total weight, we multiply the total weight by 0.01. 

Force = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

The final answer is: 16"
"Hello there, I'm Aparna. To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we'll calculate the perimeter of his rectangular backyard fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).

Given the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2(35)
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem. Dexter has five pigs, and each one eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. To find out how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week.

First, let's calculate the daily feed consumption of one pig. Since each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, the total amount of feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Now, let's multiply this by the number of pigs Dexter has, which is 5. So, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. Therefore, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a week is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of hot dogs per guest.

Total hot dogs required = 20 * 2 = 40

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we subtract those from the total required.

Hot dogs needed to buy = 40 - 4 = 36

Now, we know that a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs. To find out how many packs John needs to buy, we divide the number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack.

Number of packs = 36 / 6 = 6

Finally, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack.

Total cost = 6 * $2 = $12

First, let's calculate the total square feet from the small shirts. Since each small shirt is 3 square feet, we multiply the number of small shirts (11) by the square feet per shirt (3). This gives us 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.

Next, we calculate the total square feet from the medium shirts. Each medium shirt is 4 square feet, so we multiply the number of medium shirts (8) by the square feet per shirt (4). This gives us 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.

Finally, we calculate the total square feet from the large shirts. Each large shirt is 6 square feet, so we multiply the number of large shirts (6) by the square feet per shirt (6). This gives us 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

He also gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so that's 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

Now, let's talk about the beakers. Igor gathered the correct number initially, but he lost some on the way. We don't know how many he lost yet, so let's call that number x. This means he gathered 7 - x beakers.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + 7 - x (beakers), and we know this equals 29.

So, we can set up the equation: 8 + 16 + 7 - x = 29.

Now, we are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, it would take Vanessa twice as long to run the same distance. So, if Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, Vanessa would take 16 * 2 = 32 minutes to run 2 miles.

To find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles, we can multiply the time it took her to run 2 miles by 2, since she ran twice the distance. Therefore, Vanessa took 32 * 2 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The vendor sold the watermelons at a 25% profit. To find the profit amount per watermelon, we'll calculate 25% of the cost price.

Profit amount per watermelon = 25% of $1.60 = 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40

Now, let's find the selling price per watermelon by adding the cost price and the profit amount.

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit amount per watermelon
= $1.60 + $0.40
= $2.00

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that James is twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. To find Dora's current age, we subtract 3 from 12, which gives us 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John was 19 years old when James was born. Now, we need to find John's current age. Since James is 18 years old, John is 18 + 19 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the age difference between John and his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

The youngest son's current age is 5 years. In 3 years, he will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Ana and Jane start peeling oranges at the same time, and we want to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour.

First, let's calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour. Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 / 3 = 20 oranges

On the other hand, Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 / 4 = 15 oranges

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5

"Hello, I'm Aparna. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark needs a new radiator that originally costs $400, but he gets it for 80% off at a junk shop. To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 20% of the original price, since 100% - 80% = 20%.
20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

Next, he hires a mechanic to install it, and the mechanic charges $50 per hour. The installation takes 3 hours, so the total labor cost is:
$50 * 3 = $150

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost:
$80 + $150 = $230

$230"
"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they are either chickens or cows. The total number of legs is 70. To start, let's use variables to represent the number of chickens and cows. Let's say 'c' is the number of chickens and 'w' is the number of cows.

Since there are 20 animals in total, we can write the equation:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so we can write another equation:

2c + 4w = 70

To make things easier, let's simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:

c + 2w = 35

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'w' into the first equation:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"Hello there, I'm Aparna. Let's dive into the problem. Henry and his 3 friends have ordered 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. To find out how many slices each of them can have, we need to calculate the total number of slices first.

Since there are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we have 4 people in total, including Henry and his friends. To share the slices equally, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 / 4 = 14.

So, each of them can have 14 slices.

Answer: 14"
