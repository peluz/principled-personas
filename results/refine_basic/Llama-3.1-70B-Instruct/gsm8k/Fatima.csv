"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Janet's daily egg sales to figure out how much she makes at the farmers' market.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 for breakfast and 4 for baking muffins, so that's a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs used. To find out how many eggs she sells, we subtract the eggs used from the total eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Since Janet sells each egg for $2, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem. A robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber, and it needs half that amount of white fiber. To find the amount of white fiber, we'll divide the amount of blue fiber by 2. So, 2 bolts of blue fiber divided by 2 is 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts. 

The final answer is: 3"
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Josh's house flipping venture to calculate his profit.

First, we need to determine the total cost Josh incurred. He bought the house for $80,000 and spent an additional $50,000 on repairs. So, his total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% + 150%). To find the new value, we'll calculate 250% of the original value of the house, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

Now, let's calculate Josh's profit. His profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down James' running routine to find out how many meters he runs in a week.

James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week. So, the total number of sprints he runs in a week is 3 * 3 = 9 sprints. Since each sprint is 60 meters, we multiply the total number of sprints by the distance of each sprint.

Total meters per week = 9 sprints * 60 meters per sprint = 540 meters

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's figure out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day. Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, and the price of the glasses alternates between $5 and 60% of $5. To find the total cost, we can calculate the cost of each pair of glasses.

The first glass in each pair costs $5, and the second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3. So, the total cost of each pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide them into 8 pairs. The total cost of 8 pairs is 8 * $8 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Now, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which means Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we simply add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Carla's file download situation.

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before Windows forces a restart. To find 40% of 200 GB, we multiply 200 by 0.4, which gives us 80 GB. Carla's download speed is 2 GB per minute, so it takes her 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to download 80 GB.

After the 20-minute restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. This means she'll be downloading the entire 200 GB file. At 2 GB per minute, it'll take her 200 / 2 = 100 minutes to complete the download.

To find the total time, we add the initial download time (40 minutes), the restart time (20 minutes), and the complete download time (100 minutes). So, the total time is 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down John's journey to find out how far he is from home.

First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply his speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Now, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move.

After the traffic, he drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he travels in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

For the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), he drives at 80 mph. The distance he travels in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance John travels in the 4 hours after turning around is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Since John was trying to get back home, we subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the distance he traveled before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"Hello. To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular and overtime hours. 

Eliza's regular pay is $10 per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week. So, her regular pay is 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

For the overtime hours, she receives 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. Since she worked 45 hours this week, she has 5 hours of overtime. Her overtime pay is 5 hours * (1.2 * $10/hour) = 5 * $12 = $60.

Now, let's add her regular pay and overtime pay to find her total earnings. Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

"Hello. Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. 

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. So, the downloads in the second month were 3 * 60 = 180.

Now, for the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

To find the total number of downloads, we add the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the total cost of the pastries Toula bought from the bakery.

First, we have 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen, so that's 3 x $68 = $204. Then, there are 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen, which is 2 x $80 = $160. Lastly, we have 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen, so that's 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add up the costs: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem of Carlos and his lemon tree.

To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) plus the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree ($3 per year). 

The total revenue is the annual revenue from selling lemons (7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year).

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.5
Year 2: Total cost = $93 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $96, Total revenue = $10.5 * 2 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $99, Total revenue = $10.5 * 3 = $31.5
Year 4: Total cost = $99 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $102, Total revenue = $10.5 * 4 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $105, Total revenue = $10.5 * 5 = $52.5
Year 6: Total cost = $105 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $108, Total revenue = $10.5 * 6 = $63

Since the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108) in year 6, we need to calculate for more years.

Year 7: Total cost = $108 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $111, Total revenue = $10.5 * 7 = $73.5
Year 8: Total cost = $111 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $114, Total revenue = $10.5 * 8 = $84
Year 9: Total cost = $114 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $117, Total revenue = $10.5 * 9 = $94.5
Year 10: Total cost = $117 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $120, Total revenue = $10.5 * 10 = $105
Year 11: Total cost = $120 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $123, Total revenue = $10.5 * 11 = $115.5
Year 12: Total cost = $123 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $126, Total revenue = $10.5 * 12 = $126

However, in year 12, the total revenue ($126) is still not more than the total cost ($126). We need to calculate for year 13.

Year 13: Total cost = $126 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $129, Total revenue = $10.5 * 13 = $136.5

In year 13, the total revenue ($136.5) is more than the total cost ($129). Therefore, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie starts with an unknown number of vacuum cleaners, which we'll call 'x'. She sells a third of them at the green house, which is x/3. Then, she sells 2 more to the red house. To find out how many vacuum cleaners are left after these two sales, we subtract the number sold from the total: x - x/3 - 2.

To simplify this, we can first find a common denominator for x and x/3, which is 3. So, we rewrite x as 3x/3. Now, we can subtract: 3x/3 - x/3 - 2 = 2x/3 - 2.

Next, Melanie sells half of what's left at the orange house. To find half of 2x/3 - 2, we divide by 2: (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1.

We know Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:
x/3 - 1 = 5

To solve for x, we add 1 to both sides:
x/3 = 6

Then we multiply both sides by 3:
x = 18

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have a dance class with 20 students. First, 20% of them enrolled in contemporary dance. To find the number of students, we multiply 20 by 0.2, which gives us 4 students.

Now, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left. Then, 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. We multiply 16 by 0.25, which gives us 4 students.

So, the number of students left for hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide 12 by the total number of students (20) and multiply by 100. This gives us (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

"Hello. I'd be happy to help you with that.

To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for each.

For the jewelry worth $5,000 with a 2.5% increase:
Increase in value = $5,000 * 2.5% = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125

For the electronic gadgets worth $8,000 with a 1.2% increase:
Increase in value = $8,000 * 1.2% = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the jewelry, which has a higher increase in value.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have two trains that start at the same point, San Rafael, and travel westward for 80 miles on the first day. The direction they travel doesn't affect the distance, so we can simply note that they each covered 80 miles.

The next day, they change direction and travel northward, covering 150 miles. Again, the direction doesn't impact the distance, so we add this to the previous day's total.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we add the distance from the first day (80 miles) to the distance from the second day (150 miles).

80 + 150 = 230

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Jill's annual salary.

First, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching. She earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. She earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, so she eats 3 eggs per day. To find the total number of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of days by the number of eggs she eats per day: 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Now, to find the number of dozens of eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs). 
84 / 12 = 7.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Marissa's hiking problem step by step.

Marissa wants to complete a 12-mile trail with an average speed of 4 miles per hour. To achieve this, we need to find the total time she has to complete the trail.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. Now, let's find the time she has left to complete the remaining 6 miles.

Time left = Total time - Time already taken
Time left = 3 hours - 2 hours
Time left = 1 hour

Now that we know Marissa has 1 hour to complete the remaining 6 miles, we can find the speed she needs to walk.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

Adding these up, we get $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. This is the total cost of everything except the pizza.

Since Marie paid $50 in total, we subtract $33 from that to find out how much she spent on pizza: $50 - $33 = $17.

First, let's calculate how much money John made from selling his lego sets. Since he has 13 lego sets and sells them for $15 each, he made 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, let's calculate how much he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left, which means the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets, minus the amount he didn't spend. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, that means he didn't spend the money from all 13 lego sets. The amount he didn't spend is $195 - $165 = $30.

Since each lego set is $15, the number of lego sets he didn't sell is $30 / $15 = 2.

So, John still has 2 lego sets.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem to find John's running speed.

We know John runs 60 miles a week and he runs 3 days a week. The time he runs each day is 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, the time he runs on the second and third days is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each.

Now, let's calculate the total time he runs in a week:
Total time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day)
Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5
Total time = 6 hours

To find John's running speed, we'll divide the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. This means her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Now, we're told that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she can travel in 2 hours while running is 2 * 6 = 12 miles.
The distance she can travel in 4 hours while walking is 4 * 1.5 = 6 miles.

The total distance she can travel in 6 hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Now, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. To find Brandon's iPhone age, we multiply Ben's iPhone age by 4. So, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's tackle this problem together.

We know that Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone. However, when she holds the gemstone, her throwing distance triples. To find the new distance, we multiply 400 by 3, which gives us 1200 feet.

Now, we need to determine how far outside the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon. The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, so we subtract this distance from Polly's new throwing distance: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get to the problem at hand. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the fireman's luncheon, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie: 5 x 8 = 40.

Now, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To determine how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces: 40 - 14 = 26.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. You have 2000 calories as your target and you have already consumed 1800 calories. To find the remaining calories, we subtract the consumed calories from the target calories.

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Now, we know that the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. We need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories. To do this, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving.

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams 0.8 servings is. First, we find out how many grams are in one serving.

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.

Now, we multiply the grams per serving by the number of servings you can eat.

60g * 0.8 = 48g.

The answer is: 48"
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Charlie's candle-making business to find his net profit.

First, we need to determine how much it costs Charlie to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, he'll need 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Now, let's calculate Charlie's total revenue from selling 20 candles. He sells each candle for $2.00, so his total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

To find Charlie's net profit, we subtract his total cost from his total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Meredith's writing schedule to find out how many hours she spent writing articles.

Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find out how many more articles she wrote, I'll calculate 2/5 of 5, which is (2/5) * 5 = 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Candice initially had 80 post-it notes in her purse. Then, she purchased a package of post-it notes, which we'll call x. So, the total number of post-it notes she had after buying the package is 80 + x.

At work, she used 220 post-it notes, leaving her with (80 + x) - 220 post-it notes. We know that she had 23 post-it notes remaining, so we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Now, let's solve for x:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The final answer is: 163"
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we divide the total amount spent by the cost of each tie: 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he must have bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

Now, we're told that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. To find the cost of a red tie, we calculate 50% of the cost of a blue tie and add it to the original cost: 40 + (0.5 * 40) = 40 + 20 = $60 per red tie.

The total amount spent on red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

Finally, to find the total amount spent on ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

Tracy has a 4-foot wire that she wants to cut into 6-inch pieces. To find out how many pieces she'll get, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches by multiplying 4 by 12.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find out how many pieces Tracy will get.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

"Hello, I'm Fatima. To find the total number of unoccupied units in Richard's apartment building, we need to calculate the total number of units and then subtract the number of occupied units.

First, let's find the total number of units. Since there are 15 floors with 8 units each, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor.

Total number of units = 15 * 8
Total number of units = 120

Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4.

Number of occupied units = 120 * (3/4)
Number of occupied units = 90

Finally, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Number of unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Number of unoccupied units = 30

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get cracking on Lloyd's egg-cellent earnings.

To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by 7.

First, let's figure out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd's chickens produce per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we'll divide the total number of eggs by 12:
252 eggs ÷ 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozen eggs per day

Now, let's calculate Lloyd's daily earnings. He sells each dozen eggs for $2, so:
21 dozen eggs per day × $2 per dozen = $42 per day

Finally, let's calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings:
$42 per day × 7 days per week = $294 per week

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now that we know the distance, we can find the time it takes him to get back at a rate of 6 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's help Uriah with his heavy book bag. He needs to remove 15 pounds from it. We know his comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, we can calculate the weight of those comic books first.

30 comic books * 1/4 pound per comic book = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, and he's already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds of toys.

Now, let's find out how many toys he needs to remove. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy.

7.5 pounds / 0.5 pounds per toy = 15

The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

Aleena pays $140 per month for the first half of the year, which is 6 months. To find the total amount for the first half, we multiply the monthly charge by the number of months: 140 * 6 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charges her 10% less. To find the reduced monthly charge, we calculate 10% of $140: 0.1 * 140 = $14. Then, we subtract this amount from the original monthly charge: 140 - 14 = $126. Since the second half of the year is also 6 months, we multiply the reduced monthly charge by the number of months: 126 * 6 = $756.

To do this, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill up again. This means she used 4 gallons to travel 100 miles.

Let's calculate the miles per gallon:

mpg = Total miles / Total gallons used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we know the car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find the total miles Sophia can drive on a single tank, we multiply the mpg by the total capacity of the tank.

To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-leveled sandcastle, we need to calculate the total square footage of all levels and then divide by the number of levels.

We know the top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage as the level below it, we can work our way down. The second level will have twice the square footage of the top level, which is 2 * 16 = 32.

The fourth level will have twice the square footage of the third level, which is 2 * 64 = 128.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Cecilia's puppy needs 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. To find the total amount of dog food consumed during this period, we multiply the number of days by the amount of food per day:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

After the first 180 days, the puppy will need 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of the year. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day for:
365 days - 180 days = 185 days

Now, let's calculate the total amount of dog food consumed during this period:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

The total amount of dog food consumed in the first year is the sum of the dog food consumed during the first 180 days and the remaining days:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can find the number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year by dividing the total amount of dog food consumed by the amount in each bag:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

First, we need to determine which package is the better deal. We have two options: a package of 3 flowers for $2.50 or a package of 2 flowers for $1. To compare the prices, we'll calculate the cost per flower for each package.

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 ÷ 3 = $0.833 per flower. For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 ÷ 2 = $0.50 per flower. Clearly, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better deal.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. Since each package contains 2 flowers, Vincent will need 18 ÷ 2 = 9 packages. The total cost will be 9 packages × $1 per package = $9.

If Vincent were to buy 18 flowers at the other price, he would need 18 ÷ 3 = 6 packages. The total cost would be 6 packages × $2.50 per package = $15.

The amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is $15 - $9 = $6.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the cost of the dog grooming after the discount.

The original price of the grooming is $100, and the groomer is offering a 30% discount for new customers. To find the discount amount, I'll multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

Discount amount = 30% of $100 = 0.3 * $100 = $30

Now, I'll subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price.

Discounted price = $100 - $30 = $70

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We have 24 liters of water, and two girls each got 1/6 of it. To find out how much water each girl got, we need to divide 24 by 6, which is 4 liters per girl. Since there are two girls, they got a total of 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

Now, a boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken is 8 (girls) + 6 (boy) = 14 liters.

To find out how much water is left, we subtract the total amount of water taken from the initial amount: 24 - 14 = 10 liters.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

Charlie had 10 stickers initially. He then bought 21 stickers from a store in the mall and got 23 stickers for his birthday. To find the total number of stickers he had, we need to add these numbers together:
10 (initial stickers) + 21 (bought stickers) + 23 (birthday stickers) = 54 stickers

After that, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card. So, the total number of stickers he gave away and used is:
9 (given to sister) + 28 (used for greeting card) = 37 stickers

Now, let's subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used from the total number of stickers he had:
54 (total stickers) - 37 (given away and used) = 17 stickers

"Hello, I'm Fatima. To find the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we need to calculate Alex's weight first. Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, we'll start by multiplying Grace's weight by 4. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds, so 4 times her weight is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. Now, we subtract 2 pounds from that to find Alex's weight: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now that we know Alex's weight, we can add it to Grace's weight to find their combined weight: 
125 (Grace's weight) + 498 (Alex's weight) = 623 pounds.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the total number of thorns on Dan's rose bushes.

First, we need to find the total number of roses. Since Dan has 3 rose bushes and each bush has 25 roses, we multiply the number of bushes by the number of roses per bush.

Total roses = 3 * 25
Total roses = 75

Now, we know that each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose.

Total thorns = 75 * 8
Total thorns = 600

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem. We know the football team played 22 games in total. They also won 8 more games than they lost. To find out how many games they won, we can use a simple equation.

Let's say the number of games they lost is 'x'. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is 'x + 8'. The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and lost, which is 22. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Since the team won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is:
x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get to the problem at hand. Gene is sewing a quilt out of old souvenir t-shirts, and we need to figure out how many quilt blocks he has in total.

First, we need to determine how many years Gene has been vacationing. He started going on vacations when he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. So, the number of years he's been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations a year, we can multiply the number of years by the number of vacations per year to find the total number of vacations. That's 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Now, since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times. 
The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which is 3 * 4 = 12 times. 
The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22

"Hello. To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase and then multiply it by 12.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. The company increases the salaries of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years. So, the 10% increase would be $600 * 0.10 = $60.

Her new monthly salary after 5 years would be $600 + $60 = $660. To find her annual salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12.

Annual salary after 5 years: $660 * 12 = $7920

Since the salary increase is only given once after 5 years, her annual salary will remain the same for the next three years.

Annual salary after three more years: $7920"

We know that Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x', then Marilyn sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:
x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many guests will actually show up to the party. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of guests that will show up as follows:

Number of guests that will show up = Total number of guests - (1/4 * Total number of guests)
= 16 - (1/4 * 16)
= 16 - 4
= 12

Now, we know Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest. To find the total number of gift bags she needs, we multiply the number of guests that will show up by 0.75:

Total gift bags = 0.75 * Number of guests that will show up
= 0.75 * 12
= 9

Finally, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of gift bags by the cost per gift bag, which is $2:

Total cost = Total gift bags * Cost per gift bag
= 9 * 2

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get to the problem at hand. Ted the T-Rex needs to figure out how much potato salad to bring to the dinosaur picnic.

First, we know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much, which is 5 pounds. There are 20 adults and 5 children attending the picnic.

To calculate the total amount of potato salad needed, we'll start with the adults. Since there are 20 adults, and each eats 10 pounds, we multiply 20 by 10, which gives us 200 pounds.

Next, we calculate the amount needed for the children. With 5 children, each eating 5 pounds, we multiply 5 by 5, resulting in 25 pounds.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad needed for both adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

Now, since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Given that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age. So, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Jackson's age is 4."
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he's 2 seconds faster than Gerald's original time. To find Gerald's original time, we add 2 seconds to Lee's time.

Gerald's original time = Lee's time + 2 seconds
Gerald's original time = 38 + 2
Gerald's original time = 40 seconds

Now, Gerald's speed improved by 10% due to his new diet. This means his new time will be 90% of his original time. To find 90% of his original time, we multiply by 0.9.

Gerald's new time = 0.9 * Gerald's original time
Gerald's new time = 0.9 * 40
Gerald's new time = 36 seconds

We have 200 Grade 5 students in total, and 2/5 of them are boys. To find the number of boys, we multiply 200 by 2/5.

Number of boys = 200 * (2/5) = 80

Now, let's find the number of girls. Since the total number of students is 200, and 80 are boys, the number of girls is:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys = 200 - 80 = 120

We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we multiply the number of girls by 2/3.

Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 * (2/3) = 80

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

So, the total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Now, let's subtract this from the total hours of TV watched: 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours. This is the amount of TV Frankie watched on Wednesday.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 90 minutes.

First, we need to find out how far Julia rows to reach the shore. We know it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can calculate her rowing speed.

Rowing speed = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second

Now, we know the shore is 64 seconds away, so we can multiply the time by her rowing speed to find the total distance.

Distance = Speed * Time = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10 to find the number of 10-foot intervals.

Number of intervals = Total distance / 10 feet = 80 feet / 10 feet = 8 intervals

Finally, we can multiply the number of intervals by 2 liters to find the total amount of water the boat has taken on.

Total water = Number of intervals * 2 liters/interval = 8 intervals * 2 liters/interval = 16 liters

Cost price of 10 (2 x 4 x 10) boards = 10 * $10 = $100
Cost price of 5 (4 x 4 x 10) boards = 5 * $16 = $80
Total cost price = $100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price.

Selling price of 10 (2 x 4 x 10) boards = 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150
Selling price of 5 (4 x 4 x 10) boards = 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120
Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270

First, let's find the total number of parts in the ratio. We add the parts together: 7 (sugar) + 13 (water) = 20 parts.

Now, we know Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, we need to find the fraction of the total that represents the sugar. Since the ratio of sugar to the total is 7:20, we can multiply this fraction by the total amount:

(7/20) * 120 = 7 * 6 = 42

So, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair contains 2 shoes, we need to find the total number of shoes. To do this, we multiply the number of pairs by 2 (since each pair has 2 shoes) and then multiply by the number of children:
2 pairs/child * 2 shoes/pair * 3 children = 12 shoes

Now, we know the cost of each shoe is $60. To find the total amount John paid, we multiply the total number of shoes by the cost of each shoe:
12 shoes * $60/shoe = $720

"Hello, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that on the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles from the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day. To find the number of vehicles imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles from the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4.

The number of containers imported on the second day is 4."
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem and find the solution.

We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and it increased by 40% over the four years. To find his new salary, we can calculate:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, let's find Lylah's salary four years ago. We know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. So, we can set up the equation:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Sadie's sleep schedule for the week.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours. For the next two days, Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, which is 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. So, for Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept a total of 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week, Thursday to Sunday, she slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, which is 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. Since there are 4 days from Thursday to Sunday, she slept a total of 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours for the entire week: 
Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday and Wednesday: 12 hours
Thursday to Sunday: 28 hours
Total hours = 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Rosie's running scenario to find out how many miles she can run in 7 hours.

First, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. To find the distance she covers in this time, we multiply her speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

After 3 hours, Rosie has 4 hours left (7 hours - 3 hours). In these 4 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. To find the distance she covers in this time, we multiply her speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances she covers in both parts to find the total distance:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

To find out how many spoons Julia had before her husband gave her the 5 new spoons, we subtract 5 from the total number of spoons: 
12 - 5 = 7

However, we also know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, to find out how many spoons Julia had before she used those 3 spoons, we add 3 to the 7 spoons: 
7 + 3 = 10

Therefore, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

Dillon needs to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. Let's calculate the total cost:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

Now, let's add the number of rides for Pam and Fred: 4 rides (Pam) + 6 rides (Fred) = 10 rides.

So, Walt's total mileage for Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Given that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, we can find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday by subtracting the total mileage for Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday:

And, she ordered 2 cookies for $1.00 each, so that's 2 x $1.00 = $2.00. Adding these up, we get $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

Next, there's a 20% delivery fee. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply by 0.20, which gives us $4.00. So, the total cost with the delivery fee is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is 2Q. And since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2(2Q) = 4Q.

The total number of bees is the sum of queens, baby bees, and worker bees, which is Q + 2Q + 4Q = 7Q. We know this total is 700, so we can set up the equation:
7Q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into this problem together.

We know that Dave bought a large pack of french fries and ate 14 before a hungry seagull stole the pack. The seagull then ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.

After the seagull, three pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate 3 fries. So, the pigeons ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total.

Let's denote the original number of french fries as x. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x - 14 (Dave's fries) - 7 (seagull's fries) - 9 (pigeons' fries) = remaining fries

This simplifies to:
x - 30 = remaining fries

A raccoon then stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, leaving 1/3 of the remaining fries behind. We know that the ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, the number of fries left after the raccoon is 5 + 1 = 6.

We can set up another equation:
1/3 * (x - 30) = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3:
x - 30 = 18
x = 18 + 30
x = 48

So, the original number of french fries in the pack was 48.

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches. Converting to feet: 1200 inches / 12 = 100 feet.
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches. Converting to feet: 720 inches / 12 = 60 feet.
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet.

Now, let's add up the lengths: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months.

First, we need to find out how many bananas are needed per month. The monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas every month. 

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is: 
200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, he needs to order:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

The final answer is: 1400"
"Hey there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down this problem step by step.

Blake and Kelly are running on a football field that's 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, which means he covers a distance of 200 yards (100 yards each way) 15 times. So, Blake's total distance is 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly, on the other hand, runs back and forth once, covering 200 yards. Then, she decides to run to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each of these trips is 80 yards (40 yards each way). So, Kelly's total distance is 200 + (34 * 80) = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Now, let's compare their distances. Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards. To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate how much Raphael spent on school supplies.

First, we need to find the total cost of the pens. Since each pen costs $1.5 and he bought 4, the total cost of the pens is 4 x $1.5 = $6.

Next, we calculate the cost of the notebooks. Each notebook costs $4, and he bought 2, so the total cost of the notebooks is 2 x $4 = $8.

Lastly, we add the cost of the rim of bond paper, which is $20.

"Hello. To find the tank's water depth on Wednesday, we need to calculate the depth on Tuesday first and then find two-thirds of that.

The tank's initial depth on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, it had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Now, we need to find two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday. To do this, we multiply 24 by 2 and then divide by 3. This gives us (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16 feet.

The tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem and find out how many fish Anakin and Locsin caught at the beach.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Now, let's see what Locsin caught. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so that's 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. And, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin. Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish. To find the total number of fish caught, we add Anakin's and Locsin's catches: 19 + 13 = 32.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every 2 months. The price increases by 20% of the original price every 2 months.

Let's break it down:

Initial price = $20
Price increase every 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

Since the price increases every 2 months, we'll calculate the price for each 2-month period:
- After 2 months: $20 + $4 = $24
- After 4 months: $24 + 20% of $24 = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
- After 6 months: $28.80 + 20% of $28.80 = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
- After 8 months: $34.56 + 20% of $34.56 = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47
- After 10 months: $41.47 + 20% of $41.47 = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76
- After 12 months: $49.76 + 20% of $49.76 = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71
- After 14 months: $59.71 + 20% of $59.71 = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65
- After 16 months: $71.65 + 20% of $71.65 = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98
- After 18 months: $85.98 + 20% of $85.98 = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18
- After 20 months: $103.18 + 20% of $103.18 = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82
- After 22 months: $123.82 + 20% of $123.82 = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58
- After 24 months: $148.58 + 20% of $148.58 = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30
- After 26 months: $178.30 + 20% of $178.30 = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96
- After 28 months: $213.96 + 20% of $213.96 = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75
- After 30 months: $256.75 + 20% of $256.75 = $256.75 + $51.35 = $308.10
- After 32 months: $308.10 + 20% of $308.10 = $308.10 + $61.62 = $369.72
- After 34 months: $369.72 + 20% of $369.72 = $369.72 + $73.94 = $443.66
- After 36 months: $443.66 + 20% of $443.66 = $443.66 + $88.73 = $532.39

The cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $532.39."
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the total cost of all the toys in the room.

First, we know that there are 5 red cars, and each one costs $4. So, the total cost of the red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.

Next, we have 3 action figures, and each one costs $5. Therefore, the total cost of the action figures is 3 x $5 = $15.

Now, the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which is $15.

To find the total cost of all the toys, we simply add up the cost of each type of toy: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

On the other hand, hiring an accountant would cost her a flat fee of $90.

To make a Spanish flan, Sandra needs 3 eggs, and she has to make 15 of them. So, the total number of eggs she needs is 3 eggs/flan * 15 flans = 45 eggs.

Since Sandra's neighbor gives her 9 eggs every time she babysits, we can divide the total number of eggs she needs by the number of eggs she gets per job:
45 eggs / 9 eggs/job = 5 jobs.

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke. Let's denote Brooke's current age as 'x'. This means Seth's current age is 2x.

In 2 years, Brooke will be x + 2 years old, and Seth will be 2x + 2 years old. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as an equation:

(x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28

Now, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms:

3x + 4 = 28

Next, we'll subtract 4 from both sides:

3x = 24

Now, divide both sides by 3:

x = 8

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is 2x = 2 * 8 = 16.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Jessica's monthly debt payments and calculate how much she pays in a year.

First, we need to find the total minimum payment. Jessica's student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. 

Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we calculate the increase:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, we add the increase to the minimum payment:
$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

Now, let's add the time it takes to peel and cut a potato: 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes = 1.5833 minutes per potato.

Since Billy has 60 potatoes, we multiply the time per potato by 60: 1.5833 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 95 minutes.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Juan and his brother Carlos are selling lemonade, and we need to find out how much they spent on lemons. To do this, we'll first calculate the cost and revenue per gallon.

The cost per gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Now, let's find the profit per gallon by subtracting the cost from the revenue: $10 - $5 = $5 per gallon.

We know they made a total profit of $25, so we can find the total number of gallons by dividing the total profit by the profit per gallon: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Finally, we can find the total cost of lemons by multiplying the total number of gallons by the cost of lemons per gallon: 5 * $3 = $15.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Zaid's expenses and donations to find out how much he'll have left.

First, we need to calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500. He also spends 1/3 on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000.

Adding these two expenses together, we get 1500 + 2000 = 3500. This means he has 6000 - 3500 = 2500 left.

Next, Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. Half of 2500 is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250. So, after the donation, he has 2500 - 1250 = 1250 left.

Finally, Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$ for expenses and groceries. This adds up to 200 + 700 = 900. Subtracting this from the remaining amount, we get 1250 - 900 = 350.

Let's break it down: Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, and 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. To find the number of red roses, we first need to find the number of white carnations.

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of white carnations as x. Then the number of pink calla lilies is 5x. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200.

So, 5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. The number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem at hand. Jerry is rolling a six-sided die, and we want to find out how much more likely it is that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

First, let's consider the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die: 4, 5, and 6. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5. Since the die is rolled twice, we multiply the probabilities together: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

To find the difference between the two probabilities, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

Finally, we express this difference as a percentage by multiplying by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters, with one hamster per cage, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. Then, there's a pen of rabbits that shares 20 pieces of straw. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed in total.

First, let's find out how many pieces of straw are left after accounting for the rabbits. That would be 160 - 20 = 140 pieces of straw for the rats and hamsters.

Since there are 10 hamsters, and each gets 5 pieces of straw, the total number of pieces of straw for the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, let's subtract the number of pieces of straw for the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw for the rats and hamsters. That gives us 140 - 50 = 90 pieces of straw for the rats.

We know that each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

Next, they went on 2 different rides, each costing $33. The total cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's calculate the total cost by adding the cost of tickets, food, and rides: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Tom starts with 50 trees and has a net gain of 8 trees per year, since he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees every year. To find the total number of trees after 10 years, we need to calculate the net gain over this period.

The net gain per year is 10 (trees planted) - 2 (trees chopped down) = 8 trees per year. Over 10 years, the net gain is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Adding this to the initial number of trees, we get 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we calculate 30% of 130, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

Finally, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees to find the number of trees Tom has left: 130 - 39 = 91.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the events to find the answer.

On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard. Then, on Saturday morning, they took back one third of the flamingos, which is 1/3 * 18 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's help Violetta with her crayon purchase.

Violetta needs 5 crayons, each costing $2. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of crayons by the cost per crayon: 5 * $2 = $10.

Since Violetta prepared $20 for this purchase, we subtract the total cost from the amount she prepared: $20 - $10 = $10.

Violetta will get $10 in change."
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the cost of a pen.

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens.
Cost of 8 pens = 8 * Cost of a pen
Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50
Cost of 8 pens = $12

"Hello, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We have 200 pounds of carrots to distribute to 40 restaurants, with each restaurant receiving 2 pounds of carrots. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed.

First, let's find the total amount of carrots that will be distributed. We can do this by multiplying the number of restaurants by the amount of carrots each restaurant will receive.

Total carrots distributed = Number of restaurants * Carrots per restaurant
Total carrots distributed = 40 * 2
Total carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Now, let's subtract the total carrots distributed from the total amount of carrots available to find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used.

Carrots not used = Total amount of carrots available - Total carrots distributed
Carrots not used = 200 - 80
Carrots not used = 120

We know the total population of Soda is 23786, with 8417 men and 9092 women. To find the number of kids, we'll subtract the total number of men and women from the total population.

First, let's add the number of men and women: 8417 + 9092 = 17509.

Now, let's subtract this from the total population: 23786 - 17509 = 6277.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Elaine's Pokémon card collection.

Elaine started with 20 Pokémon cards. In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month. So, that's 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards she collected in the first two months: 60 + 40 = 100 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. That's 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we add the cards she collected each month to her initial number of cards: 
20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320.

"Hello, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark edits an equal number of sentences for two publishers, and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. To find out how many sentences he edits for each publisher, we'll divide the total number of sentences by 2. 

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Now, let's calculate how much Mark earns from each publisher. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so he earns:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents from Publisher A

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence. Mark earns:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents from Publisher B

To find Mark's total weekly earnings, we'll add the amount he earns from each publisher:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down John's award and its impact on his annual earnings.

First, John receives a one-time monetary reward of $5000. This is a straightforward addition to his annual income.

Next, John gets a 5% raise in salary. Since he makes $2000 a week, the raise amounts to:

$2000 per week * 0.05 = $100 per week increase

With the raise, John's new weekly salary is:

$2000 per week + $100 per week = $2100 per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, John's total earnings after the raise would be:

$2100 per week * 52 weeks = $109,200 per year

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward to his annual earnings:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Now, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. To find the total barrels of wine, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the barrels per ton:
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Carl's cheese usage for the week.

Carl had a sandwich for lunch every day, and since there are 7 days in a week, that's 7 sandwiches. He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, so that's 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl had cheese and egg omelets for 3 days. He used one more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich, which means he used 3 slices of cheese per omelet. So, that's 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Lastly, Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese for dinner, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up all the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (dinner) = 31 slices.

Next, let's calculate the number of pens she bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag contains 9 pens. So, she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens. She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, which is 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

In total, Janet bought 54 + 12 = 66 pens.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into Brinley's math problem. Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, and Brinley wants to achieve an average of 93. She has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first five tests.

To find the required score, we need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score. Since there are 6 tests and she can remove the lowest score, she needs to have a total of 5 scores that average to 93. 

The total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 5 = 465.

Now, let's find the total score of Brinley's first 5 tests: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since the lowest score (71) will be removed, we subtract it from the total score of the first 5 tests:
438 - 71 = 367.

Now, we add the total score required (465) and subtract the total score of the remaining 4 tests (367) to find the required score on the 6th test:
465 - 367 = 98.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Micheal's bike riding adventure to find out how many kilometers he rode in total.

Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week, covering 25 kilometers each time, for 4 weeks. To calculate the total kilometers for this period, we multiply the number of times he rode (5 times/week * 4 weeks = 20 times) by the distance he covered each time (25 kilometers). This gives us 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

After that, Micheal changed his routine to riding 2 times a week, covering 60 kilometers each time, for 3 weeks. To calculate the total kilometers for this period, we multiply the number of times he rode (2 times/week * 3 weeks = 6 times) by the distance he covered each time (60 kilometers). This gives us 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Now, let's add the kilometers from both periods to find the total distance Micheal rode: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get to the problem at hand. We need to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, which contains 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. So, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Now, we're told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. This means that each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar, which is 40g / 2 = 20g.

The total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we simply add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since half a dozen is 6, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than $36000. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since 1 dozen is 12, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost by the number of cups: $34800 / 240 = $145.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Sara's situation to figure out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford that new jacket and shoes.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. Adding the cost of the jacket, we get $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved up before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she's done that 4 times. So, she's earned 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's add up the money Sara has so far: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, Sara still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4).

$40 / $4 = 10

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Jerry has a flock of chickens, with red chickens producing 3 eggs a day and white chickens producing 5 eggs a day. He collects 42 eggs every day. We also know that he has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's use variables to represent the number of red chickens (r) and the number of white chickens (w). Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, we can write an equation: w = r + 2.

Now, let's think about the total number of eggs collected per day. The red chickens produce 3 eggs each, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs each. We can set up an equation based on this information: 3r + 5w = 42.

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42. Expanding this equation, we get: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42.

Combining like terms, we get: 8r + 10 = 42. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 8r = 32. Dividing both sides by 8, we get: r = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park first.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now that we know the perimeter, we can find the time it takes Gary to walk around the park by dividing the perimeter by his walking speed, which is 3 miles/hour.

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

To find the total number of customers on the first two days, we add the customers from both days: 100 + 150 = 250.

Now, we're given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total customers from the first two days from the total: 500 - 250 = 250.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem. We have two pools, both leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. We're given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, and now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water, it had 2x gallons at that time.

In 4 minutes, both pools lost 16 gallons of water (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes). So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

We know that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

So, the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

24 - 16 = 8

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn this amount. We can do this by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage, which is $8.00.

Number of hours = Total cost / Hourly wage
Number of hours = $352.00 / $8.00

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. Let's calculate 3/4 of 84.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

Ashlyn harvested 63 more watermelons, leaving 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

The number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21.

"Hello, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark buys 12 cars for his company, and each car costs $20,000. So, the total cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

Next, Mark pays a 10% tax on the cars. To calculate the tax, we multiply the total cost of the cars by 0.1. So, the tax is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

In addition to the tax, Mark also pays a registration fee of $1000 for each car. Since he bought 12 cars, the total registration fee is 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

To find the total amount Mark pays, we add the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem. We know that Robert collected 20 shells on Monday, and Kylie collected 5 more than him. To find out how many shells Kylie collected on Monday, we add 5 to Robert's total.

20 (Robert's shells) + 5 = 25

So, Kylie collected 25 shells on Monday. Now, let's find out how many she collected on Tuesday. We're told that Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To calculate this, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2.

25 * 2 = 50

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden, and there were 50 ants. To find the number of bugs, we need to divide the number of ants by 2. 

So, the number of bugs is 50 / 2 = 25.

Now, we add the number of bugs to the number of ants to find the total number of insects:
25 (bugs) + 50 (ants) = 75

Total number of insects: 75"
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem. We have 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow, and we need to find out how many are left after some of them jump in the ocean and others go inside the cave.

First, let's calculate the number of penguins that jump in the ocean. Since one-third of them jump in, we can divide 36 by 3, which gives us 12 penguins.

Next, we have another one-third of the penguins going inside the cave. Again, we divide 36 by 3, and we get 12 penguins.

So, in total, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins have left their sunbathing spot.

To find the number of penguins still left sunbathing, we subtract the total that left from the original number: 36 - 24 = 12.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get started on solving the problem.

To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate his weekly consumption of cherry tomatoes. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, his weekly consumption is:

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, so his girlfriend eats half of what he eats. Their combined weekly consumption is:

42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, we know that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide their combined weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine:

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/week/vine = 21 vines

So, Steve needs 21 vines to meet their combined weekly consumption.

20 friends * 4 slices/friend = 80 slices

Now, we know that each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we'll divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza:
80 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem.

Ram buys 25 pens and uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low. He can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we'll consider the initial pens and the pens he makes from the empty ones.

Initially, Ram has 25 pens.

When the ink runs low in these 25 pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

Now, he has 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens.

We can see a pattern emerging. Each time the ink runs low, Ram can make new pens from the empty ones. Let's calculate the total number of pens he can make.

We can represent the number of pens Ram has after each refill as a geometric series:

25 + 25/5 + 25/5^2 + 25/5^3 + ...

This is an infinite geometric series with the first term a = 25 and the common ratio r = 1/5.

The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula:

S = a / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term, and r is the common ratio.

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 25 / (1 - 1/5)
S = 25 / (4/5)
S = 25 * 5/4
S = 125/4
S = 31.25

However, we can't have a fraction of a pen, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

But we can't stop here. We need to find the total number of pens Ram gets to have. We can do this by adding the initial 25 pens to the sum of the infinite series.

Total pens = 25 + 31.25 ( rounded down to 31)
Total pens = 25 + 31
Total pens = 56

However, this is still not correct. We need to add the initial 25 pens to the sum of the infinite series, but we also need to consider that the series is actually 25 + 5 + 1 + 0.2 + ... . The 0.2 is not a whole number, so we can't make a pen from it. We can only make pens from whole numbers.

Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he's now pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends him 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. That means he writes 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week. Since each letter is 5 pages long, he writes a total of 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.

Now, let's calculate the time he spends writing. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find the total time he spends writing a week, we multiply the number of pages he writes by the time it takes to write each page: 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes.

Finally, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

In addition to these daily calls, Jason had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes used are:

Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Then, Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

After that, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. This left Griffin with 9 - 2 = 7 fries.

Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, we can calculate the number of fries Ginger gave him by subtracting the fries he had from the total he ended up with: 27 - 7 = 20.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem. We have two aquariums with different numbers of snails - one has 4 snails and the other has 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can start by finding the difference in snails.

The difference in snails is 32 - 4 = 28. Now, we know this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Let's use 'x' to represent the number of fish in each aquarium. Since there are two aquariums with the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

We can set up the equation: 2 * 2x = 28, since the difference in snails is twice the total number of fish.

Combine like terms and solve for x:
4x = 28
x = 28 / 4
x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

First, we need to calculate the total hours of makeup work per week. Since the makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, the total hours per week would be 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Next, we multiply the total hours per week by the number of weeks the movie takes to finish, which is 5 weeks. So, the total hours for the movie would be 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost would be 120 * $250 = $30,000.

Finally, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done. To calculate the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1, which gives us $3,000. Subtracting the discount from the total cost, we get $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate how much each person paid for the party supplies.

First, we need to find the total cost of the party supplies. Isabelle spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on birthday presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags. 

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, we'll divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

"Hello. To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is 4 * 50 = 200 pounds.

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is 200 * $1.50 = $300.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many cookies Sue and her sister ate. On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's find the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's sister: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue's sister: 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
Sue: 46 * 200 = 9200 calories

Now, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:
9200 - 3600 = 5600

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 3 classes in the school, each with 20 students. So, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, we can divide the total number of students by 2 to find the number of boys and girls. This gives us 60 / 2 = 30 boys and 30 girls.

Now, let's look at the number of girls in each class. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls: 30 - 15 - 12 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls, we can find the number of boys in the third class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in the class: 20 - 3 = 17.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that last night Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, for a total of 10 + 15 = 25 animals.

Now, let's calculate the number of animals he killed today. We know that he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say he killed x cougars. Then, he killed 3x wolves. We also know that he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so x = 15 - 3 = 12.

So, today Rick killed 3x = 3 * 12 = 36 wolves and 12 cougars, for a total of 36 + 12 = 48 animals.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. Now, subtract 9 from 30 to find out how many times Anne went down the slide. That's 30 - 9 = 21.

Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4. That's 21 * 4 = 84.

First, we have 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows initially is 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Now, Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls. I know it says 10 stalls initially, but later it mentions 20 stalls, so I'll go with that. Each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

So, each stall now has 20 (initial cows) + 2 (new cows) = 22 cows.

To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We're given that each 10-foot section of a redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. The tree is 200 feet tall, and termites have eaten 30% of its wood. To find the weight of the tree, we first need to calculate its total weight before the termites had their snack.

Since the tree is 200 feet tall, we can divide its height by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections. Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

However, we need to account for the 30% of the tree that the termites ate. To do this, we'll calculate 30% of the total weight: 0.3 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds. Now, we subtract this from the total weight to find the weight after the termites ate 30% of the tree: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"

In addition to the cost of the overdue books, Nancy also has to pay a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. To find the total amount she has to pay, we add the cost of the overdue books to the flat fee:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Andrea has 52 apples, and she has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Now, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. This means Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's count the total number of fruits. Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, which is 52 + 24 = 76 fruits. Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, which is 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have: 76 + 92 = 168.

To figure out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to determine the total number of cookies she's making. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so we add those together.

36 + 30 = 66 cookies

Since a dozen is 12 cookies, we divide 66 by 12 to get the total number of dozens.
66 / 12 = 5.5 dozen cookies

To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total price first. The selling price of the house is $350,000. On top of that, there's a brokerage fee of 5% and a transfer fee of 12%.

Let's calculate the fees:
Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have a 76-star flag with three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

Three rows of 8 stars will have 3 * 8 = 24 stars, and two rows of 6 stars will have 2 * 6 = 12 stars. So, the total number of stars in these rows is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Now, let's subtract the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag. This will give us the number of stars in the 5-star rows: 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, we can divide the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows. 

40 stars / 5 stars per row = 8 rows

"Hello. To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

First, let's find the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight is:
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, we'll divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck, which is 2000 pounds:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3

So, the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip is:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. To solve this problem, we need to find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane.

First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance of 480 miles.

time = distance / speed
time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
time = 16 hours

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem. Ali has 22 medals for counting super fast, and his friend Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali. So, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have a total of 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

Now, it's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. To find the total number of medals given out for counting, we need to multiply the number of medals Ali and Izzy have by 10.

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 * 39 = 390.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. To find the total number of chocolate bars, we multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet: 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we know that 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each. So, the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get is 4 * 6 = 24.

To find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars will be shared equally among them. So, each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Susan's earnings from her online task.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a 30-minute break, so we subtract that from her total time: 
3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, let's convert 2.5 hours to minutes: 
2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 10: 
150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15

This means she completes 15 intervals of 10 minutes each. Now, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval: 
15 * $5 = $75

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have three friends, Mike, Jim, and Tony, who are playing a game. After 3 rounds, Mike has 21 points, Jim has 3 points less than Mike, and Tony has 2 times more than Mike.

First, let's calculate the points for each player:
Mike has 21 points.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, in the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Mike and Tony have over 20 points, so they each get 1 extra point. Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.

After the extra points have been distributed, the total points for each player are:
Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
Jim: 18 points (no change)
Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

The total points for all three players after the extra points have been distributed is: 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

Will buys 15 oranges and asks his 2 sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest is half as old as the oldest. To find out how many oranges the youngest son is, we need to divide the oldest son's age by 2. So, the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Now, let's add the ages of the two sons to find out how many oranges they washed in total. The total number of oranges washed is 8 (oldest son's age) + 4 (youngest son's age) = 12 oranges.

Since Will bought 15 oranges, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total to find out how many are left unwashed. So, 15 - 12 = 3 oranges are left unwashed.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Darren's exercise routine for the first two days.

On the first day, Darren did 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

On the second day, he increased his pushups by 20, so that's 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. He did 10 fewer squats, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats. For dumbbell presses, he doubled the number, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

Now, let's add up the total number of activities for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that each person in the household consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are two meals (lunch and dinner) per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To find the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Now, we can divide the total weight of the rice bag (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down John's driving expenses to find out how much he pays per year.

First, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year. John's work is 30 miles away, and he goes there and back each day, so that's 60 miles per day. He does this 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year. 

Total miles driven per year = 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles

Now, let's calculate the cost of these miles. John gets charged $2 per mile driven.

Total cost per year for miles driven = 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

In addition to the mileage cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is:

Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

To find the total cost per year for driving, we add the cost of miles driven and the total bonus.

Total cost per year for driving = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

When creating a simple folding newspaper or tabloid, the pages are arranged in a specific way. The paper is folded vertically, and the pages are printed on both the front and back. To figure out the number of pieces of paper used, we need to consider how the pages are paired.

Imagine the pages are arranged in the following way: page 1 is on the left back, page 2 is on the left front, page 32 is on the right back, and page 31 is on the right front. This arrangement implies that the pages are paired in a way that requires 8 pieces of paper for the front and 8 pieces of paper for the back. However, these are the same 8 pieces of paper, just viewed from different sides.

We also know that she sold 45 books this year and twice as many in the first year, which means she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

Now, let's find out how many books she sold in the second year. We know the total number of books sold is 200, and she sold 90 in the first year and 45 in the current year. So, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Since each book sells for 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300$.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, which means he works 50 hours per week. Since he earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 50 * $10 = $500 per week.

Assuming a 4-week month, Watson's total earnings from his hourly wage would be $500 * 4 = $2000.

As the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total bonus for the month is $300 * 4 = $1200.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. To find out how many loaves are sold in the morning, we need to calculate two-thirds of 60. 

Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total to find out how many are left: 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight he loses in a week, we can divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in a week, he loses 8 / 4 = 2 pounds.

Now, we're told that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks (8 pounds), we can divide the total weight by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks.

Since Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, to lose 8 pounds, it will take her 8 / 2 * 4 = 16 weeks.

Next, the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each will be 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. It costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. So, 5 * $100 = $500, and adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up all these expenses: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo has a budget of $6000 and wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, if we subtract his total expenses from his budget, we get $6000 - $1950 = $4050. Then, subtracting the amount he wants to save, we get $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

We have a football team with 105 members. The offense has twice as many players as the defense, and the special teams have half the number of players as the defense. We need to find out how many players are on the defense.

Let's use a variable to represent the number of players on the defense. I'll call it D. Since the offense has twice as many players, the number of players on the offense is 2D. The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105, so we can set up an equation:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, I'll multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Now, let's combine like terms:

To find out how many old records they brought in, we can use the trade-in ratio. Since 1 new record is traded for 2 old records, we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to get the total number of old records.

So, 7 new records would be traded for 7 * 2 = 14 old records.

The final answer is: 14"
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of junior programmers. Since they make up 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as 2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Now, to find the number of senior programmers, we subtract the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees: 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Next, we know that junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their salary is $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month: 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is: 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

Finally, to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the amounts paid to junior and senior programmers: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

$224,000"
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that at the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. This means the net change at the second stop is 8 - 7 = 1.

Before that, at the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, if we denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x, then the total number of people after the first stop is x + 5.

After the second stop, the total number of people is x + 5 + 1, which simplifies to x + 6.

We're told that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20. This gives us the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To find the value of x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Oscar's lollipop adventure step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school. That leaves him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes out 14 lollipops to his friends, so he's left with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave away 14, he buys 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, Oscar eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he's left with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is: 31"
"Hello. To find the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge needed and then multiply it by the time it takes to charge 1 percentage-point.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%). Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, it will take 40 * 3 minutes to charge the remaining 40%.

40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the customer's shopping trip to find out how much they paid.

The customer earned rewards from their last shopping trip, where they spent $80. Since they get $1 off for every $20 spent, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards of $1 each.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards, which gave them a $4 discount. They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, so the coupon discount is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount they received is $4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12.

To find out how much they paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount they spent: $43 - $12 = $31.

"Hello, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem to determine which job has a higher net pay rate.

First, let's calculate the net income for Job A. The gross income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. With a 20% total tax rate, the taxes would be $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. So, the net income for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Now, let's calculate the net income for Job B. The gross income is $42,000/year, but we need to subtract the $6,000 property tax first. That leaves us with $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. With a 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax, the taxes would be $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. So, the net income for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Since Job B has a higher net income, we need to find the difference between the two net incomes. The difference is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the two offers to find the cost difference.

First, we'll calculate the total cost of Furniture United's offer. The advance payment is $1,350, and the 6 monthly installments of $350 each add up to $2,100. So, the total cost is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Next, we'll calculate the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer. The advance payment is $1,100, and the 9 monthly installments of $250 each add up to $2,250. So, the total cost is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers. To do this, we'll subtract the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from the total cost of Furniture United's offer: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We have four friends - Nick, Richard, Jason (also referred to as RJ), and DJ - who have paintball guns. To find out how many guns each of them would have if they shared equally, we need to first find the total number of guns and then divide it by the number of people.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. Let's add these numbers together to find the total number of guns.

Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5
Total number of guns = 24

Now, we have 4 friends who want to share these guns equally. To find out how many guns each of them would have, we'll divide the total number of guns by the number of people.

Number of guns each would have = Total number of guns / Number of people
Number of guns each would have = 24 / 4
Number of guns each would have = 6

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each, so the initial total value is 8 * $8 = $64.

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4. Adding this to the initial price, we get $8 + $4 = $12 per share. Now, the total value is 8 * $12 = $96.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we calculate 25% of $12, which is 0.25 * $12 = $3. Subtracting this from the price after the first year, we get $12 - $3 = $9 per share. Now, the total value is 8 * $9 = $72.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have a class of 200 students divided into 3 groups. Two of the groups have an equal number of students, and the third group, which is the smallest, has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups.

Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. This means the smallest group has x - 10 students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide by 3:

x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and they're all either chickens or cows. He has twice as many chickens as cows. To start, let's say the number of cows is x. Since he has twice as many chickens, the number of chickens is 2x.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of animals:
x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:
3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 20

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2x = 2(20) = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs. 
Total legs = (number of cows * 4) + (number of chickens * 2)
Total legs = (20 * 4) + (40 * 2)
Total legs = 80 + 80
Total legs = 160

Now, we're told that 4 fourth-grade boys were absent on Friday. To find the number of boys present, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

Number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of boys absent
Number of boys present = 53 - 4
Number of boys present = 49

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know there are 6 girls in the park, and the number of boys is twice the number of girls. To find the number of boys, we multiply the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = 2 * 6 = 12

Now, we add the number of boys to the number of girls to find the total number of kids in the park.

Total number of kids = 6 + 12 = 18

"Hello, I'm Fatima. To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, let's calculate the total points she has already scored and subtract that from the total points required.

Jane scored 15 points on her first test and 18 points on her second test, so the total points she has scored so far is 15 + 18 = 33.

Since she needs a total of at least 42 points, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total points required: 42 - 33 = 9.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that 3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. Then, we have a number of people kicked out for shoplifting, which is four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, minus 5. So, that's 4 * 3 - 5 = 7 people.

Now, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. That's 3 * 7 = 21 people.

To find the total number of people kicked out for these reasons, we add them up: 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31 people.

We're told that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the given reasons from the total: 50 - 31 = 19.

"Hello. To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first determine how many points Erin has now. Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8, we can calculate Erin's current points as follows:

Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's points
Erin's current points = 3 * 8
Erin's current points = 24

Since Erin scored 14 points, we can subtract 14 from her current points to find out how many points she had before:

Erin's points before = Erin's current points - 14
Erin's points before = 24 - 14
Erin's points before = 10

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the costs for the senior gifts.

First, we have the picture frames. Each senior receives a frame that costs $20, and there are 44 seniors. So, the total cost of the frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to add the cost of etching the logo onto each frame. This is an additional 20% of the frame's cost. To find 20% of $880, we multiply by 0.2, which gives us $176. Now, we add this to the cost of the frames: $880 + $176 = $1056.

Two seniors will also receive pins that cost $5 each, so we add 2 * $5 = $10 to the total.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 seniors. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Finally, we add up the costs of the frames, etching, pins, and cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

So, let's break it down. The hand-painted wallpaper costs $400 at the market, and Ethan can save 20% by making it himself. To find the amount he saves, we need to calculate 20% of the market cost.

20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80. This is the amount Ethan saves by making the wallpaper himself.

Now, to find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we subtract the amount he saves from the market cost: $400 - $80 = $320.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. The next day, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of pairs sold each day to find the total number of pairs sold:
14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs

Since each pair contains 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100 shoes.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment. Since 40% of the total equipment was faulty, we can find this amount by multiplying the total cost by 0.4. 

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. 
40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000.

Mary has 30 sheep, and she gets milk from all of them, but the amount of milk varies. Half of the sheep give her 1 kg of milk each, and the other half give her 2 kg of milk each.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each half. Since there are 30 sheep in total, half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the milk from the first half. 15 sheep * 1 kg of milk each = 15 kg of milk.

Next, let's calculate the milk from the other half. 15 sheep * 2 kg of milk each = 30 kg of milk.

To find the total amount of milk, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"Hello, I'm Fatima. To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest and then divide the total amount by the number of months.

Now, let's add the interest to the principal to get the total amount.
Total amount = Principal + Interest
= $3,650 + $152.08

Millie buys supplies for $18, which allows her to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she can make a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup for $1, so her total revenue will be 36 * $1 = $36.

To find her profit, we subtract her total cost from her total revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Now, let's find out how many hours she spends running the stand. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour, so the total number of hours is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

We know that Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. To find the original amount of land he had, we can start by setting up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"

The total parts in the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11. Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can divide 165 by 11 to find the value of 1 part:
165 ÷ 11 = 15.

Now, we can multiply the value of 1 part by the number of parts each person has. Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

First, we need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. So, for a quadruple batch, Mark will need 3 * 4 = 12 cups of flour and 1 * 4 = 4 cups of milk.

Now, let's see how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy. Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so he'll need 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour. Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so he'll need 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

First, we need to calculate the original energy usage per day. Since Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day, the energy usage per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours. To convert this to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000 (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts), which gives us 7.2 kilowatt-hours.

Now, let's calculate the new energy usage per day. If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he'll be using it for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. The new energy usage per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours, or 2.7 kilowatt-hours.

To find the energy saved per day, we subtract the new energy usage from the original energy usage: 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours.

Finally, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30 to find the total energy saved in 30 days: 4.5 kilowatt-hours * 30 = 135 kilowatt-hours.

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, bringing the total number of cannolis to 40 + 60 = 100.

He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, which means he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Finally, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house. Adding the total number of corns and cannolis, we get 140 + 100 = 240.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Elliott's steps to figure out how many he took during his jog.

Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps with his friend. So, before the jog, he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that before the jog, he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps taken.

Now, we subtract the steps taken before the jog from the total steps taken before the jog and after the jog: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many words are in the book. The book is 45 pages long, and it averages 200 words per page. So, the total number of words in the book is:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Toby to read the book. Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find the time it takes him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time Toby needs is:
30 minutes (to read the book) + 10 minutes (to get to the airport) = 40 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport. To find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the total time he needs from the time he has:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600. The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy, and the deal was ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which is $3 * 0.5 = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each. The total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up all her expenses: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage: 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150: $960 + $150 = $1110.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem at hand. Marcy makes homemade candles that she markets as 99% guaranteed not to explode. However, 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. If she makes 50,000 candles, we need to find out how many of them will both smell like wet dog and explode.

First, we need to find the number of candles that will explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% will explode. To find this number, we multiply 50,000 by 0.01.

Number of candles that will explode = 50,000 * 0.01
= 500

Now, we know that 5% of the more dangerous candles (which are the ones that explode) will smell like wet dog. To find this number, we multiply the number of candles that will explode by 0.05.

Number of candles that will smell like wet dog and explode = 500 * 0.05

$20 * 0.3 = $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price of each blouse.

First, we know Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half that amount, which is 15 apples, from the shortest trees. We'll denote the number of apples she gathered from the average trees as x.

Now, let's look at her sister's gathering. Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples, and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples. She didn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Joanne's apples + Sister's apples = 500
(30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500

Combine like terms:

(45 + x) + 105 = 500

"As-salamu alaykum, I'd be happy to help you with that problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We have a herd consisting of camels and dromedaries. We know that camels have two humps each, while dromedaries have one hump each. We're given two pieces of information: there are 180 heads in total, and 304 humps in total.

Let's use variables to represent the number of camels (c) and the number of dromedaries (d). Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is the sum of the number of camels and dromedaries:
c + d = 180

Now, let's consider the humps. Since camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each, the total number of humps is:
2c + d = 304

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now, we can substitute c = 124 into the first equation to find d:
124 + d = 180
d = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Tom's trip to find the total distance he traveled.

Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for the first 4 days, so that's 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km. 

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first four days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.3, which gives us 240 km.

On the 7th day, Tom didn't travel at all, so that's 0 km.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he traveled 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

Now, let's add up the distances: 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now, we're told that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. This means Timothy's locker is twice as big as Zack's locker. To find Timothy's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats run after a mouse. To find out how many cats that is, we multiply 30 by 3/5: (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

Next, the normal rate kicks in for 8 months at $12 per month, which is 8 * $12 = $96.

Now, let's calculate the remaining time at the increased rate. Since 2 years is 24 months, we subtract the introductory and normal rate periods: 24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months. At $14 per month, that's 10 * $14 = $140.

First, we know the tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we add the savings to the sale price: $22 + $2 = $24.

To find the original price of the tattered jeans, we add the savings to the sale price: $28 + $4 = $32.

Now, we need to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. However, since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, we'll find the difference and take the negative of that.

The original price difference between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8. Since the jogger jeans cost less, we take the negative of this difference.

The answer is: $-8"

The store-bought feeders, on the other hand, attract 20 birds each. With 3 store-bought feeders, that's 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine how much money he made from selling his cards. Since he spent $100 on the ticket and had $50 left, he must have made $150.

Now, let's calculate the number of cards he sold. We can divide the total amount of money he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5):

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

However, this is the number of cards he sold, not the number he started with. Since he kept 1/3 of his cards, the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with ""x"". Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3x.

We know that 2/3x = 100, so we can solve for x:

2/3x = 100
x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26. 

Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we need to know the length and width of the room in feet. We are given the length in yards, so we need to convert it to feet first. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, the length in feet is:

Length (in feet) = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

We are also given the area of the room, which is 360 square feet. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width:

Width = Area / Length
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

After baking, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equal to 3 intervals of 10 minutes, the total decrease in temperature is 2 * 3 = 6 degrees. Subtracting this from the temperature after baking, we get 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate Jon's total time for the triathlon. 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Now, let's calculate James' time for the swim and bike ride. 
- James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. 
- 10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
- James' swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes
- James took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. 
- James' bike ride time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' time for the run:
- James' total time: 180 minutes
- James' swim and bike time: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes
- James' run time: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Movie C is 1.25 hours long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour.

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we're told Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B.

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

Finally, we know Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

Movie A = Movie B / 4
Movie A = 80 minutes / 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how far Michael's horse runs. We know the horse runs for 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour. To calculate the distance, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance: 
Distance = speed * time = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay.

The cost of the hay is 8 bails * $3 per bail = $24.

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30.

The change he has after buying the hay is $30 - $24 = $6.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get cracking on Rozanne's eggnog problem.

Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs, which is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. She also has 2 loose eggs, so in total, she has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, and each tray holds 5 glasses. So, each tray needs 5 * 5 = 25 eggs.

Now, let's see how many trays Rozanne can put out. We'll divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per tray: 50 eggs / 25 eggs per tray = 2 trays.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the Scrabble scores to find out by how many points Joey is winning.

First, we need to calculate Joey's new score after his turn. He had 214 points and scored 26 points, so his new score is 214 + 26 = 240.

Next, we calculate Marcy's new score. She had 225 points and scored 10 points, so her new score is 225 + 10 = 235.

Now, let's find the difference between their scores to determine by how many points Joey is winning: 240 - 235 = 5.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the salesman spent on the sneakers. He bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from Monday's sale is 17 * $20 = $340.

Now, let's find out how many sneakers were left after the flash sale. The salesman had 48 sneakers initially and sold 17, so he had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.

These 31 sneakers were sold to a department store for $25 each throughout the rest of the week. The revenue from the rest of the week is 31 * $25 = $775.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from Monday's sale and the revenue from the rest of the week, which is $340 + $775 = $1115.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue. The profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

Beatrice bought ten packets of crayons, but they're not all the same. Six packets have 8 colors each, and the other four packets have 16 colors each. To find the total number of colors, we need to calculate the total number of colors in each type of packet and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of colors in the packets with 8 colors each. Since there are 6 packets, we multiply 6 by 8: 6 * 8 = 48.

Next, let's calculate the total number of colors in the packets with 16 colors each. There are 4 packets, so we multiply 4 by 16: 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the super ticket costs $20 and includes a movie ticket, popcorn, and a soda for an additional $1. So, the total cost of the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

On the other hand, we have the regular ticket option, which costs $12, and we need to buy popcorn and a soda separately. The soda costs $3.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket option is $21 - $2 = $19.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the regular ticket and soda: $12 + $3 = $15.

To find the regular price of popcorn, we subtract the cost of the ticket and soda from the total cost of the regular ticket option: $19 - $15 = $4.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We'll multiply the number of balloons by the new cost per balloon: 170 × $65 = $11,050.

"Hello. To find the car's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at each speed. The car drives 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance traveled at this speed is 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then, it drives 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance traveled at this speed is 30 * 1 = 30 miles.

The total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances: 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with that problem.

To find the total cost of the potting soil, we need to calculate the total volume of the raised beds and then divide it by the volume of each bag of soil.

First, let's calculate the volume of each raised bed. The dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall, so the volume is 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since there are 10 raised beds, the total volume is 32 cubic feet * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Now, let's divide the total volume by the volume of each bag of soil, which is 2 cubic feet. This gives us 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet = 160 bags.

Finally, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag, which is $12. So, the total cost is 160 bags * $12 = $1920.

60% of 15 is 0.6 * 15 = 9. So, the number of green cards is 15 + 9 = 24.

Now, the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards, which is 15 + 24 = 39.

To find the total number of cards, we'll add the number of red, green, and yellow cards: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the percentage of puppies with spots.

First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 35%

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed.

First, we need to find the total weight of the feed. The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so that's 2 * 1 = 2 pounds. He also buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, which is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds. For hay, he buys 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds, so that's 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds. Lastly, he buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, which is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we'll divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity: 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Since 2 trips will not be enough to carry the remaining 0 pounds of feed, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the division results in a whole number, so no rounding is needed.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Grayson's recycling earnings.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, in a week, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents from aluminum cans. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans.

She also drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, in a week, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents from plastic bottles. In a 4-week month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

To find the total amount she earns in a month, we add her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 cards

She also has five boxes of baseball cards, with 40 cards in each box. To find the total number of baseball cards, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of cards per box:
5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 cards

Now, let's add the total number of basketball and baseball cards to find the overall number of cards:

Miss Maria decides to keep 50 cards for herself and gives the remaining cards to her students. To find the number of cards she gives away, we subtract the number of cards she keeps from the total:
350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player, and Luri has 3 times as many songs. To find out how many songs Luri has, we multiply Gabriel's songs by 3. So, Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Now, let's see how many songs each of them can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs. Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs.

The question asks how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his. To find this out, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

Stetson made a bet with Alec that he would give up $10 for each orange he eats. They picked 60 oranges, and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. To find out how many oranges Stetson ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 of 60 is (2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 oranges.

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, the total amount he gave up is 24 * $10 = $240.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Jillian's shoes cost $80, and her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes. To find the cost of her handbag, we need to calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes and then subtract $20.

So, 3 times the cost of her shoes is 3 * $80 = $240. Now, let's subtract $20 from this amount: $240 - $20 = $220.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down James' running schedule to find out how many hours he runs a week.

First, we need to calculate the total miles James runs in a week. He runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs a week is:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Now, we know James runs 10 miles an hour. To find the total hours he runs a week, we'll divide the total miles by his hourly running speed:
60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much oats each horse consumes in a day. Since each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal and they're fed twice a day, that's 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per horse per day.

Now, Uncle Ben has 4 horses, so the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find out how much oats they'll consume in 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Finally, since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats needed by the weight of one bag: 200 / 50 = 4 bags.

Jana has 27 adorable puppies, and we're told that two thirds of them are Pomeranians. To find out how many Pomeranians Jana has, we need to calculate two thirds of 27. 

Two thirds of 27 is (2/3) * 27 = 18. So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Now, we're asked to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. 

One third of 18 is (1/3) * 18 = 6.

"Hello. To find the average highest temperature of Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia, we need to add their highest temperatures and divide by 3.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit, in Northlandia it's 21 degrees Fahrenheit, and in Midlandia it's -3 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Let's add these temperatures: -48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

Now, we'll divide the sum by 3 to find the average: -30 / 3 = -10

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The child wants to buy a toy car that costs $12, and he already has $4 in savings. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount he already has from the cost of the toy car.

Remaining amount = Cost of toy car - Amount already saved
= $12 - $4
= $8

Now, we know the child saves $2 every day from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take him to save the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his daily savings.

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
= $8 / $2
= 4 days

Jaime has 2 trays, and each tray can hold 24 eggs. To find out the total number of eggs the trays can hold, we multiply the number of trays by the number of eggs each tray can hold:
2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Now, Jaime has 64 eggs, and we want to know how many eggs won't fit on the trays. To do this, we subtract the total number of eggs the trays can hold from the total number of eggs Jaime has:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free offer, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be:

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have a total of 8 razors. 

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor:

$2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

$0.25 * 100 = 25 cents

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the height of the human pyramid.

We have 9 cheerleaders who are 64"" tall and 1 cheerleader who is 60"" tall. The pyramid structure consists of 4 girls at the bottom, 3 on top of them, 2 on top of the 3, and the shortest girl at the very top.

The bottom level has 4 girls, each 64"" tall, so their total height is 4 * 64"" = 256"". 
The middle level has 3 girls, each 64"" tall, so their total height is 3 * 64"" = 192"". 
The top level has 2 girls, each 64"" tall, so their total height is 2 * 64"" = 128"". 
The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, add the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636"".

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know Brett is 14 years old, and in four years, his sister Angela will be three times as old as he is now. To find Angela's current age, we need to determine her age in four years.

Since Angela's age in four years will be three times Brett's current age, we can calculate it by multiplying Brett's age by 3. So, Angela's age in four years will be 3 * 14 = 42 years.

Now, to find Angela's current age, we subtract 4 from 42, since this is her age in four years.

Angela's current age = 42 - 4 = 38 years.

For the morning rides: 14 days * 1 ride/day * $6/ride = $84

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get started on solving this problem.

First, we need to find out how many oranges Ashley brought. Since she brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges in each box: 5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges.

Now, let's calculate how many oranges Brianne brought. We know she brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so we add 20 to Ashley's total: 50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges.

To find the total number of oranges they have, we add Ashley's and Brianne's oranges together: 50 oranges + 70 oranges = 120 oranges.

Finally, we need to determine how many Greek orange pies they can make. Since one pie needs three oranges, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie: 120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie = 40 pies.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have two venues to consider for the surprise party. The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of the number of guests, but doesn't include food, which costs $5 per person. The second venue charges $25 per person, and the price includes food.

To find the number of guests where the costs of both venues are equal, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

The cost of the first venue is the flat fee plus the cost of food for 'x' guests, which is 200 + 5x. The cost of the second venue is 25x, since the price includes food.

Now, we set the two costs equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

To solve for 'x', we'll subtract 5x from both sides of the equation:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x

Now, divide both sides by 20:

x = 200 / 20
x = 10

So, the two venues will be equal in cost when there are 10 guests.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects. And since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

We can set up an equation using the information that together they collected 43 insects:
B + B/2 + (B/2 + 7) = 43

Combine like terms:
2B/2 + B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43
3B/2 + 7 = 43

B = 24

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

Mariah and her grandma used some yarn for knitting. To find out how many yards of yarn they used altogether, we need to calculate the yards used by each of them and then add those amounts together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, she used 1/4 * 364 yards = 91 yards.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn, which is 1/2 * 364 yards = 182 yards.

But Cherrie didn't stop there. She also bought 10 more random gifts to surprise her friends.

To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we add the gifts for her friends to the random gifts: 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. So, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Next, we're told the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. To find the length of the couch, we add 2 feet to this: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Suzie bought four packs of gum and paid $7 in total. We know she bought two packs of strawberry gum, one pack of grape gum for $2, and one pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3. To find the total cost of the strawberry gum, we subtract this amount from the total amount Suzie paid: $7 - $3 = $4.

Since Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost by 2 to find the cost of each pack: $4 / 2 = $2.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into Frederick's popsicle stick problem.

Frederick wants to make the most popsicle sticks possible with his $24 budget. He has two options: 2 x 4 wood that costs $4 and gives 200 sticks, or 2 x 8 wood that costs $6 and gives 400 sticks.

To find the best option, I'll calculate the number of sticks per dollar for each type of wood. For 2 x 4 wood, that's 200 sticks / $4 = 50 sticks per dollar. For 2 x 8 wood, it's 400 sticks / $6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar.

Since 2 x 8 wood gives more sticks per dollar, that's the way to go. Now, let's see how many 2 x 8 woods Frederick can buy with his $24 budget: $24 / $6 = 4.

With 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, Frederick can make a total of 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get down to business and figure out how much Mario needs to spend on snowshoes for his sled dogs.

First, we need to determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has four legs and snowshoes are sold in pairs, each dog needs two pairs of snowshoes. With six sled dogs, the total number of pairs needed is 6 dogs * 2 pairs/dog = 12 pairs.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost will be 12 pairs * $12/pair = $144.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Janet's bus trip costs. She takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. That's a total of 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so her weekly bus trip expenses would be 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00.

Now, if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she can save some money. To find out how much, we subtract the cost of the pass from her weekly bus trip expenses: $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the information we have about the farm and the zoo.

We know the farm has 30 cows, and the zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

On the other hand, the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, which means the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's count the total number of animals at both places. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, making it a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, making it a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

To find the combined total, we add the number of animals at the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. We also know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we can divide the number of onions Rose bought by 4. So, 12 onions / 4 = 3 onions.

Similarly, to find out how many potatoes Sophia bought, we can divide the number of potatoes Rose bought by 4. So, 4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato.

In total, Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items.

To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs, we first need to determine the total number of days he has to reach his goal. From December 31st to July 19th, there are 201 days.

Since Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calories he needs to burn is 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

Now, we divide the total calories by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit: 105,000 / 201 ≈ 522 calories.

First, Julie spent 20% of her $500 on clothes. To calculate this, I'll multiply $500 by 0.20, which gives me $100. So, she spent $100 on clothes.

Now, let's subtract this amount from her initial $500: $500 - $100 = $400. This is the amount she has left after buying clothes.

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To calculate this, I'll multiply $400 by 0.25, which gives me $100. So, she spent another $100 on CDs.

Finally, let's subtract this amount from the $400 she had left: $400 - $100 = $300.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know that the house costs three times as much as the lot. To make things easier, let's say the cost of the lot is 'x'. Then, the cost of the house would be 3x.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:
x + 3x = 120,000

Combine the 'x' terms:
4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4 to find the value of 'x':
x = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we multiply 'x' by 3 to find the cost of the house:
3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"

Josh's cookies = 1/4 * 36
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we're told that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, let's calculate Kelsie's cookies:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. He also has six $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Next, Ali gives half of the total money to his sister. Half of $160 is $160 / 2 = $80. So, Ali is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Then, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is 3/5 * $80 = $48.

Finally, we subtract the amount Ali spent on dinner from the amount he had after giving money to his sister. The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy's rate is 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Since she's dividing the raisins equally among the three, she'll use 1/3 of the raisins for the cookies. So, 1/3 of 27 cups is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Now, we know that a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make with 9 cups of raisins, we can divide 9 by 3/4.

First, we need to calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device. Her current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour, and the new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption after adding the new device will be:

12 kWh/hour + 2 kWh/hour = 14 kWh/hour

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh):

Daily consumption before: 12 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 288 kWh
Daily consumption after: 14 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 336 kWh

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption:

Weekly consumption before: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
Weekly consumption after: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour, so we multiply the weekly consumption by the cost:

Weekly cost before: 2016 kWh * $1.50 = $3024
Weekly cost after: 2352 kWh * $1.50 = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. To find out how long it would take for one person to paint a whole house, we simply multiply the number of days by 2, since painting a whole house is twice as much work as painting half a house. So, one person can paint a whole house in 5 * 2 = 10 days.

Next, we need to convert the number of days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so one person can paint a whole house in 10 * 24 = 240 hours.

Now, if we have 5 people working together, the time it takes to paint a whole house will be divided by 5. Therefore, 5 people can paint a whole house in 240 / 5 = 48 hours.

Now, Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. To find the number of chairs Jenna has, we multiply Ophelia's chairs by 3: 22 * 3 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we subtract 2 from the number of chairs to find the number of sofas: 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

Since the total cost of all items is $2,400, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer to find the cost of 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since April has 30 days, we can divide the month into two halves of 15 days each. Let's say Elvis saves 'x' dollars per day in the first half. Then, he'll save 2x dollars per day in the second half.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half. We can set up an equation to represent this:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the change Verna received after buying fruits.

First, I'll find the total cost of the fruits. Verna bought three apples at $1.50 each, so that's 3 * $1.50 = $4.50. She also bought five oranges at $0.80 each, which is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00. Lastly, she purchased six peaches at $0.75 each, so that's 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20, so to find the change, I'll subtract the total cost from the amount she gave: $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, and Jenny earns $0.5 for each task. They both completed 20 tasks. To find out how much each of them will get, we need to multiply the amount they earn per task by the number of tasks.

For Jairus: 20 tasks * $0.8/task = $16
For Jenny: 20 tasks * $0.5/task = $10

Now, let's find the difference between the amount Jairus gets and the amount Jenny gets:
$16 - $10 = $6

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Jeff and Brad are dividing 100 dollars between them, and Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. To find out how much Jeff gets, we can start by letting Brad's share be x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's share will be 4x dollars.

The total amount they are dividing is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

So Brad gets 20 dollars, and Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars.

"Hello. To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the miles walked per day and then multiply it by the number of days worked.

Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home, so the total miles walked per day is 3 + 3 = 6 miles. Since he works 5 times a week, we multiply the miles walked per day by the number of days worked.

6 miles/day * 5 days = 30 miles

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Elise's alphabet-writing adventure.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, writing it twice gives us 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so that's 13 more letters.

Now, Elise re-writes everything she's already written. This means she re-writes the initial 52 letters and the additional 13 letters, for a total of 52 + 13 = 65 letters re-written.

To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters from each step: 52 (initial) + 13 (half) + 65 (re-written) = 130 letters.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. Then, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families in the second round, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families being notified.

In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so 9 * 3 = 27 new families are notified.

Now, in the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families. To find the number of new families notified in this round, we multiply 27 by 3.

27 * 3 = 81

"Hello, I'm Fatima. Let's solve the problem together.

Mark was unwell for 3 months and lost 10 pounds each month. We know his final weight was 70 pounds, and we need to find his initial weight.

To do this, we'll calculate the total weight Mark lost during those 3 months. Since he lost 10 pounds per month, the total weight lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, let's add the total weight lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem.

We know that James's play set has 80 toys, and Jonathan wants a sorted play set that's five times larger than James's. To find the total number of toys Jonathan needs, we multiply James's toys by 5:

5 * 80 = 400 toys

Now, we're told that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this total. Let's use a variable, x, to represent the number of toys Jonathan currently has. We can set up an equation:

x + 2 = 400

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

Daniel wants to buy five notebooks at $1.50 each, so the cost of the notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50. He also wants to buy two pens at $0.25 each, so the cost of the pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. Additionally, he wants to buy one calculator at $12 and one geometry set at $10.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1: $30 * 0.1 = $3.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the amount Daniel has to spend: $30 - $3 = $27.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem.

We know that Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold. When the water is warm, he takes 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. To find the time it takes him to swim a mile in warm water, we need to calculate twice the time it takes in cold water and add 2 minutes.

Twice the time it takes in cold water is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes. Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim in hot water, we'll assume it's the same as the time for warm water, which is 34 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes

Now, we need to find the number of buttons with 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 have 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is:
21 - 7 = 14 buttons

Now, let's find the number of holes in these buttons:
14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes

Now, Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, which is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

To find the average weight, we need to add their weights and divide by 3. The total weight is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the total number of candles needed, we add the ages of the two sons: 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. We can do this by dividing the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

So James needs 4 packs of candles. The total cost will be the number of packs multiplied by the cost per pack: 4 * $3 = $12.

First, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off. We know that when Maggie sets it to 450, the actual temperature is 468. To find the percentage, we'll calculate the difference between the actual and set temperatures, then divide by the set temperature.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18. Now, let's calculate the percentage: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%. So, the oven is off by 4%.

Now that we know the percentage, we can find the correct temperature setting for Maggie's recipe, which calls for 520 degrees. Let's call the correct setting x. Since the oven is off by 4%, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

We know the actual temperature should be 520, so we can set up the equation: x + 0.04x = 520. Combining like terms, we get 1.04x = 520. Dividing both sides by 1.04, we find that x = 500.

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of utensils:

Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36
Her friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84
Total utensils: 36 + 84 = 120

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of one box of contacts after the discount. The original price is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To calculate the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price: $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts, we multiply the discounted price by 2: $90.00 * 2 = $180.00.

Now, let's find the total number of contacts in 2 boxes. One box contains 90 contacts, so 2 boxes will contain 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of contacts. However, since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), we'll divide the total cost by the total number of contacts and then multiply by 2. But first, let's find the cost per contact: $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

Now, we multiply the cost per contact by 2 to get the cost per pair: $1.00 * 2 = $2.00

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total hours worked by Jill. She worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours are 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate John's total hours. He worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which means he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. On Sunday, he worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Since they are paid $10 an hour, we can calculate their earnings. Jill earned 3 * $10 = $30, and John earned 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"Hello, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink.

First, we need to find out how many calories Hannah burns in total. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, so she burns 2 * 500 = 1000 calories doing aerobics. She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour, so she burns 1 * 600 = 600 calories running.

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200. 1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the result by 100 to find out how many ml of water she needs to drink. 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem at hand. We have a jar containing red, blue, and green jelly beans at the Burger Palace restaurant. The note on the jar states that it contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. We're also given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500.

To solve this, let's assume the number of blue jelly beans is B. Then, the number of red jelly beans would be 0.99B (1% fewer than blue) and the number of green jelly beans would be 1.01B (1% more than blue).

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of jelly beans:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide by 3:

B = 1500

Now, we can find the number of red jelly beans and the number of green jelly beans:

Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:

1515 - 1485 = 30

To find the average of Jared's typing speed measurements, we need to calculate the total of the three measurements and then divide by 3.

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons, his speed increases to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his speed by 5 words, his new speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, let's add the three measurements: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

Finally, we divide the sum by 3 to find the average: 156 / 3 = 52.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem. We need to find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast.

If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

On the other hand, if Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

To find the difference in weight between the two options, we subtract the weight lost from the weight gained: 8.75 - (-6.25) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends to invite them, and 8 of them are bringing their spouses. This adds 10 (friends) + 8 (spouses) = 18 people to the guest list.

Now, the Mastiff at the end of the line weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. To find the Mastiff's weight, we multiply the Papillon's weight by 44: 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

On eBay, the boots are $13, but shipping costs twice as much as it does on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground, and the beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall. Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, we can track its growth as follows:

Day 1: 4 feet (initial height)
Day 2: 8 feet (doubled from 4 feet)
Day 3: 16 feet (doubled from 8 feet)
Day 4: 32 feet (doubled from 16 feet)

We want to find out when the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window. On Day 3, the beanstalk is still shorter than the window, but on Day 4, it's already 32 feet tall, which is taller than the window.

So, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein content per gram of mushrooms. 

Protein content per gram of mushrooms: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms

Now, let's multiply this by the amount John eats per day, which is 200 grams.

Protein content per day: 0.03 grams/gram * 200 grams = 6 grams of protein per day

Since we want to know how many grams of protein John gets per week, we'll multiply the daily protein content by 7 days.

Protein content per week: 6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. To find his current age, we can use a variable, let's call it 'x'. This means 5 years ago, Jerry was x - 5 years old. Since he's twice as old now, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:
x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 'x' from both sides:
0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides:
10 = x

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. Now, to find his age in 3 years, we simply add 3 to his current age:
10 + 3 = 13

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down George's dental work costs. He needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000, so that's 2 * $2000 = $4000. He also wants a porcelain crown for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours he needs to work to cover this amount, we'll divide the remaining cost by his hourly wage of $15. That's $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We're given that the three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. One angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle. To find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we can start by letting the smallest angle be x.

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it's 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x. Now, we can write an equation based on the fact that the sum of the three angles is 180 degrees:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Now, let's add all the amounts together: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

In the second year, Steve buys 2 games per month, which is 24 games. He gets 5 more games for Christmas, adding up to 24 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 29 games for the second year. Now, his total collection is 22 (previous year) + 29 (second year) = 51 games.

In the third year, Steve buys 4 games per month, which is 48 games. He gets 5 more games for Christmas, making it 48 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 53 games for the third year. Adding this to his previous collection, Steve now has 51 (previous years) + 53 (third year) = 104 games.

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate. We can do this by dividing the distance by the rate:

Now, let's calculate Marissa's hourly production. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. However, we need to compare it to Ruiz's hourly production, so we calculate 3/4 of Ruiz's hourly production.
Marissa makes 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Now that we know their hourly production, we can calculate the amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours.
Ruiz makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates in 12 hours.
Marissa makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates in 12 hours.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260.

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, in 2 hours, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups. The total earnings from the next 2 hours = 20 * $0.60 = $12.

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, let's calculate the total number of rotations per month. We know Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so we multiply the rotations per mile by the miles driven per month.

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the rotations per month by 12 to get the rotations per year.

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we know each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we divide the total number of rotations by the rotations per year.

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings. This means that the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

Now, let's calculate the cost of each pump. The cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is 2400 cents. 

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = 2400 cents / 240 pumps

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost: $60 - $18 = $42.

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial monthly funding, which is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

"Hello, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem to find the total cost of John's physical therapy.

John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, with two sessions per week, and each session lasted 2 hours. To find the total number of hours, we'll first calculate the hours per week: 2 sessions/week * 2 hours/session = 4 hours/week. Then, we multiply this by the number of weeks: 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours.

Now, we know the cost per hour is $125. To find the total cost, we multiply the total hours by the cost per hour: 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Jim's gum-chewing day.

Jim has a 20-pack of gum and chews 1 piece for every 2 hours he's at school. Since his school day is 8 hours long, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

On top of that, he chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, adding up to 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum chewed throughout the day.

Starting with 20 pieces, Jim now has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, he decides to share his gum with his sister, giving her half of what's left. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister and keeps the remaining 7 for himself.

Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

First, we need to find out Charmaine's current age. We know she'll be 16 in 12 years, so we subtract 12 from 16.
16 - 12 = 4

This means Charmaine is currently 4 years old. Now, let's add 4 years to her current age to find out how old she'll be 4 years from now.
4 + 4 = 8

Next, we'll calculate how much the basketball coach spent. The coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is:
8 * $14 = $112

Now, let's find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach. To do this, we'll subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden.

First, we need to find the total number of flowers in the garden. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row.
10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Now, we know that only 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed. To find the number of bloomed flowers, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.
200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers

To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to do a couple of conversions. First, let's convert her speed from kb to Mb. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we can divide 20 kb by 1000 to get 0.02 Mb per second.

Next, we need to convert seconds to hours. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

Now, let's multiply Ashley's speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour: 0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds = 72 Mb per hour.

10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

For the remaining four days of the week, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is:
10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, let's add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days to find the total number of cars towed that week:

Now, let's see how many inches Adam still needs to grow. We'll subtract his current height from the required height: 
48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the remaining inches by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to be tall enough:
8 / 2 = 4 years.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down James' earnings from selling those used cars.

First, we need to find the cost price of each car. The company paid 30% of the selling price, which is $25,000. So, the cost price is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500.

Now, let's calculate the profit on each car. The profit is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 10% of $175,000, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem. We're given that when a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. Out of these riders, 60% are women. We need to find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, given that there are 100 riders.

First, let's calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25:
100 * 0.25 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we multiply 25 by 0.6:
25 * 0.6 = 15

Since we're looking for the number of men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
25 - 15 = 10

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get down to business and calculate the total price of those lovely jewels.

First, we know the price of the diamond jewel is $2000. The gold jewel is 4/5 times as expensive as the diamond jewel, so we can calculate its price as follows:
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000 = $1600

Now, the silver jewel is $400 cheaper than the gold jewel, so its price is:
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

To find the total price of all three jewels, we simply add their individual prices:
Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom and is driving at a speed of 55 miles per hour. Tom, on the other hand, is driving at a speed of 70 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to cover the 75-mile gap between them.

First, we need to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed:

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

To find out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend before the cost exceeds $10 per class. We can do this by dividing the total cost by the maximum cost per class:
$60 ÷ $10 = 6 classes

This means Manny can attend a maximum of 6 classes before the cost exceeds $10 per class. Since there are 10 total classes, Manny can miss:
10 (total classes) - 6 (maximum classes he can attend) = 4 classes

Similarly, three oranges cost $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10. For five oranges, the cost would be 5 × $1.10 = $5.50.

Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. To find the total time, we multiply the volume by the time per cubic foot:

To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade costs $7,500. The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs: 
$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $43,500

First, we need to calculate his 5% raise. To do this, we'll find 5% of his current $20,000 monthly salary and add it to his current salary.

5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

The bonus is worth half a month's salary, so:

Next, he buys 10 dress pants, which cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit. Since a suit costs $750, the dress pants cost $750 / 5 = $150 each. So, the total cost of the dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1,500.

James also buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he has 10 suits. That's a total of 3 * 10 = 30 dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the dress shirts is 30 * $60 = $1,800.

To find the sales from green hats, we can set up a simple equation. If the sales from red hats are half the sales from green hats, then the sales from green hats must be twice the sales from red hats. So, the sales from green hats would be 2 * 400 = 800.

Let's use variables to represent the number of sheep (S) and the number of geese (G). Since each animal has one head, we can write an equation based on the total number of heads:
S + G = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. We can write another equation based on this information:
4S + 2G = 70

To solve for S, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G the same:
2S + 2G = 40

Now, let's subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate G:
(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for S:
S = 15

The number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15."
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. Since it costs 20% more than the normal brand, we'll calculate 20% of the normal price. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, so 20% of that is 0.2 * $5 = $1. Adding this to the normal price, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the coffee. Roger buys a week's worth, which is 7 days, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. So, he buys 7 pounds of coffee. The cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Finally, we add the cost of the donut, which is $2. The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Gus's grocery shopping trip to find out how much the apple pie cost.

Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the store. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, which comes out to 2 x $2.00 = $4.00. He also picked up a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00. 

To find the total cost of these items, I'll add them up: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, let's subtract the total cost of these items from the total amount Gus spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get cooking with John's class schedule.

To figure out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in class. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week. Since the class runs for 6 weeks, the total hours would be 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

Now, we know John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours. To find out how many recipes he learns, we'll divide the total hours by 1.5. That gives us 48 / 1.5 = 32 recipes.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so we can calculate Kassidy's amount by multiplying Aurelia's amount by 3/4. 

Kassidy's amount = 3/4 * $120 = $90.

Now, we know Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount by adding $60 to Kassidy's amount.

Rayna's amount = $90 + $60 = $150.

Now that we have the amounts for each person, let's add their money together: $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total by 3: $360 / 3 = $120.

Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds, and Aaron had 4 pounds. 

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Now, we'll divide the total amount of candy by 3, since they're sharing it equally among themselves.

Candy per person = Total candy / 3
Candy per person = 12 / 3

Now, let's add the cost of both types of candies: $3.5 + $7.5 = $11.

Adam paid the cashier $15, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid: $15 - $11 = $4.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days. Her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. This means that the remaining 6 days (30 - 8 - 8 - 8 = 6) can be a mix of good, bad, and neutral days.

Since Christina had 12 good days in total, and 8 of them were in the first 8 days, that leaves 12 - 8 = 4 good days in the remaining 22 days (30 - 8 = 22). 

Now, we are told that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. This means that 2 of the remaining good days are in the next 3 days.

So, the number of good days left in the month is 2."
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, and Janey has 21 books. To find out how many books Sally has, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Sally has 'x' books. Then, Janey has 2x + 3 books. Since Janey has 21 books, we can write the equation as:
2x + 3 = 21

Now, let's solve for 'x'. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
2x = 18

Next, divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can calculate the current height in inches as follows:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we want to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. To do this, we need to find the difference between the target height and the current height.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

James initially had 4 dogs and 4 toys. Then, 8 more dogs arrived, making the total number of dogs 4 + 8 = 12.

When James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means the number of dogs doubled. So, the new total number of dogs is 12 * 2 = 24.

However, 3 dogs left, so we subtract 3 from the total number of dogs: 24 - 3 = 21.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

To solve this, I'll first find the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. It's quite simple, really. If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then we can divide the number of hash browns by the number of potatoes to get the number of hash browns per potato. 

36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = 6 hash browns per potato

Now that we know the ratio, we can multiply the number of hash browns per potato by the total number of potatoes to find the total number of hash browns we can make.

6 hash browns/potato * 96 potatoes = 576 hash browns

Total weight = Number of adults * Average weight per adult
Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult
Total weight = 720 kg

Now, let's compare the total weight to the maximum load of the elevator, which is 700 kg.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get started on solving the problem.

Shania is designing her own dress, and she decides to make it a longer dress by extending the dress by 50% of its original length. She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. If the final design is 140cm long, we need to find the original length of the dress.

Let's denote the original length as 'x'. When Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, the new length becomes 1.5 times the original length. So, the length after extension is 1.5x.

Adding the 20cm lace trim to the bottom, the final length is 1.5x + 20. We know that the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Now, let's solve for x. Subtract 20 from both sides:
1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:
x = 80

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down this problem step by step.

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, we need to find the age of one of the twins.

Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation:

T = t + 7

We know that there are two twins and three triplets, so the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages are 44, so we can write another equation:

2T + 3t = 44

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation:

2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

2t + 14 + 3t = 44

Combine like terms:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

t = 6

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so we can write the equation:

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for x:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with:

Now, we know Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find 40% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.4: 300 * 0.4 = 120. So, Hannah can see 120 of the city's fireworks.

In addition to the city's fireworks, Hannah will also set off some fireworks in her backyard. She has 3 boxes with 5 fireworks each, so we multiply the number of boxes by the number of fireworks per box: 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of city fireworks she can see to the number of fireworks she will set off: 120 + 15 = 135.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of people. Aiden is going to the cinema with 12 friends, and they're meeting 7 more friends there. So, the total number of people is Aiden (1) + 12 friends + 7 more friends = 20.

Now, each person has a seat, and each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks. To find the total number of drinks and snacks, we multiply the number of people by the number of drinks and snacks per person. The total number of drinks is 20 * 2 = 40, and the total number of snacks is 20 * 3 = 60.

The total number of items (drinks and snacks) is 40 (drinks) + 60 (snacks) = 100.

Since each item costs $2, the total amount spent is 100 * 2 = 200.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, let's add the capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks: 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

The three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. To find out how many pounds Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the total weight that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total weight that the three trucks can carry: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get to the problem at hand. Larry cooked dumplings for his friends, and we need to figure out how many he made.

First, we know there are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females. We also know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

Now, let's calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females. There are 6 females, and each ate 3 dumplings, so that's 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.

Next, we calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males. There are 8 males, and each ate 4 dumplings, so that's 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.

To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we add the dumplings eaten by the males and females. That's 18 + 32 = 50.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to calculate his share of the $100 based on the 3:2 ratio.

The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5. 
Gerald's share is 3/5 of $100, which is (3/5) * 100 = 60.

Now, Gerald spent $10 on a book, so let's subtract that from his initial amount: 60 - 10 = 50.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, and the cat can run 15 feet/second. To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5.

Speed of turtle = Speed of cat / 5
Speed of turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The firefighters have a goal to raise $6300 and have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. To find out how much they raise per hour, we can divide the amount raised by the number of hours.

Amount raised per hour = $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal of $6300. We can do this by dividing the total amount by the amount raised per hour.

Total number of hours = Total amount / Amount raised per hour
Total number of hours = $6300 / $700 per hour
Total number of hours = 9 hours.

The answer is: 9"
"Hello. To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes.

Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River, and 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes. So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city:
40% - 32% = 8%

First, let's calculate the quarts of chocolate ice cream they can make per hour. That's 100 quarts divided by 2 hours, which equals 50 quarts per hour.

Next, let's calculate the quarts of vanilla ice cream they can make per hour. That's 50 quarts divided by 4 hours, which equals 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream they can make per hour. That's 50 quarts per hour + 12.5 quarts per hour, which equals 62.5 quarts per hour.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate Marcus' total bill.

First, we need to find the total cost of the items he purchased. He ordered 5 croissants at $3.00 each, so that's 5 * $3.00 = $15.00. He also got 4 cinnamon rolls for $2.50 each, which is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00. Additionally, he bought 3 mini quiches for $4.00 apiece, totaling 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. Lastly, he purchased 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each, so that's 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, let's add up the costs: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10: $50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get Marcus' total bill: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

To find out how many scoops Erin can buy, we need to calculate how many sets of 3 scoops (2 paid + 1 free) she can afford. Each set of 3 scoops costs 2 * $1.50 = $3.00.

Now, let's divide the total amount Erin has ($6.00) by the cost of each set ($3.00): $6.00 / $3.00 = 2 sets.

Since each set has 3 scoops, Erin can buy 2 sets * 3 scoops = 6 scoops.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get to the problem at hand. We have Ginger and Amy, both starting with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, while Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We want to find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks. There are 14 days in two weeks, so Ginger eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces. To find out how much candy she has left, we subtract the amount she ate from the initial amount: 100 - 56 = 44 pieces.

Now, let's do the same for Amy. She eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces. To find out how much candy she has left, we subtract the amount she ate from the initial amount: 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

The difference in the amount of candy they have left is 58 - 44 = 14.

First, we need to find the total cost of picking the blueberries. James paid $20 to go picking and an additional $1.5 per pound. He picked 30 pounds, so the total cost of picking is:

$20 (initial cost) + $1.5 * 30 (cost per pound) = $20 + $45 = $65

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, and James would have bought 30 pounds. The total cost of buying is:

$2.5 * 30 = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the total cost of picking from the total cost of buying:

Helga's tap rate changes depending on whether her arms are raised or at her sides. When her arms are raised, she taps 200 times per minute with each foot. Since she does this for 2 minutes, the total taps with arms raised is:
2 minutes * 200 taps/minute * 2 feet = 800 taps

When her arms are at her sides, she taps 300 times per minute with her right foot and 250 times per minute with her left foot. Since she does this for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps with arms at her sides is:
3 minutes * (300 taps/minute + 250 taps/minute) = 3 minutes * 550 taps/minute = 1650 taps

Now, we are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x. Then, the equation becomes:
9x + 10 = 100

First, we know that candidate A got 20% of the votes. To find the number of votes, we multiply 20% by the total number of voters, which is 100. So, candidate A got 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Now, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B got. It's given that candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. To find 50% of candidate A's votes, we multiply 20 by 0.5, which is 10 votes. So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes candidates A and B got is 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5. To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar.

Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5 = $50
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3 = $48
Total amount spent = $50 + $48 = $98

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have a class of 50 students with various hobbies. 10 students like to bake, and 5 students like to play basketball. The rest of the students either like to play video games or play music.

First, let's find the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball. That's 10 + 5 = 15 students.

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of students to find out how many students like to play video games or play music. So, 50 - 15 = 35 students.

We're also given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10 students.

Finally, we can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to play music from the total number of students who like to play video games or play music. That's 35 - 10 = 25 students.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

Jeremy initially saw 12 birds in the backyard. When he threw a stone, he scared away 1/3 of them. To find out how many birds were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of 12. 

1/3 of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4 birds.

So, Jeremy scared away 4 birds. The number of birds left is 12 - 4 = 8.

Later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. The total number of birds now is 8 + 20 = 28.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are two classes with a total of 80 students, and each class has the same number of students. To find the number of students in each class, we divide the total number of students by 2.

80 / 2 = 40 students per class

Now, we're told that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4.

40 * 0.4 = 16 girls per class

Since the remaining students are boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24 boys per class

We have 8 dogs that need to be bathed, 5 cats that need their nails clipped, 3 birds that need their wings trimmed, and 12 horses that need to be brushed. To find out how many animals she'll groom each day, we need to calculate the total number of animals first.

8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals

Since Melissa wants to split the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, we'll divide the total number of animals by 7.

28 animals / 7 days = 4 animals per day

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Mark's magic card venture to find out how much profit he made.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the packs. Mark bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so the total cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. Mark got 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000. He also got 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, which is 30 * $50 = $1500. So, the total revenue is $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the cost difference between the two amusement parks for Jake's family.

First, we need to find the total cost for each park. For the first park, the cost is $26 per adult and $12 per child. Since there are 2 adults and 2 children, the total cost would be:
- 2 adults: 2 * $26 = $52
- 2 children: 2 * $12 = $24
Total cost for the first park: $52 + $24 = $76

For the second park, the cost is $14 per adult and $10 per child. So, the total cost would be:
- 2 adults: 2 * $14 = $28
- 2 children: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now, let's find out how much they can save by choosing the second park:
Cost difference = Total cost for the first park - Total cost for the second park
Cost difference = $76 - $48
Cost difference = $28

Now, he's buying tomatoes from a new vendor at $.4 each. His new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is $250 - $200 = $50.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 54 students that need to be separated into groups of equal size. If we want 12 groups, we first need to find out how many students should be in each group. To do that, we divide the total number of students required for 12 groups by 12. However, we don't know the total number of students required for 12 groups. We can find the number of students per group by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups we can form with the given number of students.

Since we are given that the students are to be separated into six groups of equal size, we can find the number of students per group by dividing 54 by 6: 54 / 6 = 9.

Now, if the activity requires 12 groups, we can find the total number of students required by multiplying the number of groups by the number of students per group: 12 * 9 = 108.

However, we are given that there are only 54 students. To find the number of groups that can be formed with 54 students, we divide 54 by 9 (since each group has 9 students): 54 / 9 = 6.

Since the activity requires 12 groups, but we can only form 6 groups with the given number of students, we need to find the difference: 12 - 6 = 6.

Candy's chair rental business has different rental rates for weekdays and weekends. On weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day, and on weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. We need to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in a week. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.

- Weekdays: 60 chairs/day * 5 days = 300 chairs
- Weekends: 100 chairs/day * 2 days = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week = 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, let's find the total number of weeks in two 4-week months. Since each month has 4 weeks, two months will have:
- 2 months * 4 weeks/month = 8 weeks

Finally, we multiply the total chairs rented in a week by the number of weeks:
- 500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 items, we can calculate the initial number of glasses and plates as follows:

Initial number of glasses: 8 dozen * 12 = 96 glasses
Initial number of plates: 4 dozen * 12 = 48 plates

Total initial items: 96 glasses + 48 plates = 144 items

When the items were returned, 10 glasses were broken, and 6 plates were broken. So, the total number of broken items is:
10 (glasses) + 6 (plates) = 16 items

Now, let's subtract the total broken items from the total initial items to find out how many items Jeff has now:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.9, which equals 27. Since 3 small stickers are worth 1 large button, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Now, Lorraine has 3 small stickers left and 9 large buttons. She then trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

Lorraine now has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons (9 + 20), and 20 large stickers left. She trades the remaining large stickers for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

In total, Lorraine has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons, and 60 small buttons. We can convert the large buttons to small buttons since 1 large button is worth 3 small buttons. So, 29 large buttons equal 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons. Adding these to the 60 small buttons, she has 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

Since 1 small sticker is worth 1 small button, we can convert the small stickers to small buttons. Lorraine has 3 small stickers, which is equivalent to 3 small buttons. Adding these to the 147 small buttons, she has 147 + 3 = 150 small buttons.

However, we need to find the total number of buttons, not just small buttons. Since we already know she has 29 large buttons, and we've converted them to small buttons for the count, we can just use the total small buttons as the answer.

The final answer is: 150"

"Hello. Let's break down the problem. We know that the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. We also know that there are 33 people on the council.

Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is x. Then, the number of votes in favor would be 2x, since it's twice the number of votes against.

The total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and against, which is x + 2x = 3x. Since each council member votes, the total number of votes is equal to the total number of council members, which is 33.

So, we can set up the equation 3x = 33. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 33 / 3
x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:
Votes in favor = 2x
Votes in favor = 2 * 11
Votes in favor = 22

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order.

First, we know that 11 students need size extra-small. Since twice as many students need size small as extra small, we can calculate the number of small students as 2 * 11 = 22.

Next, we're told that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, the number of medium students is 22 - 4 = 18.

Now, half as many students need size large as size medium, which means the number of large students is 18 / 2 = 9.

Finally, six more students need size extra-large than large, so the number of extra-large students is 9 + 6 = 15.

To find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we add up the number of students for each size:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people

Finally, we need to find out how many people think horse #12 will win. Since the rest of the people think horse #12 will win, we can subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since buying the series together costs 1/6 of the price of a normal movie, and a normal movie costs $10, we can calculate the cost per series movie:

The remaining movies are normal movies, costing $10 each. To find the number of normal movies, we'll subtract the older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 movies
Now, let's calculate the total cost of the normal movies:
240 * $10 = $2400

Finally, we'll add up the total cost of all the movies:
$334 + $800 + $2400 = $3534

The final answer is: $3534"
"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the total amount Winston spent on fruit.

First, we need to find the cost of each type of fruit. For peaches, Winston picked 6 pounds at $2.00 per pound, so that's 6 * $2.00 = $12.00. For plums, he picked 8 pounds at $1.00 per pound, which is 8 * $1.00 = $8.00. Lastly, he picked 6 pounds of apricots at $3.00 per pound, so that's 6 * $3.00 = $18.00.

Now, let's add up the costs: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with that problem.

To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked. We know that the total time taken is 6 hours, and they hiked for 1.5 hours. So, they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Their driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so the distance driven is:
Distance driven = Speed * Time = 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

Now, let's calculate their hiking speed. It's 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

The distance hiked is:
Distance hiked = Speed * Time = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem and figure out the difference between Ava and Emma's scores.

Ava and Emma are competing in a video game, and the scoring system is as follows: 10 points for every enemy they jump on, 5 points for each berry they collect, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level.

We know that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries, but finishes the level 4 seconds slower. To calculate the difference in their scores, let's break it down:

- For every enemy Ava jumps on, she gets 10 points. Since she jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, she gets 8 * 10 = 80 more points.
- For every berry Ava collects, she gets 5 points. Since she collects 3 more berries than Emma, she gets 3 * 5 = 15 more points.
- For every second left on the timer, Ava gets 30 points. Since she finishes the level 4 seconds slower, she loses 4 * 30 = 120 points.

Now, let's calculate the net difference in their scores:
80 (more points for enemies) + 15 (more points for berries) - 120 (lost points for time) = -25

The final answer is: -25"
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars in total. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas.

So, the cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 30 = 34 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 34 / 2 = 17 dollars.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. To find the total number of rides on these days, we multiply the number of days by the number of rides per day:
5 days * 3 rides/day = 15 rides

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual times, which is 2 * 3 = 6 rides per day. The total number of rides on these 2 days is:
2 days * 6 rides/day = 12 rides

Now, let's add the rides from both periods to find the total number of rides in a week:
15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem. Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. He then bought 17 more fish, and after adding them to his pond, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, the total number of white fish is x + 4 (he already had 4 white fish). The total number of orange fish is 3 + (17 - x), since he bought 17 fish in total.

We can set up an equation based on the fact that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:

2(x + 4) = 3 + (17 - x)

Expanding the equation, we get:

2x + 8 = 20 - x

Now, let's solve for x:

2x + x = 20 - 8
3x = 12
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

However, this doesn't seem to work, as the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, and if x = 4, then the number of orange fish he bought is 13, which is more than the total number of fish he bought minus the number of white fish.

Let's try another approach. If Bob bought x white fish, then he bought 17 - x orange fish. The total number of white fish is x + 4, and the total number of orange fish is 3 + (17 - x). Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can set up the equation:

2(x + 4) = 3 + (17 - x)

However, we can also try to find the correct value of x by testing different options. If Bob bought 6 white fish, then he bought 11 orange fish. The total number of white fish would be 6 + 4 = 10, and the total number of orange fish would be 3 + 11 = 14. Since 14 is indeed twice 7, but not twice 10, this isn't correct.

If Bob bought 5 white fish, then he bought 12 orange fish. The total number of white fish would be 5 + 4 = 9, and the total number of orange fish would be 3 + 12 = 15. Since 15 is not twice 9, this isn't correct.

If Bob bought 4 white fish, then he bought 13 orange fish. The total number of white fish would be 4 + 4 = 8, and the total number of orange fish would be 3 + 13 = 16. Since 16 is twice 8, this seems correct.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello. To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to consider a few factors. 

First, we know that Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 2 x 5 = 10 miles per day.

The total distance he drives in a week is 10 miles/day x 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money his car is consuming per week is 5 gallons/week x $3/gallon = $15/week.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carrie received 10 twenties and 140 quarters from her aunt. We need to find out how much she spent for lunch, given that she used all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties.

First, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount spent from the quarters is:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, we'll calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, and Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties, we can find the total amount spent from the twenties as follows:
3/5 * 10 * $20 = 3/5 * $200 = $120

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount spent:
$35 + $120 = $155

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that one-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs, and one-eighth are analog TVs. To find the number of smart TVs sold, we multiply the total number of TVs (40) by 1/4, which gives us 10 smart TVs.

Next, we find the number of analog TVs sold by multiplying the total number of TVs (40) by 1/8, which gives us 5 analog TVs.

Now, let's add the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold: 10 + 5 = 15.

Since the rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

School's contribution = Total cost / 2
School's contribution = $300 / 2
School's contribution = $150

Now, let's subtract the school's contribution and the money John already has from the total cost of the trip:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 90 people who need to be split into 9-person groups. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

Now, 3/5 of these groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. To find the number of groups that brought seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

Number of groups that brought seashells = 10 * 3/5
= 6

Since each group has 9 members, the total number of people who brought seashells is:

Number of people who brought seashells = 6 * 9
= 54

Each of these people brought 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells is:

Total number of seashells = 54 * 2

First, we need to find the total number of employees after three months. The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after three months, the total number of employees will be:

200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3)

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let's assume she needs to buy x stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We can set up the equation to represent the situation:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

To do this, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours. The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will cover a distance of:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will cover a distance of:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Now, to find the distance between the two cars, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

To find the total number of petals in the vase, we subtract the dropped petals from the total: 101 - 22 = 79 petals.

"Hey there, I'm Fatima. Let's get to the problem at hand. John and DeSean have a bag of marshmallows to make s'mores, and we need to figure out how many s'mores each of them can have with the marshmallows left in the bag.

First, we know they started with 35 marshmallows. Each s'more uses one marshmallow, so we need to calculate how many marshmallows they used and how many were dropped. John and DeSean each made 9 s'mores, which means they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

To find out how many marshmallows are left, we subtract the total used and dropped from the initial number. That's 35 (initial) - 21 (used and dropped) = 14 marshmallows left.

Since there are 2 kids, we'll divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many s'mores each kid can have. That's 14 / 2 = 7.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Tanya makes a salt scrub using salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She fills a 10-ounce jar each time. We know that she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. Also, she uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's denote the amount of zest as 'x'. Then the amount of fragrance is also 'x', the amount of salt is '2x', the amount of sugar is '2x', and the amount of oil is '4x' (twice the amount of salt).

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10

Combine like terms:
10x = 10

Divide both sides by 10:
x = 1

Now, we know the amount of oil is 4x, so:
4 * 1 = 4

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate how much John spent at the market.

First, we need to find the total cost of the goats. John bought 3 goats for $500 each, so the total cost of the goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows. John bought 2 cows for $1500 each, so the total cost of the cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, let's add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to find the total amount John spent. $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's figure out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy. 

First, we need to find out the total number of cupcakes Paul already has. He has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. So, the total number of cupcakes he already has is 8 + 40 = 48.

Now, we know Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. To find out how many more he needs to buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs. 

So, 63 (total cupcakes needed) - 48 (cupcakes already available) = 15.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, we can calculate the number of cars Joe has: 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which gives us 8 cars sold.

Now, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

"Hello, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem to find out how much each student raised.

The charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 coming from organizations. To find out how much the students raised, we subtract the amount from organizations from the total amount.

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we know that 20 students worked together to raise this amount, and each student earned the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

John completes 30 cycles of work each day, and each cycle consists of 5 tasks that pay $1.20 per task. To calculate his daily earnings, we first need to find out how much he earns per cycle:
5 tasks * $1.20 per task = $6 per cycle

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are:
$6 per cycle * 30 cycles = $180 per day

Now, let's calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by 7:
$180 per day * 7 days = $1260

Now, let's move on to the second game. Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. So, Sasha's score in the second game was 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her points from both games:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

To find out how many more tins of cat food Kimberly bought than dog food, we need to calculate the total number of tins of each type of food.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food. Since each package contains 11 tins, and Kimberly bought 8 packages, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food. Since each package contains 6 tins, and Kimberly bought 6 packages, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, to find the difference, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem and find out how many cards Becca has.

We know that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 cards. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has.

Let's start by representing the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of cards:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

And the number of cards Becca has:
Becca has 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards

Becca has 153 cards."

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost per pound is:
4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40

Additionally, the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, and the distribution center is 20 miles away, so the cost per mile is:
20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60

Now, let's add the cost per pound and the cost per mile to get the total shipping cost:
$1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32. So, the refund amount is:
75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24.00

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
Total loss = Book cost - Refund amount + Shipping cost
Total loss = $32 - $24.00 + $3.00

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Boris's chocolate production for the month.

Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week. In the second week, he produces half as much, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. Then, in the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Britany's TikTok activities and calculate the total time she spends on them in a month.

First, we have the time spent recording videos. Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, that's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply 72 by 4 to get 288 minutes per month.

Next, we have the time spent writing songs. Britany spends 2 hours per week writing songs, which is equivalent to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes per week. For a month, that's 120 * 4 = 480 minutes.

Lastly, we have the time spent on makeup. Britany spends 15 minutes per day, 6 days a week, which is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes per week. For a month, that's 90 * 4 = 360 minutes.

The interior design firm's initial installation package includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures for $129.00. Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that need to be installed.

First, let's calculate the number of additional items: 
- Mirrors: 6 (Angela's) - 4 (initial package) = 2 additional mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 (Angela's) - 1 (initial package) = 1 additional chandelier
- Pictures: 20 (Angela's) - 10 (initial package) = 10 additional pictures

The cost of these additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost for the additional items is:
2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00
Total cost for additional items = $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, which means Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).

First, we need to find the total number of pairs James buys in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of pairs he buys per month by 12:

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, we know James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:

$2640/year ÷ 24 pairs/year = $110/pair

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the total cost of the baskets of food.

First, we need to find the cost of the green food baskets. Since each basket costs $25, three baskets will cost 3 * $25 = $75.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the red food baskets. The original price of each basket is $18, so three baskets would cost 3 * $18 = $54. However, we get a $2 discount for each basket of red food, which means we save 3 * $2 = $6.

After applying the discount, the cost of the three red food baskets is $54 - $6 = $48.

Now, let's add the cost of the green food baskets and the discounted red food baskets to find the total cost: $75 + $48 = $123.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get to the problem at hand. We have 90 rooms at the KozyInn Motel, and it takes housekeeping 20 minutes to clean each room. We want to find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms.

First, let's determine how many rooms that is. One-half of 90 rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Now, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so the total time to clean 45 rooms is 45 * 20 minutes = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, 900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes. That's a great start.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, that's 3 * 12 = 36 homes. Now, the total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built so far. This means they will build 2 * 48 = 96 new homes in the third year.

To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to add the homes built in the first two years (48) to the homes built in the third year (96). So, the total is 48 + 96 = 144.

The final answer is: 144"
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have four people: you, your brother, your sister, and your mom. Let's denote your brother's age as B, your age as Y, and your sister's age as S. We know that you are three years younger than your brother, so we can write an equation:
Y = B - 3

We also know that you are 2 years older than your sister, so we can write another equation:
Y = S + 2

Now, let's talk about your mom's age. It's one less than three times your brother's age. Let's denote your mom's age as M:
M = 3B - 1

When we add all your ages, we get 87. So, we can write the equation:
B + Y + S + M = 87

Substituting the expressions for Y and M from the previous equations, we get:
B + (B - 3) + (Y - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Since Y = B - 3, we can substitute this expression for Y in the equation above:
B + (B - 3) + ((B - 3) - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
B + B - 3 + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87

Combine like terms again:
5B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:
5B = 96

Divide by 5:
B = 19.2

Since B must be a whole number, we'll try both 19 and 20 to see which one works.

If B = 20:
Y = B - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17
S = Y - 2 = 17 - 2 = 15
M = 3B - 1 = 3(20) - 1 = 59

B + Y + S + M = 20 + 17 + 15 + 35 = 87 (this works)

So, I think I have the answer.

Mr. Jackson has 27 students in his class, and he wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. To find out the total number of glue sticks required, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks each student needs: 27 * 2 = 54.

The glue sticks come in packs of 8, so we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs are needed. 

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, and he wants to make sure every student gets 2 glue sticks, he'll need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means he'll need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

First, we know the initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount doubles. So, we multiply the initial amount by 2 to get the new amount: 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons.

Now, on the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. To find the total amount of water passing through the river, we add this increase to the amount we calculated earlier: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

On day 2, the 70 infected people will infect 70 * 6 = 420 others. So, the total number of infected people on day 2 is 70 (previous) + 420 = 490.

On day 3, the 490 infected people will infect 490 * 6 = 2940 others. So, the total number of infected people on day 3 is 490 (previous) + 2940 = 3430.

Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month, so in a year, she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, which means she earns 1 badge every 2 months. To find out how many badges Amber earns in a year, we can divide 12 months by 2, which gives us 6 badges.

Wendy, on the other hand, earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, we multiply the number of badges Claire earns in a year (12) by 3, which gives us 36 badges.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year:

36 (Wendy's badges) - 6 (Amber's badges) = 30

We can now set up an equation to represent the total number of books:

F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. To find the number of outdoor plants, we'll multiply the remaining plants by 2/3.

Number of outdoor plants = 75 * 2/3 = 50

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we'll subtract the outdoor plants from the remaining plants.

Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we'll divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, and it spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. To find the speed of the thingamabob, we can divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we have the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. Since the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob, we can multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Ellen's daily expenses to find out how much she pays for one carrot.

Ellen buys a salad for $6 and a yogurt that's half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3. The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily goods, the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the total cost of the carrots by 2. So, $2 / 2 = $1.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Mark's weekly earnings.

First, we need to calculate his new hourly wage. Mark used to make $10 an hour, but he received a $2 raise, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, which is a total of 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, let's multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: 40 hours * $12 per hour = $480.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Tasha made a total of $80 last month from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We also know that she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, and the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, we can assume that's for one mowing.

So, if Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, that's 3 * $6 = $18 from Kamala. And if she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, that's 5 * $6 = $30 from Alba.

Now, let's add up the money she made from mowing lawns: $6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) + $30 (Alba) = $54.

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the money she made from mowing lawns from the total: $80 - $54 = $26.

"Hello, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Martin's weight is 55 kg. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's, so we add 16 kg to Martin's weight to find Carl's weight.

Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg

Next, Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so we add 8 kg to Carl's weight to find Christian's weight.

Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg

Finally, Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so we subtract 5 kg from Christian's weight to find Harry's weight.

Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down John's car rental situation to find out his monthly profit.

First, we need to calculate the total hours John rents his car out per month. He rents it out 10 times a month, and each time it's for 3 hours. So, the total hours per month would be:
10 x 3 = 30 hours

Since John gets paid $25 an hour, his total earnings per month would be:
30 hours x $25/hour = $750

Now, let's subtract his car payment of $500 from his total earnings to find his profit:
$750 - $500 = $250

Now, we're told Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Since Martha initially had 2 notebooks, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

After buying more notebooks, Martha now has 7. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's total from Martha's total: 7 - 6 = 1.

So, Dijana and Anis went rowing, and Dijana rowed 50 miles the whole day. Anis, on the other hand, rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how far Anis rowed, we need to calculate 1/5 of 50 miles, which is 50 * 1/5 = 10 miles. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we add those 10 miles to Dijana's 50 miles. So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, let's find the total distance they both rowed. We simply add the distance rowed by Dijana (50 miles) to the distance rowed by Anis (60 miles).

To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to subtract the cookies taken by Susan's husband from the total number of cookies and then divide the result by the number of nephews.

So, let's do the math: 
Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4 = 96
Number of nephews = 6

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem. Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill four adult bowls or eight child bowls. He's an adult, and he'll be eating with his adult wife and their two children. Everyone will have one bowl for dinner.

To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the leftover soup first. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they'll eat 2 adult bowls, which is equivalent to 4 child bowls. Their 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. 

The total number of bowls eaten is 4 (from the adults) + 2 (from the children) = 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

To calculate the material needed for the small masks, we'll divide the total number of small masks by the number of small masks she can make with 2 yards of material. Then, we'll multiply the result by 2 yards. So, for 20 small masks:
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 * 2 yards = 10 yards

Now, let's do the same for the large masks. We'll divide the total number of large masks by the number of large masks she can make with 2.25 yards of material. Then, we'll multiply the result by 2.25 yards. So, for 8 large masks:
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 2.67 * 2.25 yards = 6 yards

Finally, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem.

We know Duncan's current age is 60. To find Adam's age, we need to work backwards. Eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

We're also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Let's use this information to find Adam's current age. If Adam's current age is A, then four years ago, he was A - 4 years old.

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can set up the equation:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

52 = 2A - 8

Adding 8 to both sides, we get:

60 = 2A

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

A = 30

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find his age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we first need to calculate the total miles he drives in a month. Since he drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, we can multiply the miles driven per day by the number of days in a month.

Total miles driven in a month = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles driven in a month = 3000 miles

Now, we know that Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find the number of tune-ups he needs, we can divide the total miles driven by the miles required for a tune-up.

First, we need to find out how many calories are in each mini pastry. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that. So, a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. Since Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories from the cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, let's look at the blueberry muffins. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that. So, a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories. Since Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories from the blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 31 blocks + 8 stuffed animals + 9 stacking rings = 48 toys.

Now, let's subtract this number from the new total: 62 (total toys) - 48 (toys she already had) = 14.

So, Sophie bought 14 bouncy balls.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote Jean's age as J, Paul's age as P, and Peter's age as P.

Since Paul is 10 years older than Jean, we can write an equation:
P = J + 10

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
P = P + J

Now, let's rewrite the equation for Peter's age in terms of J:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, so we can write another equation:
P + P + J = 100

Substitute P from the previous equation into this one:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
P = J + 10
P = 20 + 10
P = 30

Now that we know Paul's and Jean's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = P + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

"Hey there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 balloons for her friends. Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself, making the total initial number of balloons 8 + 1 = 9.

Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total, including Maria, so that's 5 * 3 = 15 additional balloons.

To find the total number of balloons, we add the initial and additional balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the yard sale problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff the charity group has. Since 10 people donated 5 boxes each, that's a total of 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. Adding the 10 boxes they already had, we get 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Now, we know they can fit 2 boxes per table. To find out how many tables they need in total, we divide the total number of boxes by 2. So, 60 / 2 = 30 tables are needed.

The charity group already owns 15 tables, which means they need to get some more. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables needed. That's 30 - 15 = 15 new tables.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get to the watermelon seed spitting contest between Zoey and Sydney. To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance each person spits and then find the average of those two distances.

Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet, so her total distance is 40 x 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet, so her total distance is 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

Now, let's find the average total distance spat. We add the total distances and divide by 2: (400 + 420) / 2 = 820 / 2 = 410 feet.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem at hand. Fern is trying to decide between two widget-making machines: the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000. To determine which one is more profitable, we need to calculate the total amount of money each machine can make in a month.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a month. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours, it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. Since there are 30 days in a month, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours, it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money each machine can make in a month. Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 will make 43200 * 6 = $259200 in a month. The WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32400 * 6 = $194400 in a month.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the amount made by the WidgetMaster 9000 from the amount made by the Widgeteer 3000: $259200 - $194400 = $64800.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Cameron's hotel stay options.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. He has two options: pay for a 24-hour stay or pay for a 12-hour stay and add 70 pesos for every additional hour.

If Cameron chooses the 24-hour stay, he'll pay 1600 pesos.

For the 12-hour stay, he'll pay 1000 pesos. Since he's staying for 17 hours, he'll need to add 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) at 70 pesos per hour. The additional hours will cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. So, the total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get to the problem at hand. Nate is feeding his livestock hay, and we need to figure out how many pounds of hay he needs in total.

First, we know that each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats:

15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds

Now, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. It's given that each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we can calculate it as follows:

Amount each sheep needs = 2 * 5 pounds - 3 pounds
Amount each sheep needs = 10 pounds - 3 pounds
Amount each sheep needs = 7 pounds

With 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for the sheep is:

12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay Nate needs, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep:

Total hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds
Total hay needed = 159 pounds

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down John's situation step by step.

First, we need to calculate John's total earnings. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 * 6 = 300 dollars

Next, we subtract his expenses. He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has:
300 - 50 = 250 dollars left

Then, he wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has:
250 - 100 = 150 dollars left

After that, he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends:
5 * 10 = 50 dollars

Now he has:
150 - 50 = 100 dollars left

Finally, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining amount. We divide the remaining amount by the cost of a pen:
100 / 25 = 4

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem.

Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word. 
Craig's total letters = 20 words * 15 letters/word = 300 letters.

Now, let's consider Craig's brother. He has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. To find the brother's total letters, we add 50 to Craig's total letters.
Brother's total letters = 300 + 50 = 350 letters.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled is the sum of Craig's total letters and his brother's total letters.
Total letters = 300 + 350 = 650 letters.

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Now, the teacher gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice. To find the total number of bottles given away, we multiply the number of students by the number of bottles per student:
29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given away from the total number of bottles:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Patty's Plumbing charges a visit fee of $40, plus $35 per hour (or part thereof) for labor, and the cost of parts. For this particular job, the labor took 2.25 hours and the parts cost $60.

First, we need to calculate the labor cost. Since the labor took 2.25 hours, we round up to the nearest hour, which is 3 hours. The labor cost is $35 per hour, so:

Labor cost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's add the labor cost to the visit charge and the cost of parts:

Total charge = Visit charge + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60

However, he got them for 40% off, which means he paid 60% of the total cost. To find 60% of $150, we multiply $150 by 0.6, which gives us $90.

Later, James decided to sell 5 of the CDs for $40. Now, let's calculate how much money he was out. We subtract the amount he got back ($40) from the amount he paid ($90).

$90 - $40 = $50

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem and find out how long it took James to cross the lake.

First, we need to calculate the distance James swam at his initial pace. Since he swam 60% of the 20-mile lake, the distance covered is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. Given his pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, James takes a break on an island, resting for half as long as the swimming time. So, his resting time is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance James needs to cover, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half his initial speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

To find the total time taken, we add the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D.

We can set up two equations based on the given information: B = A + 20 and B = D + 10.

Since the total points scored by the team is 45, we can write the equation A + B + D = 45.

Now, let's substitute B from the first equation into the total points equation: A + (A + 20) + D = 45.

We also know that B = D + 10, so we can rewrite D as B - 10. Substituting this into the previous equation gives us A + (A + 20) + (A + 20 - 10) = 45.

Combine like terms to get 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides to get 3A = 15.

Divide both sides by 3 to get A = 5.

To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per paper. Given that there are 100 papers (or 100 pages) to the inch, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we multiply the total number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book (1.5 inches) to find the total number of pages in the book.

Total number of pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches
Total number of pages = 300 pages

We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have caught a total of 339 Pokémon. We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.

Let's start by denoting the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught as 'x'. Then, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is 4x - 13, and the number of Pokémon Alex has caught is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

Since the total number of Pokémon caught is 339, we can set up the equation:
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon Stan has caught:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the total age of Nani and his siblings.

First, we know Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.

Now, let's find Nani's sister's age. She is 25% younger than Nani. To calculate this, we find 25% of 8, which is 0.25 * 8 = 2 years. So, Nani's sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we can calculate the total age of all three family members:
Nani's age: 8 years
Nani's brother's age: 16 years
Nani's sister's age: 6 years
Total age: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 12 racquets that need restringing, and the time it takes to string each one varies depending on the type of string used. We have 3 racquets to be strung with synthetic gut, 5 with polyester string, and 4 with a hybrid set (half synthetic gut, half polyester string).

The time it takes to string each type of racquet is as follows:
- Synthetic gut: 15 minutes
- Polyester string: 22 minutes
- Hybrid set: 18 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time it will take to string each type of racquet:
- Synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
- Polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
- Hybrid set: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Finally, we add up the time for each type of racquet to get the total time:
45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem. John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, so that's a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining 2 phones (for the 2 kids) are half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the remaining 2 phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Now, let's add the cost of all the phones together: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

We know that Carlton's team has 13 players, and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. To find the number of players in Zeke's team, we simply add 7 to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Number of players in Zeke's team = 13 + 7

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team.

Total number of players = 20 + 13

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need for his fence, we need to calculate the perimeter of the fence first. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). 

Given that the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula. 

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total slats = 2 * 50
Total slats = 100

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. To find the total number of oranges, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box:
12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away:
4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, let's subtract the number of oranges she gave away from the total:
240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, which is:
160 oranges * 1/4 = 40 oranges

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the remaining oranges:
160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the books. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. So, the total cost is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, which is great! However, he still needs to cover the remaining amount. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost: $39 - $14 = $25.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5). 

$25 ÷ $5 = 5

Now, we know that Robert and Richard have a combined total of 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. Since the total number of cherries is 60, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Finally, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's total from Robert's total: 30 - 10 = 20.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both days. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

In total, Sunny sold 10 + 15 = 25 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, let's calculate the number of apple pies sold. On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

In total, Sunny sold 11 + 15 = 26 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we multiply the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie by their respective costs:

25 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $150
26 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $390

Adding these amounts together, we get the total amount Sunny earned:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside, and she'll be outside 4 hours a day. To find out how much sunscreen she'll use in a day, we multiply the amount she uses per hour by the number of hours she's outside: 1 ounce/hour * 4 hours = 4 ounces per day.

Since she'll be on vacation for 8 days, we multiply the daily amount by the number of days: 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces.

Now, let's find out how many bottles of sunscreen she'll need. Each bottle contains 8 ounces, so we divide the total amount of sunscreen she'll use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces): 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

First, we need to find the price of the red car. Since it's 40% cheaper than the blue car, we'll calculate 40% of the blue car's price and subtract it from the blue car's price.

The blue car costs $100. To find 40% of $100, we multiply it by 0.4: $100 * 0.4 = $40. Now, we subtract this amount from the blue car's price: $100 - $40 = $60. So, the red car costs $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add their prices: $100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160.

We know Emil is 19 years old now, and when he turns 24, he'll be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48. Since 5 years will pass before Emil turns 24, his dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he'll be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12. Since 5 years will pass before Emil turns 24, his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7.

Now, let's add up the total pounds of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

To find the total number of flowers Pat needs, we'll convert the length of the flower bed to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, we'll divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space each flower takes up:

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants. However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. 
For the sunflowers: 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
For the carnations: 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations: 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

We subtract the soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil: 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is: 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

Next, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at 3 degrees per hour. The temperature change in this case is 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.

Now, let's add the temperature changes from both low and high settings: 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the temperature increase is 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.

To find the net temperature change, we subtract the warming from the cooling: 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time, we need to multiply his dad's age by 3. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it for the second time. Therefore, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds, which is our starting point. Chikote, being the enthusiastic howler that he is, howls for twice as long as Tobias. So, Chikote's howl lasts for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.

Now, Igneous is a bit of a show-off, howling for as long as the other two wolves combined. That means Igneous howls for 20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) = 60 seconds.

To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we add their individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

Since we need the answer in minutes, we'll convert the total seconds to minutes by dividing by 60 (because there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We can write an equation based on the total age:
3 + 4 + W + H = 20

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. To find the average age, we divide the total age by the number of children:
Average age = Total age / Number of children
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write:
H = 2 * Average age
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now we can substitute the value of H into our first equation:
3 + 4 + W + 10 = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

So, the age of Wilfred is 3.

To solve this, let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices. We have 4 kids, each getting a slice of size x, and 2 adults, each getting a slice of size 2x. So, the total number of slices is 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Since each adult gets 2x, we can calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets by dividing 2x by the total number of slices (8x) and multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (2x / 8x) * 100

We know that Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each. We also know that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars.

To find out how many chocolate bars each of them has in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter, that would be 64 ÷ 4 = 16 chocolate bars in each box.

For Martha, that would be 56 ÷ 7 = 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, let's find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We can do that by subtracting the number of chocolate bars Martha has in each box from the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box.

16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem.

We have a population of 50 porcupines in a park, and we know that 3/5 of them are female. To find the number of female porcupines, we can multiply the total population by 3/5.

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Now, each of these female porcupines gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the total number of babies born in a month is:

Number of babies per month = 30 * 4 = 120

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

Number of babies per year = 120 * 12 = 1440

To find the total number of porcupines after a year, we add the initial population to the number of babies born in a year:

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the cost of filling the pool, we need to start by calculating the volume of the pool. The pool's dimensions are given as 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. We can find the volume by multiplying these dimensions together.

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

The pool company instructed the Smiths to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the total gallons of water needed. Let's do that.

Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260

Now, we know the cost of filling the pool is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = gallons * $0.10
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get to the problem at hand. We have 9 red sticks, and the number of blue sticks is 5 more than the red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

Now, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, which means we have 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

To find the total number of sticks, we simply add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the distance each person traveled. To do this, we multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles
Shandy's distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances to see how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo.

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance
= 450 miles - 220 miles
= 230 miles

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Brook Hills High School has 3000 students. Half of these students are over 16 years old, which is 3000 / 2 = 1500 students. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so the number of male students over 16 is 1500 / 4 = 375.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which is also 1500 students. One-half of these students are male, so the number of male students under 16 is 1500 / 2 = 750.

Now, let's find the total number of male students. We add the male students over 16 and under 16: 375 + 750 = 1125.

To find the total number of female students, we subtract the total number of male students from the total number of students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey's total is 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Now, Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey. To find Shaelyn's total, we divide Trey's laps by 2: 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so we subtract 2 from Shaelyn's total: 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's total from Bethany's total: 10 - 5 = 5.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem and find out how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full.

First, we need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day. Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's add up the total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days: 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the power bank was losing 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours, and after that, the charge remaining was 28%. To find the charge before this 3-hour period, we need to add the total loss during this time to the final charge.

The total loss during the 3-hour period is 7% * 3 = 21%. So, the charge before this period was 28% + 21% = 49%.

Now, we know that the power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours before the 3-hour period. To find the charge before this 5-hour period, we need to add the total loss during this time to the charge we just calculated.

The total loss during the 5-hour period is 9% * 5 = 45%. So, the charge before this period was 49% + 45% = 94%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Janet's situation to figure out how many weeks she needs to work to save for the down payment on that $10000 car.

First, we need to calculate Janet's total hourly earnings. She makes $10 an hour from wages and another $15 an hour from tips, so that's a total of $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings would be $25 per hour * 40 hours per week = $1000 per week.

Now, let's calculate the down payment amount. Janet wants to save 20% of the car's price, which is $10000 * 0.20 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we'll divide the down payment by her weekly earnings: $2000 / $1000 per week = 2 weeks.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate how many plums Jamaar can buy with the money he has left.

Jamaar has already purchased 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples. The total cost of these fruits is:
3 peaches at $.5 each = 3 * .5 = $1.5
4 pears at $.5 each = 4 * .5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each = 2 * 1 = $2
5 apples at $.75 each = 5 * .75 = $3.75

Adding these costs together, we get: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $.25 each, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $.25 = 3

First, we need to find out how many packs she gave away. Since she kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces she gave away. Each pack has 60 pieces, so 13 packs would be 13 * 60 = 780 pieces.

To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase for each year and add it to the initial price.

First, let's calculate the price after the first year. The initial price is $120, and the increase is 5% of that, which is $6. So, the price after the first year is $120 + $6 = $126.

Next, we calculate the price after the second year. The initial price is now $126, and the increase is 5% of that, which is $6.30. So, the price after the second year is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Finally, we calculate the price after the third year. The initial price is now $132.30, and the increase is 5% of that, which is $6.615. So, the price after the third year is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

72 pictures ÷ 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. We can find the total number of selfies and portraits by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album.

Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27
Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18

To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we simply add the two numbers together.

Total number of portraits and selfies = 27 + 18 = 45

The rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult. To find the number of average and difficult questions, we subtract the percentage of easy questions from 100%:
100% - 40% = 60% of the questions are average and difficult.
60% of 60 = 0.6 * 60 = 36 questions.
Since these are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We can express this relationship as S = 2L.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is 12L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is 4S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation: 4S = 4(2L) = 8L.

The total earnings from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation: 12L + 8L = 120.

Combine like terms: 20L = 120.

Divide both sides by 20: L = 6.

Since S = 2L, S = 2 * 6 = 12.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

1. The teacher gives everyone an extension, which has a 40% chance. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.
2. The teacher doesn't give an extension, which has a 60% chance. In this case, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing the teacher that his dog ate his assignment and getting a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework:
50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher with extension) + 6% (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 76%

This means that Marcus has a 76% chance of not having to turn in his homework. To find the probability that he will actually have to turn it in, we subtract this from 100%:

Now, let's move on to Wednesday. They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. Adding 5 to that result, we get 204 + 5 = 209 letters delivered on Wednesday.

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we simply add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the total amount Molly will pay for the catering.

First, we need to find the cost of the chicken salad. Since 10 people want the chicken salad at $6.50 per person, the total cost will be 10 * $6.50 = $65.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the pasta salad. 6 people want the pasta salad at $6 per person, so the total cost will be 6 * $6 = $36.

Now, let's add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad to find the total amount Molly will pay. $65 + $36 = $101.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Johnny's dad had a bit of a rollercoaster day at the horse racing event. On the first race, he lost $5. Then, on the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. To calculate this, we multiply the amount he lost by 2 and add $1: 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

However, his winning streak didn't last long. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, we multiply the amount he won by 1.5: 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost. We subtract the amount he won from the total amount he lost: $5 (lost) + $16.50 (lost) - $11 (won) = $10.50.

To find the average amount lost, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races: $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 26 countries in South America, and in each country, there are 5 cities with 1000 people living in each city. To find the total population, we need to calculate the number of people in each country and then multiply that by the number of countries.

Each country has 5 cities, and each city has 1000 people. So, the total number of people in each country is:
5 cities * 1000 people per city = 5000 people per country

Now, let's multiply the number of people in each country by the number of countries:
26 countries * 5000 people per country = 130,000 people

So, the total population of South America is 130,000."
"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's figure out the difference in height between Cole and Xavier.

First, we need to convert Xavier's height to inches. Since Xavier was 4 feet tall, and there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 4 by 12 to get 48 inches. Then, we add the 3 inches he grew over the summer, making his new height 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his new height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now, let's find the difference in their heights. We subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that three people divided an amount of $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first, and the third person took twice what the second person took. To find the share of the first person, let's denote it as x.

The second person's share is x + 80, and the third person's share is 2(x + 80). The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine x terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have a team of 4 painters working on a mansion for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks. To find the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's convert 3/8ths of a day to hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can multiply 3/8 by 24:
3/8 * 24 = 9 hours per day

Now, let's calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:
3 weeks = 3 * 7 days = 21 days
Total hours worked in 21 days = 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Finally, let's divide the total hours worked by the number of painters:
189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls in three sets. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x.

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

To simplify the equation, let's multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is 10."
"Hello. To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (from 2007 to 2010).

The initial price of the car is $20000, and it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

First, let's calculate the price after 1 year (2008). 
Price after 1 year = Initial price - (Initial price * Depreciation rate)
= $20000 - ($20000 * 0.21)
= $20000 - $4200
= $15800

Next, we'll calculate the price after 2 years (2009).
Price after 2 years = Price after 1 year - (Price after 1 year * Depreciation rate)
= $15800 - ($15800 * 0.21)
= $15800 - $3328
= $12472

Finally, we'll calculate the price after 3 years (2010).
Price after 3 years = Price after 2 years - (Price after 2 years * Depreciation rate)
= $12472 - ($12472 * 0.21)
= $12472 - $2618.52

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. To find out how many kilometers Bernice will still need to drive, we need to calculate the total distance she has driven so far and subtract it from the total distance.

The total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is 1955 kilometers. Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, so let's calculate the total distance she has driven:

Total distance driven = Distance driven per day * Number of days
Total distance driven = 325 * 4
Total distance driven = 1300 kilometers

Now, let's subtract the total distance driven from the total distance to find out how many kilometers Bernice will still need to drive:

Distance left to drive = Total distance - Total distance driven
Distance left to drive = 1955 - 1300
Distance left to drive = 655 kilometers

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, and we want to find out how many gallons of water she drinks in 30 days. To do this, we need to calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days.

Since Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups of water.

Now, we know that there are 16 cups in a gallon. To find the number of gallons, we can divide the total number of cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons

At the second stop, 50 people get off the train, leaving us with:
140 - 50 = 90

Then, twice the number of people who got off board the train, which is 2 * 50 = 100. So, the total number of people is now:

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Alison's shopping trip to find out how much she spent on athletic gear.

First, Alison bought a tank top for $10. Then, she picked up a pair of running shorts that cost $5 more than the tank top, so that's $10 + $5 = $15.

Next, she got a great deal on a pair of tennis shoes. They were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. To find the sale price, we'll divide the original price by 2: $48 ÷ 2 = $24.

Finally, Alison bought a package of athletic socks that originally cost $8. She had a coupon for $2 off, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6 for the socks.

Now, let's add up the costs: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with your kitchen floor renovation costs.

To calculate the total cost, we need to determine the number of tiles required to cover the entire floor. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. Given that your kitchen floor has a total area of 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles needed.

Total number of tiles required = Total area of the kitchen floor / Area of each tile
Total number of tiles required = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Total number of tiles required = 200

Now, let's calculate the total cost. Each tile costs $12, so:

Total cost = Total number of tiles required * Cost of each tile
Total cost = 200 * $12
Total cost = $2400

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72

Now, we add this to the normal cost to get James' new monthly rate.

$120 + $72 = $192

Since James pays this amount every month, we multiply it by 12 to find his yearly cost.

$192 * 12 = $2304

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed that need clean sheets every week. His laundry machine can only handle 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

For the twin beds, since the machine can wash 2 sets at a time, Greg will need to do 4 / 2 = 2 loads for the twin beds.

For the king size bed, it's just 1 load.

So, in total, Greg does 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads of laundry per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of loads per year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks: 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food they eat per day is 120 grams * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of food (720 grams) by the amount they eat per day (360 grams):

We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. Let's denote Donovan's part as x minutes. Then, Betsy's part is x + 18 minutes.

Since the total time is the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's parts, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now, let's subtract the number of emails that don't require a response from the total number of emails James receives in a day. That's 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James responds to the rest of the emails, he responds to 64 emails in a day. To find the number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5. That's 64 * 5 = 320.

315 ÷ 7 = 45 bananas per day

Now, let's find out how many bananas each monkey eats. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

Since the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is 45, and the first and second monkeys eat 24 bananas in a day, we can find out how many bananas the third monkey eats by subtracting 24 from 45.

Let's break it down step by step. Paul needs to catch the fourth train, and we know the schedule of the first three trains.

The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes and will stay in the station for 20 minutes. So, it will leave the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train will arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. This train will stay in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the second train will leave the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train will arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since this train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, it will leave at 125 minutes.

Finally, the fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. So, it will arrive at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Paul will wait for his train for 145 minutes.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for her sculpture, and she's been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has already collected, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks she's been saving them.

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since she needs 200 toothpicks, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks needed.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Since he bought it at 75% of the original price, we can calculate it as follows:
Original price = $2000
Price Mr. Rogers bought it = $2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. So, the price his friend paid is:
Price friend paid = $1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, let's find the discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. The discount is the difference between the original price and the price the friend paid:
Discount = $2000 - $1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we'll divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
Percentage discount = ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem. We have 5 bubbling springs, each creating a new jellyfish every second. We want to find out how many jellyfish they'll create in 4 hours.

First, let's convert 4 hours into seconds. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in an hour is 60 * 60 = 3600. For 4 hours, we multiply this by 4: 3600 * 4 = 14400 seconds.

Now, since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, we multiply the total number of seconds by the number of springs: 14400 * 5 = 72000 jellyfish.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down James' journey to the store. He walked halfway to the store, then back home, and finally to the store again. Since his home is 4 miles from the store, the distance he walked before turning back is 2 miles (half of 4 miles). Then, he walked 2 miles back home. After that, he walked the full 4 miles to the store.

So, the total distance James walked is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 miles. Now, let's calculate the time it took him to cover this distance. We know James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find the time, we'll divide the total distance by his speed:

Time = Total distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the amount of money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually.

First, we need to find out how many bananas Jenny bought. Since she bought 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she bought a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so 40 bananas would cost 40 * $0.80 = $32.

On the other hand, buying the bananas in bunches costs $3.00 per bunch. Since Jenny bought 10 bunches, she paid 10 * $3.00 = $30.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32 - $30 = $2.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find out how much it grows in one year, we can divide the total growth by the number of years.

So, the crocodile grows 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches per year * 13 years = 26 inches

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Marcel's bicycle sales to find out how much he earned.

Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes, with half of them being Trekking bikes. So, the number of Trekking bikes sold is:
300 / 2 = 150

Next, 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes. To find the number of BMX bikes sold, we multiply 300 by 0.15:
300 * 0.15 = 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105

The prices of the bikes are as follows: MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB ($500 / 2 = $250), and a Trekking bike is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get to the problem at hand. We have a farmer and a truck driver working together in a field. The farmer is baling hay at a rate of 5 bales per hour, while the truck driver is picking up the bales at a rate of 3 per hour. They both work for 6 hours.

To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and subtract the total number of bales picked up by the truck driver.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck driver picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck driver picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, let's subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck driver from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down John's weekly learning time.

John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. To find the total weekly minutes, let's call the total weekly minutes 'x'. Then, the extra learning time is (1/16)x.

We know that the class time is 1600 minutes, and the extra learning time is (1/16)x. The total weekly minutes 'x' is the sum of class time and extra learning time:

x = 1600 + (1/16)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 16:

16x = 25600 + x

Subtract x from both sides:

15x = 25600

Divide both sides by 15:

x = 25600 / 15
x = 1706.67

Now, we can convert the total weekly minutes to hours:

Total hours per week = x / 60
Total hours per week = 1706.67 / 60
Total hours per week = 28.44

First, we need to find the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since he drops it from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the initial height is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

Now, let's calculate the height of the ball on its first bounce. The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height, so on the first bounce, it goes to 72 * 2/3 = 48 feet.

Finally, we need to find the height of the ball on its second bounce. Again, the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its previous height, so on the second bounce, it goes to 48 * 2/3 = 32 feet.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 inches to 72: 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from 74: 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

Finally, the fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to 69: 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

Number of bags sold = Total apples sold / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200 bags

Now, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we'll multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag.

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

Now, we know that the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

Finally, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, which means the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get started on calculating the cost of painting the room.

First, we need to find the total area of the walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, so we'll divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons are needed: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost will be 12 * 12 = $144.

Later, Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. This means there are now 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

When Ellen's friend arrives, there are a total of 8 sodas to choose from, with 2 of them being shaken. To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of choosing a shaken soda.

The probability is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas: 2/8 = 1/4 = 0.25.

To express this probability as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled. For the first train:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

For the second train:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, we add the distances they've traveled to find the total distance between them:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to calculate 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2, which gives us 10 days off.

Now, let's find the number of days Billy works. We subtract the days off from the total number of days: 50 - 10 = 40 days.

We know Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. To find the total number of people he helps per day, we multiply the number of people he helps per hour by the number of hours he works: 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Micah's miles = 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.

Now, let's add the miles run by Amber and Micah to find their total. 
Total miles run by Amber and Micah = 8 + 28 = 36 miles.

Since the total miles run by all three is 52, we can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.
Ahito's miles = Total miles - miles run by Amber and Micah = 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Sheila's credit card transactions to find the new balance.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. Then, she returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract that from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, Sheila bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off the original price of $20.00. To find the discount, we calculate 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00. So, the price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off the original price of $30.00. The discount is 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00. Therefore, the price of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the new purchases is $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00. Adding this to the balance after the return, we get: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem and figure out how many more years Lauren needs to work.

Lauren wants to save for a retirement period of 20 years, and she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000. To calculate her retirement savings goal, we need to determine how much she'll need per year and then multiply that by the number of years.

40% of $100,000 is $40,000 per year. For 20 years, she'll need:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000

Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck, which translates to:

$100,000 per year * 0.20 = $20,000 per year

To calculate how many years it will take her to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the goal by her annual savings:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

However, Lauren wants to retire in 20 years. Since she's already been working and saving, let's assume she's saved some amount. We know she needs to save a total of $800,000 and she saves $20,000 per year.

The amount she'll save in the next 20 years is:

$20,000 * 20 = $400,000

This means she's already saved:

$800,000 - $400,000 = $400,000

Since she saves $20,000 per year, she's already worked:

$400,000 / $20,000 per year = 20 years

However, this is the total number of years she's worked so far, not the number of years she needs to work from now. Since she wants to retire in 20 years and she's already worked for some years, the number of years she needs to work from now is equal to the number of years she needs to work to save the remaining amount.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Anna's book-buying situation. Anna started with a budget of $16 and had already spent $4, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. After buying the books, she had $2 left, which means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books for the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount she spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

The final answer is: $5"

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know the light on the lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find out how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we need to determine the rate at which it blinks per minute.

First, let's calculate the rate per minute by dividing the number of blinks by the number of minutes: 
255 blinks ÷ 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now that we know the rate, we can find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We'll do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute: 
459 blinks ÷ 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem at hand. We need to find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has in his garden pond.

First, let's count the initial number of fishes. There are 4 male guppies and 3 male goldfishes, making a total of 7 male fishes. On the other hand, there are 7 female guppies and 5 female goldfishes, making a total of 12 female fishes.

Tate then buys some more fishes: 2 male guppies and 2 male goldfishes, adding up to 4 male fishes, and 1 female guppy and 3 female goldfishes, adding up to 4 female fishes.

Now, let's update the total count. The new total number of male fishes is 7 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 11. The new total number of female fishes is 12 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 16.

To find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes, we subtract the number of male fishes from the number of female fishes: 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5.

As for Dior, her task took 4 hours longer than Amalia's, not ""well over 4 hours longer"" as stated. So, Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chore:

First, we need to find the distance John drives for a round trip to visit his parents. We know it takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph. Since it's a round trip, we'll multiply the time by 2.

Time for round trip = 2 * 2 hours = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance for the round trip using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time.

Distance for round trip = 70 mph * 4 hours = 280 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total miles driven per month is:
280 miles * 2 = 560 miles

Now, we know that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. This means Brian will cover half the distance that Sofie covers. To find Brian's total distance, we divide Sofie's total distance by 2: 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 5 workers, and we know the production rates of 4 of them. Two workers produce 6 toys an hour, and the other two produce 4 toys an hour. They all work for 10 hours, and by the end of their shift, the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to fulfill the order of 400 toys.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours. The two workers who produce 6 toys an hour will make 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys. The other two workers who produce 4 toys an hour will make 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys. So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, let's find out how many toys the fifth worker produced. We subtract the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers from the total number of toys produced in 10 hours: 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

We know that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah has two dogs, one that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog and another that is half the weight of Kory's dog.

To find the weight of Elijah's first dog, we'll divide Kory's dog's weight by 4. That's 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

For Elijah's second dog, we'll divide Kory's dog's weight by 2. That's 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the dogs: 
Kory's dog: 60 pounds
Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds
Elijah's second dog: 30 pounds

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get to the problem at hand. John is packing M&M's into small bags, and we need to figure out how many small bags he can make.

First, we need to find out the total number of M&M's John has. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. So, the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Since each ounce of M&M's contains 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

Now, if John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we can find out the number of small bags he can make by dividing the total number of M&M's by 10. That's 900 / 10 = 90.

120 * 5 = 600 miles per hour

Now, we're told the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the fastest car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.

We know that Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 Easter eggs. We also know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Additionally, Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

To start, let's figure out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, we can say that Sarah painted x eggs, and Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Together, they painted 30 eggs, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 12) = 30.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 12 = 30. Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 2x = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 9.

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many eggs Arnold and Madeline painted. We know that the total number of eggs is 56, and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs. Therefore, Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Finally, let's find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 

The difference is 21 - 13 = 8.

Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to put them into boxes, with 8 crayons in each box. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the weight of each separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the crayons. Since there are 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:
200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces

Next, let's find the weight of the boxes. To do this, we need to find out how many boxes Nik will need. Since he's putting 8 crayons in each box, we can divide the total number of crayons by 8:
200 crayons / 8 crayons/box = 25 boxes

Now that we know Nik needs 25 boxes, we can find the total weight of the boxes:
25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of their individual weights:
200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can divide the total weight in ounces by 16:
400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds

First, we need to find out how much of the 80-foot tree can be used to make logs. Since John can make logs out of 80% of it, we calculate that as follows:
80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Now, we know that John cuts the tree into 4-foot logs. To find the total number of logs, we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we're told that John cuts 5 planks from each log. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log to find the total number of planks:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we know that John sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

Now, let's calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000, and her brother earns $10,000, so together they earn $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Grandma walks 3 miles every day, with 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We know she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and we need to find the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We can do this by dividing the distance she walks on the beach (2 miles) by the time she spends walking on the beach (40 minutes).

Speed on the beach = Distance / Time
Speed on the beach = 2 miles / 40 minutes
Speed on the beach = 1/20 miles per minute

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach.

Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * Speed on the beach
Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * (1/20 miles per minute)
Speed on the sidewalk = 1/10 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk by dividing the distance she walks on the sidewalk (1 mile) by her speed on the sidewalk (1/10 miles per minute).

Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed
Time on the sidewalk = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute)
Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes

Finally, we can find the total time it takes Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk by adding the time she spends on the beach (40 minutes) to the time she spends on the sidewalk (10 minutes).

Total Time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk
Total Time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes
Total Time = 50 minutes

Initial marbles + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from both sides:

Initial marbles = 60 - 24
Initial marbles = 36

So Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, he will have:

36 - 10 = 26

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem. Donny has two mugs of water, one at 33 degrees and the other at an unknown temperature. He mixes 4 ounces of the 33-degree water with 1 ounce of the unknown water and is now able to drink it, which means the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees.

To find the minimum temperature of the second mug, we can use the concept of weighted averages. The total weight of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug). We can set up the equation:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:
4 * 33 + x ≥ 200
132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:
x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

First, we need to determine the number of cows and chickens added over the three weeks. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.

Since there are 21 days in three weeks, the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows. The total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add these to the initial number of animals. The farm started with 50 cows and 20 chickens. So, the total number of cows after three weeks is 50 + 420 = 470, and the total number of chickens after three weeks is 20 + 210 = 230.

To find the total number of animals, we add the number of cows and chickens: 470 + 230 = 700.

Each pack of bagels has 9 bagels, so the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops.
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop to find out how many potatoes he ate.
18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.12 * 100 = 12%

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem of Carlos, Jim, and Carrey's seashell collection.

We know Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

It's also mentioned that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. To find out how many Carrey collected, we'll divide Carlos' collection by 2. That's 22 / 2 = 11 seashells for Carrey.

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we'll divide the total by 3. That's 60 / 3 = 20 seashells per person.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate how many carrots Mason eats in a week.

Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays, which is 5 days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots.

On weekends, Mason eats 5 carrots each day, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekends is 5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots.

Now, let's add the carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week: 20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the first song is 5 minutes long, and the second song is 60% longer. To find the length of the second song, we need to calculate 60% of 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes. Since the second song is 60% longer, we add these 3 minutes to the original 5 minutes. So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

Now, let's find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes.

Linus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40 per device.

He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, for a total of 2 + 4 = 6 devices. The cost of each device is $20, so the total cost is 6 * $20 = $120.

The total selling price is 6 * $40 = $240.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price: $240 - $120 = $120.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's figure out the length of Carl's cane together.

We know Isabel is 7 feet tall. Since Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height by subtracting 2 from 7, which gives us 5 feet.

Now, Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so we add 1 to Ned's height, making Carl 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.

The problem states that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we simply divide Carl's height by 2. So, 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"Hello, I'm Fatima. To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of 1 person's daily energy needs. Since 1 bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy needs, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy needs.

Now, to satisfy 100% of 2300 people's daily energy needs, we need 5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex already produces 4200 bottles per day, the number of additional bottles needed is 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

1/4 * 8 = 2 babies wearing blue

Now, all the blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple wearers (1/3 * 6 = 2 babies) also wear bows. So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

We want to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. To do this, we'll divide the number of babies wearing purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and multiply by 100.

Abraham starts with 80 square meters of unused land. He sells half of it, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters, for $50.

Next, he sells 1/4 of his original land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30.

Now, let's calculate how much land he has left. He initially had 80 square meters, sold 40, and then sold 20 more. So, the remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

Abraham sells this remaining land for $3 per square meter. Therefore, he earns 20 * 3 = $60 from the last sale.

First, we need to figure out how many eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, and a dozen is 12, we multiply 3 by 12 to get 36 eggs.

Now, let's see how many eggs each of the kids found. Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, which is 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so that's 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs found, we add up the eggs each kid found: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Finally, to find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs Cole hid: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The combined total of the first two complexes is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. Now, let's calculate 60% of 400, which is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Since the last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, it has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

He gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is 3120 * 0.40 = 1248.

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as y. Then, the length of the blue rope is y - 7, and the length of the red rope is 4(y - 7).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6y = 72

Divide by 6:
y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
Blue rope = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
Red rope = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4(5) = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get:

-x = -$3

We know that the wall mural has four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. The mural used a total of 12 pints of paint. It's also mentioned that half the mural is yellow, so we can calculate the amount of yellow paint used.

Yellow paint = 1/2 * Total paint = 1/2 * 12 = 6 pints

Now, let's find the total amount of paint used for the non-yellow colors. Since the yellow paint accounts for half of the total, the remaining half is divided among red, white, and purple.

Non-yellow paint (red, white, purple) = Total paint - Yellow paint = 12 - 6 = 6 pints

We're told that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. To find the amount of red paint used, we'll divide the non-yellow paint by 3.

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So, the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, let's find the cost per pod. Since the special size box costs $12, the cost per pod is 12 / 120 = $0.1 per pod.

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for something. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 left.

The value of the remaining 20 dollar bills is 20 * 20 = 400 dollars.

Then, Thomas triples his money, which gives him 400 * 3 = 1200 dollars.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk and uses 45% of it on Monday, which is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch per day (if the chalk was full). Since the chalk is not full, we will use the remaining length to calculate the number of days.

Let's calculate the number of days until the chalk is less than 2 inches:
The teacher has 2.75 inches left and uses 1 inch per day. 
2.75 - 1 = 1.75 inches after the first day.
1.75 - 1 = 0.75 inches after the second day.

Since 0.75 inches is less than 1 inch, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after the second day of using 20% of the original chalk length per day.

However, the question asks for the number of days before he has to recycle the chalk. Therefore, the answer is 2 days before he has to recycle the chalk on the third day.

To find out how many cheese pizzas Kate needs to buy, we'll calculate the total number of cheese slices her friends will eat. Since each friend eats 6 slices, the total number of cheese slices is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices. Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza, which is 12. So, 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas.

Now, let's do the same for the pepperoni pizzas. Each friend eats 4 slices, so the total number of pepperoni slices is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices. We divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza, which is 8. So, 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

First, let's convert Jay's snowball-building rate to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate his rate as 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

Now, let's consider the melting rate. 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate at which Jay gains snowballs, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate: 
1/3 - 2/15 = (5 - 2) / 15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate to find the time it will take:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2 = 4

Now that we know Jim's age 20 years ago, we can find his current age by adding 20 years:

"Let's break down the problem. Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than her, which is 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so that's 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by each person: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the nurses' station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

Now, let's calculate the total bandages they had at the end of the third day. They ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used 25 bandages, so they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages left from the third day's order.

However, it's given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means that they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the previous days.

On the second day, they used 28 bandages. Since they had 3 bandages left from the previous days, they must have had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages at the start of the second day.

On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left. Since they had 31 bandages at the start of the second day, they must have had 31 - 12 = 19 more bandages at the start of the first day.

So, the total bandages they had at the start of the first day is 50 (from the bulk pack) + 19 (extra bandages) + 12 (left at the end of the first day, but this is already included in the 50, so we don't need to add it again) = 50 + 19 = 69.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the cost of May's hair cut and color. 

First, we need to find out how many inches of hair were cut off. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so 10 - 8 = 2 inches were cut off.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so 2 inches would be 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40. 

The total cost is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

"Hello, I'm Fatima. To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her hourly rate, the number of hours she works, and the additional amount she receives for complete attendance.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. So, her total hours worked per week is 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours. Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours worked for the month is 45 * 4 = 180 hours.

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total earnings from hours worked is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

In addition to her hourly earnings, Jen receives $10 for each week of complete attendance. Since she had no absences in April, she receives $10 * 4 = $40.

Therefore, Jen's total earnings for April is $270 + $40 = $310.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Jason's earnings from his chores.

Jason earned $3.00 for doing his laundry, which he did once. He also cleaned his room once, which earned him $1.50. For taking the trash to the curb, he did it twice, so that's 2 * $0.75 = $1.50. Lastly, he emptied the dishwasher 6 times, which is 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

Now, let's add up all his earnings: $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning his room) + $1.50 (taking the trash out) + $3.00 (emptying the dishwasher) = $9.00.

"Hello, I'm Fatima. To solve this problem, we need to find out how much blood is in one shark and then multiply it by the number of sharks.

Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in a shark by multiplying 40 by 3. This gives us 40 * 3 = 120 gallons of blood in one shark.

Now, we multiply the number of gallons of blood in one shark by the number of sharks: 120 * 10 = 1200.

Finally, three times the number of people who entered in the morning came in the evening, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 red pens.

Now, let's calculate the number of black pens. Since Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, she bought 2 * 5 packs = 10 packs of black pens. With 5 pens in each pack, the total number of black pens is 10 packs * 5 pens per pack = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of one bottle of scotch. Since John buys 10 bottles for a total of $600, we can calculate the cost per bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle.

Now, let's move on to the cognac. John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch per bottle. To find the cost of cognac per bottle, we need to calculate 50% of $60, which is $30. Adding this to the cost of scotch per bottle, we get $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles × $90 per bottle = $1800.

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spent: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many trees Mr. Julius planted on the first day. We know he planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, he must have planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 + 40 = 60.

Now, let's move on to the second day. Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than he did on the first day. To find 1/4 of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.25, which gives us 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80.

To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days, we add the number of trees planted on each day: 60 + 80 = 140.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get to the problem at hand. We need to find out how much root beer was available for each person at the party.

Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer. However, his children had a taste of it on the first day, consuming 4 gallons. This left 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

The next day, Barbie accidentally spilled 7 gallons, reducing the amount to 20 - 7 = 13 gallons. Then, on the third day, Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally with Fred. To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining amount by the total number of people, which is 4 (3 guests + Fred).

8 gallons / 4 people = 2 gallons per person.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We're given that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40. To find the number of coffee mugs, let's denote it as 'x'. We can set up an equation based on the given information:

4x + 8 = 40

Now, let's solve for 'x'. First, we'll subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we'll divide both sides by 4:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem. We have 66 fish in the tank, and we need to find out how many have red stripes and blue stripes.

First, we'll calculate the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we'll divide 66 by 3. 

66 ÷ 3 = 22

So, 22 fish have red stripes. Now, let's find the number of fish with blue stripes. We know that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. To find the remaining fish, we'll subtract the fish with red stripes from the total.

Remaining fish = 66 - 22 = 44

Now, we'll calculate 5/11 of the remaining fish.

(5/11) * 44 = 20

So, 20 fish have blue stripes. To find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we'll add the two numbers together.

Total fish with red and blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Amy's eyeshadow situation. She initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, giving her a total of 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes. Additionally, she had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, which is 3 * 6 = 18 colors.

After her sister stole one palette, Amy was left with 8 - 4 = 4 colors from the palettes. The number of colors from the makeup sets remained unchanged at this point, so she still had 18 colors from the makeup sets.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set had 6 colors, she used 6 / 2 = 3 colors. This leaves her with 18 - 3 = 15 colors from the makeup sets.

Combining the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets, Amy now has 4 + 15 = 19 colors.

Now, let's calculate the remaining shells after team Alphas found their share: 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells, which is 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

The medium setting removes twice as much as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. In 3 days, it removes 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. In 5 days, it removes 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

First, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. So, the base area is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. Multiplying this by the height, we get a total volume of 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the actual volume of jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, let's find the total number of jelly beans. We know that a single jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. So, the total number of jelly beans is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

We're told that 30% of the jelly beans are red. To find the estimated number of red jelly beans, we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3. This gives us 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the price of the toy after the 80% increase in December. To do this, we'll calculate 80% of the initial price and add it to the initial price.

Initial price in November: $40
Increase in December: 80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
Price in December: $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we need to find the price of the toy after the 50% decrease in January. To do this, we'll calculate 50% of the price in December and subtract it from the price in December.

Decrease in January: 50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36
Price in January: $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Charlie's earnings for the day.

Charlie charges $80 per hour for his standard lessons, and he has 4 1-hour lessons at this rate. So, his earnings from these lessons are:
4 x $80 = $320

For the lessons with the veteran, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. To find the reduced rate, I'll calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from the original rate:
25% of $80 = 0.25 x $80 = $20
Reduced rate = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

Charlie has 2 1-hour lessons with the veteran, so his earnings from these lessons are:
2 x $60 = $120

Now, let's add his earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money he'll make for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

Sally's total score is 630. Since she took 9 quizzes, we'll divide the total score by 9 to find the mean:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos and gave some away, leaving her with 1/4 of the original amount. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we need to determine how many she was left with.

Since Eve was left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can calculate this as:
20 * 1/4 = 20 * 0.25 = 5

So, Eve was left with 5 pomelos. Now, let's subtract the remaining amount from the original amount to find out how many she gave away:
20 - 5 = 15

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Walter initially bought 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples. So, he had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

Next, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples, which is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples. So, he had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Walter then sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple: 27 * 3 = 81 dollars.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem. Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and that's 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year. To find out how many novels she's written this year, we need to figure out what number 9 is 3/4 of.

Let's set up the equation: 9 = (3/4)x, where x is the number of novels written this year. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3. This gives us x = 9 * (4/3) = 12.

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total hours Michael traveled. Since he traveled for 3 days, and there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours as follows:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance covered by Michael using his average speed of 50 km/hr:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the distance covered, we will divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of juice. So, he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

Now, let's find out how many grapes were used in total by Madeline and her brother. That's 6 (by Madeline) + 30 (by her brother) = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother. That's 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by their mother) = 84 grapes.

The answer is: 84"
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that 13 out of 82 teachers at Rydell Elementary School were sick. To find the number of teachers who were present, we subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers.

82 (total teachers) - 13 (sick teachers) = 69

However, we also know that 9 substitute teachers were called in to help. So, we add these substitute teachers to the number of teachers who were present.

69 (teachers present) + 9 (substitute teachers) = 78

Therefore, the total number of teachers at school that day was 78.

"Hello. To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning and divide it by the total time available.

The custodian has 80 classrooms to clean, with 15 minutes spent per classroom. So, the total time spent cleaning is 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes.

Since the custodian has 5 days to clean the school, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by 5: 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes per day.

Now, we need to convert the total time available per day from hours to minutes: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning: (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% ≈ 50%.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get started on solving the problem.

To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to figure out the total number of books one bookcase can hold. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so together they can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which means it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

In total, one bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Now, let's divide the total number of books Elly has (110) by the number of books one bookcase can hold (55). 

110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

First, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens, and each dozen has 12 eggs, she has a total of 5 x 12 = 60 eggs.

The cost of these eggs is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Now, let's find out how much she'll make by selling these eggs. She's selling them for $1 for every 3 eggs. So, she'll sell 60 / 3 = 20 sets of eggs. Her total revenue will be 20 x $1 = $20.

To find her profit, we subtract her total cost from her total revenue: $20 - $12 = $8.

Out of these 50 hats, 3/5 are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply 50 by 3/5, which gives us 30 blue hats.

The remaining hats are white. So, we subtract the number of blue hats from the non-red hats: 50 - 30 = 20.

Archie buys a bag of beef jerky that contains 30 sticks and originally costs $18.00. However, he gets a $3.00 discount on the bag. To find the cost per stick, we first need to calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount.

The total cost per bag after discount is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00. Now, we convert this amount to cents, as the question asks for the cost per stick in cents. Since $1 = 100 cents, $15.00 = 1500 cents.

Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick. 
Cost per stick = 1500 cents / 30 sticks
Cost per stick = 50 cents

First, we need to find out how many questions Audrey got right on the first test. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct. To calculate this, we multiply 70 by 0.6 (which is the same as 60%).

70 * 0.6 = 42 questions

Now, let's look at the total number of questions for both tests. The first test has 70 questions, and the second test has 40 questions. 

70 + 40 = 110 questions

Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions correct to pass. To find this out, we multiply 110 by 0.7 (which is the same as 70%).

110 * 0.7 = 77 questions

Since Audrey already got 42 questions correct on the first test, we subtract this from the total number of questions she needs to get right.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem. Mary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them, and we need to figure out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

We know that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. So, we have the equation: b = 5s - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which means s + b = 116. Now, let's substitute the expression for b into this equation: s + (5s - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6s - 4 = 116. Add 4 to both sides: 6s = 120. Divide both sides by 6: s = 20.

Now that we know Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes: b = 5s - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

Now, let's move on to the candles. Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other 4 have 5 medium candles each. The total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16, and the total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20. The total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs. Given that there are 20 helmets, we can start by finding the number of footballs. Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, the number of footballs is twice the number of helmets.

Number of footballs = 2 * Number of helmets
Number of footballs = 2 * 20
Number of footballs = 40

Now, let's find the number of robots. Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can divide the number of helmets by 2.

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

To find the total number of items, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.

We know Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute on land, so the time he'll take to cover 100 yards on land is:
Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes

In the water, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. So, the time he'll take to cover 100 yards in water is:
Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

The 2-legged animals have 10 * 2 = 20 legs, and the 4-legged animals have 15 * 4 = 60 legs. Adding these together, we get a total of 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

Since each pair of legs consists of 2 legs, we can find the total number of pairs by dividing the total number of legs by 2. So, 80 / 2 = 40.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We have a tower made of 4 blue blocks, twice as many yellow blocks, and an unknown number of red blocks. The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

First, let's find out how many yellow blocks there are. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, we can multiply the number of blue blocks by 2. So, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, let's add the number of blue and yellow blocks together. 4 (blue blocks) + 8 (yellow blocks) = 12 blocks.

To find the number of red blocks, we subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks in the tower. So, 32 (total blocks) - 12 (blue and yellow blocks) = 20.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down Elvis's journey to find out how far he is from his house.

First, we need to calculate the distance Elvis traveled west. We can do this by multiplying his average speed (18mph) by the time he spent driving west (5 hours).

Distance traveled west = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, we'll calculate the distance Elvis traveled east. Again, we multiply his average speed (18mph) by the time he spent driving east (8 hours).

Distance traveled east = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find out how far he is from his house.

Distance from house = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west
= 144 miles - 90 miles
= 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's calculate the value of Gary's boat after three years.

First, we need to find the depreciation for each year. In the first year, the boat depreciated by 30%. To calculate this, we multiply the original price by the depreciation percentage.

$9000 * 0.3 = $2700

Now, we subtract the depreciation from the original price to get the value after the first year.

$9000 - $2700 = $6300

In the second year, the boat depreciated by another 30%. We calculate this by multiplying the value after the first year by the depreciation percentage.

$6300 * 0.3 = $1890

Now, we subtract the depreciation from the value after the first year to get the value after the second year.

$6300 - $1890 = $4410

In the third year, the boat depreciated by 20%. We calculate this by multiplying the value after the second year by the depreciation percentage.

$4410 * 0.2 = $882

Now, we subtract the depreciation from the value after the second year to get the value after the third year.

$4410 - $882 = $3528

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the bag has 232 pieces of candies in total. We're also given the number of red candies, which is 54. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so that's 54 * 2 = 108. The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, which is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag: 232 - 189 = 43.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. I'd be happy to help you with that question.

So, Helen went on a trip to Germany and stayed in a hotel for 3 nights. The cost of one night at the hotel was $80. To find the total cost of her hotel stay, we multiply the number of nights by the cost per night: 3 nights * $80 per night = $240.

Now, let's calculate the cost of her bus rides. Each bus ride cost 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8. Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus rides is 7 * $8 = $56.

To find the total cost of Helen's trip, we add the cost of the hotel stay and the cost of the bus rides: $240 + $56 = $296.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know Mazie has 52 marbles and gives them to twins, Dallas and Darla. We also know that Dallas has a total of 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them in the playground. To find out how many marbles Dallas had initially, we need to add the 4 marbles he dropped to the 21 marbles he has now. 

So, Dallas had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles initially.

Now, since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas received 25 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles.

The number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is 52 - 25 = 27.

2 adult tickets: 2 * $12 = $24
1 child ticket: $8
Total ticket cost: $24 + $8 = $32

Next, they buy 2 popcorns for $3 each. The total cost of the popcorns would be:

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total weight of the car, including the luggage and the two children. The car itself weighs 1200 pounds, and the luggage adds another 250 pounds. The two children weigh 75 pounds each, so we need to multiply that by 2.

Weight of the car: 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage: 250 pounds
Weight of the two children: 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds
Total weight: 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Now, we're told that the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of the total weight, we can multiply the total weight by 0.01.

Force needed = 0.01 * 1600 pounds = 16 pounds

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of his rectangular backyard fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).

Given the length of the fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2(35)
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper.

Total seashells found = 214 + 432 + 86 = 732

However, they discovered that 67 of these seashells were cracked. To find the number of good seashells, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total.

Number of good seashells = Total seashells found - Number of cracked seashells

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's get down to business and solve this problem.

Dexter has five lovely pigs, and each one eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. To find out how much feed they eat in a day, we multiply the amount of feed each pig eats in a day by the number of pigs. Since each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, that's 4 * 2 = 8 pounds per pig per day. Multiply that by 5 pigs, and we get 8 * 5 = 40 pounds of feed per day.

Now, let's calculate how much feed they eat in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7. That's 40 * 7 = 280 pounds of feed per week.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumption from the total amount of feed ordered. That's 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we subtract those from the total:
40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs

Now, we know that a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs. To find out how many packs John needs to buy, we divide the number of hot dogs he needs by the number of hot dogs per pack:
36 / 6 = 6 packs

Finally, since each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total amount John needs to spend:
6 * $2 = $12

Igor gathered the correct number of beakers initially, but he lost some on the way to the lab bench. Let's call the number of beakers he lost x. Then, the number of beakers he gathered is 7 - x.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + 7 - x (beakers) = 29.

Now, we can solve for x:
8 + 16 + 7 - x = 29
31 - x = 29
-x = -2
x = 2

Number of beakers Igor lost:

"Hi there, I'm Fatima. Let's figure out how many screws James will have left over.

First, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws. Since James is putting together 4 tables, he will need 4 x 8 = 32 screws in total.

Now, let's subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws James has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this egg-cellent problem together.

We have 10 eggs in the first basket, and the second basket has twice as many eggs. To find out how many eggs are in the second basket, we simply multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2. So, the second basket has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30.

"As-salamu alaykum, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim's total is $430 + $320 = $750.

Next, Sarah raised $300, and Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam's total is $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by each person: Alexandra's $430 + Kim's $750 + Sarah's $300 + Maryam's $700 = $2180.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron. This means Aaron ran half the distance that Vanessa ran, which is 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

Now, we're given that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran 2 miles, we can find out how long it would take Vanessa to run the same distance. If Aaron is twice as fast, then Vanessa would take twice as long to run 2 miles. So, Vanessa would take 16 * 2 = 32 minutes to run 2 miles.

To find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles, we can simply multiply the time it took her to run 2 miles by 2, since she ran twice the distance. Therefore, Vanessa took 32 * 2 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's figure out how much line the caretaker needs to buy. He wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there's 200 feet of dock. To find the total amount of line needed, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 * 3 = 600 feet

Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we subtract that from the total amount needed:

600 - 6 = 594 feet

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount spent per reservation. Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. The total amount spent per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, the total amount made per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Now, let's calculate the total amount made per week. The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the total amount made per week is 2 * $90 = $180.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the cost price of each watermelon, we'll divide the total cost by the number of watermelons.

Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

The vendor sold the watermelons at a 25% profit. To find the profit amount per watermelon, we'll calculate 25% of the cost price.

Profit amount per watermelon = 25% of $1.60 = 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40

Now, let's find the selling price per watermelon by adding the cost price and the profit amount.

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit amount per watermelon
= $1.60 + $0.40
= $2.00

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that James is twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. To find Dora's current age, we subtract 3 from 12, which gives us 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

Now, we know that John was 19 years old when James was born. So, the age difference between John and James is 19 years.

To find John's current age, we add James' age to the age difference: 18 + 19 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the age difference between John and his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

The youngest son's current age is 5 years. In 3 years, he will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem. We have Ana and Jane peeling oranges at different rates. Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange, while Jane takes 4 minutes.

To find out how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour, we'll divide the total minutes in an hour (60) by the time it takes each of them to peel an orange.

Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges in an hour.

Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges in an hour.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane. To do this, we'll subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled: 20 - 15 = 5.

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark needs a new radiator, and the original price is $400. However, he manages to get it for 80% off at a junk shop. To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 20% of the original price, since 100% - 80% = 20%.

20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

Next, he hires a mechanic to install it, and the mechanic charges $50 per hour. The installation takes 3 hours, so the total labor cost is:

$50 * 3 = $150

Now, let's add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid:

$80 + $150 = $230

"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they're either chickens or cows. We also know that the total number of legs is 70. To start, let's use variables to represent the number of chickens and cows. Let's say 'c' is the number of chickens and 'w' is the number of cows.

Since there are 20 animals in total, we can write the equation:

c + w = 20

Now, let's think about the legs. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. So, the total number of legs can be represented by the equation:

2c + 4w = 70

To make things easier, let's simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:

c + 2w = 35

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to get:

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

So, we know that there are 15 cows. To find the number of chickens, we can substitute 'w' into the first equation:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"Hello there, I'm Fatima. Let's dive into the problem. Henry and his 3 friends have ordered 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. To find out how many slices they have in total, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza: 7 * 8 = 56 slices.

Now, since there are 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends) who want to share the pizzas equally, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 / 4 = 14.

Answer: 14"
