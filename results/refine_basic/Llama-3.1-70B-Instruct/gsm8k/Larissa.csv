"Hey there, let's break down Janet's daily egg sales. First, we need to figure out how many eggs she has left to sell after breakfast and baking. Her ducks lay 16 eggs per day, and she uses 3 for breakfast and 4 for baking muffins. That's a total of 7 eggs used.

So, the number of eggs she has left to sell is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. Since she sells each egg for $2, her daily earnings from the farmers' market would be 9 eggs * $2 per egg.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. We know that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. It also takes half that much white fiber, which means it takes 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

To find the total number of bolts, we simply add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt). 

The final answer is: 3"
"Hey there, let's break down Josh's house flipping adventure. He bought the house for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs, so his total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% + 150%). To find the new value, we multiply the original value by 2.5. So, 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

Now, let's calculate the profit. The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, James is running 3 sprints, 3 times a week, and each sprint is 60 meters. To find the total meters he runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

First, let's calculate the total number of sprints per week: 3 sprints * 3 times a week = 9 sprints per week. Now, we multiply this by the distance of each sprint: 9 sprints * 60 meters per sprint = 540 meters.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's figure out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day. Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, and the price for them varies. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of that price.

Let's calculate the cost of the second glass: 60% of $5 is 0.6 * 5 = $3.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can pair them up. There will be 8 pairs, with each pair consisting of a $5 glass and a $3 glass. The total cost for each pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Now, let's multiply the cost of one pair by the total number of pairs: 8 * $8 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's figure out how many sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together.

We know Seattle has 20 sheep. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can calculate Charleston's sheep by multiplying Seattle's sheep by 4. That's 4 * 20 = 80 sheep in Charleston.

Now, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. To find Toulouse's sheep, we multiply Charleston's sheep by 2. That's 2 * 80 = 160 sheep in Toulouse.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in each city: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Carla's file download situation.

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before Windows forces a restart. To find out how much she downloaded, we calculate 40% of 200 GB, which is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla's download speed is 2 GB per minute, it takes her 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to download 80 GB.

After the restart, which takes 20 minutes, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. So, she downloads the entire 200 GB file. At 2 GB per minute, this takes 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the initial download time, the restart time, and the complete download time: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes.

"Let's break down John's journey to find out how far he is from home.

First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply his speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Now, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move.

After the traffic, he drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he travels in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

For the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), John drives at 80 mph. The distance he travels in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance John travels after turning around is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Since John was trying to get back home, we subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the distance he traveled before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you with that. So, let's break down Eliza's earnings for the week. She earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours she works, and then she gets overtime pay, which is 1.2 times her regular rate.

For the first 40 hours, Eliza earns 40 hours * $10/hour = $400. Since she worked 45 hours, she has 5 hours of overtime. Her overtime rate is 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour. So, for the 5 hours of overtime, she earns 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

To find her total earnings, we add her regular pay and overtime pay: $400 + $60 = $460.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the program had 60 downloads in the first month. 

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. So, we multiply 60 by 3 to get 180 downloads.

Now, for the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

To find the total number of downloads, we add the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's calculate the total cost of the pastries Toula bought.

First, we have 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen, so that's 3 x $68 = $204. Then, there are 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen, which is 2 x $80 = $160. Lastly, we have 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen, so that's 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add all these costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carlos is planting a lemon tree that costs $90 to plant. Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. However, it costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree.

To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) plus the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree ($3 per year). The total revenue is the annual revenue from selling lemons (7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year).

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.5
Year 2: Total cost = $93 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $96, Total revenue = $10.5 * 2 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $99, Total revenue = $10.5 * 3 = $31.5
Year 4: Total cost = $99 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $102, Total revenue = $10.5 * 4 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $105, Total revenue = $10.5 * 5 = $52.5
Year 6: Total cost = $105 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $108, Total revenue = $10.5 * 6 = $63

Since the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108) in year 6, we need to calculate for more years.

Year 7: Total cost = $108 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $111, Total revenue = $10.5 * 7 = $73.5
Year 8: Total cost = $111 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $114, Total revenue = $10.5 * 8 = $84
Year 9: Total cost = $114 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $117, Total revenue = $10.5 * 9 = $94.5
Year 10: Total cost = $117 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $120, Total revenue = $10.5 * 10 = $105
Year 11: Total cost = $120 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $123, Total revenue = $10.5 * 11 = $115.5
Year 12: Total cost = $123 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $126, Total revenue = $10.5 * 12 = $126

However, in year 12, the total revenue ($126) is still not more than the total cost ($126). We need to calculate for year 13.

Year 13: Total cost = $126 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $129, Total revenue = $10.5 * 13 = $136.5

In year 13, the total revenue ($136.5) is more than the total cost ($129). Therefore, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie starts with an unknown number of vacuum cleaners, which we'll call 'x'. She sells a third of them at the green house, which is x/3. Then, she sells 2 more to the red house. To find out how many vacuum cleaners are left after these two sales, we subtract the number sold from the original amount: x - x/3 - 2.

To simplify this, we can first find a common denominator for x and x/3, which is 3. So, we rewrite x as 3x/3. Now we have 3x/3 - x/3 - 2, which simplifies to 2x/3 - 2.

Next, Melanie sells half of what's left at the orange house. To find half of 2x/3 - 2, we divide by 2: (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1.

We know Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:
x/3 - 1 = 5

To solve for x, we add 1 to both sides:
x/3 = 6

Then we multiply both sides by 3:
x = 18

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We have a dance class with 20 students. First, 20% of them enrolled in contemporary dance. That's 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

Now, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left. Then, 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. That's 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

So, the number of students left for hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we'll divide the number of students in hip-hop by the total number of students and multiply by 100. That's (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. To help the merchant make the best choice, let's calculate the potential profit from each option.

If the merchant chooses the jewelry worth $5,000, and the market goes up by 2.5%, the increase in value would be:

On the other hand, if the merchant chooses the electronic gadgets worth $8,000, and the market rises by 1.2%, the increase in value would be:
$8,000 * 1.2% = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, the jewelry is the better option.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Jill's annual salary.

First, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching. She earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. She earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"Hey there, let's figure this out. Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, so she eats 3 eggs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week. 

Now, if we multiply the number of eggs she eats per week by the number of weeks, we get 21 * 4 = 84 eggs in 4 weeks.

To find the number of dozens of eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12. 
84 / 12 = 7.

"I'm trying to hike a 12-mile trail, and I want my average speed to be 4 miles per hour. I've already walked 6 miles - 4 miles in the first hour and 2 miles in the second hour. To find the speed I need to walk the remaining distance, I'll first calculate the total time I have to complete the trail.

Since my average speed should be 4 miles per hour, I can calculate the total time as follows:

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

I've already taken 2 hours to walk 6 miles, so I have 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

Time left = Total time - Time already taken
Time left = 3 hours - 2 hours
Time left = 1 hour

Now, I can find the speed I need to walk the remaining distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"I'd be happy to help you with that. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much water is in the orange drink. Since it's two-thirds water, we can calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters: 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 ≈ 6.67 liters. However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we're left with 9 liters. To find the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters, we can set up a proportion: (2/3) / 10 = x / 9. Solving for x, we get x = (2/3) * 9 = 6 liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink. It's three-fifths water, and we have 15 liters of it. So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

Now, we're told that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at which son was born
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Kyle bought a book for $19.50, which is 25% off the original price. To find the original price, we need to figure out what 100% of the price is.

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, he paid 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). We can set up an equation to represent this:

0.75x = 19.50

Here, 'x' is the original price of the book. To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75

First, we know the chicken meal costs $12, and she got 5 packs of milk for $3 each, which is 5 * $3 = $15. She also picked up 4 apples for $1.50 each, so that's 4 * $1.50 = $6. Adding all these up, we get $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, we subtract the cost of the other items from the total to find out how much she spent on pizza: $50 - $33 = $17.

Now, we know each box of pizza costs $8.50, so to find out how many boxes she got, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost per box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

- Distance remaining after the second stop: 15 miles
- Total distance: 60 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance between the first and second stops:

So, the more expensive pair of heels is 2 * $33 = $66. Now, let's add the cost of both pairs of heels: $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 more than the heels together, we add $5 to $99. That gives us the cost of the boots.

7x + 11x = 162

Combine the like terms:

18x = 162

Now, divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's current age = 11x
= 11(9)
= 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we simply add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10

"Let's break down the problem. We know Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. To solve this, I'll use a variable to represent the number of silver coins. Let's call it 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'.

Now, I'll set up an equation to represent the total number of coins. The sum of gold and silver coins is 110, so the equation is:
x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
Number of gold coins = x + 30

First, let's calculate how much he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

Adding the $5 he had left, we get a total of $160 + $5 = $165.

Now, let's calculate how much he made from selling his lego sets. We know he made $165 from selling some of his lego sets, but we also know he had 13 lego sets in total. If he sold all 13 lego sets for $15 each, he would have made 13 * 15 = $195.

Since he only made $165, that means he didn't sell all 13 lego sets. The amount he didn't make is $195 - $165 = $30.

Since each lego set is $15, the number of lego sets he didn't sell is $30 / $15 = 2.

So, John still has 2 lego sets.

"Hey there, let's break down John's running routine to figure out his speed. We know he runs 60 miles a week and does this over 3 days. His running time is 3 hours on the first day and half that time on the other two days, which is 1.5 hours each.

So, his total running time for the week is 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours, which equals 6 hours. Now, we can calculate his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down this problem step by step.

First, we know Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she skips at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. So, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Now, we're told Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. This means her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she can travel in 2 hours while running is 2 * 6 = 12 miles.
The distance she can travel in 4 hours while walking is 4 * 1.5 = 6 miles.

The total distance she can travel in 6 hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break this down step by step. We know Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's. That means Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Now, we're told Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, if Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"Hello there, I'm Larissa. Let's tackle this problem together. We have a brave warrior, Polly, who's determined to defeat the fierce dragon, Perg. To do so, she needs to throw the gold javelin, which can only be done effectively while holding the sapphire gemstone.

With the gemstone, Polly's throwing distance increases threefold. Initially, she could throw the javelin 400 feet. Now, she can throw it 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

The dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, so we need to find out how far outside of this range Polly can stand and still hit the dragon. To do this, we subtract the dragon's flame distance from Polly's throwing distance: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie: 5 x 8 = 40.

Now, we know that 14 pieces of pie were left over. To determine how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces: 40 - 14 = 26.

"Hey there, let's figure this out. So, you've got a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already had 1800 calories. That means you've got 200 calories left for the day.

Now, the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, and you want to know how many grams you can have. To do that, we need to find out how many servings you can have with 200 calories. 

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

The bag is 300g and has 5 servings, so each serving is 300g / 5 = 60g. 

Since you can have 0.8 servings, that's 60g * 0.8 = 48g.

The answer is: 48"
"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Charlie's candle-making business to find his net profit.

First, we need to determine how much it costs Charlie to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, he'll need 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Now, let's calculate Charlie's total revenue from selling the candles. He sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

To find Charlie's net profit, we subtract his total cost from his total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Meredith's writing schedule to find out how many hours she spent writing articles.

Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find out how many more articles she wrote, we'll calculate 2/5 of 5, which is (2/5) * 5 = 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Candice started with 80 post-it notes in her purse. Then, she bought a package of post-it notes, which we'll call x. So, the total number of post-it notes she had after buying the package is 80 + x.

At work, she used 220 post-it notes, leaving her with (80 + x) - 220 post-it notes. We know that she had 23 post-it notes remaining, so we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Now, let's solve for x. First, we'll simplify the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

So, the package of post-it notes that Candice purchased contained 163 notes.

The final answer is: 163"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, so he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

Now, let's calculate the cost of a red tie. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the price of a blue tie. So, a red tie costs 1.5 * 40 = $60.

The total amount spent on red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

To find the total amount spent on ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. Tracy has a 4-foot wire that she wants to cut into 6-inch pieces. To figure out how many pieces she'll get, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches.

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can multiply 4 feet by 12 to get the total length in inches. That gives us 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find out how many pieces Tracy will get. 

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem. We have an apartment building with 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. We're also told that 3/4 of the building is occupied.

First, we need to find the total number of units in the building. To do that, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor: 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Next, we need to find the number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4: 120 * (3/4) = 90 units.

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30 units.

First, we need to figure out how many dozens of eggs his chickens produce daily. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we'll divide the total number of eggs by 12:
252 eggs ÷ 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozen eggs per day

Now, let's calculate Lloyd's daily earnings. He sells each dozen for $2, so we'll multiply the number of dozen eggs by the price per dozen:
21 dozen eggs per day × $2 per dozen = $42 per day

To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we'll multiply his daily earnings by 7:
$42 per day × 7 days per week = $294 per week

"To find the time it takes Tom to get back, we first need to determine the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since his ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, and he sailed for 3 hours, the distance can be calculated as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we can use the distance to find the time it takes him to get back at 6 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's tackle this problem together.

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. He's already decided to remove 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. To find out how much weight he's removed so far, we multiply the number of comic books by their weight: 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah still needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight: 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. This is the weight he needs to remove from his toys.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. On Thursday, 6 truck tires and 4 car tires were repaired. To find the total revenue for Thursday, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately.

The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, 12 car tires were repaired, and no truck tires were repaired. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.

Now, let's compare the revenue for both days. Thursday's revenue is $520, and Friday's revenue is $480. Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue.

To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to subtract Friday's revenue from Thursday's revenue. The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

Marcy is entitled to a full annual pension of $50,000 after working for 40 years. However, she becomes eligible for a percentage of the pension after 20 years of service. The percentage increases by 5% each year.

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she has worked 10 years (30 - 20 = 10) at the increased rate. To find the percentage of the full pension she's entitled to, we multiply the number of years by the annual increase rate.

10 years * 5% per year = 50%

Now, we can calculate Marcy's annual pension by taking 50% of the full pension.

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charges her 10% less. To find the discounted monthly cost, we calculate 10% of $140, which is 0.1 * 140 = $14. Then, we subtract the discount from the original monthly cost: 140 - 14 = $126. Since the second half of the year is also 6 months, we multiply the discounted monthly cost by the number of months: 126 * 6 = $756.

We know Sophia's car has a 12-gallon tank, and she recently drove 100 miles before needing to fill up with 4 gallons of gas. To determine how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg).

First, let's find out how many miles Sophia gets per gallon. We can do this by dividing the distance she traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used (4 gallons).

mpg = Total miles / Total gallons used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know Sophia's car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can multiply this by the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons) to find the total miles she can drive on a single tank.

The top level is 16, the second level is twice that, so it's 32. The third level is twice the second level, which is 64. And the fourth level is twice the third level, which is 128.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240. To find the average, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels, which is 4. So, the average square footage of a level is 240 / 4 = 60.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. To find the total amount of dog food consumed during this period, we multiply the number of days by the amount of food per day:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

After the first 180 days, the puppy will need 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of the year. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day for:
365 days - 180 days = 185 days

Now, let's calculate the total amount of dog food consumed during this period:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

To find the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year, we add the amounts from both periods:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can find the number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year by dividing the total amount of dog food by the amount per bag:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

First, we need to determine which package is the better deal. We have two options: a package of 3 flowers for $2.50 or a package of 2 flowers for $1. To compare the prices, we'll calculate the cost per flower for each package.

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 ÷ 3 = $0.833 per flower. For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 ÷ 2 = $0.50 per flower. Clearly, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better deal.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. Since each package contains 2 flowers, Vincent will need 18 ÷ 2 = 9 packages. The total cost will be 9 packages × $1 per package = $9.

If Vincent were to buy 18 flowers at the other price, he would need 18 ÷ 3 = 6 packages. The total cost would be 6 packages × $2.50 per package = $15.

The amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is $15 - $9 = $6.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. So, let's calculate the cost of the dog grooming after the discount. The original price is $100, and the groomer is offering a 30% discount for new customers.

To find the discount amount, I'll multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $100 * 0.3 = $30. Now, I'll subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price: $100 - $30 = $70.

The final cost of the grooming is $70."
"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. To find out how much each girl got, we need to divide 24 by 6, which is 4 liters per girl. Since there are two girls, they got a total of 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

Now, a boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken is 8 (girls) + 6 (boy) = 14 liters.

We started with 24 liters of water. To find out how much is left, we subtract the amount taken from the total: 24 - 14 = 10 liters.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Charlie's sticker situation. He started with 10 stickers, then bought 21 more and received 23 for his birthday. To find the total number of stickers he had, we add those together: 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers.

After that, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 to decorate a greeting card. So, the total number of stickers he gave away and used is 9 + 28 = 37 stickers.

Now, let's subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used from the total number of stickers he had: 54 - 37 = 17 stickers.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's figure out the combined weight of Grace and Alex. 

First, we need to find out how much Alex weighs. We know Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Since Grace weighs 125 pounds, we multiply that by 4: 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. Then, we subtract 2 pounds from that to get Alex's weight: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, we add their weights together to find their combined weight: 125 (Grace's weight) + 498 (Alex's weight) = 623 pounds.

623"
"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's calculate the total number of thorns on Dan's rose bushes.

First, we need to find the total number of roses. Since Dan has 3 rose bushes and each bush has 25 roses, we multiply the number of bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75 roses.

Now, we know that each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600.

So, there are 600 thorns in total."
"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know the football team played 22 games in total. They also won 8 more games than they lost. To find out how many games they won, we can use a simple equation.

Let's say the number of games they lost is 'x'. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is 'x + 8'. The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and lost, which is 22. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Since the team won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is:
x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

"I'd be happy to help Gene figure out how many quilt blocks he has. To do this, we need to calculate the total number of vacations he's been on.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old, and he's now 34. So, he's been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of vacations is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Each of these vacations corresponds to a quilt block, so Gene has a total of 44 quilt blocks.

"Hey there, let's break down the alarm situation. The alarm rings three times a day, and we know how long it rang each time. 

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times. The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 times. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, which is 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. After 5 years, the company increases her salary by 10% of the initial amount. To find the increase, we multiply the initial salary by 0.10.

$600 * 0.10 = $60

Now, we add the increase to the initial salary to get the new monthly salary.

$600 + $60 = $660

Since Sylvie's salary increase is only given once after 5 years, her monthly salary will remain $660 for the next three years. To find her annual salary, we multiply the monthly salary by 12.

$660 * 12 = $7920

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $7920."
"Let's break down the problem. We know Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x', then Marilyn sold 10x copies.

Since they sold 88,000 copies combined, we can set up the equation:
x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Christina's gift bag situation. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of guests that will actually show up. 

Number of guests that will show up = Total number of guests - (1/4 * Total number of guests)
= 16 - (1/4 * 16)
= 16 - 4
= 12

Now, Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, so the total number of gift bags she needs is:

Total gift bags = 0.75 * Number of guests that will show up
= 0.75 * 12
= 9

The cost of the gift bags is $2 each, so the total cost will be:

Total cost = Total gift bags * Cost per gift bag
= 9 * 2
= 18

"Oh my, Ted the T-Rex wants to make sure he has enough potato salad for the dinosaur picnic. Let's see... adults eat 10 pounds of potato salad each, and there are 20 adults, so that's 20 * 10 = 200 pounds. 

Now, the kids will eat half as much as the adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 pounds each. There are 5 kids, so that's 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for the adults and the kids: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

"Hey there, let's figure out how many pets Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have in total. 

We know Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, which means Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, let's add up the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

"Hey there, let's figure out Jackson's age. We know James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Now, since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Given that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age. So, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Jackson's age is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he's 2 seconds faster than Gerald's original time. So, to find Gerald's original time, we add 2 seconds to Lee's time.

Gerald's original time = Lee's time + 2 seconds
Gerald's original time = 38 + 2
Gerald's original time = 40 seconds

Now, Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means his new time will be 90% of his original time. To find 90% of his original time, we multiply by 0.9.

Gerald's new time = 0.9 * Gerald's original time
Gerald's new time = 0.9 * 40
Gerald's new time = 36 seconds

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know there are 60 dogs in the neighborhood, and for every dog, there are two cats. So, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

Now, let's find the combined number of pet dogs and cats. That's 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

The problem states that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats: 168 (rabbits) + 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 348.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 200 Grade 5 students, and 2/5 of them are boys. To find the number of boys, we multiply 200 by 2/5.

Number of boys = 200 * (2/5) = 80

Now, let's find the number of girls. Since the total number of students is 200, and 80 are boys, the number of girls is:

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find this number, we multiply the number of girls by 2/3.

Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 * (2/3) = 80

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

First, we need to find out how many hours James slept. Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate James' sleep hours by multiplying 9 by 2/3.

James' sleep hours = (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, let's find the difference between the hours Harry slept and the hours James slept.

Difference = Harry's sleep hours - James' sleep hours
= 9 hours - 6 hours

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. Mary has a lovely collection of potted plants, and we need to figure out how many she'll have left after giving some away.

First, let's calculate the total number of plants Mary has. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges in her home, which gives us 2 * 40 = 80 plants. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants, so we add those to the mix: 80 + 18 = 98 plants.

Now, Mary has decided to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges. That's a total of 40 plants she'll be giving away. To find out how many plants she'll have left, we subtract the number of plants she's giving away from the total: 98 - 40 = 58.

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we subtract that from the total pages. 
Remaining pages = Total pages - 15 
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 
Remaining pages = 24 

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read per day to finish the remaining pages in 4 days.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down John's water-drinking habits. He has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed, which is a total of 4 glasses per day. Since he does this every weekday, that's 4 glasses * 5 weekdays = 20 glasses of water.

On weekends, John likes to relax and have a soda with dinner instead of water. So, he has 3 glasses of water per day on weekends (breakfast, lunch, and before bed). With 2 weekend days, that's 3 glasses * 2 days = 6 glasses of water.

Now, we subtract the pieces Poppy placed from the total number of pieces to find out how many are left: 1000 - 250 = 750.

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. We calculate this by multiplying 750 by 1/3, which equals 250 pieces.

To find the total number of pieces placed, we add the pieces placed by Poppy and her mom: 250 + 250 = 500.

Length (L) = 5 - 1 - 1 = 3 inches
Width (W) = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4 inches
Height (H) = 4 - 1 - 1 = 2 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 
Inner volume of each box = L * W * H = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume:

"Hey there, let's break down Frankie's TV-watching schedule. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours.

Adding those up, we get 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours of TV watched on those four days. Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, that means he watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours on Wednesday.

Now, we know each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, so we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is 90 minutes. To find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes per episode, which gives us 3 episodes.

"I'd be happy to help you out with that cookie conundrum. Let's get started.

We know Henry wants to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. If we let x be the number of cookies he baked last year, then he meant to bake 2x cookies this year. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

Unfortunately, Henry had a bit of a mishap and dropped 5 cookies while putting them out to cool. This means he's left with (2x + 15) - 5 cookies, which simplifies to 2x + 10 cookies.

We're told that this number is equal to 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"Oh no, poor Julia. Let's see if we can figure out how much water her boat took on. 

First, we need to find out how far Julia rowed to reach the shore. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can find out how many feet she rows per second by dividing 20 feet by 16 seconds.

20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second

Since the shore was 64 seconds away, we can multiply the time by the speed to find the total distance.

1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Now we know Julia rowed 80 feet to reach the shore. The boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, so we can divide the total distance by 10 to find the number of 10-foot intervals.

80 feet / 10 feet = 8 intervals

Since the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can multiply the number of intervals by 2 to find the total amount of water.

Brittany's phone = 300

Now, we're told that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds as x.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Sasha's lumber sales to figure out her profit.

First, we need to calculate the total cost price of the lumber. Sasha has 10 (2 x 4 x 10) boards that cost her $10 each, so that's 10 * $10 = $100. She also has 5 (4 x 4 x 10) boards that cost her $16 each, which is 5 * $16 = $80. Adding these together, we get a total cost price of $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, since the prices have gone up by 50%, Sasha can sell the lumber for 150% of the original price. For the 10 (2 x 4 x 10) boards, that's 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150. For the 5 (4 x 4 x 10) boards, that's 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120. So, the total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost price from the total selling price: $270 - $180 = $90.

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper. To find out how many sheets he uses in a week, we multiply the number of pads by the number of sheets per pad:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so she has a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.

Now, let's look at what Kael brought. He brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, Kael has a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of fruits Morisette and Kael have: 13 (Morisette) + 14 (Kael) = 27.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Sadie's sleep schedule for the week.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less, so that's 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. She did this for Tuesday and Wednesday, so that's a total of 6 + 6 = 12 hours for those two days.

For the rest of the week, which is Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday. So, that's 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. Since there are 4 days, that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours for the entire week: 8 hours on Monday, 12 hours for Tuesday and Wednesday, and 28 hours for the rest of the week. That's a total of 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Rosie's running scenario. We know she can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, and then she switches to 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she covers in the first 3 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

After that, Rosie has 7 - 3 = 4 hours left. In these 4 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. So, the distance she covers in the next 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

Jennie starts with 60 letters that need stamps, and she puts stamps on one-third of them. To find out how many letters she stamps, we need to divide 60 by 3.

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, Jennie stamps 20 letters. Now, the pile of already-stamped letters has 30 letters in it. To find out how many letters were in that pile initially, we need to subtract the number of letters Jennie stamped from the total number of already-stamped letters.

To find out how many spoons Julia had before her husband gave her the 5 new spoons, we subtract 5 from the total number of spoons: 
12 - 5 = 7

However, we also know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, to find out how many spoons Julia had before she used those 3 spoons, we add 3 to the 7 spoons: 
7 + 3 = 10

Therefore, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

The number of fish sausages is 6 more than the number of chicken sausages, so we add 6 to 38. That gives us 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages to find the total number of sausages. So, 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the price of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Now, we're told that an orange costs $5 less than a watermelon. So, the price of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Dillon needs to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. Let's calculate the total cost:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

Adding up the costs, we get $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total time spent by the doctors in minutes. With 500 patients and an average of 24 minutes per patient, that's a total of 500 * 24 = 12,000 minutes.

Now, let's convert those minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 12,000 by 60 to get 200 hours.

The hospital pays the doctors $150 per hour, so the total cost of the doctors is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

On the other hand, the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour. With 200 hours of patient visits, that's a total revenue of 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

So, Walt's total mileage for Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Given that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, we can find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday by subtracting the total mileage for Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday:

And, she added 2 cookies for $1.00 each, so that's 2 x $1.00 = $2.00. The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee. To do that, we multiply the total cost by 0.20, which gives us 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00. Now, we add the delivery fee to the total cost: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Mark took two tests, one with 75 questions and the other with 100 questions. He completed the tests at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions. To find out how many questions he completed, we multiply the number of hours by the rate: 8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions. Again, we multiply the number of hours by the rate: 6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions.

Now, let's add up the questions Mark completed: 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

The total number of questions in both tests is 75 + 100 = 175 questions.

To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we subtract the number of questions he completed from the total: 175 - 70 = 105 questions.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into the problem. We have a hive with 700 bees, and we know the ratio of queens to baby bees to worker bees. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, and twice as many worker bees as baby bees.

Let's use variables to represent the number of each type of bee. We'll call the number of queens Q, the number of baby bees B, and the number of worker bees W.

Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, we can write B = 2Q. And since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, we can write W = 2B.

We also know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation Q + B + W = 700.

Now, let's substitute B = 2Q and W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q into the equation. This gives us Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms, and we get 7Q = 700. Divide by 7, and we find Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W. B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, and W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

2 bottles of bleach = 2 * $2 = $4
1 pack of cloths = $5

Now, let's calculate the total number of bees that left the hive and hadn't returned yet. We start with the initial 30, subtract the 15 that returned, and then add the 60 that left in the next 6 hours. That gives us 30 - 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

Dorothy's friends = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook. Now, we're told James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. To find James' friends, we multiply Dorothy's friends by 4:

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home. Steve bikes at 440 feet per minute, so his time is 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes. Tim skateboards at 264 feet per minute, so his time is 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time.

Next, three pigeons come along and each eat 3 fries, so that's 9 fries total. We're down to x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 fries.

Adding these up, Kimo spends 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours per week attending classes. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we multiply the hours per week by the number of weeks: 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.

Next, we calculate the cost of the notebooks. Each notebook costs $4, and he bought 2, so the total cost of the notebooks is 2 x $4 = $8.

Lastly, we add the cost of the rim of bond paper, which is $20.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into the problem. Finn initially sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 more come out of hiding from under a lily pad, so we add those to the initial count: 11 + 6 = 17.

However, 2 of them hide under a rock, so we subtract those from the total: 17 - 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the tank's initial water depth on Monday is 17 feet. Then, on Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water. To find the depth on Tuesday, we simply add 7 feet to the initial depth:
17 + 7 = 24 feet

Now, we're told that on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply the depth on Tuesday by 2/3:
(2/3) * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16 feet

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem and find out how many fish Anakin and Locsin caught.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Now, let's see what Locsin caught. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so that's 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. And, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the number of fish each of them caught. Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish. To find the total number of fish they caught, we add their individual catches: 19 + 13 = 32.

"To calculate the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to consider the price increase every 2 months. The initial price is $20, and the price increases by 20% of the original price every 2 months.

Let's break it down:

- After 2 months, the price increase is 20% of $20, which is $4. So, the new price is $20 + $4 = $24.
- After 4 months, the price increase is 20% of $24, which is $4.80. So, the new price is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.
- We can continue this pattern to find the price after 36 months.

However, a more efficient way to solve this problem is to recognize that the price increase is a geometric progression. The price after each 2-month period can be calculated by multiplying the previous price by 1.20 (1 + 0.20).

Since there are 18 two-month periods in 36 months, we can calculate the price after 36 months as follows:

$20 * (1.20)^18 ≈ $532.39

$532.39"
"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 5 red cars, and each one costs $4. So, the total cost of the red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.

Next, we have 3 action figures, and each one costs $5. So, the total cost of the action figures is 3 x $5 = $15.

Now, the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which is $15.

To find the total cost of all the toys, we add up the cost of the red cars, action figures, and the doll: $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help Jackie with her tax dilemma. Let's break it down. If Jackie does her taxes herself, she'll miss out on 3 hours of freelance work, which means she'll lose $35 per hour for those 3 hours. That's a total of 3 * $35 = $105 in missed income.

On the other hand, if she hires an accountant, she'll have to pay $90.

To find out how much more money she'll have if she hires the accountant, we need to subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the cost of doing the taxes herself. That's $105 - $90 = $15.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Elvira's shopping spree to see how much she'll have left for a new garment.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories. The computer with a screen, keyboard, and mouse costs €1090. Adding the scanner (€157), CD burner (€74), and printer (€102) to that, we get:

€1090 + €157 = €1247
€1247 + €74 = €1321
€1321 + €102 = €1423

So, the total cost of the computer and accessories is €1423. Now, let's subtract that from Elvira's budget of €1500:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. Sandra needs 3 eggs to make a Spanish flan, and she has to make 15 of them. To find out the total number of eggs she needs, we multiply the number of eggs per flan by the number of flans: 3 eggs/flan * 15 flans = 45 eggs.

Now, we know Sandra gets 9 eggs every time she babysits. To determine how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs she needs by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job: 45 eggs / 9 eggs/job = 5 jobs.

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"Let's break down the problem. We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke. I'll use 'x' to represent Brooke's current age. That makes Seth's current age 2x.

In 2 years, Brooke will be x + 2 years old, and Seth will be 2x + 2 years old. The problem tells us that in 2 years, their combined ages will be 28. So, I can set up the equation: (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28.

Now, let's simplify that equation. Combining like terms, I get 3x + 4 = 28. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives me 3x = 24. Dividing both sides by 3, I find x = 8.

Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

The final answer is: 16"

So, Jimmy has $18."
"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Pancho's walking routine to figure out how many miles he walks in a week.

Pancho walks 20 miles a day on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. So, that's:
5 weekdays * 20 miles/day = 100 miles

On weekends, he walks 10 miles a day, and there are 2 weekend days. That's:
2 weekend days * 10 miles/day = 20 miles

Now, let's add those miles together to get the total miles walked in a week:
100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out with the marching band's uniform costs.

So, let's break it down. The hat costs $25, which is a given. The jacket is a bit pricier, costing three times as much as the hat. That's 3 * $25 = $75. Now, the pants are a bit tricky - they cost the average of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the two costs and divide by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now that we have all the costs, let's add them up to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, which makes her 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up their ages: 
8 (Sally Four) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Jessica's debt payments.

First, we need to calculate the total minimum payment. Jessica's student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. 

Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we calculate the increase:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, we add the increase to the minimum payment:
$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get down to business and figure out how long it'll take Billy to prep those potatoes.

First, we need to calculate the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut one potato. It takes him 1 minute and 30 seconds to peel a potato, and 5 seconds to cut it. To make the math easier, let's convert everything to seconds: 1 minute 30 seconds is 90 seconds, and 5 seconds is, well, 5 seconds.

So, the total time per potato is 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds. Now, let's convert this back to minutes: 95 seconds is equal to 95/60 = 1.5833 minutes.

Since Billy has 60 potatoes to prep, we multiply the time per potato by 60: 1.5833 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 95 minutes.

The final answer is: 95"
"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Juan and Carlos are selling lemonade, and we need to find out how much they spent on lemons. We know that for each gallon, it costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.

First, let's calculate the revenue per gallon. Since they sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 each, the revenue per gallon is:
20 glasses * $0.50 per glass = $10 per gallon

Now, let's calculate the cost per gallon:
Cost per gallon = $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5 per gallon

The profit per gallon is the difference between the revenue and the cost:
Profit per gallon = Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5 per gallon

We know that Juan and Carlos made a total profit of $25. To find out how many gallons they made, we can divide the total profit by the profit per gallon:
Total number of gallons = Total profit / Profit per gallon = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

Finally, we can calculate the total amount they spent on lemons:
Total cost of lemons = Total number of gallons * Cost of lemons per gallon = 5 * $3 = $15

Now, we know that 60 of the Chinese participants are boys. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Total Chinese - Boys on the Chinese team

"Let's break down Zaid's expenses and donations to find out how much money he'll have left.

First, we need to calculate how much he spends on rent and car fuel. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500. He spends 1/3 on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000.

So far, he's spent 1500 + 2000 = 3500. To find the remaining amount, we subtract this from his total salary: 6000 - 3500 = 2500.

Next, he donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250. After the donation, he's left with 2500 - 1250 = 1250.

Finally, he gives his daughter 200 and his wife 700, for a total of 200 + 700 = 900. Subtracting this from the remaining amount, we get 1250 - 900 = 350.

200 / 5 = 40

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Now, we know she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. To find the number of red roses, we can multiply the number of white carnations by 4.

"Hey there, let's break down this track relay problem. We have two teams competing in a 4 by 400 meter relay. One team is super consistent, with each member running their 400 meter leg in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is a bit more unpredictable, with their first runner taking 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner being 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

To figure out how much time the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time for each team. For the consistent team, it's easy: 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds.

For the less consistent team, we have 60 seconds for the first runner, 57 seconds for the second (3 seconds faster), 54 seconds for the third (3 seconds faster again), and 51 seconds for the fourth (you guessed it, 3 seconds faster once more). So, their total time is: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Now, let's find the difference: 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jerry is rolling a six-sided die, and we want to find out how much more likely it is that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die: 4, 5, and 6. So, the probability is 3 out of 6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number is 3 out of 6, which is also 1/2 or 0.5. Since the die is rolled twice, we multiply the probabilities together: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

Now, let's find the difference between the two probabilities: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and the hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can find the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by subtracting the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and the hamsters. This is 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15. There are 3 cages of rats, so the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

Next, we need to find the profit per bag. The selling price per bag is $30, so the profit per bag is $30 - $22 = $8.

We know that the trader made a total profit of $400. To find the number of bags sold, we can divide the total profit by the profit per bag:
$400 ÷ $8 = 50

Next, they went on 2 different rides which cost $33 for each ride. The total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Tom starts with 50 trees and has a net gain of 8 trees per year, since he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. To find the total number of trees after 10 years, we need to calculate the net gain over this period.

The net gain per year is 10 (trees planted) - 2 (trees chopped down) = 8 trees per year. Over 10 years, the net gain is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Adding this to the initial 50 trees, Tom has 50 + 80 = 130 trees after 10 years.

However, 30% of the trees die, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees. To find the number of trees Tom has left, we subtract the number of trees that died from the total.

So, Tom has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now that we know the cost of one pen, we can find the cost of 8 pens by multiplying the cost of one pen by 8.

In the third month, Elaine collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. That's 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we add the cards she collected each month to her initial number of cards:

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails every afternoon. To find the total number of pails he gets in a day, we simply add the morning and afternoon pails:
5 pails (morning) + 6 pails (afternoon) = 11 pails

Now, we know each pail contains 5 liters of water. To find the total liters of water, we multiply the total pails by the liters per pail:
11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters

"Hey there, let's break down John's award and its impact on his yearly earnings. He gets a one-time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise in salary. His original weekly salary is $2000, and he works every week of the year.

First, let's calculate his original yearly earnings:

$2000 per week * 52 weeks = $104,000 per year

Now, let's calculate the 5% raise:

$2000 per week * 0.05 = $100 per week increase

So, his new weekly salary is:

$2000 per week + $100 per week = $2100 per week

His new yearly earnings would be:

$2100 per week * 52 weeks = $109,200 per year

Finally, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his new yearly earnings:

$109,200 per year + $5000 = $114,200

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Josie's farm is 10 acres, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. To find the total tons of grapes produced, we multiply the number of acres by the tons per acre:
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Now, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. To find the total barrels of wine produced, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the barrels per ton:
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Carl's cheese usage for the week.

Carl had a sandwich for lunch every day, and since there are 7 days in a week, that's 7 sandwiches. He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, so that's 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl had cheese and egg omelets for 3 days. He used one more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich, which means he used 3 slices of cheese per omelet. So, that's 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Lastly, Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese for dinner, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up all the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (dinner) = 31 slices.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's calculate the total number of pens Janet has now.

First, we'll add the number of green and yellow pens Janet initially had: 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Next, we'll find out how many blue pens she bought. Since there were 9 pens in each bag and she bought 6 bags, she got 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

Then, we'll calculate the number of red pens she bought. With 6 pens in each bag and 2 bags purchased, she got 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the blue and red pens: 54 + 12 = 66 pens.

Finally, we'll add the initial number of pens to the pens she bought: 32 + 66 = 98.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into Brinley's math problem. Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, and Brinley wants to achieve an average of 93. She already has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first five tests.

To find the required score on the sixth test, we need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score. Since there are 6 tests and she can remove the lowest score, she needs to have a total of 5 scores that average to 93. 

The total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 5 = 465.

Now, let's find the total score of Brinley's first 5 tests: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since the lowest score (71) will be removed, we subtract it from the total score of the first 5 tests:
438 - 71 = 367.

Now, we add the total score required (465) and subtract the total score of the remaining 4 tests (367) to find the required score on the 6th test:
465 - 367 = 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Micheal's bike riding adventure to find out how many kilometers he rode in total.

First, Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week, covering 25 kilometers each time. He did this for 4 weeks. To calculate the total kilometers for this period, we multiply the number of times he rode his bike (5 times/week * 4 weeks = 20 times) by the distance he covered each time (25 kilometers). This gives us 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

Next, Micheal changed his routine and rode his bike only 2 times a week, but for a longer distance of 60 kilometers each time. He did this for 3 weeks. To calculate the total kilometers for this period, we multiply the number of times he rode his bike (2 times/week * 3 weeks = 6 times) by the distance he covered each time (60 kilometers). This gives us 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Now, let's add the kilometers from both periods to find the total distance Micheal rode: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. We need to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, which contains 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. So, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Now, we're told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. This means that each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar, which is 40g / 2 = 20g.

The total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we simply add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

On Tuesday, she went to a different store and bought three times that number of cakes. So, she bought 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she did on Tuesday. That's 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add up all the cakes: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since half a dozen is 6, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this amount. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since 1 dozen is 12, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost by the number of cups: $34800 / 240 = $145.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Sara's situation to figure out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford that new jacket and shoes.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. Adding the cost of the jacket, we get $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved up before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she's done that 4 times. So, she's earned 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's add up the money Sara has so far: $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, Sara still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4).

$40 / $4 = 10

"Hey there, let's get cracking on this problem. We've got Jerry and his flock of chickens, and we need to figure out how many red chickens he's got.

We know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. We also know that he's got two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's use some variables to represent the number of red and white chickens. I'll use 'r' for the number of red chickens and 'w' for the number of white chickens. Since Jerry's got two more white chickens than red chickens, we can say that w = r + 2.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the total number of eggs collected per day. We know that 3r + 5w = 42.

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42. Expanding this, we get 3r + 5r + 10 = 42.

Combining like terms, we get 8r + 10 = 42. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us 8r = 32. Dividing both sides by 8, we find that r = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, we've got a rectangular park with a length of 6 miles and a width of 1.5 miles. To find the time Gary spends walking around the edge, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). Plugging in the values, we get:
Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time he spends walking, we divide the perimeter by his speed:
Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means there were 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

To find the total number of customers on the first two days, we add the customers from both days: 100 + 150 = 250.

Now, we're told that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we subtract the total customers from the first two days from the total: 500 - 250 = 250.

"Let's dive into this problem. We have two pools, both leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. We're given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, and now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water, it had 2x gallons at that time.

In 4 minutes, both pools lost 16 gallons of water (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes). So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

We know that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides, we get:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 24

So, the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

24 - 16 = 8

$320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

Now, let's divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage of $8.00 to find out how many hours she needs to work:

"Hey there, let's break down Janeth's situation. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. To find the total amount she needs to pay back, we'll calculate the additional 10% first. That's 0.1 * $2000 = $200. So, the total amount she needs to pay back is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, let's see how much she'll pay in 12 months. She's paying $165 a month, so in 12 months, she'll pay $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find Janeth's remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she'll pay from the total amount she needs to pay back: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Harriet is 21 years old, and she's half the age of Zack. To find Zack's age, we multiply Harriet's age by 2. So, Zack is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Now, we're told Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. To find Adrian's age, we multiply Harriet's age by 3. So, Adrian is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that four students scored a total of 251 points in a board game. Naomi scored 68 of those points. Now, let's find out how many points Yuri scored. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Adding 10 to that, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Next, let's calculate Brianna's points. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. Let's add these points to find out how many points they scored in total: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's solve this problem together.

We have a water tank that initially contains 120 liters of water. Celine uses 90 liters to water her garden, so we need to find out how much water is left in the tank.

Water left = Initial water - Water used
Water left = 120 - 90
Water left = 30 liters

Now, Celine collects rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. Let's calculate the amount of rainwater collected.

Rainwater collected = 2 * Water left
Rainwater collected = 2 * 30
Rainwater collected = 60 liters

Finally, we need to find the total amount of water in the tank now. We add the water left and the rainwater collected.

Total water now = Water left + Rainwater collected
Total water now = 30 + 60
Total water now = 90 liters

To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the number of days for the trip to Rochester by bus and the number of days for the return trip by car. The trip to Rochester by bus takes 6 days. Since driving takes half as many days, the return trip will take 6 / 2 = 3 days.

So, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 6 (to Rochester by bus) + 3 (return by car) = 9 days.

"Hey there, let's get to calculating the percentage chance of picking a water type card from James' collection.

First, we need to know how many cards he has in total and how many of those are water type. James initially had 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

He also bought 14 more grass type cards, so now he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

New total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

Now, let's find the probability of picking a water type card. It's the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards.
Probability = 32 / 96 ≈ 0.3333

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100.
Percentage chance = 0.3333 * 100 ≈ 33.33%

6 tomatoes/day (Steve) + 3 tomatoes/day (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes/day

Now, let's calculate their combined weekly consumption:

9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week

We know that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide their combined weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine:

"Hello there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into the problem.

Ram buys 25 pens and uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low. He can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we'll consider the initial pens and the pens he makes from the empty ones.

Initially, Ram has 25 pens.

When the ink runs low in these 25 pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

Now, he has 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens.

We can see a pattern emerging. Each time the ink runs low, Ram can make new pens from the empty ones. Let's calculate the total number of pens he can make.

We can represent the number of pens Ram has after each refill as a geometric series:

25 + 25/5 + 25/5^2 + 25/5^3 + ...

This is an infinite geometric series with the first term a = 25 and the common ratio r = 1/5.

The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula:

S = a / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term, and r is the common ratio.

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 25 / (1 - 1/5)
S = 25 / (4/5)
S = 25 * 5/4
S = 125/4
S = 31.25

However, we can't have a fraction of a pen, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

But we can't stop here. We need to find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, including the initial pens and the pens he makes from the empty ones.

Let's calculate the total number of pens:

Total pens = Initial pens + Pens made from empty ones
= 25 + (25/5 + 25/5^2 + 25/5^3 + ...)
= 25 + (5 + 5/5 + 5/5^2 + 5/5^3 + ...)
= 25 + 5 * (1 + 1/5 + 1/5^2 + 1/5^3 + ...)
= 25 + 5 * (1 / (1 - 1/5))
= 25 + 5 * (1 / (4/5))
= 25 + 5 * (5/4)
= 25 + 25/4
= 25 + 6.25
= 31.25

Again, we can't have a fraction of a pen, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

However, we can see that the series is infinite, and Ram can keep making new pens from the empty ones. To find the total number of pens, we can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series.

Let's calculate the total number of pens:

Total pens = Initial pens + Pens made from empty ones
= 25 + (25/5 + 25/5^2 + 25/5^3 + ...)
= 25 + 25 * (1/5 + 1/5^2 + 1/5^3 + ...)
= 25 + 25 * (1/5) / (1 - 1/5)
= 25 + 25 * (1/5) / (4/5)
= 25 + 25 * (1/4)
= 25 + 6.25
= 31.25

We can see that the total number of pens Ram gets to have is not a finite number. However, we can calculate the number of pens he can make in a given number of refills.

Let's calculate the number of pens Ram can make in 10 refills:

Total pens = Initial pens + Pens made from empty ones
= 25 + (25/5 + 25/5^2 + 25/5^3 + ... + 25/5^10)
= 25 + 25 * (1/5 + 1/5^2 + 1/5^3 + ... + 1/5^10)
= 25 + 25 * (1 - (1/5)^11) / (1 - 1/5)
= 25 + 25 * (1 - (1/5)^11) / (4/5)
= 25 + 25 * (1 - (1/5)^11) * (5/4)
= 25 + 25 * (1 - 1/48828125) * (5/4)
= 25 + 25 * (48828124/48828125) * (5/4)
= 25 + 25 * 48828124/48828125 * 5/4
= 25 + 15257031/48828125 * 5
= 25 + 15257031/9765625
= 25 + 15.625
= 40.625

We can see that the number of pens Ram can make in 10 refills is approximately 40.625.

However, we can't stop here. We need to find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, including the initial pens and the pens he makes from the empty ones.

Let's calculate the total number of pens:

Total pens = Initial pens + Pens made from empty ones
= 25 + (25/5 + 25/5^2 + 25/5^3 + ... + 25/5^10)
= 25 + 25 * (1/5 + 1/5^2 + 1/5^3 + ... + 1/5^10)
= 25 + 25 * (1 - (1/5)^11) / (1 - 1/5)
= 25 + 25 * (1 - (1/5)^11) / (4/5)
= 25 + 25 * (1 - (1/5)^11) * (5/4)
= 25 + 25 * (48828124/48828125) * (5/4)
= 25 + 15257031/48828125 * 5
= 25 + 15257031/9765625
= 25 + 15.625
= 40.625

We can see that the total number of pens Ram gets to have is approximately 40.625.

However, we can't have a fraction of a pen, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

The total number of pens Ram gets to have is approximately 40.

= 25 + 25 * (1/4)

= 31.25

We can see that the total number of pens Ram gets to have is not a finite number. However, we can calculate the number of pens he can make in a given number of refills.

"Hey there, let's break down Johnny's situation. He started with a $20 allowance and added $10 to it, so he had $20 + $10 = $30 to invest.

Since his investment tripled in a year, we can find the final amount by multiplying $30 by 3.

$30 * 3 = $90

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Jessa is 20 years old. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age: 20 + 5 = 25.

Now, we're told Mary is two years younger than Joan. To find Mary's age, we subtract 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23.

Finally, we need to find the sum of their ages. Let's add them up: 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68.

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to calculate the number of students who went out through exits A and B first.

First, let's find out how many students went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students left through exit A, we can calculate this as 0.3 * 1000, which equals 300 students.

Now, we subtract the number of students who left through exit A from the total number of students to find out how many students are remaining. This is 1000 - 300, which equals 700 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students left through exit B. We know that 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, so we can calculate this as (3/5) * 700, which equals 420 students.

Now, we subtract the number of students who left through exit B from the remaining students to find out how many students are left. This is 700 - 420, which equals 280 students.

Since the rest of the students left through exit C, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

"Let's break this down step by step. We know John has 54 candies, and he has twice as many candies as Robert. To find out how many candies Robert has, we'll divide John's candies by 2. So, Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

Now, we're told James has 6 more candies than Robert. To find James' total, we'll add 6 to Robert's candies. James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

The question asks how many more candies John has than James. To find this out, we'll subtract James' candies from John's candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

Dolly will read her 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so that's 3 books for Dolly.

Pandora will read her 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so that's 3 books for Pandora.

To find the total number of books they collectively read, we add the books read by Dolly and Pandora: 3 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he's now pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends him 2 letters a week, and he responds in kind. That means he writes 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week. Since each letter is 5 pages long, he writes a total of 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.

Now, we know Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find the total time he spends writing a week, we multiply the number of pages he writes by the time it takes him to write a page: 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes.

Finally, we need to convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 180 minutes by 60: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Jason's phone plan situation. He has a monthly limit of 1000 minutes, and this month has 30 days. Every day, he has a 15-minute call with his boss, so that's 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes.

In addition to those daily calls, Jason had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. To find the total minutes used, we add those extra minutes to the daily calls: 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the total minutes used from Jason's monthly limit to find out how many minutes he has left: 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Then, Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Next, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. After Colby took his share, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.

Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, we can calculate the number of fries Ginger gave him by subtracting the fries he had left from the total he ended up with: 27 - 7 = 20.

"Hey there, let's dive into this snail and fish problem. We have two aquariums, one with 4 snails and the other with 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

Now, we're told that this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can set up an equation. Let's say the number of fish in each aquarium is x. Then, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The equation becomes: 2 * 2x = 28 (since the difference in snails is twice the total number of fish)

Combine like terms and solve for x:
4x = 28
x = 28 / 4
x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Jean's makeup artist charges $250 an hour, and she needs 6 hours of makeup work done each day, 4 times a week. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so we need to calculate the total hours of makeup work.

First, let's find out how many hours of makeup work Jean needs per week: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week. Since the movie takes 5 weeks, the total hours of makeup work would be 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total cost before the discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000. The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, so we need to find 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the party expenses for Isabelle's little sister's birthday party.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies. Isabelle spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on birthday presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags for the party guests.

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

First, we need to find the total weight of the onions. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. To find the total weight, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag.

Total weight = 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Now that we know the total weight, we can calculate the total cost. We're told that a pound of onions costs $1.50. To find the total cost, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound.

Total cost = 200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

"Hey there, let's break down the cookie conundrum. We know Sue's sister had 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, she had 4 * 5 = 20 cookies that day. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she had 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's tally up the total cookies each of them ate:
Sue's sister: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Given that 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories consumed by each of them:
Sue's sister: 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
Sue: 46 * 200 = 9200 calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the sister's calories from Sue's:
9200 - 3600 = 5600

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know there are 3 classes with 20 students each, so the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys and girls is 60 / 2 = 30 each.

Now, let's look at the number of girls in the first two classes. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since there are 30 girls in the school, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Now, we know the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls. So, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that last night Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, for a total of 10 + 15 = 25 animals.

Now, let's move on to today. We're told that Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. We're also told that he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, if he killed x cougars today, then x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Since Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, he killed 3x = 3 * 12 = 36 wolves today.

So, today Rick killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars, for a total of 36 + 12 = 48 animals.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the number of animals he killed last night (25) to the number of animals he killed today (48).

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. Now, subtract 9 from 30 to find out how many times Anne went down the slide: 30 - 9 = 21.

Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4: 21 * 4 = 84.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we have 10 stalls with 20 cows each, but then it's mentioned that Mr. Sylas puts the new cows into each of the twenty stalls. This implies that there are actually 20 stalls in total, not just 10.

Initially, 10 stalls have 20 cows each, so the total number of cows in these 10 stalls is 10 * 20 = 200 cows. The other 10 stalls are empty.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, the 10 stalls that initially had 20 cows each will have 20 + 2 = 22 cows, and the other 10 stalls will have 2 cows each.

To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we need to know which stalls we're considering. Since the problem doesn't specify, let's assume we're considering 8 of the stalls that initially had 20 cows each. In this case, the total number of cows in 8 stalls would be 8 * 22 = 176.

Next, we have 20 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents, so that's 20 * 10 cents = 200 cents, or $2. Lastly, there are 40 pieces of dollar bills, which is a straightforward $40.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's tackle this problem together.

We're given that each 10-foot section of the redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. The tree is 200 feet tall, so we need to find out how many 10-foot sections that is.

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight per section to find the total weight of the tree.

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

However, we're told that termites ate 30% of the tree. To find the weight after the termites had their snack, we need to calculate 30% of the total weight and subtract it.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds
Weight after termites ate 30% = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

On top of that, there's a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. So, we add that to the cost of the books.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know Andrea has 52 apples, and she has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Now, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, which means he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas each person has:
Andrea's fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76
Jamal's fruits: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92
Total number of fruits: 76 + 92 = 168

Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

Next, we'll calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price.
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

In addition to these fees, Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house.

Now, let's add up the total amount he paid.
Total amount paid = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
Total amount paid = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 
900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To solve for S, we can start by expanding the right-hand side of the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Next, we can subtract 3S from both sides to get:

Now, we know there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park. We can calculate the total number of spots on all the snakes.

Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70 = 2800
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35 = 2100
Total spots on all snakes = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

We're asked to find half the number of spots they all have combined. So, we'll divide the total spots by 2.

Half the number of spots = 4900 / 2 = 2450

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the pizza problem for Maddy.

First, we need to figure out how many people are attending the soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so that's a total of 12 + 3 = 15 people.

Each team member brings 2 guests, so we need to add those guests to the total. That's 12 team members * 2 guests each = 24 guests. Now, we add the guests to the team members and coaches: 15 + 24 = 39 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs. That's 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza, which is $15. So, 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into the problem. Katerina makes beautiful topaz necklaces, and we need to figure out how many sterling silver beads she uses per necklace.

First, we know that each necklace is 25 inches long, and it's made up of 8 topaz gemstones, each 1 inch long. To find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones, we multiply the number of gemstones by their length: 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

Now, let's subtract the length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length taken up by the sterling silver beads: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the total length of the silver beads by their individual length to find the number of beads: 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into the problem. Alani, Braylen, and Margot wrote some stories, and we need to find the total number of stories they wrote.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. So, the total number of stories in the first week is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120.

Now, in the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 
Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

The total number of stories in the second week is 40 + 80 + 120 = 240.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks: 120 + 240 = 360.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's figure out how old Ann's brother will be in 3 years.

First, we need to find out how old Ann's brother is right now. Since he's twice Ann's age, and Ann is 9 years old, we can calculate his current age by multiplying Ann's age by 2. So, 9 * 2 = 18 years.

Now, to find out how old he'll be in 3 years, we just need to add 3 to his current age. That's 18 + 3 = 21 years.

Now, Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she'll have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We have a 76-star flag with three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

Three rows of 8 stars is 3 * 8 = 24 stars, and two rows of 6 stars is 2 * 6 = 12 stars. So, the total number of stars in these rows is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Now, let's subtract this from the total number of stars on the flag: 76 - 36 = 40 stars. These 40 stars are arranged in rows of 5 stars. To find the number of rows, we divide the total number of stars by 5: 40 / 5 = 8.

"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

First, let's find the total weight of the flagstones. Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, we multiply the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone:
Total weight of flagstones = 80 * 75
Total weight of flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, we divide the total weight of flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck, which is 2000 pounds:
Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of each truck
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you with that problem. So, we have a car in the fast lane traveling at 60 miles/hour, and a car in the slow lane traveling at half that speed. To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first determine its speed.

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance of 480 miles.

time = distance / speed
time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
time = 16 hours

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ali has 22 medals, and his friend Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali. To find out how many medals Izzy has, we subtract 5 from Ali's total: 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Now, let's add the number of medals Ali and Izzy have: 22 (Ali's medals) + 17 (Izzy's medals) = 39 medals.

The problem states that together, Ali and Izzy have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have.

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 * 39 = 390.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we know that 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each, which means they'll get a total of 4 * 6 = 24 chocolate bars.

To find out how many chocolate bars are left for the kids, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children and the remaining chocolate bars will be shared equally among them, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Susan's earnings from her online task.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a 30-minute break, so we subtract that from her total time: 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Now, let's convert 2.5 hours to minutes: 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 10: 150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15. This means she completes 15 intervals of 10 minutes each.

Now, let's calculate her total earnings: 15 * $5 = $75.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We have three friends, Mike, Jim, and Tony, who are playing a game. After 3 rounds, Mike has 21 points, Jim has 3 points less than Mike, and Tony has 2 times more than Mike.

First, let's calculate the points for each player. Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, in the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Mike and Tony have over 20 points, so they each get 1 extra point. Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.

After the extra points have been distributed, Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points, Jim still has 18 points, and Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

To find the total points for all three players, we add their points together: 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Darren's exercise routine for the first two days.

On the first day, Darren did 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

On the second day, he increased his pushups by 20, so that's 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. He did 10 fewer squats, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats. For dumbbell presses, he doubled the number, so that's 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, let's add up the total number of activities for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you with that. So, let's break it down. Each person in the household consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are two meals a day - lunch and dinner. That's a total of 0.2 kg * 2 meals = 0.4 kg of rice per person per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 members = 2 kg. To find the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7, which gives us 2 kg * 7 days = 14 kg per week.

Now, let's see how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We can do this by dividing the total weight of the rice bag by the weekly consumption: 42 kg / 14 kg per week = 3 weeks.

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates of bread in a week. To determine how many crates he was off from his target, we'll subtract the total number of crates sold from his target:
120 (target) - 65 (crates sold) = 55

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down John's driving expenses.

First, we need to figure out how many miles he drives in a year. His work is 30 miles away, and he makes a round trip every day, so that's 60 miles per day. Since he goes to work 5 days a week, that's 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week. With 50 weeks in a year, he drives a total of 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year.

Now, let's calculate the cost of those miles. John gets charged $2 per mile, so 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000 per year.

In addition to the mileage cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus every month. That's $150 * 12 months = $1,800 per year.

So, the total cost of John's driving expenses per year is $30,000 (mileage) + $1,800 (bonus) = $31,800.

When creating a simple folding newspaper or tabloid, the pages are arranged in a specific way. The paper is folded vertically, and the pages are printed on both the front and back. To figure out the number of pieces of paper used, we need to consider how the pages are paired.

Imagine the pages are arranged in the following way: page 1 is on the left back, page 2 is on the left front, page 32 is on the right back, and page 31 is on the right front. This arrangement implies that the pages are paired in a way that requires 8 pieces of paper for the front and 8 pieces of paper for the back. However, these are the same 8 pieces of paper, just viewed from different sides.

We also know that she sold 45 books this year and twice as many in the first year, which means she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

Now, let's find out how many books she sold in the second year. We know the total number of books sold is 200, and we know the number of books sold in the first and current year. So, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Since each book sells for 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300$.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Watson's earnings for April.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, which means he works 50 hours per week. Since he earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 50 * $10 = $500 per week.

Assuming a 4-week month, Watson's total earnings from his hourly wage would be $500 * 4 = $2000.

As the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total bonus for the month is $300 * 4 = $1200.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. To find out how many loaves are sold in the morning, we need to calculate two-thirds of 60. 

Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total to find out how many are left: 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"Hey there, let's break this down. We know Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so to find out how much he loses in a week, we divide 8 by 4. That's 2 pounds per week for Joey.

Now, we're told Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, that means Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

We want to find out how many weeks it'll take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks, which is 8 pounds. To do that, we can divide the total weight (8 pounds) by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks (2 pounds), and then multiply by 4 (since that's how long it takes her to lose 2 pounds).

So, that's 8 / 2 * 4 = 16 weeks.

Next, I'll calculate the savings from the milk. Each packet has a discount of $0.5. Since we're buying 4 packets, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Next, the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each will be 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. It costs $700 more than 5 times as much as a business suit. So, 5 * $100 = $500, and adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up all these expenses: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo has a budget of $6000 and wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, if we subtract his total expenses from his budget, we get $6000 - $1950 = $4050. Then, subtracting the amount he wants to save, we get $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

"I'd be happy to help you with that problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Cera is currently 46 years old. To find her age six years ago, we subtract 6 from her current age: 46 - 6 = 40.

Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, we can find his age at that time by dividing Cera's age by 2: 40 / 2 = 20. This was Noah's age six years ago.

The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, we multiply Noah's age at that time by 3000: 20 * 3000 = 60,000. This was the population of Chile six years ago.

Finally, we're told that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. To find the current population, we multiply the population six years ago by 2: 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down this problem step by step.

We know the football team has 105 members, and we need to find out how many players are on the defense. We're given some clues about the offense and special teams, so let's use those to figure it out.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is D. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. And since there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We can set up an equation using these variables and the total number of players:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

The final answer is: 30"
"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get this party started by figuring out how many people are coming to Martha's Christmas party.

Now, let's subtract the people who can't make it. 8 people are out due to illness, and 1/4 of 8 people have previous commitments. To find 1/4 of 8, we multiply 8 by 1/4, which gives us 2 people. So, the total number of people who can't come is 8 + 2 = 10.

We know that 22 men stayed at the party, so the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3. This means the remaining 7 people who left must be women (since 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men).

Now, let's find the number of women who stayed. Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left, so the number of women who stayed is 15 - 7 = 8.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know the book costs $4, and the magazine is half the price of the book. So, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. To find the cost of the pen, we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine: $2 - $1 = $1.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. To find out how many pencils are in the boxes, we subtract the 2 loose pencils: 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in the boxes.

Since there are 3 boxes, we divide the total pencils in the boxes by 3 to find out how many pencils each box can hold: 24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box.

Now, let's add the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have: 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold: 72 / 8 = 9.

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step. Shannon's coffee cools by 13 degrees with each ice cube, and she wants to cool it by 65 degrees. To find out how many ice cubes she needs, we divide 65 by 13, which gives us 5 ice cubes.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker. On top of that, she's adding 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. 

So, the total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. We know that 5 people traded their old records for new ones, and they left with a total of 7 new records. The trade-in policy is 2 old records for 1 new one.

To find out how many old records they brought in, we can use the ratio of old records to new records. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new one, we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to get the total number of old records.

So, 7 new records would be equivalent to 7 * 2 = 14 old records.

The final answer is: 14"
"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of junior programmers. Since they make up 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as 2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Now, to find the number of senior programmers, we subtract the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees: 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Next, we know that junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their salary is $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

To find the total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month, we multiply the number of junior programmers by their salary: 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Similarly, the total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

Finally, we add the total amount paid to junior and senior programmers to find the total amount paid to all programmers per month: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that at the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in, resulting in a net gain of 1 person. Before that, 5 people got in at the first stop. 

Now, let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x. After the first stop, the total number of people is x + 5. Then, after the second stop, the total number of people is x + 5 + 1, which simplifies to x + 6.

We're told that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20. So, we can set up the equation x + 6 = 20. To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides, which gives us x = 14.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Oscar's lollipop adventure step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school. That leaves him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes out 14 lollipops to his friends, so he's left with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave away 14, he buys 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, Oscar eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he's left with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, we've got a cell phone that recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, and it's currently at 60% charged. To find out how long it'll take to fully charge, we need to figure out the remaining percentage of charge needed.

Since the phone is at 60%, it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%). Now, let's calculate the time it'll take to charge that 40%. We know it takes 3 minutes to charge 1 percentage-point, so for 40 percentage-points, it'll take 40 * 3 minutes.

40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

Now, we need to convert those minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we'll divide 120 by 60.

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

"Hey there, let's break down the customer's shopping trip. They spent $80 on their last trip, which means they earned rewards of $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they got 4 rewards of $1 each, totaling $4 in rewards.

This shopping trip, they spent $43 and used those rewards, which took $4 off the price. But that's not all - they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since their rewards were worth $4, the coupon discount is 2 * $4 = $8.

Adding the rewards and coupon discounts together, they got a total discount of $4 + $8 = $12. Now, let's subtract that from the original price of $43. 

$43 - $12 = $31

"Hey there, let's break down the two job options for Nick.

First, we'll calculate the net income for Job A. The job pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, which translates to a gross income of $15 * 2000 = $30,000 per year. With a 20% total tax rate, Nick would pay $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000 in taxes. So, his net income for Job A would be $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Now, let's look at Job B. The job pays $42,000 per year, but there's a $6,000 property tax. So, the net income before tax would be $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. With a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax, Nick would pay $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600 in taxes. Therefore, his net income for Job B would be $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Comparing the two net incomes, it's clear that Job B offers a higher net pay rate. To find out how much more Nick would make, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

Number of ruined castles = 40% of 220
= 0.4 * 220

Now, we're told that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. So, we'll find half of 88.

Number of unmanned ruined castles = 1/2 * 88

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the two offers to find the cost difference.

First, we'll calculate the total cost of Furniture United's offer. The advance payment is $1,350, and the 6 monthly installments of $350 each add up to $2,100. So, the total cost is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Next, we'll calculate the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer. The advance payment is $1,100, and the 9 monthly installments of $250 each add up to $2,250. So, the total cost is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers. To do this, we'll subtract the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from the total cost of Furniture United's offer: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each, so the initial total value is 8 * $8 = $64.

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4. Adding this to the initial price, we get $8 + $4 = $12 per share. Now, the total value is 8 * $12 = $96.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. We calculate 25% of $12, which is 0.25 * $12 = $3. Subtracting this from the price after the first year, we get $12 - $3 = $9 per share. Now, the total value is 8 * $9 = $72.

"Let's break down the problem. We have 200 students divided into 3 groups. Two of the groups are equal in size, and the third group is 10 students smaller than the other two.

Let's call the number of students in the two equal groups ""x"". Then, the number of students in the smallest group is ""x - 10"".

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up an equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide by 3:

x = 70

Now, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

"I'd be happy to help you with that problem. So, Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, and they're all either chickens or cows. He has twice as many chickens as cows. To start, let's say the number of cows is x. Since he has twice as many chickens, the number of chickens is 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:
x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:
3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 20

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2x = 2(20) = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs. 
Total legs = (number of cows * 4) + (number of chickens * 2)
Total legs = (20 * 4) + (40 * 2)
Total legs = 80 + 80

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into this problem. We have a pink frog that weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, but 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, and 20 pounds more than a red bird. Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can calculate the weight of the other animals.

Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, they also weigh 50 pounds each. The yellow snake is 10 pounds heavier than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds. On the other hand, the red bird is 20 pounds lighter than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container, which weighs 20 pounds. The total weight would be:
Pink frog: 50 pounds
Blue beetle: 50 pounds
Green toad: 50 pounds
Yellow snake: 60 pounds

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

Adding these activities together, we get 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This was 30% of the time he spent, so we can set up the equation:
15 = 0.3x, where x is the total time spent.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:

"Hey there, let's break down the train's route and figure out how many days it goes between services.

The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, and then 100 miles from the second city to the third city. To find the distance from the third city to the first city, we need to calculate 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs. The combined distance is 75 + 100 = 175 miles, so the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, let's add up the distances to find the total distance traveled in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. Mark makes custom dog beds, and we need to figure out how much stuffing he needs for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

First, we need to determine the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. Since it's the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed (8 pounds) and a chihuahua bed (2 pounds), we calculate it as (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total stuffing needed. For 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing. For 3 collie beds, he needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

Adding these amounts together, we get 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down John's trip to his friend's house and back.

First, we need to calculate the time it took him to get to his friend's house. The original distance was 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles, making the total distance 210 miles. He drove at a speed of 70 mph, so the time it took him to get there is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time it took him to get back home. The distance was 240 miles, and he drove at a speed of 80 mph, so the time it took him to get back home is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

To find the total time of the trip, we simply add the time it took him to get to his friend's house and the time it took him to get back home:

Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's solve this problem together.

We know there are 96 fourth-graders at Small Tree School, and 43 of them are girls. To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.

Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls
Number of boys = 96 - 43
Number of boys = 53

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. To find the number of boys present, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

Number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of boys absent
Number of boys present = 53 - 4
Number of boys present = 49

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's get to it. We've got 6 girls in the park, and the number of boys is twice that. To find the number of boys, we simply multiply the number of girls by 2. That gives us 6 * 2 = 12 boys.

Now, to find the total number of kids in the park, we just add the number of girls and boys together. So, 6 (girls) + 12 (boys) = 18.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help Jane out. To figure out the minimum number of points she needs on her third test, let's first add up the points she's already scored. She got 15 points on her first test and 18 points on her second test, so that's a total of 15 + 18 = 33 points.

Since Jane needs a total of at least 42 points to pass, we can subtract the points she's already scored from the total to find out how many more points she needs. So, 42 - 33 = 9.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. Then, we have a number of people kicked out for shoplifting, which is four times the number of people kicked out for not wearing masks, minus 5. So, that's 4 * 3 - 5 = 7 people.

Now, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. That's 3 * 7 = 21 people.

We can add up the number of people kicked out for these reasons: 3 (not wearing masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31 people.

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we can subtract the number of people kicked out for these reasons from the total to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons: 50 - 31 = 19.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. To find out how many points Erin has now, we can multiply Sara's points by 3.

Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's points
Erin's current points = 3 * 8
Erin's current points = 24

Now, we're told Erin scored 14 points. To find out how many points Erin had before, we subtract 14 from her current points.

Erin's points before = Erin's current points - 14
Erin's points before = 24 - 14
Erin's points before = 10

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out with that question. So, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames. Since each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20, and there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to add the cost of etching the logo onto each frame, which is an additional 20% of the frame's cost. To find 20% of $880, we multiply $880 by 0.2, which gives us $176. So, the total cost of the picture frames and etching is $880 + $176 = $1056.

Now, let's move on to the pins. Since only 2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

We also need to consider the cords for the officers. Since 1/4 of the seniors are officers, we can find the number of officers by dividing 44 by 4, which gives us 11. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Finally, we add up the costs of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords to find the total cost of the senior gifts: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the shoe sale numbers.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. The next day, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs. Then on Sunday, they sold half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the pairs sold each day: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs. Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100 shoes.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. To solve this problem, we need to find the amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment. 

First, let's calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment. Since 40% of the total number of equipment pieces were faulty, we can find this amount by multiplying the total cost by 0.4. 

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. 
So, the amount spent on faulty equipment is 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000.

Now, to find the amount spent on functioning equipment, we subtract the amount spent on faulty equipment from the total amount spent.
$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. Mary has 30 sheep, and she gets milk from all of them, but the amount of milk varies. Half of the sheep give her 1 kg of milk each, and the other half give her 2 kg of milk each.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each half. Since there are 30 sheep in total, half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the milk from the first half. 15 sheep * 1 kg of milk each = 15 kg of milk.

Next, let's calculate the milk from the other half. 15 sheep * 2 kg of milk each = 30 kg of milk.

To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Now, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils to find the remaining pupils. So, 40 - 20 = 20 pupils.

Out of these 20 pupils, one-fourth like green. To find this number, we'll divide 20 by 4, which gives us 5 pupils.

Finally, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils to find the number of pupils who like yellow. So, 20 - 5 = 15 pupils.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest and then divide the total amount by the number of months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * (5/12) = $152.08

Now, let's add the interest to the principal amount to get the total amount Karan needs to pay.

Total amount = $3,650 + $152.08 = $3,802.08

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Millie's lemonade stand situation. She buys supplies for $18, which is enough to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she can make a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Millie sells each cup for $1, so her total revenue will be 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find her profit, we subtract her total cost from her total revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we can find the total number of hours she spends running the stand by dividing the total cups by the cups sold per hour: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, let's calculate her profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

We know that Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. To find the original amount of land he had, we can set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"

We know the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we need to first find the total number of popsicles each of them has.

The total parts in the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11. Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can divide 165 by 11 to find the value of 1 part:
165 ÷ 11 = 15.

Now that we know the value of 1 part, we can multiply it by the number of parts each person has. Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

First, let's calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount. The original cost is $10 + $10 = $20. The discount is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix to find the total cost of the streaming services: $16 + $10 = $26.

To find out how much money Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 - $26 = $34.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. So, for a quadruple batch, Mark will need 3 * 4 = 12 cups of flour and 1 * 4 = 4 cups of milk.

Now, let's see how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy. Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so he'll need 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour. Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so he'll need 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we simply subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the original energy usage per day. Since Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day, the energy usage per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours. To convert this to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000 (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts), which gives us 7.2 kilowatt-hours.

Now, let's calculate the new energy usage per day. If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he'll be using it for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. The new energy usage per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours, or 2.7 kilowatt-hours.

To find the energy saved per day, we subtract the new energy usage from the original energy usage: 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours.

Finally, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30 to find the total energy saved in 30 days: 4.5 kilowatt-hours * 30 = 135 kilowatt-hours.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. We need to find the average number of stripes on the zebras Jane counted.

First, we'll add up the total number of stripes. Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. Then there's a zebra with 36 stripes, and another with half that many, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes. 

Now, let's add up all the stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes in total.

Since there are 4 zebras, we'll divide the total number of stripes by 4 to find the average: 88 / 4 = 22.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, Tyson's making muffaletta sandwiches for the big game, and we need to figure out how much he'll spend on meat and cheese.

First, let's determine how many sandwiches he needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people coming over, he'll need to make 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so for 5 sandwiches, he'll need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

Now, let's calculate the cost. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds will be 5 * $7.00 = $35.00. The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds will be 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.

Adding the cost of the meat and cheese together, we get $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis initially, and he has 40 cannolis. So, the number of corns he has is 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis, making the total number of cannolis 40 + 60 = 100.

Now, he buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, which means he buys 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Adding these new corns to the initial amount, we get 80 + 60 = 140 corns.

Finally, to find the combined total of corns and cannolis, we add the number of corns and cannolis: 140 + 100 = 240.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Elliott's steps to figure out how many he took during his jog.

Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps with his friend. So, before the jog, he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that before the jog, he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps taken.

Now, we subtract the steps taken before the jog from the total steps taken before the jog and after the jog: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many words are in the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, we can calculate the total number of words as follows:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Toby to read the book. Since Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, we can calculate the time it takes him to read the book as follows:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time Toby needs is:
30 minutes (to read the book) + 10 minutes (to get to the airport) = 40 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport. To find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the total time he needs from the time he has:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount paid to the employees in May. The company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96,000.

Now, let's move on to June. 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600. The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy, and the deal was ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which is $3 * 0.5 = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each. The total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up all her expenses: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage: 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150: $960 + $150 = $1110.

So, Shannon wants to make enough cookies to last her for 30 days, and she eats 2 cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights: 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that 99% of Marcy's candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of them will explode. To find the number of candles that will explode, we'll calculate 1% of the total number of candles made, which is 50,000.

Number of candles that will explode = 1% of 50,000
= 0.01 * 50,000
= 500

Now, we're told that 5% of the more dangerous candles (the ones that explode) also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since we already know that 500 candles will explode, we can find the number of candles that will smell like wet dog by calculating 5% of 500.

Number of candles that will smell like wet dog = 5% of 500
= 0.05 * 500
= 25

So, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into this problem and figure out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

First, we know Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half that amount, which is 15 apples, from the shortest trees. We'll call the number of apples she gathered from the average trees ""x"".

Now, let's look at what her sister gathered. She picked twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne did, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples. She also gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples. Her sister didn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500

Combine like terms:

(45 + x) + 105 = 500

Combine constants:

150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

x = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's break down the problem. We have a herd with camels and dromedaries. Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each. We're given that there are 180 heads and 304 humps in total.

We can start by setting up two equations. Let's use 'c' for the number of camels and 'd' for the number of dromedaries. Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is the sum of camels and dromedaries:
c + d = 180

Now, let's consider the humps. Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each. So, the total number of humps is:
2c + d = 304

To solve for 'd', we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting c = 124 into the first equation:
124 + d = 180
d = 56

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down Tom's trip and calculate the total distance he traveled.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, which is a total of 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km. Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first four days, which is 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km. On the 7th day, he didn't travel at all, so that's 0 km.

Now, let's move on to the second week. Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day, and since there are 7 days in a week, that's 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

To find the total distance, we add up the distances: 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

Now, we need to find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb. Oliver is currently at 3,000 feet, and the comb is at 6,000 feet. To find the distance Oliver must climb, we subtract his current elevation from the elevation of the comb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

Now, we subtract the cats that were taken from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats left on the rock.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats decide to chase a mouse. To find out how many cats that is, we multiply 30 by 3/5: (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18 cats.

First, we know the tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we add the savings to the sale price: $22 + $2 = $24.

To find the original price of the tattered jeans, we add the savings to the sale price: $28 + $4 = $32.

Now, we need to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. However, since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, we'll get a negative value. The original price difference between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8. But since we want to know how much more the jogger jeans cost, we'll express this as a negative value.

Since Kenny needs $150, and he's selling his cards for $1.5 each, we can divide the total amount of money he needs by the price per card to find the number of cards he needs to sell:

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

However, this is the number of cards he needs to sell, not the number he started with. We know that he keeps 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sells is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with ""x"". Then, the number of cards he sells is 2/3x.

We know that 2/3x = 100, so we can solve for x:

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we need to know the length and width in feet. We're given the length in yards, so let's convert it first. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, the length in feet is:

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

We're also given the area of the room, which is 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length and width, so we can rearrange the formula to solve for the width:

Width = Area / Length
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into the problem. We have two sisters, Elizabeth and Margareth, who bought beads. Elizabeth got 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, while Margareth got 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. We're asked to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, given that each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

First, let's calculate the total number of packs each sister bought. Elizabeth has 1 + 2 = 3 packs, and Margareth has 3 + 4 = 7 packs.

Now, we multiply the number of packs by 20 to find the total number of beads. Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads, and Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

To find the difference, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number: 140 (Margareth's beads) - 60 (Elizabeth's beads) = 80 beads.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's figure out the final temperature of Marcus's house.

So, Marcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees each hour. To find the total temperature increase, I'll multiply the number of hours by the temperature increase per hour: 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees. Now, I'll add this to the initial temperature: 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Since 30 minutes is equal to 3 intervals of 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease is 2 * 3 = 6 degrees. To find the final temperature, I'll subtract this from the temperature after baking: 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"Hey there, let's break down the triathlon times for Jon and James.

First, we need to calculate Jon's total time. 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Now, let's find James' time for the swim and bike ride. 
- James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. 
- 10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
- James' swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes
- James took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. 
- James' bike ride time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' time for the run:
- James' total time: 180 minutes
- James' swim and bike time: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes
- James' run time: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step. We know Movie C is 1.25 hours long, but we need to convert it to minutes since the question asks for the length of Movie A in minutes. 

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we're told Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B.

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

The question states Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

Movie A = Movie B / 4
Movie A = 80 minutes / 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how far Michael's horse runs. We know it runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. To calculate the distance, we need to convert the time to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance:

Distance = speed * time = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:

8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has 6 $5 bills, which is a total of:

6 * $5 = $30

To find out how much change he has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total amount of money he has:

$30 - $24 = $6

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get cracking on this eggnog problem.

Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs, which is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Plus, she's got 2 loose eggs in the cupboard, so that's a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, and each tray holds 5 glasses. So, to figure out how many eggs are needed per tray, we multiply the number of eggs per glass by the number of glasses per tray: 5 * 5 = 25 eggs per tray.

Now, let's divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per tray: 50 eggs / 25 eggs per tray = 2 trays.

Marcy had 225 points and scored 10 more, so now she has 225 + 10 = 235 points.

To find out by how many points Joey is winning, we need to subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points: 240 - 235 = 5.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. He sold 17 of them for $20 each, so that's 17 * $20 = $340. The rest of the sneakers, which is 48 - 17 = 31, were sold for $25 each, so that's 31 * $25 = $775.

Now, let's add up the total revenue: $340 + $775 = $1115. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue: $1115 - $576 = $539.

Beatrice bought 10 packets of crayons, but they're not all the same. Six packets have 8 colors each, and the other four packets have 16 colors each.

First, let's calculate the total number of colors in the packets with 8 colors each. We have 6 packets, so we multiply 6 by 8, which gives us 48 colors.

Next, let's calculate the total number of colors in the packets with 16 colors each. We have 4 packets, so we multiply 4 by 16, which gives us 64 colors.

Now, we add the total number of colors in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the super ticket costs $20 and includes a movie ticket, popcorn, and a soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost of the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

On the other hand, if you buy a regular ticket, it costs $12, and you also need to buy popcorn and a soda. The soda costs $3, and we're trying to find the cost of the popcorn.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket option is $21 - $2 = $19.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the regular ticket and the soda from the total cost of the regular ticket option: $19 - $12 - $3 = $4.

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

"I'd be happy to help you with that problem. So, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the original cost per balloon. We know that the total cost of filling 20 helium balloons was $900. To find the cost per balloon, we'll divide the total cost by the number of balloons: $900 ÷ 20 = $45 per balloon.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We can do this by multiplying the number of balloons by the new cost per balloon: 170 × $65 = $11,050.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you with that. To find the car's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at each speed. The car drives 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance traveled at 60 mph is 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then, it drives 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance traveled at 30 mph is 30 * 1 = 30 miles. The total distance traveled is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

Next, let's calculate the total time taken. The car drives for 2 hours at 60 mph and 1 hour at 30 mph, so the total time taken is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken. The average speed is 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's get started on calculating the cost of potting soil for Bob's vegetable garden.

First, we need to find the volume of each raised bed. The dimensions are given as 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. To find the volume, we multiply these dimensions together: 2 ft * 8 ft * 2 ft = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we multiply the volume of one bed by 10 to get the total volume: 32 cubic feet * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Now, we know that each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we divide the total volume by the volume of each bag: 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet = 160 bags.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag, which is $12: 160 bags * $12 = $1920.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know there are 15 red cards. The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. To find the number of green cards, we'll calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15.

60% of 15 is 0.6 * 15 = 9. So, the number of green cards is 15 + 9 = 24.

Now, the number of yellow cards is the sum of the red and green cards. That's 15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39 yellow cards.

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78.

Later, 30 fairies flew away, leaving us with 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

The number of fairies remaining is 45."
"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. We need to find the percentage of puppies that have spots. To do this, we'll first calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, with 4 of them having spots. So, the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

Now, let's count the puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3, and Brandon's dog has 4, making a total of 3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.

To find the percentage, we'll divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100. This gives us (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%.

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each type of feed and add them together.

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the farm truck to find the number of trips needed.

Number of trips = Total weight of feed / Capacity of the farm truck
= 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
= 2 trips

Since 2 trips will not be enough to carry the remaining 0 pounds of feed, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, 2 trips will be enough to carry all the feed, but the second trip will not be full. Therefore, the farmer will need 2 trips.

She also has five boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, which is 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards. Adding these together, we get 150 + 200 = 350 cards in total.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so she gives the remaining cards to her students. To find out how many cards she gives away, we subtract the cards she keeps from the total: 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies:
Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 + 48
Combined weight = 84

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. Keegan and Tashay need to raise $200 for their baseball camp. By 3 pm, they've earned a total of $83 + $91 = $174.

To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they've already earned from their goal. So, $200 - $174 = $26.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many songs Luri has and then find out how many more songs each of them can add to their players.

Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Now, let's calculate how many more songs each of them can add. Gabriel's player can store up to 100 songs, and he already has 20. So, he can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs.

Luri's player can also store up to 100 songs, and he already has 60. So, he can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs.

The difference in the number of songs they can add is 80 - 40 = 40.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked, and they picked 60 oranges. To find out how many oranges Stetson ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

So, 2/5 of 60 is (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 oranges.

Now, since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, the total amount he gave up is 24 * $10 = $240.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem. We know Jillian's shoes cost $80, and her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes. 

First, we need to find out what 3 times the cost of her shoes is. That's 3 * $80 = $240. Now, we subtract $20 from that amount to get the cost of her handbag. So, $240 - $20 = $220.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down James' running schedule to figure out how many hours he runs a week.

First, we need to find out the total miles James runs in a week. Since he runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, we multiply the miles per day by the number of days:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Now, we know James runs 10 miles an hour. To find the total hours he runs a week, we divide the total miles by his speed:
60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much oats each horse consumes in a day. Since each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal and they're fed twice a day, that's 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per horse per day.

Now, Uncle Ben has 4 horses, so the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

We're looking at a 5-day period, so we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Finally, we need to determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs. Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats needed by the weight of each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

First, we need to find out how many Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of her 27 puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this by multiplying 27 by 2/3. 

(2/3) * 27 = 18

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. Now, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this by multiplying 18 by 1/3.

(1/3) * 18 = 6

Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The child wants to buy a toy car that costs $12, and he already has $4 in savings. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount he already has from the cost of the toy car.

Remaining amount = Cost of toy car - Amount already saved
= $12 - $4
= $8

Now, we know the child saves $2 every day from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take him to save the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his daily savings.

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
= $8 / $2
= 4 days

Now, let's subtract the total number of eggs the trays can hold from the total number of eggs Jaime has: 64 - 48 = 16.

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the trays.

The family-size pizza costs 3 times the price of the small pizza, which is 3 * $8 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of both pizzas:

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have a total of 8 razors. Now, we can calculate the cost per razor:

$2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

$0.25 * 100 = 25 cents

To find the total height of the pyramid, we need to add the heights of the girls in each level. The bottom level has 4 girls, each 64"" tall, so their total height is 4 * 64"" = 256"". The middle level has 3 girls, each 64"" tall, so their total height is 3 * 64"" = 192"". The top level has 2 girls, each 64"" tall, so their total height is 2 * 64"" = 128"". The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, add the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636"". To convert the total height from inches to feet, divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 636"" / 12 = 53 feet.

We know Brett is 14 years old, and in four years, his sister Angela will be three times as old as he is now. To find Angela's current age, we need to determine her age in four years.

Since Angela's age in four years will be three times Brett's current age, we can calculate it by multiplying Brett's age by 3. So, Angela's age in four years will be 3 * 14 = 42 years.

Now, to find Angela's current age, we need to subtract 4 from 42, since we're looking at her age four years from now.

Angela's current age = 42 - 4 = 38 years.

Now, Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so we add 20 to Ashley's total: 50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges.

Combining Ashley's and Brianne's oranges, we get: 50 oranges + 70 oranges = 120 oranges.

Since one greek orange pie needs three oranges, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie: 120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie = 40 pies.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help Mark decide on a venue for his surprise party. Let's break down the costs for both options.

The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, plus $5 per guest for food. The second venue charges $25 per guest, with food included.

To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, we can set up an equation. Let's say the number of guests is 'x'. The cost of the first venue is $200 + $5x, and the cost of the second venue is $25x.

Since we want the costs to be equal, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for x:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

So, the two venues will be equal in cost when there are 10 guests.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's start by using the information that David found half of what Bodhi found. If we denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B, then David found B/2 insects.

Since Lily found 7 more than David, she found B/2 + 7 insects.

We can set up an equation using the fact that together they collected 43 insects:

B + B/2 + (B/2 + 7) = 43

Combine like terms:

2B/2 + B/2 + 7 = 43
3B/2 + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3B/2 = 36

Multiply both sides by 2/3:

First, we need to calculate the yards used by each of them. Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and since there are 364 yards in a skein, she used 1/4 * 364 yards = 91 yards.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, so she used 1/2 * 364 yards = 182 yards.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma: 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Cherrie's gift shopping spree.

First, we have 2 friends who want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 gifts. Then, there are 3 friends who want 2 gifts each, which adds up to 3 * 2 = 6 gifts. So, the total number of gifts for her friends is 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

But wait, Cherrie didn't stop there. She also picked up 10 more random gifts to surprise her friends.

Now, let's add those up: 16 gifts for her friends + 10 random gifts = 26 gifts.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem step by step. We know the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. That means the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.

Now, the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. To find the length of the couch, we add 2 feet to that: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Suzie bought four packs of gum and paid $7 in total. We know she got two packs of strawberry gum, one pack of grape gum for $2, and one pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3. To find the total cost of the strawberry gum, we subtract this amount from the total amount Suzie paid: $7 - $3 = $4.

Since Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost by 2 to find the cost of each pack: $4 / 2 = $2.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's figure out how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make with his budget.

First, we need to determine which type of wood gives the most sticks per dollar. For the 2 x 4 wood, Frederick gets 200 sticks for $4, which is 50 sticks per dollar. For the 2 x 8 wood, he gets 400 sticks for $6, which is approximately 66.67 sticks per dollar.

Since the 2 x 8 wood gives more sticks per dollar, it's the cheapest option. Now, let's see how many 2 x 8 woods Frederick can buy with his $24 budget:
$24 / $6 = 4

Each 2 x 8 wood gives 400 sticks, so we multiply the number of 2 x 8 woods by the number of sticks per wood:
4 * 400 = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"
"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's figure out how much Mario needs to spend on snowshoes for his sled dogs.

First, we need to determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has four legs and snowshoes are sold in pairs, each dog needs two pairs of snowshoes. With six sled dogs, the total number of pairs needed is 6 dogs * 2 pairs/dog = 12 pairs.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost will be 12 pairs * $12/pair = $144.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Janet's bus trip costs. She takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. That's a total of 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so her weekly bus trip expenses would be 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00.

Now, if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she'd save $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the information we have about the farm and the zoo.

We know the farm has 30 cows, and the zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

On the other hand, the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, which means the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's count the total number of animals at both places. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, making it a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, making it a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

To find the combined total, we add the number of animals at the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. We know Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can find out how many Sophia bought by dividing those numbers by 4.

For onions, that's 12 / 4 = 3 onions for Sophia.
For potatoes, that's 4 / 4 = 1 potato for Sophia.

So, in total, Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items.

8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now that we know the total distance, we can multiply it by the amount of water Hannah needs per kilometer, which is 60 ml:
2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

First, Julie spent 20% of her $500 on clothes. To find 20% of $500, I'll multiply $500 by 0.20. That's $100. So, she spent $100 on clothes and had $500 - $100 = $400 left.

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find 25% of $400, I'll multiply $400 by 0.25. That's $100. Now, she has $400 - $100 = $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem. We know the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know the house costs three times as much as the lot. To make things easier, let's say the cost of the lot is 'x'. That means the cost of the house is 3x.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:
x + 3x = 120,000

Combine the x terms:
4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x:
3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"

Now, let's talk about how much she made from selling the bags. She sold each bag for $8, so she made a total of 40 * $8 = $320.

To find out how much profit she made, we need to subtract the cost from the revenue. So, her profit is $320 - $160 = $160.

Josh's cookies = 1/4 * 36
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we're told that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can multiply Josh's total by 2 to find Kelsie's total.

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Ali has in total. He has four $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. He also has six $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. Adding these together, we get $40 + $120 = $160.

Now, Ali gives half of the total money to his sister. Half of $160 is $160 / 2 = $80. So, Ali is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Next, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is 3/5 * $80 = $48.

To find out how much money Ali has after buying dinner, we subtract the cost of dinner from the remaining amount: $80 - $48 = $32.

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, the problem states that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time. So, we need to find double Rob's time first. That's 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes. Then, we add 40 minutes to that.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Martha's knitting project to figure out how many skeins of wool she'll need.

Martha wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of her 3 grandchildren. To calculate the total number of skeins needed, we'll multiply the number of skeins required for each item by 3.

- Each hat requires 2 skeins, so 3 hats will need 2 * 3 = 6 skeins.
- Each scarf requires 4 skeins, so 3 scarves will need 4 * 3 = 12 skeins.
- Each sweater requires 12 skeins, so 3 sweaters will need 12 * 3 = 36 skeins.
- Each pair of mittens requires 1 skein, so 3 pairs will need 1 * 3 = 3 skeins.
- Each pair of socks requires 2 skeins, so 3 pairs will need 2 * 3 = 6 skeins.

Now, let's add up the total number of skeins needed: 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Chris's math homework progress.

Chris started with 100 math problems. On Monday, he completed 12 problems. That's a good start!

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. So, that's 3 * 12 = 36 problems. Now, let's add the problems he completed on Monday and Tuesday: 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

Now, we subtract the problems he completed from the total: 100 - 48 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61 problems.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get down to business and figure out how many quarts of strawberries Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm.

First, we know Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. Bobby, on the other hand, picks one less quart than Tony, so that's 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour for Bobby.

Now, Kathy is a superstar and can pick twice as many strawberries as Bobby. That's 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour for Kathy. Last but not least, Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, which means he can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

To find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour, we simply add their individual rates together: 6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29.

However, a grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. To find the number of loaves left, we need to subtract the total number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked and then add the returned loaves.

Loaves left = Total loaves baked - Total loaves sold + Loaves returned
Loaves left = 200 - 132 + 6
Loaves left = 74

First, let's calculate the number of rows for the red tulips. Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row, and he buys 36 of them. To find the number of rows, we divide the total number of tulips by the number of tulips per row:
36 ÷ 6 = 6 rows of red tulips.

Next, let's do the same for the blue tulips. Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, and he buys 24 of them. Again, we divide the total number of tulips by the number of tulips per row:
24 ÷ 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.

Now, we just need to add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
6 rows (red) + 3 rows (blue) = 9 rows.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Ada's electric bill situation.

First, we need to calculate her daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device. Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour, and the new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be:

12 kWh/hour (before) + 2 kWh/hour (new device) = 14 kWh/hour (after)

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh):

Daily consumption before: 12 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 288 kWh
Daily consumption after: 14 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 336 kWh

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption:

Weekly consumption before: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
Weekly consumption after: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour, so we multiply the weekly consumption by the cost:

Weekly cost before: 2016 kWh * $1.50 = $3024
Weekly cost after: 2352 kWh * $1.50 = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is:

$3528 - $3024 = $504

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down this problem step by step.

First, if one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it means they can paint a whole house in 10 days. This is because painting a whole house is twice as much work as painting half a house.

Now, let's convert those 10 days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, one person can paint a whole house in 10 * 24 = 240 hours.

Finally, if we have 5 people working together, they can paint a whole house in 1/5 the time it would take one person. So, we divide 240 hours by 5, which gives us 48 hours.

Now, Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. To find Jenna's chairs, we multiply Ophelia's chairs by 3: 22 * 3 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we subtract 2 from the number of chairs to find her sofas: 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

"Hey there, let's break down Josh's workout routine. He worked out for 8 weeks, with a few exceptions to his usual 4-hour weekly routine. There were two consecutive weeks where he spent 5 hours each, and one week where he spent 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the hours spent in the weeks with the usual 4-hour routine. Since there were 2 weeks with 5 hours and 1 week with 6 hours, that's 3 weeks with exceptions. So, Josh spent 4 hours a week for 8 - 3 = 5 weeks. The total hours spent in those 5 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

For the 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours, the total hours spent is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

For the week where he spent 6 hours, the total hours spent is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

We start with 48 people on the bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving us with:
48 - 8 = 40

Now, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus. Now the total number of passengers is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

On the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

On the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer is 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get on the bus. Now the total number of passengers is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66

Next, we'll find Jame's age in 8 years: 22 + 8 = 30.

Now, let's consider Jame's cousin. In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 2 * 30 = 60. So, the cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

To find the cousin's current age, we subtract 8 from 55: 55 - 8 = 47.

Finally, we calculate the difference in their current ages: 47 - 22 = 25.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400. We also know the computer cost $1,100 and that he paid $400 less for the printer than the computer.

To find the cost of the printer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer: $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

Since the total cost of all items is $2,400, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer to find the cost of the 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Finally, to find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of the 2 monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

We have 20 kids divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, so that's 10 boys and 10 girls. The boys went out and brought back 60 shells each, which means they collected a total of 10 x 60 = 600 shells.

Now, the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys, plus four times as many seashells as the boys. To calculate this, we'll add 600 (the number of shells brought by the boys) to four times the number of shells brought by the boys, which is 4 x 600 = 2400. So, the girls brought back 600 + 2400 = 3000 shells.

Since there are 10 girls, we'll divide the total number of shells they brought back (3000) by 10 to find out how many shells each girl brought. That's 3000 / 10 = 300.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Elvis's savings goal for April. He wants to save a total of $1125 for the month, and he's planning to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half.

Since April has 30 days, we can divide the month into two halves of 15 days each. Let's say Elvis saves 'x' dollars per day in the first half. Then, in the second half, he'll save 2x dollars per day.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half. We can set up an equation to represent this:

15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Combine like terms:
15x + 30x = 1125
45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So, Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2x = 2 * 25 = 50 dollars per day in the second half.

First, she bought three apples at $1.50 each, so that's 3 x $1.50 = $4.50. Then, she got five oranges at $0.80 each, which is 5 x $0.80 = $4.00. Lastly, she purchased six peaches at $0.75 each, so that's 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the fruits: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave: $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

$7.00"
"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem. Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and Jenny gets $0.5 for each task. They both finished 20 tasks.

To find out how much Jairus will get, we multiply the number of tasks by the amount he gets per task: 20 * $0.8 = $16.

For Jenny, we do the same thing: 20 * $0.5 = $10.

Now, to find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total from Jairus' total: $16 - $10 = $6.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, Jeff and Brad are dividing 100 dollars, and Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. Let's break it down.

If Brad gets x dollars, then Jeff gets 4x dollars. Since the total amount is 100 dollars, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

So Brad gets 20 dollars, and Jeff gets 4 times that amount, which is 4(20) = 80 dollars.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem. Jeff walks to work and back home every day, and his workplace is 3 miles away. That means he walks a total of 6 miles per day (3 miles to work and 3 miles back home).

Since he works 5 days a week, we can multiply the miles walked per day by the number of days worked to find the total miles walked per week. 

6 miles/day * 5 days = 30 miles

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Elise's alphabet-writing adventure.

First, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, that's 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

Now, she re-writes everything she's already written. That means she re-writes the initial 52 letters and the additional 13 letters, for a total of 52 + 13 = 65 letters re-written.

To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters from each step: 52 (initial) + 13 (half) + 65 (re-written) = 130 letters.

"Let's break down the phone tree to figure out how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls.

Ali starts by calling 3 families. Then, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, which means 3 * 3 = 9 new families are notified in the second round.

In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so 9 * 3 = 27 new families are notified.

Now, for the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families. To find the total number of new families notified in the fourth round, we multiply 27 by 3.

27 * 3 = 81

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's figure out Mark's initial weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, and his final weight was 70 pounds. To find his initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and add it to his final weight.

First, let's find the total weight lost: 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the total weight lost to his final weight: 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

"I'd be happy to help with that problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of toys Jonathan needs to have a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys, we multiply that number by 5 to get 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Now, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach 400 toys. To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we can set up a simple equation. Let's say Jonathan currently has x toys. Then, we can write the equation as x + 2 = 400.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation, which gives us x = 398.

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's calculate the total amount Daniel has to spend on the school supplies.

First, we need to find the total cost of the items before the discount. Daniel wants to buy five notebooks at $1.50 each, so that's 5 * $1.50 = $7.50. He also wants two pens at $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. Additionally, he needs one calculator for $12 and one geometry set for $10.

Now, let's add up the costs: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1: $30 * 0.1 = $3.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the amount Daniel has to spend: $30 - $3 = $27.

For the remaining $1500, she earns a 40% commission, since it's 30% plus an additional 10% for sales over $1000. That's $1500 * 0.40 = $600.

To find her total commission, we add those two amounts together: $300 + $600 = $900.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's figure out how many water bottles Bill needs to buy for his party.

Bill has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, he already has:
2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

He's expecting 70 guests and wants to have 2 bottles of water for each guest. That's a total of:
70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Now, let's subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he wants:
140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into this problem. We're given that Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold. When the water is warm, he takes 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. To find the time it takes him to swim a mile in warm water, we'll first calculate twice the time it takes in cold water, which is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim in hot water, we'll assume that the time for warm water is the same as the time for hot water, which is 34 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we can divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings. So, $80 / $40/week = 2 weeks.

"Hey there, let's solve this problem together. We have a bag of buttons with 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes, and the rest have 4 holes. To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in each type of button and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes. Since there are 7 buttons with 2 holes, we multiply 7 by 2:
7 * 2 = 14 holes

Now, let's find the number of buttons with 4 holes. We subtract the number of buttons with 2 holes from the total number of buttons:
21 - 7 = 14 buttons

Since each of these 14 buttons has 4 holes, we multiply 14 by 4:
14 * 4 = 56 holes

Finally, we add the holes from both types of buttons to find the total number of holes:
14 + 56 = 70 holes

Zack's locker size = 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we'll divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker size = 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

Next, we're told Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. To find Bob's weight, we multiply Susan's weight by 2: 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now that we have all their weights, we can find the total weight by adding them together: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

Finally, to find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves for 10 hours, so we need to calculate how many degrees it's moved. To do that, we multiply the rate of movement (5 degrees per hour) by the number of hours (10 hours), which gives us 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Now, we add the angle the sun has moved (50 degrees) to the initial angle of the pyramid (32 degrees). This gives us a total angle of 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's figure out how much James spends on birthday candles for his sons. 

First, we need to determine the total number of candles James needs. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, which makes the younger son 8 years old. So, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

So James needs 4 packs of candles. The total cost will be the number of packs multiplied by the cost per pack: 4 * $3 = $12.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:
105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages = 105 / 1.5 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"I'd be happy to help you with that problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, and in 7 years, he'll be three times as old as his nephew. To start, we'll calculate Shiloh's age in 7 years: 44 + 7 = 51.

Now, we're told that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship: 51 = 3 * nephew's age in 7 years.

To find the nephew's age in 7 years, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3: 51 / 3 = 17. This means the nephew will be 17 years old in 7 years.

Finally, to find the nephew's current age, we'll subtract 7 from his age in 7 years: 17 - 7 = 10.

Now, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount she received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she got $1.00 for each of those teeth, half of that is $0.50 per tooth. So, for the last two teeth, she got 2 x $0.50 = $1.00.

To find the total amount, we add the amounts together: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new carpet. It costs $12 per square foot, so for 216 square feet, it will be $12 * 216 = $2592.

Next, we need to add the cost of the padding underneath, which is $2 per square foot. For 216 square feet, that's $2 * 216 = $432.

The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, so for 216 square feet, that's $4 * 216 = $864.

Finally, the contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet, so for 216 square feet, that's $34 * 216 = $7344.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. Maggie's oven is malfunctioning, and we need to figure out what temperature she should set it to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off. We know that when Maggie sets it to 450, the actual temperature is 468. To find the percentage, we'll calculate the difference between the actual and set temperatures, then divide by the set temperature.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18. Now, let's calculate the percentage: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%. So, the oven is off by 4%.

Now that we know the percentage, we can find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Let's call this temperature x. Since the oven is off by 4%, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x), which should equal 520.

To find 4% of x, we multiply x by 0.04: x + 0.04x = 520. Combining like terms, we get 1.04x = 520. Dividing both sides by 1.04, we find that x = 500.

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

Her friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84
Total utensils: 36 + 84 = 120

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem. Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts, and each box has 90 contacts. Since he's buying 2 boxes, that's a total of 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

Now, let's talk about the cost. Each box is originally $100, but it's 10% off. To find the discount, we multiply $100 by 0.10, which gives us $10. So, the cost of one box is $100 - $10 = $90. Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost is $90 * 2 = $180.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of contacts. But, since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), we'll divide the total cost by the total number of contacts and then multiply by 2. However, we can simplify this by just dividing the total cost by the total number of pairs of contacts. Since there are 180 contacts, there are 180 / 2 = 90 pairs of contacts.

Now, let's calculate the cost of each pair of contacts:
$180 / 90 pairs = $2 per pair.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Tabitha agreed to pay John and Jill $10 an hour to help clean out her attic and basement. We know Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate John's hours. He worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours. On Sunday, he worked three times as long as Jill, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Since they're paid $10 an hour, Jill earned 3 * $10 = $30 and John earned 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's: $70 - $30 = $40.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Hannah's water needs.

First, we need to calculate the total calories she burns. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics at 500 calories/hour, so that's 2 * 500 = 1000 calories. Then, she spends 1 hour running at 600 calories/hour, which is 1 * 600 = 600 calories. 

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Now, we know Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many 200-calorie increments she burned, we divide the total calories by 200. 1600 / 200 = 8.

Since she needs 100 ml of water for each of those increments, she needs 8 * 100 = 800 ml of water.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into this jelly bean problem. We've got a jar with red, blue, and green jelly beans, and we know the total number of jelly beans is 4500. The note on the jar tells us that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B. Then, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B (1% fewer than blue), and the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B (1% more than blue).

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of jelly beans:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The question asks how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans. Let's find the difference:

1515 - 1485 = 30

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's calculate Jared's average typing speed.

Jared starts with 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons, his speed increases to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his speed by 5 words, his new speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

To find the average of the three measurements, we add them together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156. Then, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We have two breakfast options for Martin: Cheerios and donuts. If he chooses Cheerios, he'll lose 1.25 pounds per week, and if he chooses donuts, he'll gain 1.75 pounds per week. We want to find the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two options.

First, let's calculate the weight change for each option over 5 weeks. If Martin eats Cheerios, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds. If he eats donuts, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

Now, to find the difference in weight, we need to subtract the weight lost from the weight gained. Since we're looking for the difference, we can simply add the absolute values: 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds.

Next, Alex called 10 of her friends to invite them, and 8 of them are bringing their spouses. So, we need to add the 10 friends and their 8 spouses to the total. That's 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, let's add the people invited via email and their friends to the people invited via phone: 300 + 18 = 318.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. So, you want to know how much more expensive those boots are on eBay compared to Amazon? Let's break it down.

On Amazon, the boots cost $16, and shipping is $4, so the total comes out to be $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots are $13, but shipping costs twice as much as it does on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

"I'd be happy to help you with that. Let's break it down step by step.

Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground, and the beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall. Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, we can track its growth as follows:

Day 1: 4 feet (initial height)
Day 2: 8 feet (doubled from 4 feet)
Day 3: 16 feet (doubled from 8 feet)
Day 4: 32 feet (doubled from 16 feet)

As you can see, the beanstalk needs to be at least 20 feet tall to be taller than Mark's window. On Day 3, it's still a bit short, but on Day 4, it's already 32 feet tall, which is taller than the window.

So, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much protein is in the mushrooms John eats every day. We know that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein. To find the protein content per gram of mushrooms, we can divide the protein content by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

Now, we know John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how much protein he gets, we can multiply the protein content per gram by the amount he eats: 0.03 grams/gram * 200 grams = 6 grams of protein per day.

Finally, to find out how much protein John gets per week, we can multiply the daily protein content by 7: 6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week.

"Let's break this down step by step. We know Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. If we denote Jerry's current age as 'x', we can set up an equation based on this information.

Since Jerry's age 5 years ago is (x - 5), and he's twice that now, we get:
x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:
x = 2x - 10

Now, let's solve for x. Subtracting 'x' from both sides gives us:
0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we find:
10 = x

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find his age in 3 years, we simply add 3 to his current age:
10 + 3 = 13

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help George figure out how many hours he needs to work to pay for his dental work.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work. George needs 2 implants, and each one costs $2000, so that's 2 * $2000 = $4000. He also wants a porcelain crown for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, which is awesome! That means he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, let's calculate how many hours George needs to work to earn $3900. He makes $15 per hour, so we'll divide the amount he needs to pay by his hourly wage: $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

"Let's break down the problem. We have a triangle with three angles, and we know that they add up to 180 degrees. We also know that one angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle.

Let's call the smallest angle x. Then, the other two angles are 2x and 3x. We can write an equation based on the fact that the three angles add up to 180 degrees:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

So, the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"Hey there, let's figure out how many gumballs Colby can buy. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. He has 8 quarters, which is 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents. He also has 6 dimes, which is 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents. Then there are 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents, and 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents.

Now, let's add all that up: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs a nickel, or 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = 345 / 5 = 69

Steve starts with 5 games from his birthday. Then, he buys 1 game per month for the first year, which is 12 games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas, making it a total of 5 (initial) + 12 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve buys 2 games per month, which is 24 games. He gets 5 more games for Christmas, adding up to 24 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 29 games for that year. Now, his total collection is 22 (previous year) + 29 (current year) = 51 games.

In the third year, Steve buys 4 games per month, which is 48 games. He gets 5 more games for Christmas, making it 48 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 53 games for that year. Adding this to his previous collection, Steve now has 51 (previous years) + 53 (current year) = 104 games.

Let's calculate the speed: 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour. Now that we know the speed, we can find the time it would take to travel 2000 miles: 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many times the tires rotate per mile. Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can divide 725 by 2 to get the rotations per mile.

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, let's calculate the total number of rotations per month. We know Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so we multiply the rotations per mile by the miles driven per month.

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the rotations per month by 12 to get the rotations per year.

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we know each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we divide the total number of rotations by the rotations per year.

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

If 2 pumps give 120 washings, then 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings. Since the bottle gives 120 washings with 2 pumps, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

Now, let's find the cost of each pump. The cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is 2400 cents. To find the cost per pump, we'll divide the total cost by the total number of pumps.

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = 2400 cents / 240 pumps
Cost per pump = 10 cents

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

John initially received $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. To find the monthly funding for the first 5 months, we divide the initial funding by the number of months: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial monthly funding, which is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

The cost for the remaining 45 months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

But wait, he gives half of those to his sister before bed. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister and keeps the other 7 for himself.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's figure out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now.

First, we need to find out Charmaine's current age. We know she'll be 16 in 12 years, so we subtract 12 from 16.
16 - 12 = 4

So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old. Now, let's add 4 years to her current age to find out how old she'll be 4 years from now.
4 + 4 = 8

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the shopping trip for the two sports coaches.

The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, which comes out to:
9 * $3 = $27

The basketball coach, on the other hand, bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so that's:
8 * $14 = $112

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we just need to subtract the baseball coach's total from the basketball coach's total:
$112 - $27 = $85

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's calculate the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden.

First, we need to find the total number of flowers in the garden. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row.
10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Now, we know that only 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed. To find the number of bloomed flowers, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.
200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Ashley's internet connection speed problem.

First, we need to convert her speed from kilobytes (kb) to megabytes (Mb). We know that 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb. So, Ashley's speed of 20 kb per second is equivalent to 20/1000 = 0.02 Mb per second.

Next, we need to convert seconds to hours. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, which means there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

Now, let's multiply Ashley's speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour: 0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds = 72 Mb per hour.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the tow truck pulled ten cars for each of the first three days. To find the total number of cars towed in those three days, we multiply the number of cars per day by the number of days:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

For the remaining four days of the week, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars per day. So, we subtract 4 from the original 10 cars per day:
10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

Now, we multiply the number of cars per day in the remaining days by the number of remaining days:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

To find the total number of cars towed that week, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. So, let's figure out how many years it'll take Adam to be tall enough to ride that awesome roller coaster.

First, we need to convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the required height of 4 feet is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, let's see how many inches Adam still needs to grow. We'll subtract his current height from the required height: 
48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the remaining inches by his growth rate to find out how many years it'll take for him to be tall enough:
8 / 2 = 4 years.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down James' earnings from selling those used cars.

First, we need to find out how much the company paid to acquire each car. Since they paid 30% of the selling price, we can calculate it as 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500.

Now, let's find the profit made on each car by subtracting the cost price from the selling price: $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 10% of $175,000, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that 25% of the riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. To find the total number of riders who can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25 (which is the same as 25%):
100 * 0.25 = 25

Now, we're told that 60% of these riders are women. To find the number of women, we multiply 25 by 0.6:
25 * 0.6 = 15

Since we want to find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
25 - 15 = 10

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the price of the diamond jewel is $2000. The price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel. To find the price of the gold jewel, we multiply the price of the diamond jewel by 4/5:
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000 = $1600

Now, we're told the price of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. So, we subtract $400 from the price of the gold jewel:
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

To find the total price of all three jewels, we add the prices together:
Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

Now, let's find the number of rose stamps. Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem. We've got Bob, who's 75 miles ahead of Tom, and they're both driving in the same direction. Bob's cruising at 55 miles per hour, while Tom's speeding along at 70 miles per hour.

To figure out how long it'll take Tom to catch up, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is gaining on Bob. We do this by subtracting Bob's speed from Tom's speed:

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now that we know Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now, we're told Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find Tommy's catch, we add 3 to Darren's catch.

Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. Manny's karate classes cost $60 in total, and his parents have set a limit of $10 per class. If there are 10 classes, we need to figure out how many he can miss before the cost per class exceeds the limit.

First, let's calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can attend without going over the $10 per class limit. We can do this by dividing the total cost by the maximum cost per class:
$60 ÷ $10 = 6 classes

This means Manny can attend up to 6 classes without exceeding the limit. Since there are 10 classes in total, he can miss:
10 (total classes) - 6 (maximum classes he can attend) = 4 classes

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jewel processes 50 customers daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel. So, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers daily.

To find the total number of customers they process daily, we add the number of customers each of them processes: 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150.

Since they work all days of the week, we multiply the total daily production by 7 to find the total weekly production: 150 * 7 = 1050.

Reggie's total miles = 5 * 4 miles
Reggie's total miles = 20 miles

Now, we also know Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total.

Lynn's total miles = Reggie's total miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 17 miles

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem. We know that four apples cost $5.20, and three oranges cost $3.30. To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of one apple. If four apples cost $5.20, then one apple costs $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. Now, we can multiply this by 5 to find the cost of 5 apples: 5 x $1.30 = $6.50.

Next, let's find the cost of one orange. If three oranges cost $3.30, then one orange costs $3.30 / 3 = $1.10. Now, we can multiply this by 5 to find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 x $1.10 = $5.50.

Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges together: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. Bob wants to dig a hole that's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. To figure out how long it'll take him, we need to calculate the volume of the hole.

The volume of a rectangular hole is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth. So, let's do the math:
Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. To find the total time, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot:
Time = volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the costs of Bill's new truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is an extra $7,500. The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so that's $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs: 
$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $43,500

However, we still need to consider the towing package. Unfortunately, the cost of the towing package isn't provided. Since we can't determine the cost of the towing package, I'll provide the total cost without it.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Tim's new salary and bonus.

First, we need to calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 a month salary.
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

The bonus is half a month's salary, so:
Bonus = $21,000 / 2 = $10,500

Now, let's calculate Tim's total income for the year. He'll get his new monthly salary for 12 months, plus the bonus.
$21,000 * 12 = $252,000
Total income for the year = $252,000 + $10,500 = $262,500

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down James' wardrobe shopping spree to find the total cost.

First, James buys 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7,500.

Next, he buys 10 dress pants, which cost 1/5 of the price of a suit. That's $750 / 5 = $150 per pair of dress pants. So, the total cost of the dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1,500.

James also buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he has 10 suits. That's a total of 3 * 10 = 30 dress shirts. Each shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the dress shirts is 30 * $60 = $1,800.

First, we need to calculate the total cost for Clara's purchase on Tuesday. She bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost is 20 * $20 = $400. Since she had a $2 voucher, she got a discount, making the final price $400 - $2 = $398.

Now, let's move on to Sheila's purchase the next day. The price per pomegranate increased to $30, and she bought 20 pomegranates. The total cost would be 20 * $30 = $600. However, there was a 10% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount, we multiply $600 by 0.1, which gives us $60. So, the final price Sheila paid is $600 - $60 = $540.

First, we know her sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. To find the sales from green hats, we can set up a simple equation:

Sales from green hats = 2 * Sales from red hats
Sales from green hats = 2 * 400
Sales from green hats = 800

Now, let's calculate the total sales for the first month:
Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales for the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales for the first month = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:
Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * Total sales for the first month
Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales for the second month = 900

Finally, let's find the total amount she made in two months:
Total amount she made in two months = Total sales for the first month + Total sales for the second month
Total amount she made in two months = 1200 + 900
Total amount she made in two months = 2100

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Now, since 1 egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the number of eggs needed.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 eggs

200 pages / 10 pages per day = 20 days

Since Mike finishes the book in 20 days and the deadline is 30 days, we subtract the number of days it took Mike to finish the book from the deadline to find out how many days before the deadline he finishes.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Lee has sheep and geese on his farm. Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20.

We can start by using the information about the total number of heads. Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is equal to the total number of animals. So, the total number of animals is 20.

Let's say the number of sheep is S and the number of geese is G. We know that S + G = 20, since the total number of animals is 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the equation: 4S + 2G = 70.

Now, we can solve these equations. We can multiply the first equation by 2 to get: 2S + 2G = 40.

Subtracting this equation from the second equation, we get: 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: S = 15.

The number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15."

"Hey there, let's break down Gus's grocery shopping trip. We know he spent a total of $20.00. Now, let's calculate the cost of the items we know he bought:

2 bags of chips for $2.00 each will be 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
A bottle of soda for $1.00
Adding these up, we get $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, to find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the items we know from the total amount Gus spent:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem to find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B.

We know James delivers a total of 600 newspapers in a day. He delivers 198 newspapers to District A and 209 newspapers to District C. To find the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we need to subtract the sum of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total.

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get cooking with John's class schedule. To figure out how many recipes he learns, we need to calculate the total hours he spends in class. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week. Since the class runs for 6 weeks, the total hours would be 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

Now, we know John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours. To find out the total number of recipes, we'll divide the total hours by 1.5. That gives us 48 / 1.5 = 32 recipes.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, we've got 150 teachers on the school basketball court, and 60% of them are history teachers. That means the rest, which is 40%, are math teachers.

Let's calculate the number of math teachers. To do that, we'll find 40% of 150.

Number of math teachers = 0.4 * 150
= 60

Now, since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we can find the total time the math teachers spend sleeping by multiplying the number of math teachers by the hours they sleep.

Total time math teachers spend sleeping = 60 * 6
= 360

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so we can calculate Kassidy's amount by multiplying Aurelia's amount by 3/4. 

Kassidy's amount = 3/4 * $120 = $90.

Now, we know Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount by adding $60 to Kassidy's amount.

Rayna's amount = $90 + $60 = $150.

Now that we know how much each person has, let's add their money together: $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total by 3: $360 / 3 = $120.

Now, out of these 10 management employees, only 30% oversee the entire company. 
30% of 10 = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees

So, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3."

Now, let's add those costs together: $3.5 + $7.5 = $11. That's the total cost of the candies.

Adam paid the cashier $15, so to find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid: $15 - $11 = $4.

Since her first 8 days were good, that leaves 12 - 8 = 4 good days in the remaining 14 days of the first 30 days. Then, the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good, adding 2 more good days.

So, the good days left in the month are the 2 additional good days from the next 3 days.

"Let's break down the problem. We know Janey has 21 books, and she has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. To find out how many books Sally has, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Sally has x books. Then, Janey has 2x + 3 books. Since we know Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, let's solve for x. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 18

Next, divide both sides by 2:

x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's tackle this problem together.

First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can calculate the current height in inches as follows:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we want to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. To do this, we need to find the difference between the target height and the current height:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

James initially had 4 dogs and 4 toys. Then, 8 more dogs arrived, making the total number of dogs 4 + 8 = 12.

When James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means the number of dogs doubled. So, the new total number of dogs is 12 * 2 = 24.

However, 3 dogs left, so we subtract 3 from the total number of dogs: 24 - 3 = 21.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know that three people, Dylan, Frances, and Skyler, invested a total of $1200 in a joint savings account.

First, Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200 = $480.

Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total to find the remaining amount: $1200 - $480 = $720.

Next, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = $480.

We subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find out how much is left: $720 - $480 = $240.

This remaining amount is Skyler's investment.

"To determine by how much the maximum load of the elevator will be exceeded, we need to calculate the total weight of the adults and then compare it to the maximum load.

There are 9 adults in total, including Jack, and each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. 

Total weight = Number of adults * Average weight per adult
Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult
Total weight = 720 kg

The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg. To find the excess weight, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"I'd be happy to help you with that problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length and then added 20cm to the bottom. If the final length is 140cm, we can work backwards to find the original length.

Let's denote the original length as 'x'. When Shania extended the dress by 50%, the new length became 1.5 times the original length. So, the length after extension is 1.5x.

Then, she added 20cm to the bottom, making the final length 1.5x + 20. Since we know the final length is 140cm, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Now, let's solve for x. Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Next, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Chris has two modes for his lawn mower: turtle mode and rabbit mode. In turtle mode, he can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. In rabbit mode, he can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.

Today, Chris decided to mow half the lawn in turtle mode and the other half in rabbit mode. To find the total time, we need to calculate the time it took for each half and add them together.

For the half mowed in turtle mode, we can find the time by dividing the total time for the entire lawn by 2. 
60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes

For the half mowed in rabbit mode, we do the same thing. 
40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

Now, let's add the times together to find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn. 
30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, we need to find the age of one of the twins.

Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation:

T = t + 7

We know that there are two twins and three triplets, so the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages are 44, so we can write another equation:

2T + 3t = 44

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation:

2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

2t + 14 + 3t = 44

Combine like terms:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

t = 6

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin:

T = t + 7
T = 6 + 7
T = 13

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. We know that each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.

Now, let's find the cost of 4 candies. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. This is the cost of 4 candies.

To find the cost of one candy, we'll divide the total cost of 4 candies by 4: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. 
10 lollipops will cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00

Now, let's calculate the total coins saved by each of them in a year. Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year, and Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year.

Since they've been saving for 10 years, we multiply their yearly savings by 10. Rong has 240 * 10 = 2400 coins, and Neil has 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have after 10 years, we add their savings together: 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

John's dog needs 2 vaccines, which cost $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so we can write the equation:
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for x:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. So, let's get to the problem at hand. Larry cooked some dumplings for his friends, and we need to figure out how many he made.

First, we know there are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females in the group. We also know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, that means each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

Now, let's calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females. There are 6 females, and each ate 3 dumplings, so that's 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.

Next, we calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males. There are 8 males, and each ate 4 dumplings, so that's 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.

To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we simply add the number of dumplings eaten by the males and females. That's 18 + 32 = 50.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's solve this problem together.

We know Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, and the cat can run 15 feet/second. To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5.

Speed of turtle = Speed of cat / 5
Speed of turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, the firefighters are doing a ""fill the boot"" fundraiser and they're aiming to raise $6300. After the first 3 hours, they've managed to collect $2100. To figure out how many hours they need to fundraise in total to reach their goal, we can start by calculating how much they raise per hour.

Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can divide the total amount by the number of hours to get the hourly amount: $2100 ÷ 3 hours = $700 per hour.

Now, let's use this hourly amount to find the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal of $6300. We can do this by dividing the total amount by the hourly amount: $6300 ÷ $700 per hour = 9 hours.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Then, we're told that 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes. To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes, we multiply the two percentages: 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 40% - 32% = 8%.

The answer is: 8"
"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. Alex charges $12 per day for tutoring, and we need to find out how much she charges for 2 weeks.

First, we need to figure out how many days are in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 2 weeks by 7 days:
2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days

Now, we multiply the total number of days by the daily charge:
14 days * $12/day = $168

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the ice cream factory's production. 

First, we need to find out how many quarts of each flavor they can make per hour. For chocolate, they make 100 quarts in 2 hours, so that's 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour. For vanilla, they make 50 quarts in 4 hours, which is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add those together to get the total quarts per hour: 50 + 12.5 = 62.5 quarts per hour.

To find the total quarts made in 48 hours, we multiply the quarts per hour by the number of hours: 62.5 * 48 = 3000.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's calculate Marcus' total bill.

First, we need to find the total cost of the items he ordered. He bought 5 croissants at $3.00 each, so that's 5 * $3.00 = $15.00. He also got 4 cinnamon rolls for $2.50 each, which is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00. Then, there are 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece, so that's 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. Lastly, he purchased 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each, which is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, let's add up the costs: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10: $50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get Marcus' total bill: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down this ice cream deal. Erin has $6.00 to spend, and each scoop costs $1.50. The deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. 

To find out how many scoops Erin can buy, we need to figure out how many sets of 3 scoops (2 paid + 1 free) she can afford. Each set of 3 scoops costs 2 * $1.50 = $3.00. 

Now, let's divide the total amount Erin has ($6.00) by the cost of each set ($3.00): 
$6.00 / $3.00 = 2 sets.

Since each set has 3 scoops, Erin can buy 2 sets * 3 scoops = 6 scoops.

First, let's calculate how much candy each of them eats in two weeks. There are 14 days in two weeks, so Ginger eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces, and Amy eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the amount they ate from their initial amount. Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract the amount Ginger has from the amount Amy has: 58 - 44 = 14.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down James' blueberry adventure.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of picking those delicious blueberries. James paid $20 to go picking, and then he paid $1.5 per pound. He picked 30 pounds, so the total cost of picking is:

$20 (initial cost) + $1.5 * 30 (cost per pound) = $20 + $45 = $65

Now, let's see how much it would have cost James to buy the blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, and he would have needed 30 pounds. So, the total cost of buying would be:

$2.5 * 30 = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying:

$75 (cost of buying) - $65 (cost of picking) = $10

"I'd be happy to help you with that problem. So, let's break it down step by step.

Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised for 2 minutes and at her sides for 3 minutes. When her arms are raised, she taps 200 times per minute with each foot. To find the total number of taps during this time, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of taps per minute per foot, and then multiply by 2 (since she has 2 feet).

2 minutes * 200 taps/minute * 2 feet = 800 taps

When her arms are at her sides, she taps 300 times per minute with her right foot and 250 times per minute with her left foot. To find the total number of taps during this time, we multiply the number of minutes by the total number of taps per minute (300 + 250), since she has 2 feet.

3 minutes * (300 taps/minute + 250 taps/minute) = 3 minutes * 550 taps/minute = 1650 taps

Now, let's add the total number of taps with arms raised and the total number of taps with arms at her sides to find the combined total.

Now, let's calculate the slices eaten by Bryce and his friends. Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 3 * (2/3) * 12 = 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 * (3/4) * 12 = 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42.

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 42 = 18.

The dog eats the sausages in 2/3 of the cat's time, which is 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes. Now that we know the dog's time, we can find the average time by adding the cat's and dog's times and dividing by 2.

Average time = (cat's time + dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. To make the calculation easier, let's convert this to just inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we're told that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x. Then, the equation becomes:
9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:
9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9:
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

Mara started with 2 slices of cake on her plate and added 3 more, so she had a total of 2 + 3 = 5 slices. Then, she tripled the number of slices, which means she now had 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

After getting a bit hungry, Mara ate 2 slices, leaving her with 15 - 2 = 13 slices. Unfortunately, while she was distracted, her friend snuck in and stole 5 slices off her plate. So, we subtract those 5 slices from the 13 Mara had left: 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

"I'd be happy to help with that. To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom. 

She has 8 dogs that need to be bathed, 5 cats that need their nails clipped, 3 birds that need their wings trimmed, and 12 horses that need to be brushed. Let's add those up:

8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals

Since Melissa wants to split the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, we'll divide the total number of animals by 7:

28 animals / 7 days = 4 animals per day

"Hey there, let's break down Mark's magic card adventure. He bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so his total cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Now, let's calculate his total revenue. He got a card worth $4000 and another one worth $1000. Plus, he has 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, which is 30 * $50 = $1500. Adding all these up, his total revenue is $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find his profit, we subtract his total cost from his total revenue: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you with that. So, Jake's family is trying to decide between two amusement parks, and they want to know which one is cheaper. Let's break it down.

The first amusement park charges $26 per adult and $12 per child. Since there are 2 adults and 2 children in Jake's family, the total cost for the first park would be:
- 2 adults: 2 * $26 = $52
- 2 children: 2 * $12 = $24
Total cost for the first park: $52 + $24 = $76

The second amusement park charges $14 per adult and $10 per child. For Jake's family, the total cost for the second park would be:
- 2 adults: 2 * $14 = $28
- 2 children: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now, let's see how much they can save by choosing the second park:
Cost difference = Total cost for the first park - Total cost for the second park
Cost difference = $76 - $48
Cost difference = $28

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem. The tomato vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, and he's switching to a new supplier who offers a better deal.

First, we need to calculate the daily cost with the old supplier. That's 500 tomatoes at $.5 each, which comes out to $250 per day.

Now, let's calculate the daily cost with the new supplier. That's 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, which comes out to $200 per day.

The daily savings is the difference between the two, which is $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7. So, $50 * 7 = $350.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Sean has 56 marbles, and Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean. So, Cal has 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

Now, let's find out how many marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we simply add the number of marbles each of them has: 112 + 224 = 336.

"To determine the number of additional groups needed, we first need to find out how many groups can be formed with the 54 students. Since the activity requires groups of equal size and there are 6 groups initially, we divide 54 by 6 to get 9 students per group.

Now, if the activity requires 12 groups, we can calculate the total number of students required: 12 * 9 = 108. However, we only have 54 students. To find the number of groups that can be formed with 54 students, we divide 54 by 9: 54 / 9 = 6.

Since the activity requires 12 groups, but we can only form 6 groups with the given number of students, we need to find the difference: 12 - 6 = 6.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Candy's chair rental business. We know that during the weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day, and on weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

In a week, Candy rents out 60 chairs per day for 5 days, which is 60 * 5 = 300 chairs. On weekends, she rents out 100 chairs per day for 2 days, which is 100 * 2 = 200 chairs. So, in a week, she rents out a total of 300 + 200 = 500 chairs.

Since there are 8 weeks in two 4-week months, we multiply the number of chairs rented in a week by 8. That's 500 * 8 = 4000 chairs.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's solve this problem together.

Gunther started with 48 bananas hidden under a fern branch. When Arnold stole half of them, Gunther was left with 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, making it 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. But then, Arnold stole 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas to his pile, making it 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

So, when Gunther counted his bananas, he found that he had 43 bananas.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. Jeff's catering company sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates to an event. When they were returned, some items were broken. To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the initial number of items and subtract the broken ones.

First, let's find the initial number of glasses and plates. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 items, we multiply the number of dozens by 12.

Initial number of glasses: 8 dozen * 12 = 96 glasses
Initial number of plates: 4 dozen * 12 = 48 plates

Now, let's add the initial number of glasses and plates to get the total initial items.
96 glasses + 48 plates = 144 items

We know that 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. So, the total number of broken items is:
10 glasses + 6 plates = 16 items

To find the number of items Jeff has now, we subtract the total broken items from the total initial items.
144 - 16 = 128

"I'm Lorraine, and I'm excited to share how I traded my stickers for buttons. I started with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

First, I traded 90% of my small stickers for large buttons. I had 30 small stickers, so I traded 27 of them for 9 large buttons. Now I have 3 small stickers left.

Next, I traded 50% of my large stickers for large buttons. I had 40 large stickers, so I traded 20 of them for 20 large buttons. Now I have 20 large stickers left.

Then, I traded the rest of my large stickers for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, I got 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count my buttons. I have 9 large buttons from the first trade and 20 large buttons from the second trade, for a total of 29 large buttons. Since 1 large button is worth 3 small buttons, I can convert my large buttons to small buttons: 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons. Adding the 60 small buttons I got from trading my large stickers, I have 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

But wait, I still have 3 small stickers left, and each small sticker is worth 1 small button. So, I can add those to my total: 147 + 3 = 150 small buttons.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. If we denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x, then the number of votes in favor is 2x.

Since there are 33 people on the council, the total number of votes is 33. We can set up an equation to represent this: x (votes against) + 2x (votes in favor) = 33.

Combine like terms: 3x = 33.

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x: x = 11.

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. To find the number of votes in favor, multiply x by 2: 2 * 11 = 22.

"I'm happy to help Krissa with her field trip shirt order. Let's break it down by size.

First, we have 11 students who need extra-small shirts. Since twice as many students need size small as extra small, that's 2 * 11 = 22 students who need small shirts.

Next, we know that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, that's 22 - 4 = 18 students who need medium shirts.

Now, half as many students need size large as size medium, which means 18 / 2 = 9 students need large shirts.

Finally, six more students need size extra-large than large, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 students who need extra-large shirts.

To find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we add up the number of students for each size: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

The discount amount is 5% of $140, which is the same as multiplying $140 by 0.05. So, that's $140 * 0.05 = $7.

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the price after the discount. That's $140 - $7 = $133.

Now, we subtract those 10 people from the total to find out how many people are left: 50 - 10 = 40 people.

Next, 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. We multiply 40 by 0.6 to find out how many people that is: 40 * 0.6 = 24 people.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply the number of Pomeranian girls by 3, since they represent one third of the Pomeranians.

6 Pomeranian girls * 3 = 18 Pomeranians

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Since we have 18 Pomeranians, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of puppies. Let's call the total number of puppies ""x"". We can write the proportion as:

(2/3)x = 18

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2, which is the reciprocal of 2/3.

x = 18 * (3/2)
x = 27

So, Jana has a total of 27 puppies.

Let's use a variable to represent the number of cases the first house needs. I'll call it x. Since the first house needs half the amount of the second house, the second house needs 2x. The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so it needs 2x as well.

We know the total number of cases needed is 250, so we can set up an equation: x + 2x + 2x = 250. Combining like terms, we get 5x = 250. Dividing both sides by 5, we find that x = 50.

Since the third house needs 2x, it needs 2 * 50 = 100 cases of shingles.

First, let's find 45% of 200. To do this, we multiply 200 by 0.45. 
0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, we add 90 to the number of bananas to find the number of pears.
200 + 90 = 290

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. At $15 per hour, that's 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches 2 classes, which is less than 3, she doesn't get the extra $5. So, her total for Wednesday is $30.

600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

These series movies will cost 1/6 of the price of a normal movie, which is $10. So, the cost per series movie is:

$10 / 6 = $1.67 per movie

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the series movies:

200 * $1.67 = $334

Next, we'll find out how many movies are left:

First, let's figure out how long we drove. We hiked for 1.5 hours, so we drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Now, let's calculate the distance we drove. Distance = Speed * Time, so the distance we drove is 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

Next, let's find out our hiking speed. Half of our driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. Since we hiked 5 miles per hour less than that, our hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now that we know our hiking speed, we can calculate the distance we hiked. Distance = Speed * Time, so the distance we hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Let's calculate the difference in points for each category:

- Enemies: Ava jumps on 8 more enemies, so she gets 8 * 10 = 80 more points than Emma.
- Berries: Ava collects 3 more berries, so she gets 3 * 5 = 15 more points than Emma.
- Time: Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she gets 4 * 30 = 120 fewer points than Emma.

"Let's break down the problem. Bob initially had 7 fish, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. After buying more fish, he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, the total number of white fish is x + 4 (since he already had 4 white fish). The total number of orange fish is 3 + (17 - x), since he bought 17 fish in total.

We know that the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish, so we can set up the equation:

3 + (17 - x) = 2(x + 4)

Simplifying the equation:

20 - x = 2x + 8

Combine like terms:

20 - 8 = 3x

12 = 3x

Divide by 3:

x = 4

However, this doesn't seem to work, as it would mean Bob bought 13 orange fish, which is more than the total number of fish he bought. Let's try another approach.

If Bob bought 6 white fish, he would have 10 white fish in total (6 + 4). This would mean he has 20 orange fish (twice the number of white fish). Since he already had 3 orange fish, he would have bought 17 orange fish, which is more than the total number of fish he bought.

If Bob bought 5 white fish, he would have 9 white fish in total (5 + 4). This would mean he has 18 orange fish (twice the number of white fish). Since he already had 3 orange fish, he would have bought 15 orange fish, which is less than the total number of fish he bought.

If Bob bought 6 white fish, that would be too many orange fish. If he bought 5 white fish, that would be too few orange fish. Let's try 6 white fish and 11 orange fish. This would be a total of 17 fish, which is correct.

The final answer is: 6"
"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Andy drives in a week. He drives to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 2 x 5 = 10 miles per day.

Since he drives 10 miles per day, the total distance he drives in a week is 10 miles/day x 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, let's calculate how much gas he uses in a week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, which means he uses 1 gallon of gas for every 10 miles he drives. So, the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we need to find out how much money his car is consuming per week. The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money his car is consuming per week is 5 gallons/week x $3/gallon = $15/week.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carrie's aunt gave her 10 twenties and 140 quarters for lunch. We need to find out how much she spent if she used all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties.

First, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount spent from the quarters is:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, and she spent 3/5 of the twenties, we need to find 3/5 of 10 twenties:
3/5 * 10 = 6 twenties
Now, multiply the number of twenties by the value of each twenty:
6 * $20 = $120

Finally, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount spent:
$35 + $120 = $155

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's calculate the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his garden.

First, we need to find out how many tomatoes he'll get. Since each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes and he has 5 plants, the total number of tomatoes is 22 * 5 = 110.

Next, we'll calculate the number of eggplants. Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and he has 8 plants, so the total number of eggplants is 4 * 8 = 32.

Now, let's add the number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits: 110 + 32 = 142.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. We know that one-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

The number of smart TVs sold is 1/4 * 40 = 10. 
The number of analog TVs sold is 1/8 * 40 = 5.

Now, let's add the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold: 10 + 5 = 15.

Since the rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs, we subtract the total number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, John is trying to raise money for a school trip, and the school has agreed to cover half the cost. To figure out how much John is missing, let's break it down.

The trip costs $300, and the school is covering half of that. So, the school's contribution would be $300 / 2 = $150.

Now, let's subtract the school's contribution and the money John already has from the total cost of the trip. John has $50, so we'll subtract that too.

$300 (total cost) - $150 (school's contribution) - $50 (John's money) = $100

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's get started.

To figure out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to find out the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder at night, we subtract 33 from the daytime temperature.

Daytime temperature: 45 degrees
Nighttime temperature: 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Now, we know the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. So, we need to find out how many degrees the temperature needs to rise to reach 32 degrees.

Temperature rise needed: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed, we divide the temperature rise needed by the heat provided by each log.

Number of logs needed: 20 / 5 = 4

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many groups were formed. Since there are 90 people and each group has 9 people, we can divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Now, we know that 3/5 of the groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. To find the number of groups that brought seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

Number of groups that brought seashells = Total number of groups * 3/5
= 10 * 3/5
= 6

Since each group has 9 members, the total number of people who brought seashells is:

Number of people who brought seashells = Number of groups that brought seashells * Number of people per group
= 6 * 9
= 54

Each of these people brought 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells is:

Total number of seashells = Number of people who brought seashells * Number of seashells per person
= 54 * 2
= 108

First, let's calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

Now, for the additional 3 hours, her rate is 150% of $20, which is:
1.5 * $20/hour = $30/hour
So, her earnings for the extra 3 hours are:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of employees after three months. The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after three months, the total number of employees will be:

200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3)
= 200 + 60
= 260

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month. Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, so the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month is:

260 (total employees) * 4000 (monthly salary per employee)
= 1,040,000

Since we want to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to multiply the monthly salary by 3:

1,040,000 (monthly salary) * 3 (number of months)
= 3,120,000

To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for each song. For ""Deck the Halls"", we multiply the length by 2 since it's being sung twice: 2 * 150 = 300 seconds. For ""Jingle Bells"", we just use the given length: 240 seconds.

Now, let's add the time for both songs together: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

First, we need to find out Billy's current hourly wage. He started at $10 per hour, got a $0.50 raise after 2 months, and then another $1.00 raise on his first anniversary. So, his current hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's find out Sally's hourly wage. It's $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, which is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, so we can calculate their total earnings:

Billy's earnings: 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's earnings: 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

Total number of students: 25 students/class * 40 classes = 1000 students
Total number of teachers: 3 teachers/class * 40 classes = 120 teachers

Now, since each student plants 1 tree and each teacher plants 2 trees, we can calculate the total number of trees planted.

Total trees planted by students: 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees
Total trees planted by teachers: 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Finally, we add the total number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the overall number of trees planted.

Total trees planted: 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into Bubbles' stuffed animal collection. She's got 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. To find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has, we simply add them up: 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14.

Now, Bubbles wants to buy some stuffed goats, and she wants them to make up 30% of her total collection. Let's call the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy ""x"". After buying x stuffed goats, her total collection will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Kris's gaming schedule to figure out how many hours she still needs to play to earn that achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, that's 2 * 7 = 14 days. So, she plays 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours in those 2 weeks.

Then, she switches to playing 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Adding those together, Kris has played a total of 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

The achievement requires 30 hours of gameplay, so to find out how many hours she still needs to play, we subtract the hours she's already played from the total required: 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you with that problem. So, we have two cars on the highway, and the first one is cruising at 60 miles per hour. Then, the second car zooms past it at 70 miles per hour. We want to know how far apart they'll be after 2 hours, assuming they both keep driving at the same speed.

Let's start by calculating the distance each car will travel in 2 hours. For the first car, that's easy:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Now, let's do the same for the second car:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since the second car is ahead of the first car, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

Now, the fifth-graders had a pass rate that was twice the fourth graders' pass rate. The fourth graders' pass rate is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. So, the fifth graders' pass rate is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%. With 400 fifth graders, the number of fifth graders who passed is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's add up the number of students who passed: 340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 320 (fifth graders) = 700. The total number of students is 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000.

Now, let's add the remaining tea to the amount consumed: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts. Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea to gallons by dividing by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We have Jack and his three friends playing games at an arcade. The games cost a quarter per play, and the length of each play varies depending on the person's skill level.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends aren't as skilled and can only play half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is a total rockstar and can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Now, let's add up all the quarters: 12 (Jack) + 48 (the not-so-skilled friends) + 8 (the rockstar) = 68 quarters.

"Let's break down the information given about Tanya's salt scrub recipe. We know she makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. The ingredients include salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. The recipe has some specific proportions: the amount of citrus zest is the same as fragrance, the amount of salt is the same as sugar, twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

To solve this, let's denote the amount of zest as 'x'. Then the amount of fragrance is also 'x', the amount of salt is '2x', the amount of sugar is '2x', and the amount of oil is '4x' (twice the amount of salt).

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can set up the equation:

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem. We know that the charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 coming from organizations. To find out how much the students raised, we need to subtract the amount from organizations from the total.

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now that we know the students raised $125,000, we can divide this amount by the number of students (20) to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours, to Hollock valley shores.

To find the total time, we add the time she walked on both days: 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.

Since we need the total time in minutes, we multiply the total hours by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the school parking lot. Then, during the first break, he counted 20 more cars. To find the total number of cars before lunch break, we simply add these two numbers together: 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, we know that 1/2 of the cars left during lunch break. To find the number of cars that remained, we need to divide the total number of cars before lunch break by 2. So, 70 / 2 = 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"Hey there, let's break down John's weekly earnings. He does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle consists of 5 tasks that pay $1.20 each. To find out his daily earnings, we need to calculate the total amount he earns per cycle and then multiply it by the number of cycles he does in a day.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20, so the total amount he earns per cycle is $6. Now, let's multiply this by the number of cycles he does in a day:
$6 per cycle * 30 cycles = $180 per day

Since John works a full 7-day week, we can find his weekly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by 7:
$180 per day * 7 days = $1260

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sasha scored 14 points in the first game, and Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha. So, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.

Now, let's move on to the second game. Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored, we add her points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and 6 packages of dog food. Each package of cat food contained 11 tins, and each package of dog food contained 6 tins. We need to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food she bought.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food. We multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 88 - 36 = 52.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has. We also know that the total number of cards is 341.

Let's say PJ has x cards. Then Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of cards:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

And the number of cards Becca has:
Becca has 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards

Becca has 153 cards."
"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Cindy has 5 green eggs. She has twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she has 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, which means she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, she has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. To find this, we divide the number of pink eggs by 3: 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color to find the total number of eggs:
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost per pound is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. They also charge $0.08 per mile, and the distribution center is 20 miles away, so the cost per mile is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32. So, the refund amount is 0.75 * $32 = $24.00.

Now, let's calculate the total loss. The total loss is the book cost minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost. So, the total loss is $32 - $24.00 + $3.00 = $11.00.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Boris's chocolate production to find out how much he produces in the fourth week.

Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week. In the second week, he produces half as much, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. Then, in the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, we can subtract the production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Britany's TikTok activities and calculate the total time she spends on them in a month.

First, Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, that's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 72 * 4 = 288 minutes recording videos.

Next, Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs. That's 2 hours * 4 weeks = 8 hours per month. To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60, so that's 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per month.

Lastly, Britany spends 15 minutes, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. That's 15 * 6 = 90 minutes per week. For a month, that's 90 * 4 = 360 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity: 288 minutes + 480 minutes + 360 minutes = 1128 minutes.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the installation costs for Angela.

The interior design firm's initial installation package includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures for $129.00. Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that need to be installed.

First, let's calculate the number of additional items: 
- Mirrors: 6 (Angela's) - 4 (initial package) = 2 additional mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 (Angela's) - 1 (initial package) = 1 additional chandelier
- Pictures: 20 (Angela's) - 10 (initial package) = 10 additional pictures

The cost of these additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost for the extra items is:
2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00
Total cost for additional items = $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Now, let's add the initial installation cost to the cost of the additional items:
$129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

Now, we're told that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30 by 0.4, which gives us $12. This means Roy has saved $12 more than Anthony. So, we add $12 to Anthony's savings: $30 + $12 = $42.

"Let's break down the information we have. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, Mason is traveling at a speed of 8 miles per hour, and he's got a bit of a journey ahead of him. He travels for 4 hours, takes a break, and then gets back on his bike for another 6 hours.

To figure out the total distance he's traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covered in each part of his journey. For the first 4 hours, the distance would be his speed (8 miles per hour) multiplied by the time (4 hours), which gives us 32 miles.

For the next 6 hours, we do the same thing: speed (8 miles per hour) multiplied by time (6 hours), which gives us 48 miles.

Now, to get the total distance, we just add those two numbers together: 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down this problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it would take one kangaroo to cross the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours, we can multiply 18 by 3 to get the time for one kangaroo. That's 18 * 3 = 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means they're twice as slow, so they'll take twice as long to cross the highway. For one turtle, that's 54 * 2 = 108 hours.

The question asks about four turtles, but since they're all traveling at the same speed, the time it takes them to cross the highway is the same as the time it takes one turtle. So, it'll take them 108 hours.

She's also got some money coming in from other sources. She earned $150 from her part-time job and her mom chipped in $80, so that's a total of $150 + $80 = $230.

Now, we know Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has $400 - $50 = $350.

To find out how much she had in her purse initially, we subtract the money she got from her job and her mom from the total amount she has: $350 - $230 = $120.

He also sliced 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. That's 5 * 3 = 15 slices from the small apples.

Now, let's add those together to get the total number of slices he had initially: 15 (large) + 15 (small) = 30 slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the slices he ate from the total: 30 - 15 = 15.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To determine how many more liters are needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we divide the additional liters needed by the liters per cow to find out how many more cows are needed: 10 / 5 = 2.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so 1/3 of it is used. The used length is 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, meaning 1/2 of it is used. The used length is 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm.

First, we know Jack collected 60 dishes, and he collected twice as many dishes as socks. So, to find out how many socks Jack has, we'll divide the number of dishes by 2. That gives us 60 / 2 = 30 socks for Jack.

Now, we're told Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. That means Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

Next, we know Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we'll add up the number of socks and dishes each of them has. 
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

Half of 40 is 20, so there are 20 white shirts with collars, and the remaining 20 have no collars.

Next, we're given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts. That gives us 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts with no buttons.

It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so the total time to clean 45 rooms is 45 * 20 minutes = 900 minutes.

To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to add the new homes to the existing total. So, the final count is 48 (existing homes) + 96 (new homes) = 144 homes.

"I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's start by assigning variables to each person's age. We'll use B for the brother's age, S for the sister's age, Y for your age, and M for your mom's age.

We know that you are three years younger than your brother, so we can write an equation:
Y = B - 3

We also know that you are 2 years older than your sister, so we can write another equation:
Y = S + 2

Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so we can write:
M = 3B - 1

When you add all your ages, you get 87. So, we can write the equation:
B + Y + S + M = 87

Now, let's substitute the expressions for Y and M from the previous equations:
B + (B - 3) + (Y - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Since Y = B - 3, we can substitute this expression for Y in the equation above:
B + (B - 3) + ((B - 3) - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
B + B - 3 + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87

Combine like terms again:
5B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:
5B = 96

Divide by 5:
B = 19.2

Since B must be a whole number, we'll try both 19 and 20 to see which one works.

If B = 20:
Y = B - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17
S = Y - 2 = 17 - 2 = 15
M = 3B - 1 = 3(20) - 1 = 59

B + Y + S + M = 20 + 17 + 15 + 35 = 87 (this works)

So, I think I've found the answer!

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he'll need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. Therefore, he'll need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into the problem. We're given the initial amount of water passing through the river, which is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount doubles. To find the new amount, we simply multiply the initial amount by 2.

New amount = 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons

Now, on the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. To find the total amount of water passing through the river, we add this increase to the new amount.

Total amount = 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 10 people initially infected with the plague. Each day, every infected person infects 6 others.

On the first day, the 10 infected people will infect 10 * 6 = 60 others. So, the total number of infected people after the first day is 10 (initial) + 60 = 70.

On the second day, the 70 infected people will infect 70 * 6 = 420 others. Now, the total number of infected people is 70 (previous) + 420 = 490.

On the third day, the 490 infected people will infect 490 * 6 = 2940 others. Therefore, the total number of infected people after three days is 490 (previous) + 2940 = 3430.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Rafaela received tips from 40 customers, and each customer gave her $20. To find the total amount of money Rafaela received, we multiply the number of customers by the tip amount. 

40 customers * $20 per customer = $800

Now, let's calculate Julieta's tips. She received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of $800, we multiply $800 by 0.1. 
0.1 * $800 = $80
So Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720

The total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is $800 + $720 = $1520

Jennifer bought 12 oranges from the market. She then gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, which is a total of 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. Her only boy got 3 oranges, so the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total oranges given to her children from the total oranges she bought: 12 - 9 = 3.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month, so in a year, she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, which means she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, she earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges.

Wendy, on the other hand, earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year. To do this, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many banana bread loaves Paige baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked a total of 5 * 2 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Now, let's calculate the total amount raised. Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Gretchen has some coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. We're also given that she has 70 gold coins. To find the total number of coins, we need to find the number of silver coins first.

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can subtract 30 from the number of gold coins to find the number of silver coins. So, the number of silver coins is 70 - 30 = 40.

Now, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins. The total number of coins is 70 + 40 = 110.

First, we know that 600 burritos were ordered. There were 50 students, and each student got 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50 * 10 = 500. Mr. George, the teacher, also had 20 burritos.

To find the total number of burritos eaten, we add the number of burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George: 500 + 20 = 520.

Now, let's subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos: 600 - 520 = 80.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know the bumper car rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so that's 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

Now, they have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. That's 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

So, if we add up the red, green, and blue cars, we get 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars.

The rink has a total of 75 cars, and we want to find out how many yellow cars they have. To do that, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total: 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. We can represent the number of books each person has as variables: let's say Anne has A books, Sofie has S books, and Fawn has F books.

We can set up two equations based on the given information: S = A + 25 and A = F - 12.

We also know that the total number of books is 85, so A + S + F = 85.

Now, let's substitute the expressions for S and A into the equation A + S + F = 85. We get (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) + F = 85.

Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84.

Divide by 3: F = 28.

Fawn has 28 books.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's get started with the problem. We need to figure out how much Greg will spend on jello for his son's birthday party.

First, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there are 30 kids and each kid gets 4 jello cups, we multiply the number of kids by the number of jello cups per kid:
30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Now, we know that one box of jello makes 10 jello cups. To find out how many boxes Greg needs, we divide the total number of jello cups by the number of jello cups per box:
120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost. Since each box of jello costs $1.25, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

First, we'll calculate Keenan's monthly share. To do this, we'll find 40% of the total cost, which is the amount Keenan pays.

Keenan's monthly share = 40% of $400
Keenan's monthly share = 0.4 * $400
Keenan's monthly share = $160

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. Since there are 4 weeks in the month, we'll divide Keenan's monthly share by 4.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To find out how many pieces that is, we multiply 26 by 7/13:
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add the pieces he ate each day:

Next up are the true/false questions. There are 20 of them, and Amy gets 90% of them right. We multiply 20 by 0.9, which gives us 18 questions correct. Again, each true/false question is worth 1 point, so she scores 18 points.

Last but not least, we have the long-answer questions. There are 5 of them, and Amy correctly answers 60% of them. We multiply 5 by 0.6, which gives us 3 questions correct. Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points.

The total amount he will make from selling the chickens is the cost price plus the profit. 
Let's call the cost price x. 
Then, the selling price is x + $2000.

The selling price per chicken is $50, so the total selling price is 180 * $50 = $9000.

We know that the total selling price is the cost price plus the profit, so we can set up the equation:
x + $2000 = $9000

Subtracting $2000 from both sides gives us:
x = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

32 (total glasses) - 14 (glasses sold by Julie) = 18 glasses sold by the boys
Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we divide 18 by 2:

"Hey there, let's break down Kelly's grocery shopping trip. We need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and then subtract that from her budget.

First, the 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total. Next, we have the 6 packets of chicken, which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. To find the cost of one pack of bacon, we divide the total cost by the number of packs: $10 / 5 = $2. Since the chicken costs twice as much, one packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4. The total cost of 6 packets of chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

Moving on to the fruits, we have 3 packs of strawberries priced at $4 each, so the total cost is $4 * 3 = $12. Then, there are 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. Half of $4 is $2, so the total cost of 7 packs of apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60

Kelly's budget is $65, so she has:

We can set up an equation using the given total runtime:

2x + 15 = 65

Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:

We also know that she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, and the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, we can assume that's for one mowing.

So, if Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, that's 3 * $6 = $18 from Kamala. And if she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, that's 5 * $6 = $30 from Alba.

Now, let's add up the money she made from mowing lawns: $6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) + $30 (Alba) = $54.

To find out how far Anis rowed, we need to calculate 1/5 of 50 miles. That's 50 * 1/5 = 10 miles. So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, let's add the distances covered by both Dijana and Anis to get the total distance. 
Total distance = 50 miles (Dijana) + 60 miles (Anis) = 110 miles.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, Susan made 100 cookies and wants to divide them equally among her 6 nephews. But, before she can do that, her husband sneaks 4 cookies. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to subtract the cookies taken by her husband from the total number of cookies and then divide the result by the number of nephews.

First, let's subtract the cookies taken by her husband: 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left. Now, we'll divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews: 96 ÷ 6 = 16 cookies per nephew.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Denise read 10 pages yesterday, and today she read 5 more than Daniel's 13 pages from yesterday. So, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. Now, let's add the pages she read yesterday and today: 10 + 18 = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, but he didn't read any pages today. So, his total is still 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 28 - 13 = 15.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, Calvin's making soup for his family, and he's got a pot that can fill four adult bowls or eight child bowls. He's an adult, and he's eating with his adult wife and their two kids. Everyone's having one bowl for dinner.

Let's figure out how many bowls are left over. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they'll eat two adult bowls. Their two kids will eat two child bowls. We can convert the adult bowls to child bowls, so two adult bowls are equal to four child bowls. Adding the two child bowls, that's a total of six child bowls eaten.

The pot can fill eight child bowls, so we subtract the six bowls eaten from that. That leaves us with two child bowls of leftover soup. Since there are two kids, we can divide the leftover soup by two. Each child can have one bowl of soup for lunch from the leftovers.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's calculate how much William spent at the educational shop. 

He bought five notebooks for $1.50 each, so the total cost of the notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50. He also bought a ballpen for $0.50.

To find the total amount William spent, we need to add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen: $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00.

$8.00"
"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks for her class. To figure out how much material she'll need, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For the small masks, Jo can make 4 with 2 yards of material. To make 20 small masks, we'll divide 20 by 4 to find out how many sets of 2 yards she'll need. That's 20 / 4 = 5 sets. Since each set requires 2 yards, we multiply 5 sets by 2 yards to get 10 yards.

For the large masks, Jo can make 3 with 2.25 yards of material. To make 8 large masks, we'll divide 8 by 3 to find out how many sets of 2.25 yards she'll need. That's 8 / 3 = 2.67 sets. Since each set requires 2.25 yards, we multiply 2.67 sets by 2.25 yards to get 6 yards.

Now, let's add the material needed for the small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. Deepa has seen each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies three times in the theatre, and she's spent a total of $216.

To find the average price she paid per ticket, we need to calculate the total number of tickets she bought. Since she saw each movie three times, we multiply the number of movies by 3.

Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 times/movie = 27 tickets

Now, we divide the total amount she spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

"Hey there, let's break down Harold's daily schedule. He sleeps for 10 hours a night, which is a good chunk of time. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so that's 10 - 2 = 8 hours of work. On top of that, he spends 1 hour walking his dog each day.

To find out how much free time Harold has left, we need to add up the hours he spends on these activities: 10 hours (sleep) + 8 hours (work) + 1 hour (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we subtract the hours Harold spends on other activities from 24: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes and 1/3 of his red shoe boxes to go fishing.

First, let's calculate the number of red shoe boxes used. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes, 1/3 of that would be 9 / 3 = 3 red shoe boxes.

Now, let's subtract the shoe boxes used from the total. For blue shoe boxes: 7 - 3 = 4. For red shoe boxes: 9 - 3 = 6.

So, the total number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box is 4 (blue) + 6 (red) = 10.

"Hey there, let's figure out how many marbles Dean has left. He started with 30 marbles and gave 1/5 of them to Jamie. To find 1/5 of 30, we can divide 30 by 5, which gives us 6 marbles.

In addition to the marbles he gave to Jamie, Dean also gave 10 marbles to Donald. So, the total number of marbles he gave away is 6 + 10 = 16.

Now, let's subtract the marbles he gave away from the total: 30 - 16 = 14.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Duncan's current age is 60, and we need to find Adam's age in 8 years. To do this, we'll first figure out Adam's current age.

Eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old. We're told that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, if we let Adam's current age be A, then Adam's age four years ago was A - 4.

We can set up an equation based on the given information:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

52 = 2A - 8

Adding 8 to both sides, we get:

60 = 2A

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

A = 30

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's calculate the total acres of the two farms. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, and Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that. To find the size of Farmer Smith's farm, we'll multiply Farmer Brown's farm by 2 and add 100.

Farmer Smith's farm = 2 * 200 + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500 acres

Now, let's add the sizes of both farms to find the total acres.

Total acres = Farmer Brown's farm + Farmer Smith's farm
Total acres = 200 + 500
Total acres = 700

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is 30 minutes. To find out how many bottles he drinks while solving the extreme sudoku puzzle, we need to calculate the total time he spends on it.

First, we know that a normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. Since an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, we multiply 45 minutes by 4:
45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes

Now, we divide the total time by the time interval at which John drinks a bottle of water (30 minutes):
180 minutes / 30 minutes = 6

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving the extreme sudoku puzzle.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. We know there were 20 red balloons, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, we subtract the bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total number of bologna pieces thrown, which is 58. This gives us 58 - 40 = 18 bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. This gives us 18 / 3 = 6.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so we need to calculate the total miles he drives in a month.

Total miles driven in a month = miles driven per day * number of days in a month
Total miles driven in a month = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles driven in a month = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by the miles required for a tune-up to find the number of tune-ups he needs.

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven in a month / miles required for a tune-up
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000 miles
Number of tune-ups = 3

Now, Thursday is a bit different. He works 2 hours less than he did on Wednesday, which means he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

To find the total hours Bruce works, I'll add up the hours for each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream for their dad's birthday. The cake costs $11, and 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for every 2 balloons. Since there are 12 balloons in a dozen, that's 6 sets of 2 balloons, so the total cost of the balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.

Next, they bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so that's 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total amount they spent: $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2.

$28 / 2 = $14

Now, let's look at the soccer players. We have 16 boys and 22 girls, so that's a total of 16 + 22 = 38 students playing soccer.

To find the total number of students, we simply add the number of students playing each sport: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops were sold in total. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, we can multiply the number of students by the average number of lollipops sold per student.

Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. Each lollipop costs $0.8, so we multiply the total number of lollipops sold by the price per lollipop.

Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240

Next, we need to find the total cost. The students bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, so we multiply the total number of lollipops sold by the cost per lollipop.

Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

Finally, we can find the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $240 - $150 = $90

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's count the number of pets Larry has.

Larry has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, which means he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Larry also has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish. In addition to that, he has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, which is 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

Martha has been collecting shells since she turned 5 years old, and she collects one shell every month. To find the total number of shells, we need to calculate the number of months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year, and from 5 years old to 10 years old is 5 years. So, we multiply the number of years by the number of months in a year: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects 1 shell per month, she will have collected a total of 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

Let's start by figuring out how many cups she used for chamomile and mint tea. We know she used 15 cups for cinnamon tea, so we subtract that from the total: 27 - 15 = 12 cups.

Since she's dividing the cups into 3 rows, we can divide the 12 cups by 3 to find out how many cups are in each row: 12 / 3 = 4 cups.

Now, we know that each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea. So, we can divide the 4 cups in each row by 2 to find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row: 4 / 2 = 2 cups.

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, we'll divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into the problem. We have a pool with 10000 gallons of water, and Anthony and his father fill a tank with half of that amount. To find the initial amount of water in the tank, we'll divide the total amount of water in the pool by 2.

10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons

Now, the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. We need to find out how much water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days. To do that, we'll multiply the rate at which the tank is emptied by the number of days.

500 * 6 = 3000 gallons

This is the amount of water that will be emptied from the tank in 6 days. To find the remaining amount, we'll subtract this from the initial amount of water in the tank.

5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Colby's movie expenses to see how many more movies he can catch.

Colby's parents give him $150 each month for movies. He's already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays at $10 each, which totals $50. He's also seen 8 movies on other days at $7 each, adding up to $56. On top of that, he's had 2 tubs of popcorn for $8 each, which is $16, and 4 boxes of candy for $2 each, totaling $8.

So, his total expenses so far are $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130. This means he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since he wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy tonight, he'll spend $8 + $2 = $10. This leaves him with $20 - $10 = $10.

It's a Friday, and the movie ticket costs $10, which is exactly what he has left. Therefore, Colby can see 1 more movie.

"Hey there, let's get baking. To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, then add them together.

First, we know a normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. Andrew baked 200 of these, so the total calories from the cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, which is 450 / 3 = 150 calories. Andrew baked 300 of these, so the total calories from the blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Now, let's add the calories from both types of pastries: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

To find the total number of Junebugs removed, we add the Junebugs removed each day: 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300.

Since Rita removed Junebugs over 5 days, we divide the total number of Junebugs by 5 to find the average: 300 / 5 = 60.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote Jean's age as J, Paul's age as P, and Peter's age as Pe. We can set up the following equations:

1. Pe + P + J = 100 (combined age is 100 years)
2. P = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than Jean)
3. Pe = P + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age)

Now, let's substitute P from equation 2 into equation 3:
Pe = (J + 10) + J
Pe = 2J + 10

Now, substitute Pe and P from the above equations into equation 1:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know J, we can find P:
P = J + 10
P = 20 + 10
P = 30

Now that we know P and J, we can find Pe:
Pe = P + J
Pe = 30 + 20
Pe = 50

So, Peter's age is 50 years old.

Then, Maria's mom comes out and gives each person 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total, including Maria. So, that's 5 * 3 = 15 additional balloons.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have two machines: the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, while the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. Each widget sells for $6.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a month. There are 30 days in a month, and each machine runs 24 hours a day.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours, it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it makes 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours, it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it makes 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money each machine can make in a month. We multiply the total number of widgets by the price of each widget, which is $6.

The Widgeteer 3000 will make 43200 * 6 = $259200 in a month.

The WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32400 * 6 = $194400 in a month.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the amount made by the WidgetMaster 9000 from the amount made by the Widgeteer 3000.

First, we know that each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats:

15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds

Now, let's determine how much hay each sheep needs. It's mentioned that each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we can calculate that as follows:

2 * 5 pounds (goat's amount) = 10 pounds
10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds

So, each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay. Since there are 12 sheep, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep:

12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the amounts for the goats and sheep:

75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

"Hey there, let's break down John's situation. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, leaving him with 300 - 50 = 250 dollars. Then, he wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he's left with 250 - 100 = 150 dollars.

Next, he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, which totals 5 * 10 = 50 dollars. After this purchase, he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.

Now, let's see how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining amount. We'll divide 100 by 25, which gives us 100 / 25 = 4.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each, so we need to find the total number of letters he spelled. To do that, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word.
Craig's total letters = 20 words * 15 letters/word = 300 letters.

Now, we know Craig's brother spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, we add 50 to Craig's total letters to find the brother's total letters.
Brother's total letters = 300 + 50 = 350 letters.

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled, we simply add Craig's total letters and his brother's total letters.
Total letters = 300 + 350 = 650 letters.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's figure out how many children can be in the drill.

We know that the children stand 8 in a row, and there are 7 rows for each of the 5 different schools. To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in a row by the number of rows, and then multiply by the number of schools.

So, let's do the math: 8 children/row * 7 rows = 56 children per school. Since there are 5 schools, we multiply 56 by 5.

56 * 5 = 280

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gets from the coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles, and the teacher has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles she gets is:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Next, we need to calculate how many bottles she gives away to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles given away is:
29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Now, let's subtract the number of bottles given away from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Patty's Plumbing charges a visit fee of $40, plus $35 per hour (or part thereof) for labor, and the cost of parts. For this particular job, the labor time was 2.25 hours, and the parts cost $60.

First, we need to calculate the labor cost. Since the labor time is 2.25 hours, we round up to the nearest hour, which is 3 hours. The labor cost is then 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

Now, let's add up the total charge: the visit fee, labor cost, and parts cost.

Total charge = Visit fee + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60
Total charge = $205

"Hey there, let's break down James' CD purchase and sale. He bought 10 CDs at $15 each, so the total cost would be 10 * $15 = $150. However, he got them for 40% off, which means he paid 60% of the total cost. To find 60% of $150, we multiply 0.6 by $150, which gives us $90.

Now, James sold 5 of the CDs for $40. To determine how much money he was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid: $90 - $40 = $50.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into this problem. James is swimming across a 20-mile lake, and we need to find out how long it takes him to get across.

First, James swims 60% of the distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, so the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After that, James takes a break on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, James has 20 - 12 = 8 miles left to swim. However, he's going half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

To find the total time, we add up the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"I'd be happy to help with that. To find the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times. Cayley sold 6 copies at $5 each, so the total sales amount is 6 * $5 = $30. Since he gets a 10% commission, we multiply the total sales amount by 0.10 to get the commission: $30 * 0.10 = $3.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal. Cayley sold 10 copies at $15 each, so the total sales amount is 10 * $15 = $150. Since he gets an 8% commission, we multiply the total sales amount by 0.08 to get the commission: $150 * 0.08 = $12.

Finally, we add the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission earned by Cayley: $3 + $12 = $15.

"Let's break down the problem. We know Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. We also know their total points are 45.

Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D. We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)
A + B + D = 45 (Their total points are 45)

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. Solving for D, we get D = A + 10.

Now, substitute D = A + 10 and B = A + 20 into the equation A + B + D = 45:

A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45

Combine like terms to get 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides to get 3A = 15.

Divide both sides by 3 to get A = 5.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into the problem. We're given that the book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Since each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side, we have 2 pages per paper.

To find the total number of pages per inch, we multiply the number of papers per inch by 2. So, that's 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we know the book is 1.5 inches thick. To find the total number of pages in the book, we multiply the total number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book. 

Total number of pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches
Total number of pages = 300 pages

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to figure out how many 15-minute intervals are there from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

First, let's calculate the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. There are 15 hours in that time frame. Multiply the hours by 60 to get the total minutes: 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Now, divide the total minutes by 15 to find the number of 15-minute intervals: 900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval: 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Kim's sleep pattern to figure out how many minutes she slept on her bed that day.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert those hours to minutes: 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom, so we subtract those 5 minutes from her total sleep time: 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

We also know that Kim is a sleepwalker and that day she woke up and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m. To find out how many minutes she was sleepwalking, we subtract the start time from the end time: 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes.

Now, let's subtract those 23 minutes from her total sleep time: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept 452 minutes on her bed that day.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups. First, I'll calculate the number of cups he has. Two dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Now, let's find out how many measuring spoons he has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as cups, I'll multiply the number of cups by 2/3. This gives me (2/3) * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so he's left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, I'll add the number of cups and the number of measuring spoons: 24 + 10 = 34.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many beds are initially occupied and unoccupied in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 of them occupied. To find the number of occupied beds, we multiply the total capacity by 1/5.

Number of occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds

Now, let's find the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the occupied beds from the total capacity.

Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. We need to find out how many patients are admitted in 2 weeks. Since there are 14 days in 2 weeks, we multiply the number of patients admitted per day by 14.

Number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Now, let's find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds and the new patients.

Total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Finally, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity to find the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

Total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. To find the number of non-work emails, we subtract the work emails from the total.

Non-work emails = Total emails - Work emails
Non-work emails = 16 - 7
Non-work emails = 9

Now, we know that two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family. Let's calculate that.

Emails to family = 2/3 * Non-work emails
Emails to family = 2/3 * 9
Emails to family = 6

The remaining emails are to others, including her boyfriend. We can find this by subtracting the emails to family from the non-work emails.

Emails to others = Non-work emails - Emails to family
Emails to others = 9 - 6
Emails to others = 3

Finally, we're told that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. Let's find that.

Let's break it down step by step. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

Now, we know that the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

To find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11.

Let's start by denoting the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught as 'x'. Then, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is 4x - 13, and the number of Pokémon Alex has caught is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

Since the total number of Pokémon caught is 339, we can set up the equation:
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon Stan has caught:
Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 160 - 13

In the second leg, the bird changes direction and flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this leg is: 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles.

In the third leg, the bird changes direction again and flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this leg is: 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, let's find the net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes. Since the bird traveled north in the second leg, we subtract this distance from the total distance traveled south: 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

Now, let's move on to the apple pie. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so that's 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

In total, Sunny sold 11 + 15 = 26 boxes of apple pie.

Now that we know the total number of boxes sold, we can calculate the total amount of money Sunny earned. The gingerbread costs $6 per box, and the apple pie costs $15 per box.

25 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $150
26 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $390

Adding these amounts together, we get the total amount Sunny earned:

$150 + $390 = $540

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Pamela's sunscreen needs for her vacation.

Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside, and she'll be outside 4 hours a day. So, she'll use 4 ounces of sunscreen per day. Since she'll be on vacation for 8 days, she'll use a total of 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she'll need, we can divide the total amount of sunscreen she'll use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces). 

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you with that. So, we know the blue car costs $100, and the red car is 40% cheaper. To find the price of the red car, I'll calculate 40% of $100, which is 0.4 * $100 = $40. Then, I'll subtract that from the price of the blue car: $100 - $40 = $60.

So, the red car costs $60, and the blue car costs $100. To find the total cost of both cars, I'll add those two prices together: $100 + $60 = $160.

"Let's break down the information given about Emil and his family.

Emil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48. Since 5 years will pass before Emil turns 24, his dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43.

When Emil turns 24, he will also be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12. Since 5 years will pass before Emil turns 24, his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7.

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother:
Sum = Dad's age + Brother's age
Sum = 43 + 7
Sum = 50

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads. That's a great start to her collection.

Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads from her sister.

Her friend was super generous and gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave. That's 2 * 20 = 40 beads from her friend.

Now, let's add up all the beads Adrianne received: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90.

"Hey there, let's break down Joe's crawfish catch. On Thursday, he caught 3 pounds. Then on Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half of his Friday catch, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up all the pounds of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3. So, 21 / 3 = 7.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate that as 20% of 30 students, which is 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Now, we need to find out how many students are left in the class after the football players are accounted for. That would be 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Next, we're told that 25% of the remaining students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. So, we can calculate that as 25% of 24 students, which is 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we need to find the total number of students leaving early, which is the sum of the football players, cheerleaders, and band members. That would be 6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders and band members) = 12 students.

Now, we add their shoe sizes together: 5 + 25 = 30.

To find the average, we divide the total by 2: 30 / 2 = 15.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. Pat has a flower bed that's 111 feet long, and she wants to fill it with plants that grow 12 inches wide, leaving 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant.

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches.

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, let's calculate the total space each plant takes up: 12 inches (the plant itself) + 18 inches (the space between plants) = 30 inches.

Next, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space each plant takes up.

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants. However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

44 - 17 = 27 flowers

Each flower costs $6, so Pat will spend:

27 flowers * $6/flower = $162

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, and his brother eats half as many. To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to divide 18 by 2.

18 / 2 = 9

So, Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day. To find out how many he eats in a week, we multiply 9 by 7 (the number of days in a week).

9 * 7 = 63

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill, and for each basket, she wants 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines. To find the total number of petunias and sweet potato vines needed, we multiply the number of each plant by the number of baskets.

For petunias: 3 petunias/basket * 5 baskets = 15 petunias
For sweet potato vines: 2 vines/basket * 5 baskets = 10 vines

Now, let's calculate the cost of the petunias and sweet potato vines. The petunias cost $3.00 each, and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each.

Cost of petunias: 15 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $45.00
Cost of sweet potato vines: 10 vines * $2.50/vine = $25.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the petunias and sweet potato vines.

Total cost: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. Artemis and her father have a 30-pound bag of soil, and they want to plant some flowers. We know that each rose needs 1 pound of soil, each carnation needs 1.5 pounds, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds.

They've already decided to plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations. To find out how much soil they'll use for these flowers, we need to do some calculations.

For the sunflowers: 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
For the carnations: 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Adding these together, we get: 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, let's subtract the soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil: 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is: 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"Hey there, let's break down Jessica's shoe-buying power. She makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. To find out how much she saves each month, we'll calculate 25% of $2,000.00.

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00 per month

Since she saves $500.00 per month, in a year she'll have:
$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of shoes she can buy in a year is:
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, we need to determine how long it takes her to saute 90 shrimp. She can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can saute 3 shrimp per minute. To saute 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 3 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to saute the shrimp. The total time is 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total temperature change when the air conditioner was running on low for 3 hours. Since it cools the room by 2 degrees an hour, the temperature change is 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.

Next, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the temperature change is 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.

Now, let's add the temperature changes: 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees. This is the total cooling effect.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. The temperature increase is 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.

To find the net temperature change, we subtract the warming from the cooling: 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"I'd be happy to help you with that problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Now, we're told that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 from his age when he saw it for the second time. So, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

He also writes 2 checks to the church every month, which is 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.

And then there's the quarterly check for the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, that's 1 * 4 = 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up all these checks: 24 (electric and gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks per year.

Now, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. To find the number of flights to Greece, we multiply 88 by 3/4, which gives us 66 flights. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

These 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we divide 22 by 2, which gives us 11 flights.

"Hello there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into the problem of the three little wolves and their howling habits.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds, which is our starting point. Chikote, being the enthusiastic howler that he is, howls for twice as long as Tobias. So, Chikote's howl lasts for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.

Now, Igneous is a bit of a show-off, howling for as long as the other two wolves combined. That means Igneous howls for 20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) = 60 seconds.

To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we simply add their individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

Since we want the answer in minutes, we'll convert the total seconds to minutes by dividing by 60 (because there are 60 seconds in a minute). So, 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's solve this problem together.

We have four children: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the total age of the children is 20. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.

First, let's find the average age of the group. Since there are 4 children, we can set up an equation using the total age and the number of children:
Total age = Average age * Number of children
20 = Average age * 4

Now, divide both sides by 4 to find the average age:
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can find her age by multiplying the average age by 2:
Helene's age = 2 * Average age
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

Now, let's find Wilfred's age. We know the ages of Akbar (3 years old), Alessandro (4 years old), and Helene (10 years old). We can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of the other three children from the total age:
Wilfred's age = Total age - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age)
Wilfred's age = 20 - (3 + 4 + 10)
Wilfred's age = 20 - 17
Wilfred's age = 3

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of cookies that were brought to the wedding reception. Since each of the 100 guests brought a plate of 15 cookies, we can calculate the total number of cookies as follows:

Total number of cookies = Number of guests * Number of cookies per guest
Total number of cookies = 100 * 15
Total number of cookies = 1500

Now, the bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. So, we need to find half of 1500.

Number of cookies given to the church = 1/2 * Total number of cookies
Number of cookies given to the church = 1/2 * 1500
Number of cookies given to the church = 750

Finally, we know that each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we can divide the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received.

Number of people in the church next door = Number of cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
Number of people in the church next door = 750 / 15
Number of people in the church next door = 50

Let's say each kid gets a slice of size x. Then, each adult gets a slice of size 2x. To find the total number of slices, we add up the slices for the kids and the adults. That's 4x (for the kids) + 2(2x) (for the adults) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Now, we know each adult gets 2x. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (2x / 8x) * 100

First, we need to calculate the time he'll spend on rounds and appointments. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes, so that's 9 * 20 = 180 minutes. He also has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes, which adds up to 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

Adding these together, we get 180 + 300 = 480 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour), which gives us 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

Now, let's subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time Doctor Jones is spending at the clinic: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars he has (64) by the number of boxes he has (4). This gives us 64 ÷ 4 = 16 chocolate bars per box.

To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars she has (56) by the number of boxes she has (7). This gives us 56 ÷ 7 = 8 chocolate bars per box.

Now, let's find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We subtract the number of chocolate bars Martha has in each box (8) from the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box (16). This gives us 16 - 8 = 8.

Now, since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we can calculate the total number of babies born in a month.

Number of babies per month = 30 * 4 = 120

To find the total number of babies born in a year, we multiply the number of babies per month by 12.

Number of babies per year = 120 * 12 = 1440

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's add up the total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days: 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that after 5 hours of losing 9% of the total capacity each hour, the power bank started losing 7% of the total capacity each hour for 3 hours. At the end of this time, the charge remaining was 28%.

First, let's calculate the charge before the power bank started losing 7% each hour. Since it lost 7% each hour for 3 hours, the total loss during this time is 7% * 3 = 21%. So, the charge before this was 28% + 21% = 49%.

Now, let's calculate the charge before the power bank started losing 9% each hour. Since it lost 9% each hour for 5 hours, the total loss during this time is 9% * 5 = 45%. So, the charge before this was 49% + 45% = 94%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Janet's situation. She's a waitress making $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, which adds up to $25 per hour. Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Janet wants to save up for a down payment on a $10000 car, and she's aiming to save 20% of the cost. To calculate the down payment, we multiply the car's price by 0.20: $10000 * 0.20 = $2000.

Now, let's figure out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment. We'll divide the down payment by her weekly earnings: $2000 / $1000 per week = 2 weeks.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's figure out how many plums Jamaar can buy.

Jamaar has already purchased 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples. We need to calculate the total cost of these fruits and subtract that from the $10 he has.

The cost of the fruits is as follows:
3 peaches at $.5 each = 3 * .5 = $1.5
4 pears at $.5 each = 4 * .5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each = 2 * 1 = $2
5 apples at $.75 each = 5 * .75 = $3.75

Adding up the cost of these fruits, we get:
$1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the $10 Jamaar has:
$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Jamaar has $0.75 left to spend on plums. Since plums cost $.25 each, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $.25 = 3

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Anne has a box of sweets with 15 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces. She decides to keep 2 packs for herself and gives the rest to her 10 friends, dividing them equally.

First, we need to find out how many packs she gave away. Since she kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces she gave away. With 13 packs and 60 pieces in each pack, that's 13 * 60 = 780 pieces.

To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends. So, 780 / 10 = 78.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's calculate the price of carrots after three years. 

The initial price of carrots is $120, and it increases by 5% every year. To find the price after three years, we'll calculate the price increase for each year and add it to the initial price.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put the same number of pics into 8 albums. We know that 3 of the albums were selfies only and 2 of the albums were portraits.

First, we need to find out how many pictures are in each album. To do that, we'll divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

72 pictures ÷ 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now that we know there are 9 pictures in each album, we can find the total number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, we multiply 3 albums by 9 pictures per album.

3 albums × 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies

Similarly, since 2 albums were portraits, we multiply 2 albums by 9 pictures per album.

2 albums × 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits

To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we add the number of selfies and portraits together.

27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45

The 15 guests who opted for a late checkout were already included in the initial count, so we don't need to subtract them. Now, let's move on to the new check-ins.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. That's 2 * 15 = 30 new guests. Adding these to the current total, we get 76 + 30 = 106 guests.

Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, bringing the total to 106 + 7 = 113 guests.

So, John picked 4 bananas on Wednesday and 6 bananas on Thursday. That's a total of 4 + 6 = 10 bananas so far.

On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, he picked 3 * 4 = 12 bananas on Friday.

Now, let's add all the bananas together: 10 (from Wednesday and Thursday) + 12 (from Friday) = 22 bananas.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many questions are easy, average, and difficult. We know that 40% of the 60 questions are easy. To find the number of easy questions, we multiply 60 by 0.4.

Easy questions = 60 * 0.4 = 24

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we can find the number of average and difficult questions by subtracting the percentage of easy questions from 100% and multiplying the result by 60.

Average and difficult questions = 60 * (100% - 40%) = 60 * 0.6 = 36

Now, we divide the average and difficult questions by 2, since they are equally divided.

Average questions = 36 / 2 = 18
Difficult questions = 36 / 2 = 18

Next, we need to find out how many questions Aries is sure to get correctly. We know that she's sure to get 75% of the easy questions, and half of the average and difficult questions.

Easy questions correct = 24 * 0.75 = 18
Average questions correct = 18 * 0.5 = 9
Difficult questions correct = 18 * 0.5 = 9

Finally, we add up the number of questions Aries is sure to get correctly.

Total questions correct = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

"I'd be happy to help you out. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

We're also told that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold L large stuffed animals and S small stuffed animals. Then, S = 2L.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is 12L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is 4S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation: 4S = 4(2L) = 8L.

The total earnings from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation: 12L + 8L = 120.

Combine like terms: 20L = 120.

Divide both sides by 20: L = 6.

Since S = 2L, S = 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, let's subtract the amount she gave to her sisters. She gave each of her two sisters $10, so that's 2 * $10 = $20. Subtracting this from her total earnings, we get $320 - $20 = $300.

"Hello there, I'm Larissa. Let's get down to business and calculate how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month.

First, we need to figure out how much ore one dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe. We know that a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day. Now, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. To find this, we calculate 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now that we know one dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe, we multiply this by the number of dwarves and the number of days in a month. So, 36 pounds/day * 40 dwarves * 30 days = 43,200 pounds.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, we've got a store that sells sandwiches in three different package sizes, and we need to figure out the price of the package with 8 sandwiches.

Let's start by looking at the prices of the other two packages. The first one has 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second one has 4 sandwiches for $6. To find the price per sandwich, we can divide the cost by the number of sandwiches. For the first package, that's $3 ÷ 2 = $1.50 per sandwich. For the second package, it's $6 ÷ 4 = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, we can assume that the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. So, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

Now, to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can multiply the price per sandwich by 8:
$1.50 * 8 = $12.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Tom's situation. He buys a bedroom set for $3000 and uses the $1000 he got from selling his old bedroom set to pay for part of it. To find out how much he still owes, we subtract the $1000 from the initial cost.

$3000 (initial cost) - $1000 (from selling old set) = $2000 (remaining amount owed)

Now, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month. To calculate this, we multiply the remaining amount by 0.10 (which is the same as 10%).

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sally initially had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she had: 
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Marcus's homework dilemma.

Marcus has a few ways to get out of turning in his homework. First, there's a 50% chance that a substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. And if the normal teacher comes in but doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince her that his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to calculate the probability of each scenario where he won't have to turn it in and then subtract that from 100%.

The probability of the substitute teacher coming in is 50%. The probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%. The probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%. This means there's a 76% chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.

To find the probability that he will have to turn it in, we subtract 76% from 100%: 100% - 76% = 24%.

"To determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive, we need to first calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family. The Fine Arts Center has a capacity of 6000 people, with 950 seats reserved for graduates and 300 seats for faculty.

Total seats available for friends and family = Total capacity - (Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty)
Total seats available for friends and family = 6000 - (950 + 300)
Total seats available for friends and family = 6000 - 1250
Total seats available for friends and family = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we can divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Tickets per graduate = Total seats available for friends and family / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950

First, we need to determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide, and Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. 

So, the length of the fabric will be 6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet. The width of the fabric will be 8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet.

Since Jim needs two identical pieces of fabric, we can calculate the area of one piece and then multiply by 2. The area of one piece is length * width = 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:
3 weeks = 3 * 7 days = 21 days
Total hours worked in 21 days = 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls in three sets. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x.

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

To simplify the equation, let's multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is 10."
"Hi there, I'm Larissa. To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (from 2007 to 2010).

The initial price of the car is $20000, and it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

First, let's calculate the price after 1 year (2008). 
Price after 1 year = Initial price - (Initial price * Depreciation rate)

= $15800 - $3328
= $12472

Finally, we'll calculate the price after 3 years (2010).
Price after 3 years = Price after 2 years - (Price after 2 years * Depreciation rate)
= $12472 - ($12472 * 0.21)
= $12472 - $2618.52

"Hi there, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let's break down the information we have. We know there are 50 books in the library, with half of them written in English. That's 50 * 0.5 = 25 English books.

We also know that 10% of the books are written in German. To find the number of German books, we multiply 50 by 0.1, which gives us 5 German books.

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books. So, that's 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is approximately 1955 kilometers. Bernice has been driving for 4 days, covering a distance of 325 kilometers each day. To find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive, we'll calculate the total distance she's driven so far.

Total distance driven = Distance driven per day * Number of days
Total distance driven = 325 * 4
Total distance driven = 1300 kilometers

Now, let's subtract the total distance driven from the total distance to find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive.

Distance left to drive = Total distance - Total distance driven
Distance left to drive = 1955 - 1300
Distance left to drive = 655 kilometers

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, and we want to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days. First, we need to calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

8 cups per day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we know there are 16 cups in a gallon. To find the number of gallons, we'll divide the total number of cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Romeo starts with 120 people on the train. At the first stop, 20 more people board, so we add 20 to 120:
120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people get off, leaving us with:
140 - 50 = 90

Then, twice the number of people who got off board the train, which is 2 * 50 = 100. So, we add 100 to 90:
90 + 100 = 190

Finally, at the third stop, 80 people get off, leaving us with:
190 - 80 = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Alison's shopping trip to find out how much she spent on athletic gear.

First, she bought a tank top for $10. Then, she picked up a pair of running shorts that cost $5 more than the tank top, so that's $10 + $5 = $15. Next, she got a pair of tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, which brings the price down to $48 / 2 = $24. Finally, she bought a package of athletic socks for $8 and used a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6 for the socks.

Now, let's add up the costs: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you with that. So, you want to know how much it'll cost to renovate your kitchen floor with those new square tiles, right?

First, let's figure out how many tiles you'll need. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. Your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, so you'll need:

200 SqFt (kitchen floor) / 1 SqFt (per tile) = 200 tiles

Now, each tile costs $12, so to find the total cost, you multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile:

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down James' insurance situation. The normal cost is $120 a month, but since he had an accident, it's 60% more than that. To find the increased amount, we'll calculate 60% of $120.

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72

Now, we add this to the normal cost to get James' new monthly rate.

$120 + $72 = $192

Since James pays this amount every month, we multiply it by 12 to find his yearly cost.

$192 * 12 = $2304

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Greg's laundry situation. He's got 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed to take care of every week. His laundry machine can handle 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

For the twin beds, he'll need to do 4 / 2 = 2 loads, since he can wash 2 sets at a time. And for the king size bed, it's just 1 load.

So, that's a total of 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week. Now, let's multiply that by the number of weeks in a year, which is 52. That gives us 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he added 50 more to his collection. This year, he collected twice as many stickers as he did last year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

To find the total number of stickers Leo has now, we need to add the stickers he had initially, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year. 

So, let's add them up: 
100 (initial stickers) + 50 (last year's stickers) + 100 (this year's stickers) = 250

Now, Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, which means Silvia had 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add up Becky's, Jake's, and Silvia's slices: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31 slices.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes.

Let's denote Donovan's part as x minutes. Then, Betsy's part is x + 18 minutes. Since the total time is the sum of their parts, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now, we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to 40:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

Next, Hannah needs 30 painkillers at $4 each, which adds up to $4 * 30 = $120. And don't forget the parking – 2 hours at $6 per hour is $6 * 2 = $12.

So, James responds to the remaining emails, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

Now, to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we simply multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5. That's 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited from Monday to Wednesday: 32 + 64 + 96 = 192.

We also know that 30 classes visited on Thursday and 25 classes visited on Friday. Adding these to the total, we get: 192 + 30 + 25 = 247.

Now, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they got 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of those, which is 40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas eaten. That leaves them with 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas.

To find the total number of pizzas left, I'll add the leftovers from both groups: 6 (glee club) + 8 (football team) = 14.

First, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. He's sending out 700 of these, and each one costs 5 cents to mail. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of coupons by the cost per coupon:
700 * 0.05 = 35 dollars

Next, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. He's sending out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so that's 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so we multiply the number of coupons by the cost per coupon:
1400 * 0.15 = 210 dollars

Now, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons to find the total cost of postage:

This means 5 trucks failed, and the remaining trucks were able to deliver the fertiliser. Let's find out how many trucks delivered:
20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to calculate the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day. Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, we can divide this number by 7 to get the daily total: 315 / 7 = 45 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a day. The first monkey eats 10 bananas, and the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas. So, the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a day, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the daily total: 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for her sculpture, and she's been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she already has, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks she's been saving them.

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, let's subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Melanie still needs 80 toothpicks. Since she saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Since he bought it at 75% of the original price, we can calculate it as follows:
Original price = $2000
Price Mr. Rogers bought it = $2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. So, the price his friend paid is:
Price friend paid = $1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, let's find the discount obtained by the friend from the original price. The discount is the difference between the original price and the price the friend paid:
Discount = Original price - Price friend paid
= $2000 - $1800
= $200

To find the percentage discount, we'll divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

Next, 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes. To find the number of BMX bikes, we multiply 300 by 0.15, which gives us 45 BMX bikes.

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

The prices of the bikes are as follows: MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB ($500 / 2 = $250), and a Trekking bike is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down John's weekly learning time.

John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. To find the total weekly minutes, let's call the total weekly minutes 'x'. Then, the extra learning time is (1/16)x.

We know that the class time is 1600 minutes, and the extra learning time is (1/16)x. The total weekly minutes 'x' is the sum of class time and extra learning time:

x = 1600 + (1/16)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 16:

16x = 25600 + x

Subtract x from both sides:

15x = 25600

Divide both sides by 15:

x = 25600 / 15
x = 1706.67

Now, we can convert the total weekly minutes to hours:

Total hours per week = x / 60
Total hours per week = 1706.67 / 60
Total hours per week = 28.44

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, Nathan's got a bouncy ball that bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. He drops it from the third-floor balcony in the mall, and each story is 24 feet high. Let's figure out how high the ball goes on its second bounce.

First, we need to find the initial height. Since there are 3 stories, and each story is 24 feet high, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

Now, on the first bounce, the ball goes to 2/3 of its initial height. So, that's 72 * 2/3 = 48 feet.

Finally, on the second bounce, the ball goes to 2/3 of its height on the first bounce. That's 48 * 2/3 = 32 feet.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's figure out how tall Caroline's fourth child is.

First, we need to convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

Now, the third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, which makes the third child 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

Finally, the fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's calculate the earnings of the apple orchard. 

The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples, and they sell apples in bags of 10. To find out how many bags were sold, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag.

Number of bags sold = Total apples sold / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200 bags

Now, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag.

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which was half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. To find the total weight before the Allosaurus ate, we multiply 270 by 2, which gives us 540 kilograms.

Now, we know that the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get started on that painting problem.

To figure out the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

First, let's look at the north and south walls. They're 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

Next, let's consider the east and west walls. They're 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add up the total area of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Finally, the cost of paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. So, let's break down this prank situation. Ellen started with 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Then, she took 1 unshaken soda for herself. That leaves 11 sodas - 3 shaken and 8 unshaken.

Later, Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. Now, we have 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

When Ellen's friend comes along, there are 8 sodas to choose from, and 2 of them are shaken. To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of choosing a shaken soda.

The probability is the number of shaken sodas (2) divided by the total number of sodas (8), which is 2/8 or 1/4. To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you with that. So, we have two trains departing from the same station, but they're heading in opposite directions. One train is cruising at 60 miles per hour, while the other is moving at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find out how far apart they are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled. For the first train, that's easy:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

Now, let's do the same for the second train:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since they're moving in opposite directions, we add the distances to find the total distance between them:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to calculate 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2, which gives us 10 days off.

Now, let's find the number of days Billy works. We subtract the days off from the total number of days: 50 - 10 = 40 days.

We know Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. To find the total number of people he helps per day, we multiply the number of people he helps per hour by the number of hours he works: 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Finally, we multiply the number of people Billy helps per day by the number of days he works: 6 * 40 = 240 people.

First, let's calculate the number of people who arrived in cars: 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people. Then, we calculate the number of people who arrived in buses: 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people.

Now, let's add the number of people who arrived in cars and buses to find the total: 60 people + 420 people = 480 people.

Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, we can find his age by adding 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The biggest waterslide is 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet/minute. So, the time it takes to ride the biggest slide is 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.

The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long, and people slide down at 80 feet/minute. So, the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide is 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

Now, let's find the difference in time: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles. Amber ran 8 miles, and Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. To find out how many miles Micah ran, we multiply Amber's miles by 3.5.

Micah's miles = 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.

Now, let's add up the miles run by Amber and Micah. 
Total miles run by Amber and Micah = 8 + 28 = 36 miles.

Since the total miles run by all three is 52, we can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - miles run by Amber and Micah = 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

"Hey there, let's break down Sheila's credit card transactions.

She initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise. Then, she returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract that from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off the original price of $20.00. To find the discount, we calculate 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00. So, the frying pan cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off the original price of $30.00. The discount is 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00. Therefore, the towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the new purchases is $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00. Adding this to the balance after the return, we get $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

"Let's dive into this jellyfish problem. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of those large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The rest of the jellyfish are small and stay blue. When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

Since 6 jellyfish changed color, and they represent a third of the large jellyfish, we can find the total number of large jellyfish by multiplying 6 by 3. This gives us 18 large jellyfish.

Now, we know that these 18 large jellyfish make up a fifth of the total jellyfish population. To find the total number of jellyfish, we can multiply the number of large jellyfish by 5. This gives us 18 * 5 = 90.

Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so we multiply Ben's age by 3.

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lauren wants to save for a retirement period of 20 years, and she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000. To calculate her retirement savings goal, we need to determine how much she'll need per year and then multiply that by the number of years.

40% of $100,000 is $40,000 per year. For 20 years, she'll need:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000

Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck, which translates to:

$100,000 per year * 0.20 = $20,000 per year

To calculate how many years it will take her to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the goal by her annual savings:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

However, Lauren wants to retire in 20 years. Since she's already been working and saving, let's assume she's already saved some amount. We know she needs to save a total of $800,000 and she saves $20,000 per year.

The amount she'll save in the next 20 years is:

$20,000 * 20 = $400,000

This means she's already saved:

$800,000 - $400,000 = $400,000

Since she saves $20,000 per year, she's already worked:

$400,000 / $20,000 per year = 20 years

However, this is the total number of years she's worked so far, not the number of years she needs to work from now. Since she wants to retire in 20 years and she's already worked for some years, the number of years she needs to work from now is equal to the number of years she needs to work to save the remaining amount.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. To find the total number of students in the school, we need to figure out what 100% of the population is.

First, let's find 1% of the population. We can do this by dividing 240 by 40, since 40% is equal to 240 boys.
240 ÷ 40 = 6

Now that we know 1% of the population is 6, we can multiply 6 by 100 to find 100% of the population.
6 × 100 = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys (240) from the total number of students.
600 - 240 = 360

So, the total height of the 4-inch heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches, and the total height of the 2-inch heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches. Adding these together gives us a total height of 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

Since there are 6 women in total, we divide the total height by 6 to get the average height of heels. That's 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"I'd be happy to help Soledad with her hiking plans. To determine how many more miles she needs to hike per day, let's break it down.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June, which has 30 days. To find out her daily target, we'll divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since she plans to hike twice a day, we'll divide the daily target by 2:

310 miles / 2 = 155 miles per hike

However, Soledad is currently planning to hike 125 miles per time. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we'll subtract 125 miles from 155 miles:

155 miles - 125 miles = 30 miles

So, let's calculate how many kilograms Pierre and Paul want:

Pierre (Peter) wants a quarter of 12 kg: 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg
Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg: 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg

In total, they want 3 + 4 = 7 kg of apples.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, we'll multiply the distance by 2:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the toy manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order, and by the end of the 10-hour shift, they still need 20 toys. This means they produced 400 - 20 = 380 toys in 10 hours.

We also know that 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. Let's calculate the total number of toys these 4 workers produce in 10 hours.

The 2 workers producing 6 toys an hour will produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours. The 2 workers producing 4 toys an hour will produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours. So, the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Now, we know that the total number of toys produced in 10 hours is 380, and the first 4 workers produced 200 toys. This means the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

To find the weight of Elijah's first dog, we'll divide Kory's dog's weight by 4. That's 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

For Elijah's second dog, we'll divide Kory's dog's weight by 2. That's 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the dogs: 
Kory's dog: 60 pounds
Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds

First, we find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces. Since there are 30 M&M's in an ounce, we multiply the total weight by 30 to get the total number of M&M's: 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, if John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find out how many small bags he can make: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per bag = 90 bags.

Now, we add 2 years to Vince's age two years ago to find his current age: 7 + 2 = 9.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down this Easter egg problem step by step.

We know Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. To find out how many eggs each of them painted, let's use a variable for Sarah's eggs. Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs.

Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation x + (x + 12) = 30. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 12 = 30. Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 2x = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 9.

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many boxes Nik will need to put all his crayons in. Since he wants to separate them into groups of 8, we divide the total number of crayons (200) by 8. This gives us 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, let's calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and we have 25 boxes, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.

To find the total weight, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight by 16: 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much of the tree John can actually use to make logs. Since he can use 80% of the 80-foot tree, we calculate that as follows:
80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Now, we know each log is 4 feet long, so we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log to find the total number of logs:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we're told that John can cut 5 planks from each log. To find the total number of planks, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we know John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank to find the total amount he makes:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. To find her brother's salary, we multiply Valerie's salary by 2. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Now, let's calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000 and her brother earns $10,000, so together they earn $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Grandma's walk to figure out how long it takes her to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

We know Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. She spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and we need to find out how long she spends walking on the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We can do this by dividing the distance she walks on the beach (2 miles) by the time she spends walking on the beach (40 minutes).

Speed on the beach = Distance / Time
Speed on the beach = 2 miles / 40 minutes
Speed on the beach = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we know Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk. So, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * (1/20 miles per minute) = 1/10 miles per minute.

We can use this speed to find the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed
Time on the sidewalk = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute)
Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time Grandma spends walking on the beach (40 minutes) to the time she spends walking on the sidewalk (10 minutes) to get the total time.

Total Time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes
Total Time = 50 minutes

Her goal is to save $60, so she still needs to save $60 - $32 = $28. Since she's saving $4 each week, we can divide the amount she still needs by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it'll take: $28 / $4 = 7 weeks.

"Hey there, let's count those blue birds. 

We have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 blue birds. Then, there are 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, which gives us 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds. And finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add all those blue birds together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

"Let's break this down step by step. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles and ends up with 60, we can set up an equation to find out how many marbles he has initially. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24, we can subtract 24 from 60 to find the initial number of marbles.

60 - 24 = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we subtract 10 from 36.

36 - 10 = 26

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into this problem. Donny's got two mugs of water, and he can only drink it if it's at least 40 degrees. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other is a mystery. When he mixes 4 ounces of the 33-degree water with 1 ounce from the other mug, the resulting temperature is just right for him to drink.

To figure out the minimum temperature of the second mug, we can use a weighted average. The total weight of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the mystery mug). We can set up an equation to represent this:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:
4 * 33 + x ≥ 200
132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:
x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second mug is at least 68 degrees.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's calculate the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks.

First, we need to determine the number of cows and chickens added over the three weeks. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. Since there are 21 days in three weeks, we multiply the daily additions by 21.

Cows added: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Chickens added: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, let's add these to the initial number of animals on the farm. There were 50 cows and 20 chickens initially.

Total number of cows after three weeks: 50 + 420 = 470
Total number of chickens after three weeks: 20 + 210 = 230

To find the total number of animals, we add the total number of cows and chickens.

Total number of animals after three weeks: 470 + 230 = 700

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, and each pack costs $10.00. So, the original cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. However, he gets a 10% discount on this order. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $40.00, which is $4.00. Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels. To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

"Oh my goodness, let's get to the bottom of this potato mystery. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, which means he had 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, I know it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, that's 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops. To find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop, I'll divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops: 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, let's multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop. That's 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

To find the total number of eggs, we add these two amounts together: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

Now, let's add the number of green and red jellybeans to find their total. 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51 jellybeans.

Since there are 60 jellybeans in total, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans. 60 - 51 = 9.

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, we need to find out how many lemons he gets in a decade. There are 10 years in a decade, so we multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10.

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

We know the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. To find the number of women on the bus, we need to figure out how many groups of 5 men and 9 women are on the bus.

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by the total parts in the ratio (5 + 9 = 14) to find the multiplier.

84 ÷ 14 = 6

Now, we can multiply the number of women in one group (9) by the multiplier (6) to find the initial number of women on the bus.

9 × 6 = 54

So, there were 54 women on the bus initially. If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who remained is:

54 - 20 = 34

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Faraday earns $26 from individual sunflowers and $56 from bouquets per day. We know that each sunflower costs $2 and each bouquet costs $8. 

First, let's find out how many individual sunflowers Faraday sells per day:
$26 / $2 = 13 individual sunflowers per day

Since we want to know the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days, we multiply the number of individual sunflowers per day by 3:
13 * 3 = 39 individual sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

We're told that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers in bouquets per day is:
7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers per day

For 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets is:
84 * 3 = 252 sunflowers

Finally, we add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in bouquets:
39 + 252 = 291 sunflowers

So, Adam buys 20 rocks, and his total cost is $100. Now, he only sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks:

20 rocks × 0.6 = 12 rocks

He sells each rock for $7, so his total revenue is:

12 rocks × $7 = $84

To find out how much money he loses, I'll subtract his total revenue from his total cost:

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes, 6 medium-sized picture scenes, or 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. She needs to create 45 large-sized picture scenes, 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 49 small-sized picture scenes.

First, let's calculate the number of days it would take her to complete each type of scene separately:

- Large-sized scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

However, Lauren can work on different scenes in a single day. To minimize the total number of days, let's try to combine the scenes.

One possible combination is:
- 6 days for medium-sized scenes (completing 36 scenes)
- During these 6 days, she can also work on large-sized scenes: 6 * 5 = 30 large-sized scenes (leaving 15 large-sized scenes)
- The remaining 15 large-sized scenes can be completed in 3 days
- The 49 small-sized scenes can be completed in 7 days, but she can work on them during the 6 days for medium-sized scenes and the 3 days for the remaining large-sized scenes. Since she can do 7 small-sized scenes per day, she can complete 6 * 7 = 42 small-sized scenes in the first 6 days, and the remaining 7 small-sized scenes in 1 day, which can be done in the 3 days for the remaining large-sized scenes.

So, the total number of days is 6 days for medium-sized scenes + 3 days for the remaining large-sized scenes = 9 days.

Now, to satisfy 100% of 2300 people's daily energy needs, we need 5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. Jack starts with $100, and Sophia gives him 1/5 of her $100. To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial amount.

1/5 of Sophia's $100 is (1/5) * 100 = 20.

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100:
100 + 20 = 120

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so if we denote the length of the yellow rope as y, the length of the blue rope is y - 7.

We also know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4(y - 7).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6y = 72

Divide by 6:
y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
Blue rope = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
Red rope = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4(5) = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"I'm happy to help with the problem. So, my sister Ronnie was given $5, and I was given three times that amount, which is $15.

After we both gave some money to our little sister, I was left with 4/5 of my original amount. Let's call the amount we gave to our little sister ""x"". So, I was left with $15 - x, and this is equal to 4/5 of my original amount, which is $15.

We can set up an equation to represent this:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get:

-x = -$3

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = $3

So, we both gave $3 to our little sister. Now, let's find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

$5 - $3 = $2

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem. We've got a wall mural with four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. We know that half of the mural is yellow, and the other half is divided equally among the other three colors.

Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we can calculate the amount of yellow paint as half of the total, which is 6 pints. That leaves us with 6 pints for the other three colors.

Now, since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can divide the remaining 6 pints by 3 to find the amount of each color. 

Red paint = 6 / 3 = 2 pints

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's calculate the total area of Tom's house.

First, we need to find the area of the bedrooms. Each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

Next, we'll calculate the area of the living room. It's 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add up the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to find the total area:
960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. So, let's get to the problem at hand. Alice is counting puffs of clouds in the sky while she eats her lunch outside at school. On Monday, she counts just 3 puffs of clouds. Each day after that through Friday, though, she sees double the number of clouds in the sky as the day before.

To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and add them up. 

On Monday, she saw 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she saw 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she saw 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she saw 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she saw 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds she saw each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We have a regular box of 100 dishwasher pods for $12, and a special size box with 20% more pods for the same price. To find out how many pods are in the special size box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100.

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So, the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, let's find out the cost per pod. Since the special size box costs $12, the cost per pod is 12 / 120 = $0.1 per pod.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide $1 by the cost per pod. $1 / $0.1 = 10 cycles.

"Hey there, let's break down Thomas's situation step by step.

First, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. To find out how many 20 dollar bills he has, we divide 1000 by 20, which gives us 50 bills.

On his way home, Thomas loses 10 bills, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for something. Half of 40 is 20, so he's left with 20 bills.

Now, let's calculate the total value of these 20 bills. Since each bill is worth 20 dollars, we multiply 20 by 20, which gives us 400 dollars.

Thomas then triples his money, so we multiply 400 by 3, resulting in 1200 dollars.

Finally, he converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide 1200 by 5.

"Hey there, let's break down the soccer match goals. 

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals, and team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

Now, moving on to the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we add the goals from both halves for each team. Team A's total goals are 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. Team B's total goals are 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals. 

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk and uses 45% of it on Monday. To find out how much chalk is left, we need to calculate 45% of 5 inches, which is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch per day (if the chalk was full). Since the chalk is not full, we'll use the remaining length to calculate the number of days.

Let's calculate the number of days until the chalk is less than 2 inches:
The teacher has 2.75 inches left and uses 1 inch per day. 
2.75 - 1 = 1.75 inches after the first day.
1.75 - 1 = 0.75 inches after the second day.

Since 0.75 inches is less than 1 inch, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after the second day of using 20% of the original chalk length per day.

However, the question asks for the number of days before he has to recycle the chalk. Therefore, the answer is 2 days before he has to recycle the chalk on the third day.

Number of girls on varsity: 1/3 * 12 = 4
Number of boys on varsity: 1/4 * 12 = 3

So, the total number of students on varsity is 4 + 3 = 7.

In total, the dentist fixes 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100:

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Total cost = 4000 * $3.5 = $14,000

Next, we need to find out how much milk had passed the expiry date. We're told it's 2/5 of the total amount. To find this, we multiply the total gallons by 2/5.

2/5 * 4000 = 1600 gallons

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. If we denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W, we can write an equation based on this information:
W = 5(C + 7)

We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This gives us another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, let's substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
C = 20

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy with $27000. Since each set costs $500, we'll divide the total amount by the cost per set.

Sets of 100 books = $27000 / $500
Sets of 100 books = 54

Now, we know that each set has 100 books, so we multiply the number of sets by 100 to get the total number of books.

Total books = 54 * 100
Total books = 5400

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we'll divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books each school will get.

Books per school = Total books / 3
Books per school = 5400 / 3
Books per school = 1800

Now, let's do the same for the pepperoni pizza. 6 friends x 4 slices per friend = 24 slices. Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, Kate will need 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. That's a total of 6 pizzas.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's dive into the problem. Jay is making snowballs, and we need to figure out how long it'll take him to have 60 snowballs.

First, we know Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. To make the math easier, let's convert this to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Jay builds 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

Now, we also know that 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the melting rate per minute, we can divide 2 snowballs by 15 minutes, which gives us 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate at which Jay gains snowballs, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate: 
1/3 - 2/15. To do this, we need a common denominator, which is 15. So, we can rewrite 1/3 as 5/15. Now, we can subtract: 
5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15. We can simplify this to 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Now that we know Jay gains 1/5 snowballs per minute, we can divide the total number of snowballs he needs (60) by this rate to find the time it'll take: 
60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

First, let's find John's age 20 years ago. To do that, we subtract 20 from his current age.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up a simple equation. Let's say Jim's age 20 years ago was x. Then, John's age 20 years ago would be 2x.

We know John's age 20 years ago was 8, so we can set up the equation like this:

2x = 8

To find x, we divide both sides by 2.

x = 8 / 2
x = 4

So, Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. To find his current age, we add 20 to that.

Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the nurses had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, at the end of the third day, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

Since they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, this means that they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the previous days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

Now, we know that they had 3 bandages left from the previous days at the end of the third day. This 3 bandages is the sum of the bandages left at the end of the first day (12) and the bandages left at the end of the second day. Since they used 28 bandages on the second day and only had 12 left from the first day, they must have had 28 - 12 = 16 more bandages at the start of the second day. This means they had 16 more bandages at the start of the first day.

So, the total bandages they had at the start of the first day is 50 (from the bulk pack) + 12 (left at the end of the first day) + 16 (extra bandages) = 78.

Now, let's calculate her earnings from these hours. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total earnings from hours worked would be 180 * $1.5 = $270.

In addition to her hourly earnings, Jen also receives $10 for each week of complete attendance. Since she didn't incur any absences in April, she gets $10 * 4 = $40.

So, her total earnings for April would be $270 (from hours worked) + $40 (for complete attendance) = $310.

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch per bottle. To calculate this, I'll find 50% of $60, which is $30, and add it to the cost of scotch per bottle: $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles × $90 per bottle = $1800.

Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, he must have planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 + 40 = 60.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. To find 1/4 of 40, we can multiply 40 by 0.25, which gives us 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80.

66 / 3 = 22

So, 22 fish have red stripes. Now, let's find the number of fish with blue stripes. We're told that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. To find the remaining fish, we'll subtract the fish with red stripes from the total.

Remaining fish = 66 - 22 = 44

Now, we'll calculate 5/11 of the remaining fish.

(5/11) * 44 = 20

But then, her sister swiped one of the palettes, leaving Amy with 8 - 4 = 4 colors from the palettes. The makeup sets were still intact at this point, so she still had 18 colors from those.

Next, Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each set has six colors, she used 6 / 2 = 3 colors. That leaves her with 18 - 3 = 15 colors from the makeup sets.

Next, we're told the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, which means it's 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house. That gives us 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 700 shells found by three teams: Alphas, The finders, and Gogetters. Team Alphas found 40% of the shells, which is:
40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells

Now, let's find the remaining shells after team Alphas found their share:
700 - 280 = 420 shells

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:
60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells

The remaining shells after team The finders found their share will be the number of shells team Gogetters found:
420 - 252 = 168 shells

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's figure out how many miles the last dog needs to walk.

We know that Bernie has 4 dogs, and on average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. To find the total miles all the dogs need, we multiply the number of dogs by the average miles per day: 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, let's add up the miles the first three dogs need: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the miles the first three dogs need from the total miles: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down John's situation. He's getting a loan worth 40% of his house's value, which is $250,000. 

First, we need to calculate the loan amount. To do that, we'll find 40% of $250,000:
40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Now, John uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts. Let's calculate that amount:
60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

To find out how much money he has leftover after paying his debt, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the loan amount:
$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

"Hey there, let's calculate how much Deandre will earn from selling the tunas.

First, we need to find the total weight of the tunas. Deandre caught three tunas weighing 56 kilograms, 46 kilograms, and 26 kilograms. 

The total weight of the tunas is: 
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:
128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the selling price and then subtract the cost price.

First, let's find the selling price. Since Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them, we multiply the cost price by 11/8. 

The cost price is $72. 
So, the selling price is 11/8 * 72 = 11 * 9 = 99.

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

"I'd be happy to help you with that problem. So, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how much water the dehumidifier removes on each setting. The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so that's 2 liters per day. The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 4 liters per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water removed on each setting. Brian ran the dehumidifier on the low setting for 3 days, so that's 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters. He ran it on the medium setting for 3 days, so that's 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters. Finally, he ran it on the high setting for 5 days, so that's 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

To find the total amount of water removed, we simply add up the amounts from each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"Oh my gosh, I just love water balloon fights. Okay, so let's get down to business. Jolene and her friends had 10 packs of balloons, and each pack had 30 balloons. To find out how many balloons they had in total, we need to multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack.

Total number of balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons

Now, we know that by the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons they threw, we need to subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons.

Number of balloons thrown = Total number of balloons - Number of balloons left
= 300 - 12

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem. Saanvi needs to combine 14 mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. To find the amount of the second medicine, we multiply 14 mL by 3, which gives us 42 mL.

Now, we add the amount of the first medicine to the amount of the second medicine to get the total amount in one dose: 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

Since we need to find the amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8: 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. John's classes, on the other hand, have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. To find the capacity of each of John's classes, we multiply 120 by 1/8.

120 * 1/8 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to get the total capacity of his school.

15 * 2 = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is just one class) to the capacity of John's school to get the combined capacity.

120 + 30 = 150

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem. Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. To calculate the interest, we multiply the amount he borrowed by the interest rate: 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Now, we add the interest to the amount he borrowed to find the total amount he owes: $300 + $6 = $306.

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months: 11 * 25 = $275.

To find out how much he'll pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes: $306 - $275 = $31.

"Hey there, let's get to the problem at hand. We need to figure out how far off Tim's guess was when it came to the number of red jelly beans in the jar.

First, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar. The jar has a square base, so we multiply the length of the base by itself to get the area, which is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. Then, we multiply the base area by the height to get the volume, which is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we need to find 80% of the total volume to get the actual volume of the jelly beans. This is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we know that each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. To find the total number of jelly beans, we divide the actual volume of jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean, which is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

We're told that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the estimated number of red jelly beans, which is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract his estimated number from the true number, which is 900 - 864 = 36.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

The bus initially had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, making the total number of people 20 + 40 = 60.

On the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop got on the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, the total number of people after the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers doubled, making the total number of people 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"I'd be happy to help you with that problem. So, let's break it down step by step.

Pauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year, and the cost of one visit is $2. To find the total amount she spent in the first 5 years, we need to calculate the cost per year and then multiply it by 5. The cost per year is 2 * 3 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 6 * 5 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost per visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = 2 + 3 = $5. Pauline still visits the museum 3 times a year, so the cost per year is 5 * 3 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 15 * 3 = $45.

Now, let's add the total cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years to find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum. The total amount is 30 + 45 = $75.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups: 40 / 8 = 5 groups.

Each group uses 45 minutes to try the escape room. To find the total time, we multiply the number of groups by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

Next, we calculate the cost of the roof frames. John made 2 roof frames for $10 each, so the total cost of the roof frames is 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay John. $80 + $20 = $100.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's solve this problem together.

Ian has a 40-foot board that he wants to cut into two pieces. The longer piece will be 4 times longer than the shorter piece. To find the length of the longer piece, we can start by letting 'x' represent the length of the shorter piece.

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x. We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it's divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet.

We can set up the equation: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece: 4x = 4 * 8 = 32

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. Aiden is making his famous steakhouse-seasoned meatballs, and we need to figure out how much of his secret seasoning he'll need.

First, we need to determine how many pounds of ground beef Aiden will use. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds of meat he'll use.

80 / 16 = 5 pounds of meat

Now that we know Aiden will use 5 pounds of meat, we can find the total amount of seasoning needed. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, so we multiply the number of pounds of meat by 2.

5 * 2 = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

We know that Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. So, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, let's say Carly made 'c' cupcakes. Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies is 3c - 2.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, which is c + (3c - 2). We can set up an equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

To find the discount, we multiply $75 by 0.20, which gives us $15. So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we need to add the cost of the nail art. Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the distance Michael covered, we'll divide the distance he covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which is 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so that's 20 - 5 = 15 books.

In total, one bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Now, let's divide the total number of books Elly has (110) by the number of books one bookcase can hold (55).

First, we need to find out how many questions she got right on the first test. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct. To find 60% of 70, we multiply 0.6 by 70, which gives us 42 questions.

Now, let's calculate the total number of questions. The first test has 70 questions, and the second test has 40 questions, so the total is 70 + 40 = 110 questions. To pass, Audrey needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct. We find 70% of 110 by multiplying 0.7 by 110, which gives us 77 questions.

Since Audrey already got 42 questions correct on the first test, we subtract that from the total she needs to get right: 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you out. So, Mary's making these awesome ice cubes with fruit frozen in them, and we need to figure out how many blueberry cubes she's making.

Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is 's', and the number of blueberry cubes is 'b'. We know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes, minus 4. So, we can write that as b = 5s - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation s + b = 116. Now, let's substitute the expression for b into this equation. We get s + (5s - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms, and we get 6s - 4 = 116. Add 4 to both sides, and we get 6s = 120. Divide both sides by 6, and we get s = 20.

Now that we know Mary's making 20 strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes. Plug s into the expression for b: b = 5(20) - 4. That's 100 - 4, which equals 96.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ara has been playing 40 games every year for four years. To find the total number of games she played, we multiply the number of games per year by the number of years.

Total number of games played = 40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Now, we know Ara scores 21 points per game. To find the total number of points she scored, we multiply the total number of games by her score per game.

Total points scored = 160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

"Oh my goodness, poor Brendan. Let's see what happened to his marbles. He started with 10, but then he tripped and dropped half of them. Half of 10 is 5, so he dropped 5 marbles. That means he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left.

Brendan then found 3 more marbles, so now he has 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. But wait, one of those ""marbles"" was actually a bead, so he got rid of it. That leaves him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Brendan ended up with 7 marbles."
"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Jason's situation to figure out how many telephone calls he needs to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

First, we know that for every two customers who come into the car dealership, one will buy a car. Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he'll need 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls Jason makes, one person will come into the dealership. To get 30 customers, he'll need to make 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights. Since there's a flashlight for every person, and there are 4 people, that's 4 flashlights. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms, so that's 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights. The total number of flashlights is 4 + 16 = 20.

Now, let's move on to the candles. Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since there are 8 rooms, half of that is 4. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other 4 have 5 medium candles each. The total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16, and the total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20. The total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles to get the final answer.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube.

First, it takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side. The second and third sides each take twice that long, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each. The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, which is 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides: 
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The answer is: 30"
"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs. Given that there are 20 helmets, we can start by finding the number of footballs. Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, the number of footballs is twice the number of helmets. So, the number of footballs is 2 * 20 = 40.

Next, we can find the number of robots. Since there are half as many robots as helmets, the number of robots is half the number of helmets. So, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Now, let's add up the number of robots, helmets, and footballs to find the total number of items Dominick saw. The total number of items is 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (footballs) = 70.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many minutes Tim spends at work in a week. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and he works 6 hours a day, that's 6 * 60 = 360 minutes per day. Multiply that by the number of days he works in a week (5), and we get 360 * 5 = 1800 minutes.

Now, we know it takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with a call. To find out how many calls he deals with in a week, we'll divide the total number of minutes he works (1800) by the time it takes to deal with a call (15). That gives us 1800 / 15 = 120.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings: 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes. Now, let's do the same for the new varnish: 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes.

To find the difference, we'll subtract the time for the old varnish from the time for the new varnish: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's figure out how much water Crista needs for her plants.

Crista has 20 plants, and they all need different amounts of water. 4 of her plants need half a cup of water each, which is 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water. Then, 8 plants need 1 cup of water each, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water.

Now, let's find out how many plants are left. We subtract the plants we already know about from the total: 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants. These plants need a quarter of a cup of water each, which is 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water.

To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we add the water needed for each group: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water.

"Oh my, poor Phineas Frog. Let's help him figure out how long it'll take to get back home.

First, we need to break down the distance. Since half of the 200 yards is on land and the other half is in water, that's 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land. He moves at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so the time on land would be 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim through water. He swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so the time in water would be 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

To find the total time, we simply add the time on land and the time in water: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Alicia's dry-cleaning expenses.

Alicia drops off 5 blouses, 2 pants, and 1 skirt every week. The dry cleaners charge her $5.00 per blouse, $6.00 per skirt, and $8.00 per pair of pants. To find out how much she spends in a week, we'll calculate the cost of each item and add them up.

- 5 blouses * $5.00 = $25.00
- 2 pants * $8.00 = $16.00
- 1 skirt * $6.00 = $6.00
Total weekly cost = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Since Alicia does this every week, we'll multiply the weekly cost by 5 to find out how much she spends in 5 weeks.
Total cost in 5 weeks = $47.00 * 5 = $235.00

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. So, let's dive into this problem. John's got a new hobby - speed talking. His normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), but after some training, he's 2.5 times faster. We need to figure out how long it'll take him to speak 10 pages, with each page having 450 words.

First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed. Since he's 2.5 times faster, we multiply his original speed by 2.5:
New speed = 2.5 * 150 WPM = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. With 450 words per page, that's:
Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Finally, we can calculate the time it'll take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed:
Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 minutes

Now, let's add up the number of people for the first three days:
50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people

For the rest of the week (4 days), Conor saw an average of 60 people per day. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we multiply the average by the number of days:
60 * 4 = 240 people

"Hey there, let's break down the popcorn popping problem step by step.

First, Garrett gets 20 kernels popping in the first 30 seconds. Then, in the next 30 seconds, the kernels start popping three times faster, so that's 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

Next, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels in the next 30 seconds. After that, the popping slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, so that's 80 / 2 = 40 kernels in the final 30 seconds.

But wait, there's more! After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. That's 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up all the popped kernels: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. Tim needs to make lemonade for a pool party, and his recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon. He's found that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, which is a great starting point.

First, let's calculate the number of lemons needed for the regular lemonade. Tim wants to make 4 gallons, so he'll need 4 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup, he'll need 4 * 6 = 24 lemons for the regular lemonade.

Now, his friend Allen asked for an extra gallon that's twice as tart. This means Tim will need 2 cups of lemon juice for this extra gallon (twice the amount of 1 cup per gallon). Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he'll need 2 * 6 = 12 lemons for the extra gallon.

To find the total number of lemons needed, we simply add the lemons required for the regular lemonade and the extra gallon: 24 + 12 = 36.

30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700

Now, subtract the depreciation from the original price to get the value after the first year.

$9000 - $2700 = $6300

Next, the boat depreciated by another 30% in the second year. Calculate 30% of the value after the first year.

30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890

Subtract the depreciation from the value after the first year to get the value after the second year.

$6300 - $1890 = $4410

Finally, the boat depreciated by 20% in the third year. Calculate 20% of the value after the second year.

20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. So, let's calculate the total amount of money James found in the vending machine. 

He found a quarter, which is worth 25 cents. Then, there were two nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 cents. Lastly, he found 7 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents, so that's 7 * 10 = 70 cents.

Now, let's add up the values: 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents.

"Hey there, I'd be happy to help you with that. So, let's break it down. We have 2 brothers and 3 sisters. The sisters are all 16 years old, and one of the brothers is 12 years old. We're also told that the 12-year-old brother is half the age of the older brother. 

To find the older brother's age, we can simply multiply the younger brother's age by 2, since he's half his age. So, the older brother is 12 * 2 = 24 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all the siblings. The 3 sisters are 16 years old each, so that's 3 * 16 = 48 years. Adding the younger brother's age, we get 48 + 12 = 60 years. Finally, adding the older brother's age, we get 60 + 24 = 84 years.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Charisma's meditation and yoga practice to find out how much time she's spent on it in 4 weeks.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes, twice a day. That's 30 minutes a day. Since there are 7 days in a week, she meditates for 30 * 7 = 210 minutes per week. In 4 weeks, that's 210 * 4 = 840 minutes.

She also practices 1 hour of yoga, 5 days a week. That's 60 * 5 = 300 minutes of yoga per week. In 4 weeks, that's 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

To convert the total time to hours, we divide by 60: 2040 / 60 = 34 hours.

The final answer is: 34"
"Hey there, I'd be happy to help Octavia figure out the size of her quilt. To do that, we need to calculate the total square feet of fabric from each type of shirt and add them together.

First, let's start with the small shirts. Since each small shirt is 3 square feet of fabric, and Octavia is using 11 of them, that's 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.

Next, we have the medium shirts. Each medium shirt is 4 square feet, and she's using 8 of them, so that's 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.

Lastly, we have the large shirts. Each large shirt is 6 square feet, and she's using 6 of them, so that's 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

Now, let's add all those up: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. We have a small sunflower with 3 dozen seeds and a large sunflower with 50% more seeds than the small one. To find the total number of seeds, we need to calculate the seeds in each sunflower.

First, let's find out how many seeds the small sunflower has. Since 1 dozen is 12, 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

Now, the large sunflower has 50% more seeds than the small one. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which gives us 18. So, the large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Finally, we add the seeds of the small and large sunflower to find the total number of seeds: 36 + 54 = 90.

"Let's break this down step by step. We know George has 18 pens, and Timothy has three times that amount. So, Timothy has 3 * 18 = 54 pens.

Now, since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can find her total by dividing Timothy's pens by 2. That's 54 / 2 = 27 pens.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Albert's height is 36 inches. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, we can calculate Anne's height by multiplying Albert's height by 2. So, Anne's height is 2 * 36 = 72 inches.

Now, we know Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so we subtract 2 inches from Anne's height to find Jackie's current height. Jackie's current height is 72 - 2 = 70 inches.

Since Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, we need to subtract 3 inches from her current height to find her height before summer. Jackie's height before summer was 70 - 3 = 67 inches.

"Hi there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars the company produces in two weeks. Since the company produces 5000 bars per day, we multiply this number by the number of days in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 14 days in two weeks.

5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70000 bars

Now, we know the company sells each bar for $2. To find the total amount of money the company will receive, we multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar.

70000 bars * $2/bar = $140000

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down Jake's shopping trip to find the total amount he spent.

First, Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. So, he pays full price for the first one ($8) and gets 50% off the second one. The discount on the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4, making the second T-shirt $8 - $4 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, Jake buys a pair of shoes that's 40% off the original price of $40. To find the discount, we calculate 40% of $40, which is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spent: $12 + $24 = $36.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

Ryan gets $6 each week for completing his chores, and he did them for 3 weeks. So, his total allowance is $6 * 3 = $18.

He then spent some of that money on ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Each cone costs $1.25, and he bought 4 cones, so that's 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total allowance: $18 - $5 = $13.

Ryan has $13 left, and he wants to buy movie tickets that cost $6.50 each. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we'll divide the amount of money he has by the cost of a ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to find the total cost of making those jars and subtract it from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of making one jar. It takes 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 per pound, so that's 2 * $6 = $12. Then, it takes 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 per pound, which is 1.5 * $8 = $12. Finally, it takes 2 pounds of special honey at $10 per pound, so that's 2 * $10 = $20. Adding these costs together, we get $12 + $12 + $20 = $44 per jar.

Now, let's multiply this cost by 10 jars: $44 * 10 = $440. This is the total cost of making 10 jars.

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars. Each jar sells for $50, so 10 jars will bring in 10 * $50 = $500.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $500 - $440 = $60.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's count the coins in Justin's jar.

First, we have 32 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the total value of the quarters is 32 * $0.25 = $8.

Next, we have 95 dimes. Each dime is worth $0.10, so the total value of the dimes is 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.

Then, there are 120 nickels. Each nickel is worth $0.05, so the total value of the nickels is 120 * $0.05 = $6.

Lastly, we have 750 pennies. Each penny is worth $0.01, so the total value of the pennies is 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add up the values of all the coins: $8 + $9.50 = $17.50, $17.50 + $6 = $23.50, and $23.50 + $7.50 = $31.

"Hey there, let's break down Josh's car shop earnings. He services 3 cars a day and is open 5 days a week, since he's closed on Sundays and Wednesdays. To find out his total earnings in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he works and the total number of cars he services.

In 2 weeks, Josh works 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days. Since he services 3 cars a day, the total number of cars he services in 10 days is 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks are 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

"Hey there, let's break down Randy's cookie situation step by step.

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He eats 3 cookies for a snack, one of each flavor. So, he's left with:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Then, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, leaving him with:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 sugar cookies (no change)

After that, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, so he's left with:
- 6 oatmeal cookies (no change)
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Finally, Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, bringing his total to:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Adding all these up, Randy now has a total of 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down the problem. Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers and wants to sell them. He found a buyer who's willing to pay $5 per toy for half the collection and $7 per toy for the other half.

First, we need to find out how many toy soldiers are in each half. Since Matthew has 12 toy soldiers, half of that would be 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

Now, let's calculate the amount he'd get for each half. For the first half, he'd get $5 per toy, so that's 6 * $5 = $30. For the second half, he'd get $7 per toy, so that's 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the amounts for both halves: $30 + $42 = $72.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's get to the problem at hand. Nate's dog is quite the digger, isn't it? It digs six holes a day, and since Nate is on vacation for 14 days, that's a total of 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

Now, when Nate gets back home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog doesn't stop digging - it still digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes per day.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day. That's 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

Since we want to know the number of weeks, we divide the number of days by 7. That's 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.

Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. However, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

Igor gathered the correct number of beakers initially, but he lost some on the way to the lab bench. Let's call the number of beakers he lost x. Then, the number of beakers he gathered is 7 - x.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + 7 - x (beakers) = 29.

"Hey there, I'm Larissa. Let's break down this problem step by step.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron. This means Aaron ran half the distance that Vanessa did, which is 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

Now, we're told that Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can find out how long it would take Vanessa to run the same distance. If Aaron is twice as fast, then Vanessa is half as fast, so it would take her twice as long to run 2 miles. That's 16 * 2 = 32 minutes for 2 miles.

Since Vanessa actually ran 4 miles, we need to find out how long it took her to run that distance. If it took her 32 minutes to run 2 miles, it would take her twice as long to run 4 miles. Therefore, Vanessa took 32 * 2 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

= $1.60

Next, we need to calculate the profit amount per watermelon. The vendor sold the watermelons at a 25% profit, so we multiply the cost price by the profit percentage.

Profit amount per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon * Profit percentage
= $1.60 * 0.25
= $0.40

Finally, we add the profit amount to the cost price to get the selling price per watermelon.

"I'd be happy to help you out. Let's get down to business and figure out how many chickens Farmer Brown has.

We know that Farmer Brown has 20 animals in total, and they're all either chickens or cows. We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can use this information to set up a couple of equations.

Let's say the number of chickens is 'c' and the number of cows is 'w'. We can write two equations based on the information we have:

c + w = 20 (since there are 20 animals in total)
2c + 4w = 70 (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

Now, let's simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:

c + 2w = 35

Next, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

So, we know that there are 15 cows. Now, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'w' into the first equation:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5
