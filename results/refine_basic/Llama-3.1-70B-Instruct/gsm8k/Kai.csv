"Hey, let's break down Janet's daily egg sales. Her ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 for breakfast and 4 for baking muffins, so that's a total of 7 eggs used. To find out how many eggs she sells, we subtract the used eggs from the total: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Since she sells each egg for $2, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, and it takes half that amount of white fiber. To find the amount of white fiber, we can divide the amount of blue fiber by 2. So, 2 bolts of blue fiber divided by 2 is 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts. That's 2 + 1 = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"Hey there, let's break down Josh's house flipping situation. He buys a house for $80,000 and puts in $50,000 in repairs. The repairs increase the value of the house by 150%. To find the profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

First, let's find the total cost. The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increase the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% + 150%). The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, this is the value of the house before repairs. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

The selling price of the house is $200,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's figure out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day. Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"I'd be happy to help Kylar with his glass shopping. 

So, Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of the price, which is $3. Since we have 16 glasses, we can pair them up - 8 pairs of glasses.

Each pair consists of a $5 glass and a $3 glass, so the total cost for each pair is $5 + $3 = $8. Now, we multiply the cost of one pair by the number of pairs: 8 * $8 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Now, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which means Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"Let's break down the problem. Carla is downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB per minute. However, 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.

First, let's find out how much of the file Carla downloaded before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the 20-minute restart, Carla has to start the download again from the beginning. This time, she downloads the entire 200 GB file. The time it takes to download 200 GB is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the initial download time, the restart time, and the complete download time: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes.

"Let's break down John's journey to figure out how far he is from home.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply his speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Now, John turns around and tries to get back home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move.

After the traffic, he drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at 30 mph. The distance he travels in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

For the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), he drives at 80 mph. The distance he travels in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance John travels after turning around is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Since John was trying to get back home, we subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the distance he traveled before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"Hey there, let's break down Eliza's earnings for the week. She earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours and 1.2 times her regular rate for overtime hours.

First, I'll calculate her regular pay: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

Next, I'll calculate her overtime pay. She worked 45 hours, so she has 5 hours of overtime. Her overtime rate is 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour. So, her overtime pay is 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

Now, let's add her regular pay and overtime pay to find her total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. 

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. So, the downloads in the second month were 3 * 60 = 180.

Now, for the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, let's add up the downloads for each month to find the total: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carlos is planting a lemon tree that costs $90 to plant. Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. However, it costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree.

To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) plus the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree ($3 per year). The total revenue is the annual revenue from selling lemons (7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year).

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.5
Year 2: Total cost = $93 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $96, Total revenue = $10.5 * 2 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $99, Total revenue = $10.5 * 3 = $31.5
Year 4: Total cost = $99 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $102, Total revenue = $10.5 * 4 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $105, Total revenue = $10.5 * 5 = $52.5
Year 6: Total cost = $105 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $108, Total revenue = $10.5 * 6 = $63

Since the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108) in year 6, we need to calculate for more years.

After calculating for a few more years, we find that:

Year 13: Total cost = $126 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $129, Total revenue = $10.5 * 13 = $136.5

In year 13, the total revenue ($136.5) is more than the total cost ($129). Therefore, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Melanie starts with an unknown number of vacuum cleaners, which we'll call 'x'. She sells a third of them at the green house, which is x/3. Then, she sells 2 more to the red house. 

After selling at the green house, she has 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left. After selling 2 more at the red house, she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sells half of what's left at the orange house. To find half of what's left, we divide 2x/3 - 2 by 2, which gives us x/3 - 1.

We know Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:
x/3 - 1 = 5

To solve for x, we add 1 to both sides:
x/3 = 6

Then we multiply both sides by 3:
x = 18

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We have a dance class with 20 students. 

First, 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance. That's 0.2 * 20 = 4 students. So, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left.

Next, 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. That's 0.25 * 16 = 4 students. Now, we have 16 - 4 = 12 students left.

These 12 students must have enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage, we'll divide the number of students in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100. That's (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%, while the electronic gadgets market will go up by 1.2%. We need to figure out which option will give the merchant the most profit.

For the jewelry, a 2.5% increase on $5,000 would be:
$5,000 * 0.025 = $125

For the electronic gadgets, a 1.2% increase on $8,000 would be:
$8,000 * 0.012 = $96

It's clear that the jewelry is the way to go, with a profit of $125.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We have two trains traveling from San Rafael, first westward and then northward. We're asked to find the total distance covered by each train over the two days.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. The next day, they change direction and travel 150 miles northward. To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distance covered on the first day to the distance covered on the second day.

So, the total distance covered by each train is 80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Jill's annual salary.

First, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching. She earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. She earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

"Hey there, let's break down Claire's egg habit. She makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, so that's 3 eggs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

Now, if we multiply that by 4 weeks, we get 21 * 4 = 84 eggs. To find out how many dozens of eggs that is, we need to divide by 12, since there are 12 eggs in a dozen.

84 / 12 = 7

"Hey there, let's break down Marissa's hike. She's got a 12-mile trail to cover and wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour. 

First, we need to figure out how much time she has to complete the entire trail. We can do this by dividing the total distance by her desired average speed.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

So far, Marissa has walked 6 miles (4 miles in the first hour and 2 miles in the second hour), which means she has 6 miles left to cover. Since she's already used up 2 hours, she's got 1 hour left to finish the remaining distance.

Time left = Total time - Time already taken
Time left = 3 hours - 2 hours
Time left = 1 hour

Now, let's calculate the speed she needs to cover the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

Now, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink. Since it's two-thirds water, we multiply 9 liters by 2/3, which gives us 6 liters of water.

Next, we calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink. It's three-fifths water, so we multiply 15 liters by 3/5, which gives us 9 liters of water.

Finally, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We know Kyle bought the book for $19.50, which is 25% off the original price. To find the original price, we need to figure out what 100% of the price is.

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, he paid 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). We can set up an equation using this information. Let's call the original price 'x'. Then, 75% of 'x' is equal to $19.50.

We can write this as:

0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

Distance traveled before the first stop: 20 miles
Distance remaining after the first stop: 60 - 20 = 40 miles
Distance remaining after the second stop: 15 miles

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's current age = 11x

"I'm happy to help you out. Let's break down the problem step by step.

John sold his lego sets for $15 each and bought video games for $20 each. He had $5 left after buying the video games. To find out how many lego sets he still has, we need to figure out how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160 on video games. Adding the $5 he had left, we get a total of $165.

Since John had $5 left, that means he spent $165 out of the money he made from selling his lego sets. Now, let's find out how much he made from selling his lego sets. We know he sold some of his lego sets for $15 each, and he spent $165. Since he had $5 left, the amount he made from selling his lego sets must be $165 + $5 = $170 more than the amount he spent, but actually, it is the amount he spent plus the amount he has left, so the amount he made is $165 + $5 = $170.

However, we are given that he has 13 lego sets and he sells them for $15 each. So, he made 13 * 15 = $195.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, that means he didn't spend the money from all 13 lego sets. The amount he didn't spend is $195 - $165 = $30.

Since each lego set is $15, the number of lego sets he didn't sell is $30 / $15 = 2.

So, John still has 2 lego sets.

First, we know Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. So, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance she can travel in 6 hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she can travel in 2 hours while running is 2 * 6 = 12 miles.
The distance she can travel in 4 hours while walking is 4 * 1.5 = 6 miles.

The total distance she can travel in 6 hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

"Hey, let's break this down. We know Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Now, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, we multiply Ben's iPhone age by 4. That's 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"I've got this one. So, Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet on her own, but with the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. That's a total distance of 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, so to find out how far outside of the flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the flame distance from the total throw distance: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"Hey there, let's get to the problem. So, Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie: 5 x 8 = 40.

Now, we know that 14 pieces were left over. To find out how many pieces the guests took, we subtract the leftover pieces from the total: 40 - 14 = 26.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know you've got a daily calorie target of 2000, and you've already had 1800 calories. That means you've got 200 calories left to play with.

The bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, so we need to figure out how many servings you can have with 200 calories. To do that, we'll divide 200 by 250, which gives us 0.8 servings.

Now, we know the whole bag is 300g and has 5 servings. To find out how many grams are in 0.8 servings, we'll first find out how many grams are in one serving. That's 300g divided by 5, which is 60g per serving. Multiply that by 0.8, and we get 48g.

The answer is: 48"
"Hey there, let's break down Charlie's candle business. He can make 10 candles from a pound of beeswax, and the supplies for that cost $10. Since he wants to make and sell 20 candles, he'll need 2 pounds of beeswax, which will cost him 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, let's look at the revenue side. Charlie sells each candle for $2, so selling 20 candles will bring in 20 * $2 = $40.

To find his net profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $40 - $20 = $20.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Meredith's writing schedule and calculate the total hours she spent writing articles.

Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find out how many articles she wrote on Tuesday, we need to calculate 2/5 of 5, which is (2/5) * 5 = 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Candice started with 80 post-it notes and bought a package with an unknown number of post-it notes, which we'll call x. After buying the package, she had a total of 80 + x post-it notes.

At work, she used 220 post-it notes, leaving her with (80 + x) - 220 post-it notes. We know she had 23 post-it notes remaining, so we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

So, the package Candice purchased had 163 post-it notes.

The final answer is: 163"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on them, we can calculate the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of each tie. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Now, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, the number of red ties is 2 times the number of blue ties.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The problem also states that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. To find the cost of a red tie, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of a blue tie and add it to the cost of the blue tie.

Cost of a red tie = Cost of a blue tie + (50% of the cost of a blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now that we know the number of red ties and the cost of each red tie, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's solve this problem.

Tracy has a 4-foot wire that she wants to cut into 6-inch pieces. To find out how many pieces she'll get, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches by multiplying 4 by 12.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now that we know the wire is 48 inches long, we can divide it by the length of each piece, which is 6 inches.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors with 8 units each, we can multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor.

Total number of units = 15 * 8 = 120

Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we can multiply the total number of units by 3/4.

Number of occupied units = 120 * (3/4) = 90

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.

Number of unoccupied units = 120 - 90 = 30

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Lloyd's egg farm earnings.

First, we need to figure out how many dozens of eggs his chickens produce daily. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we'll divide the total number of eggs by 12:
252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozen eggs per day

Now, let's calculate Lloyd's daily earnings. He sells eggs for $2 per dozen, so:
21 dozen eggs per day * $2 per dozen = $42 per day

To find out his weekly earnings, we'll multiply his daily earnings by 7:
$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week

"Hey there, let's break down Tom's sailing trip. He's sailing from 1 to 4 PM at 10 miles per hour. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply his speed by the time he sailed.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now that we know the distance, we can find the time it takes him to get back at 6 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's tackle this problem together.

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. He's already removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. To find the weight of the comic books removed, we multiply the number of comic books by their weight: 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah still needs to remove 15 pounds in total, and he's already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds of toys.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to find the number of toys he needs to remove, we divide the weight of toys to be removed by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We've got a mechanic who charges $60 for each truck tire repair and $40 for each car tire repair. On Thursday, they fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires, while on Friday, they fixed 12 car tires and no truck tires.

Let's calculate the revenue for each day. On Thursday, the revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360, and from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. So, the total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. Since no truck tires were fixed, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

Now, let's compare the revenues. Thursday's revenue is $520, and Friday's revenue is $480. Thursday has the higher revenue, and the difference is $520 - $480 = $40.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We've got a wooden bridge with a weight limit of 5000 pounds, and a delivery truck that's going to pass over it. The truck, when empty, along with the driver, weighs 3755 pounds. We need to figure out how many 15-pound boxes we can load onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

First, let's find out how much weight the bridge can still handle after the truck and driver are on it. We do this by subtracting the weight of the truck and driver from the bridge's weight limit: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.

Now, we know the bridge can handle 1245 more pounds. Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we divide 1245 by 15 to find the maximum number of boxes we can load: 1245 / 15 = 83.

Now, we add the 25% fee to the original bill: $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00.

Next, we add the $3.00 delivery fee: $50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00.

First, let's calculate the number of unripe oranges. 20% of 25 is 0.2 * 25 = 5. So, we have 5 unripe oranges.

Now, let's add up the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges: 1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Marcy's pension situation. She's worked for the same company for 30 years, and I'm here to figure out her annual pension.

Marcy gets an annual pension of $50,000 if she works for 40 years. However, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years. Since she quits after 30 years, she's worked 10 years (30 - 20 = 10) at the increased rate.

This means she's entitled to 10 years * 5% per year = 50% of the full pension. To find her annual pension, we need to calculate 50% of $50,000.

50% of $50,000 = 0.5 * $50,000 = $25,000

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Aleena's streaming service costs. 

Aleena pays $140 per month for the first half of the year, which is 6 months. To find the total cost for the first half, we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months: 140 * 6 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the cost is 10% less than $140 per month. To find the discount, we calculate 10% of $140: 0.1 * 140 = $14. So, the monthly cost for the second half is $140 - $14 = $126. Multiply this by the number of months (6) to get the total cost for the second half: 126 * 6 = $756.

Now, let's add the costs for both halves to find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year: $840 + $756 = $1596.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's figure out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas.

We know Sophia's car has a 12-gallon tank, and she recently drove 100 miles before needing to fill up with 4 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg).

First, let's calculate the miles per gallon. We can do this by dividing the distance she traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used (4 gallons).

mpg = Total miles / Total gallons used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know Sophia's car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can multiply this by the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons) to find the total miles she can drive on a single tank.

Total miles = mpg * Total gallons in the tank
Total miles = 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons
Total miles = 300 miles

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Cecilia's puppy needs 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. To find the total amount of dog food consumed during this period, we multiply the number of days by the amount of food per day:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

After the first 180 days, the puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of the year. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day for:
365 days - 180 days = 185 days

Now, let's calculate the total amount of dog food consumed during this period:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

To find the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year, we add the amounts from both periods:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can find the number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year by dividing the total amount of dog food by the amount per bag:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the better price for the flowers. We have two options: a package of 3 flowers for $2.50 or a package of 2 flowers for $1. To compare the prices, we'll calculate the cost per flower for each option.

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.833 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.50 per flower.

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.833 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. We can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each, which would cost 9 * $1 = $9.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the other price, he would need 6 packages of 3 flowers each, which would cost 6 * $2.50 = $15.

The amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is $15 - $9 = $6.

First, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight: 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. Then, we subtract 2 pounds from that to get Alex's weight: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, let's add their weights together to find their combined weight: 125 (Grace's weight) + 498 (Alex's weight) = 623 pounds.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step. We've got 3 rose bushes, and each one has 25 roses. To find the total number of roses, we multiply the number of bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75 roses.

Now, each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600.

So, there are 600 thorns in total.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know the football team played 22 games in total. They also won 8 more games than they lost. To find out how many games they won, we can use a simple equation.

Let's say the number of games they lost is 'x'. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is 'x + 8'. The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and lost, which is 22. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Since the team won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is:
x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

"I'd be happy to help you out. So, Gene's been collecting those sweet souvenir t-shirts from his vacations, and he's making a quilt out of them. Let's figure out how many blocks he's got.

Gene's been vacationing since he was 23, and now he's 34. That's 11 years of traveling, right? And he goes on 4 vacations a year, so we multiply 11 years by 4 vacations/year. That gives us a total of 44 vacations.

Since each vacation means one t-shirt, and each t-shirt is one quilt block, Gene's got a total of 44 quilt blocks.

"Hey there, let's break down the alarm situation. The alarm rings three times a day, and we know how long it rang each time. 

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times. The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 times. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, which is 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sylvie just clocked 5 years in the company, and as a result, she's eligible for a 10% salary increase. To calculate her new monthly salary, we'll find 10% of her initial monthly salary and add it to the initial amount.

Initial monthly salary: $600
10% increase: $600 * 0.10 = $60
New monthly salary: $600 + $60 = $660

Since we want to find her annual salary after three more years of service, we'll multiply her new monthly salary by 12.

Annual salary after 5 years: $660 * 12 = $7920

This increased salary will remain the same for the next three years, so her annual salary after three more years of service will still be $7920.

$7920"
"Let's break down the problem. We know Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x', then Marilyn sold 10x copies.

Since they sold 88,000 copies combined, we can set up the equation:
x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"Hey, let's break down the problem. Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them won't show up. To find out how many will actually show up, we need to calculate 1/4 of 16, which is 4. So, 16 - 4 = 12 guests will show up.

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply 0.75 by 12, which gives us 9 gift bags. Now, each gift bag costs $2, so we multiply 9 by 2 to get the total cost.

9 * 2 = 18

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's get this dinosaur picnic problem solved.

So, we've got 20 adult dinosaurs and 5 little ones coming to the party. The adults will chow down on 10 pounds of potato salad each, and the kids will eat half that amount, which is 5 pounds.

First, let's calculate how much the adults will eat: 20 adults * 10 pounds/adult = 200 pounds.

Now, let's figure out how much the kids will eat: 5 kids * 5 pounds/kid = 25 pounds.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for the adults and kids: 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds.

"Let's break down the information we have about the kids' ages. We know James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. That means Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Now, we know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. To find Jackson's age, we subtract 5 from Amy's age: 9 - 5 = 4.

Jackson is 4 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he's 2 seconds faster than Gerald's original time. So, Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means his new time is 90% of his original time. To find 90% of 40 seconds, we multiply 40 by 0.9.

Gerald's new time: 40 * 0.9 = 36 seconds

"Let's break down the problem. We know there are 60 dogs in the neighborhood. Since there are two cats for every dog, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2. So, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

Now, we need to find the number of rabbits. The problem states that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. The combined number of pet dogs and cats is 60 + 120 = 180. So, the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats: 168 + 60 + 120 = 348.

We're told that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find this number, we multiply 120 by 2/3, which gives us 80 girls in the girl scout.

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls: 120 - 80 = 40.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know that Freda's tomato sauce loses half its volume when cooked, so to make 32 ounces of sauce, she must have started with 64 ounces of canned tomatoes (since 64 / 2 = 32).

Now, we need to figure out how many cans of tomatoes are in 64 ounces. Each can is 16 ounces, so we divide 64 by 16 to get the number of cans: 64 / 16 = 4.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to get the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. Out of these, 5 cars took an exit to avoid the traffic jam. So, the number of cars that actually went through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. To find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, we subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that went through the traffic jam.

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

Now, she's feeling generous and wants to give away 1 plant from each of those 40 window ledges. That's 40 plants she's giving away. To find out how many she'll have left, we subtract the number of plants she's giving away from her total: 98 - 40 = 58.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him, and each of them pressed the doorbell a certain number of times. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find this, we calculate 1/4 of 20, which is 20 * 1/4 = 5. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

We're also given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Therefore, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) = 175

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Solo's reading task. He's got a bunch of pages to read from different textbooks: 4 pages from Science, 20 from Social Studies, 7 from History, and 8 from Geography. 

First, we need to find the total number of pages he has to read. Let's add them up: 
4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages.

We know Solo already read 15 pages on Monday, so we subtract those from the total: 
39 - 15 = 24 pages left.

Now, Solo has 4 more days to finish reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days: 
24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down John's water-drinking habits. He has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one more before bed, which adds up to 4 glasses per day. Since he does this every weekday, that's 4 glasses * 5 weekdays = 20 glasses of water.

On weekends, John likes to relax and have a soda with dinner instead of water. So, he has 3 glasses of water per day on weekends (breakfast, lunch, and before bed). With 2 weekend days, that's 3 glasses * 2 days = 6 glasses of water.

Now, let's add up the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week: 20 (weekdays) + 6 (weekends) = 26.

We can do this by dividing the total distance (42 miles) by the distance covered in 10 minutes (3 miles). This gives us 42 / 3 = 14. So, there are 14 chunks of 3 miles in 42 miles.

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each chunk, we multiply the number of chunks by the time it takes to cover each one: 14 * 10 minutes = 140 minutes.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box first. 

The dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. To find the inner dimensions, we subtract the thickness of the walls from the outer dimensions.

Length (L) = 5 - 1 - 1 = 3 inches
Width (W) = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4 inches
Height (H) = 4 - 1 - 1 = 2 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 
Inner volume of each box = L * W * H = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume:
Total inner volume of all 3 boxes = 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches

"Let's break down Frankie's TV watching schedule. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode each night, which is 2 hours total. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours.

So, the total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Now, let's convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is 90 minutes. Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes per episode to find the number of episodes.

90 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Henry wants to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. If we let x be the number of cookies he baked last year, then he wants to bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he ends up baking 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

Unfortunately, he drops 5 cookies while putting them out to cool, leaving him with (2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

We know that this number is equal to 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

First, let's find the total cost of the gas. We multiply the price per gallon by the number of gallons: $3.00 * 10 = $30.00.

Next, we calculate the cashback amount by multiplying the cashback per gallon by the number of gallons: $0.20 * 10 = $2.00.

Now, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost of the gas to get the final cost: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

Now, let's add the total number of roll-ups they ate: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups. To find the average, we divide the total by 2, since there are two people. So, the average number of roll-ups they ate is 90 / 2 = 45.

"I'm happy to help Julia out with her leaky boat situation. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how far Julia rows in the time it takes her to reach the shore. We know it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can find her rowing speed by dividing the distance by the time.

20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second

Now that we know her speed, we can multiply it by the time it takes her to reach the shore to find the total distance.

1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can divide the total distance by 10 to find the number of 10-foot intervals.

80 feet / 10 feet = 8 intervals

Finally, we can multiply the number of intervals by 2 liters to find the total amount of water the boat took on.

8 intervals * 2 liters/interval = 16 liters

Brittany's phone = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone = 300

Now, we're told that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds as x.

"Hey there, let's break down Sasha's lumber sales. She's got some leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards and 4 x 4 x 10 boards that she bought at a lower price. Now, the prices have gone up by 50%, so she's looking to make a profit.

First, let's calculate the cost price of the lumber. She bought 10 of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards for $10 each, so that's 10 * $10 = $100. She also bought 5 of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards for $16 each, which is 5 * $16 = $80. The total cost price is $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price. For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, that's 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150. For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, it's 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120. The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost price from the total selling price: $270 - $180 = $90.

The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20. Now, we can find the fraction of the total that represents the sugar, which is 7/20.

Since Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, we can multiply the fraction of sugar by the total to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar:

(7/20) * 120 = 7 * 6 = 42

So, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar.

"I'm happy to help you with that problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

"Hey there, let's break down Sadie's sleep schedule for the week. 

On Monday, she slept 8 hours. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less, so that's 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. That's a total of 6 + 6 = 12 hours for Tuesday and Wednesday.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so that's 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. There are 4 days left in the week, so that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

Now, let's add up the hours for the entire week: 8 hours on Monday, 12 hours for Tuesday and Wednesday, and 28 hours for the rest of the week. That's a total of 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

After that, Rosie has 7 - 3 = 4 hours left. In these 4 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. So, the distance she covers in the next 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time

So, Jennie stamped 20 letters. Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many were in the pile when Jennie began, we subtract the number of letters she stamped from the total number of already-stamped letters.

30 - 20 = 10

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We know that Julia had a total of 12 spoons when she went to set the table. We also know that her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to her. 

To find out how many spoons Julia had before her husband gave her the 5 new spoons, we subtract 5 from the total number of spoons: 
12 - 5 = 7

However, we also know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, to find out how many spoons Julia had before she used those 3 spoons, we add 3 to the 7 spoons: 
7 + 3 = 10

Therefore, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

"Hey, let's break down the problem. Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages and some fish sausages. We know he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. So, to find the number of fish sausages, we add 6 to the number of chicken sausages.

Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6 = 44

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages to find the total number of sausages.

Total number of sausages = 38 + 44 = 82

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the price of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we're told that an orange costs $5 less than a watermelon. So, the price of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dillon needs to buy:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

Adding up these costs, we get $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We've got a hospital seeing 500 people a day, with each patient taking up 24 minutes of the doctors' time. The doctors charge the hospital $150 an hour, and the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour.

First, I'll calculate the total time spent by the doctors in minutes: 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes. Converting that to hours, we get 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the doctors to the hospital: 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000. And the revenue from the patients is: 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: Profit = Revenue - Cost = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she had a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he had a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Together, they rode a total of 4 + 6 = 10 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

"Hey there, let's break down Walt's walking miles. On Monday, he walked 4 miles. Then on Tuesday, he walked 6 times that amount, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

So, his total miles for Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. We know his total miles from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles for Monday and Tuesday from the total miles for Monday through Wednesday: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

Now, we're told Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does. So, we multiply Brian's original number of video games (25) by 3, then subtract 5.

3 * 25 = 75

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Now, we need to find out how many of these are female. We're told that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, so we can calculate this by multiplying 9 by 2 and then dividing by 3.

9 × 2 = 18
18 ÷ 3 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

"Hey, I'm happy to help you out with that. So, let's break down Rory's delivery order. 

First, we've got the subs, which are 2 for $7.50 each. That's 2 x $7.50 = $15.00. Then, there are the chips, 2 bags for $1.50 each, so that's 2 x $1.50 = $3.00. And lastly, we've got 2 cookies for $1.00 each, which is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00. 

Adding all those up, we get $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00. Now, there's a 20% delivery fee, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00. So, the total with the delivery fee is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark took two tests, one with 75 questions and the other with 100 questions. He completed the tests at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions. To find out how many questions he completed, we multiply the number of hours by the rate: 8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions. Again, we multiply the number of hours by the rate: 6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions.

Now, let's add up the total number of questions Mark completed: 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

The total number of questions in both tests is 75 + 100 = 175 questions.

To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we subtract the number of questions he completed from the total number of questions: 175 - 70 = 105 questions.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We have 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total.

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, let's calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars. We'll divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's break down the problem. We know there are 700 bees in total. We also know there are three types of bees: queens, babies, and workers. The number of babies is twice the number of queens, and the number of workers is twice the number of babies.

Let's use variables to represent the number of each type of bee. Let Q be the number of queens, B be the number of babies, and W be the number of workers.

We can write two equations based on the given information:
B = 2Q (since there are twice as many babies as queens)
W = 2B (since there are twice as many workers as babies)

We also know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation:
Q + B + W = 700

Now, let's substitute the first two equations into the third equation. We can replace B with 2Q and W with 2B, which is equal to 2(2Q) or 4Q.

So, the equation becomes:
Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700

Combine like terms:
7Q = 700

Divide by 7:
Q = 100

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W:
B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200
W = 2B = 2(200) = 400

The number of worker bees is 400.

Now, let's look at the non-food items: light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4. That's a total of $3 + $3 + $4 = $10 for the non-food items.

Since there's a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax: $10 * 0.10 = $1. Adding the tax to the non-food items, we get $10 + $1 = $11.

Finally, let's add the cost of the food and non-food items: $5 + $11 = $16.

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year. To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:

First, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, half that many return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

Next, in the following 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bees that left the hive and hadn't returned yet. We start with the initial 30 bees, subtract the 15 that returned, and then add the 60 that left in the next 6 hours. That's 30 - 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

Finally, in the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before and hadn't already returned come back to the hive. So, the number of bees Debra saw return in the last 6 hours is 75.

12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

Now, let's solve for Dorothy's friends by dividing both sides by 3:
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends. Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. To find James' friends, we multiply Dorothy's friends by 4:
James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"What's up guys, it's Kai here. So, Steve and Tim are racing home from school, and we need to figure out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes. 

First, let's convert their distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so Steve's distance is 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet, and Tim's distance is 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home. Steve bikes at 440 feet per minute, so his time is 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes. Tim skateboards at 264 feet per minute, so his time is 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time.

Waiting time: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total amount Shawnda made is 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents. To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

Then, the seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. The remaining number of fries is x - 14 - 7 = x - 21.

Next, the three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total. The remaining number of fries is x - 21 - 9 = x - 30.

After that, the raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, so the number of fries the raccoon stole is 2/3 * (x - 30). The remaining number of fries is 1/3 * (x - 30).

Finally, the ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, 1/3 * (x - 30) = 5 + 1 = 6.

Now, we can solve for x:
1/3 * (x - 30) = 6
x - 30 = 6 * 3
x - 30 = 18
x = 18 + 30
x = 48

The original number of french fries in the pack is 48."

Since we're looking for the total length in feet, we should convert the lengths of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches. Converting to feet: 1200 inches / 12 = 100 feet.
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches. Converting to feet: 720 inches / 12 = 60 feet.
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet.

To find the total number of bananas needed per month, we add these amounts together: 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to multiply the monthly amount by 2. So, 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

"What's up guys, it's Kai here. So, let's break down this problem. We've got Blake and Kelly running back and forth on a 100-yard football field. They're trying to see who can run the most in 15 minutes.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Since the field is 100 yards long, each round trip is 200 yards. So, to find the total distance Blake ran, we multiply the number of round trips by the distance of each round trip: 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

Now, let's look at Kelly. She runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then she decides to run to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each of these trips is 80 yards (40 yards each way). To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the initial 200 yards to the distance of the 34 shorter trips: 200 + (34 * 80) = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

So, Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards. To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the smaller distance from the larger distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 5 red cars, and each one costs $4. So, the total cost of the red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.

Next, we have 3 action figures, and each one costs $5. So, the total cost of the action figures is 3 x $5 = $15.

Now, the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which is $15.

To find the total cost of all the toys, we add up the cost of the red cars, action figures, and the doll: $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"Hey, let's break down Jackie's situation. If she does her taxes herself, she'll miss out on 3 hours of freelance work, which means she'll lose 3 * $35 = $105 in income. On the other hand, hiring an accountant will cost her $90.

To find out how much more money she'll have if she hires the accountant, we need to subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the lost income. So, that's $105 - $90 = $15.

"Hey, let's break down Elvira's shopping trip. She's got a budget of €1500 for a new computer and some accessories. The computer itself costs €1090, and it comes with a screen, keyboard, and mouse. She also picks up a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102.

To find out how much she's spent, I'll add up the costs: €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423. Now, let's subtract that from her budget: €1500 - €1423 = €77.

"Hey, let's break this down. Sandra needs 3 eggs to make a Spanish flan, and she has to make 15 of them. So, the total number of eggs she needs is 3 eggs/flan * 15 flans = 45 eggs.

Now, since she gets 9 eggs every time she babysits, we need to find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. To do that, we divide the total number of eggs she needs by the number of eggs she gets per job:
45 eggs / 9 eggs/job = 5 jobs.

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so if Brooke's age is x, then Seth's age is 2x.

In 2 years, Brooke will be x + 2 years old, and Seth will be 2x + 2 years old. The problem states that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write an equation based on this:

(x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28

Combine the x terms and the constants: 3x + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 24

Divide both sides by 3: x = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2x = 2 * 8 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"Hey, let's break this down. We know Ethel has $8, and Jimmy has $2 more than twice that amount.

5 weekdays * 20 miles/day = 100 miles

On weekends, he walks 10 miles a day, and there are 2 weekend days, so that's:
2 weekend days * 10 miles/day = 20 miles

Now, let's add those up to find the total miles walked in a week:
100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the cost of the marching band uniform.

First, the hat costs $25. The jacket is three times as expensive as the hat, so that's 3 * $25 = $75. Now, the pants cost the average of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the two costs and divide by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs: $25 for the hat, $75 for the jacket, and $50 for the pants. That's a total of $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, which makes her 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up their ages: 
8 (Sally Four) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Jessica's debt payments.

First, we need to calculate the total minimum payment. We've got her student loans at $300/month, credit card at $200/month, and mortgage at $500/month. Adding those up, we get:
$300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Now, Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find that amount, we calculate 50% of $1000:
0.5 * $1000 = $500

We add this increase to the minimum payment:
$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

Now, let's add the time it takes to peel and cut a potato: 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes = 1.5833 minutes per potato.

Since Billy has 60 potatoes to prep, we multiply the time per potato by 60: 1.5833 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 95 minutes.

The final answer is: 95"
"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Juan and Carlos are selling lemonade, and we need to figure out how much they spent on lemons.

First, we need to calculate the cost and revenue per gallon. The cost per gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is $5. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Now, let's find the profit per gallon by subtracting the cost from the revenue: $10 - $5 = $5 per gallon.

We know they made a total profit of $25, so we can divide that by the profit per gallon to find the total number of gallons: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Finally, we can multiply the total number of gallons by the cost of lemons per gallon to find the total amount spent on lemons: 5 * $3 = $15.

Now, we know there are 60 boys on the Chinese team. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Total Chinese - Boys on the Chinese team

"Let's break down Zaid's expenses and donations to find out how much he'll have left.

First, we need to calculate how much he spends on rent and car fuel. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500. He spends 1/3 on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000.

So, his total expenses for rent and car fuel are 1500 + 2000 = 3500. This means he has 6000 - 3500 = 2500 left.

Next, he donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250. After the donation, he has 2500 - 1250 = 1250 left.

Finally, he gives his daughter 200 and his wife 700, for a total of 200 + 700 = 900. Subtracting this from the remaining amount, we get 1250 - 900 = 350.

"I'm happy to help Sandra and Fred resolve their issue. Let's break down the information we have. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations. To find the number of white carnations, we can divide the number of pink calla lilies by 5.

Number of white carnations = 200 / 5
= 40

Now, we know Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, we can multiply the number of white carnations by 4 to find the number of red roses.

Number of red roses = 4 * 40

Since that was two years ago, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21.

Now, we know Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23.

"What's up guys, it's Kai here. Let's break down this track relay problem. We've got two teams competing in a 4 by 400 meter relay, and we know the running times for each team.

The well-rounded team has all members running at a consistent 55 seconds each. To find their total time, we simply multiply this by 4:
55 * 4 = 220 seconds

Now, let's look at the less well-rounded team. Their first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner is 3 seconds faster at 57 seconds, the third runner is another 3 seconds faster at 54 seconds, and the fourth runner is the fastest at 51 seconds. We add these up to get their total time:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Jerry's rolling a six-sided die, and we want to know how much more likely it is that he rolls a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row.

First, let's look at the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die: 4, 5, and 6. So, the probability is 3 out of 6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.

Now, let's consider the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6, which is also 1/2 or 0.5. Since the die is rolled twice, we multiply the probabilities together: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

The difference between the two probabilities is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and the hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can find the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by subtracting the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and the hamsters. This is 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15. We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, so the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost per bag, which includes the cost of buying the bag from the farmer and the transportation cost. The total cost per bag is $20 (buying cost) + $2 (transportation cost) = $22.

Next, we know the selling price per bag is $30. To find the profit per bag, we subtract the total cost per bag from the selling price per bag: $30 - $22 = $8.

Now, we know the trader made a total profit of $400. Since the profit per bag is $8, we can set up an equation to find the number of bags sold: 
8x = 400, where 'x' is the number of bags.

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 8:
x = 400 / 8
x = 50

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. To find the cost of food, we subtract $4.50 from the cost of tickets.

Cost of food: $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

They also went on 2 different rides which costs $33 for each ride. So, the total cost of rides is:

Cost of rides: 2 * $33 = $66

Now, let's add up the total cost.

Total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person: $102 / 3 = $34

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now that we know John collects peaches for 180 minutes, and he can collect 2 peaches per minute, we can multiply the total minutes by the number of peaches per minute:

3.5 pounds/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Now, to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day, we divide the total amount they need per week by 7, since there are 7 days in a week.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step. Tom starts with 50 trees and has a net gain of 8 trees per year since he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. To find the total number of trees after 10 years, we need to calculate the net gain over this period.

The net gain per year is 10 (trees planted) - 2 (trees chopped down) = 8 trees. After 10 years, the total net gain is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

Adding this to the initial 50 trees, Tom has 50 + 80 = 130 trees after 10 years.

However, 30% of the trees die, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees. To find the number of trees Tom has left, we subtract the number of dead trees from the total: 130 - 39 = 91.

In the third month, Elaine collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. That's 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we add the cards she collected each month to her initial number of cards:

Now, let's calculate the 5% raise. That's $2000 per week * 0.05 = $100 per week increase. So, John's new weekly salary after the raise is:

$2000 per week + $100 per week = $2100 per week

His total earnings after the raise would be:

Now, let's look at her scores so far: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We add these up: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since she can drop the lowest score, which is 71, we subtract that from the total: 438 - 71 = 367.

Now, we subtract the total score of her remaining 4 tests from the total score she needs: 465 - 367 = 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Micheal's bike rides to find the total kilometers he rode.

Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week for 4 weeks, covering 25 kilometers each time. To find the total kilometers for these 4 weeks, we multiply the number of rides by the distance per ride. Since he rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks, that's 5 * 4 = 20 rides. At 25 kilometers per ride, he covered 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

After that, Micheal changed his routine to riding 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time, and he did this for 3 weeks. To find the total kilometers for these 3 weeks, we multiply the number of rides by the distance per ride. Since he rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks, that's 2 * 3 = 6 rides. At 60 kilometers per ride, he covered 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Now, let's add the kilometers from both periods: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Joe's bag has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. We're also told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, and that each chocolate bar weighs 40g.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, we can calculate the weight of all the chocolate bars: 25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g.

Now, let's find the weight of each candied apple. We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so we can divide the weight of a chocolate bar by 2 to get the weight of a candied apple: 40g / 2 = 20g.

With the weight of each candied apple, we can calculate the total weight of all the candied apples: 80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g.

Finally, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to get the total weight of Joe's bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Rose's cake shopping spree.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes. That's a good start.

On Tuesday, she went to a different store and bought three times that number of cakes. So, she bought 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she did on Tuesday. That's 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add up all the cakes: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since half a dozen is 6, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this amount. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since 1 dozen is 12, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost by the number of cups: $34800 / 240 = $145.

"Hey there, let's break down Sara's situation. She wants to buy a jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes for $20 each, so the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. Adding the jacket, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved up and she also earns some money from babysitting. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so that's 4 * $5 = $20. Now, let's add this to her initial savings: $10 + $20 = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 and she already has $30, she still needs $70 - $30 = $40. She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so to find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we'll divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4).

$40 / $4 = 10

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We've got red chickens producing 3 eggs a day and white chickens producing 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs daily, and he's got two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's use 'r' for the number of red chickens and 'w' for the number of white chickens. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, we can say w = r + 2.

Now, let's set up an equation for the total number of eggs collected per day. We know it's 42, so we can write:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. To figure out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we need to calculate the distance he covers and then divide it by his walking speed.

The park is a rectangle, so we need to find its perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). Given the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now that we know the distance, we can divide it by Gary's walking speed, which is 3 miles per hour.

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"Hey, let's break down the problem. We know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means there were 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

To find the total number of customers on the first two days, we add the customers from both days: 100 + 150 = 250.

Now, we're told that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we subtract the total customers from the first two days from the total: 500 - 250 = 250.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We know that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. We also know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Let's call the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago ""x"" gallons. This means the big pool had 2x gallons 4 minutes ago.

Since then, both pools have lost 16 gallons of water (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes). So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

The problem states that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up an equation based on this information:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides gives us:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

24 = x

So, the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

24 - 16 = 8

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320.00 and a matching belt for $32.00. To find the total cost, we add the prices of the shoes and the belt.

Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we need to figure out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn this amount. We know she makes $8.00 per hour, so we'll divide the total cost by her hourly wage.

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

"Hey there, let's break down Janeth's situation. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. To find the total amount she needs to pay back, we'll calculate the additional 10% first. That's 0.1 * $2000 = $200. So the total amount she needs to pay back is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, let's see how much she'll pay in 12 months. She's paying $165 a month, so in 12 months, she'll pay $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she'll pay from the total amount she needs to pay back: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"Hey there, let's figure this out. We know there are 4 roses in the vase. Now, we're told there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, to find the number of dahlias, we add 7 to the number of roses.

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias together.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Harriet is 21 years old now, and she's half the age of Zack. To find Zack's age, we multiply Harriet's age by 2: 21 * 2 = 42. So, Zack is 42 years old.

Now, we're told Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. We multiply Harriet's age by 3: 21 * 3 = 63. So, Adrian is 63 years old.

To find their ages in three years, we add 3 to each of their current ages:
- Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack's age in three years: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian's age in three years: 63 + 3 = 66

Finally, we calculate the average age by adding their ages in three years and dividing by 3:
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know that four students scored a total of 251 points in a board game. Naomi scored 68 of those points. Now, let's figure out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Adding 10 to that, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Now, we know that Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. To find the amount of rainwater collected, we multiply the remaining water by 2.

2 * 30 = 60 liters

Finally, we add the remaining water and the rainwater collected to find the total amount of water in the tank now.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The bus ride takes 6 days, and driving takes half that time. To figure out the total travel time, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive back.

Since driving takes half as long as the bus, the return trip will take 6 / 2 = 3 days.

"What's up, I'm Kai. Let's get to the problem. James has a bunch of Pokémon cards, and we need to find the percentage chance of picking a water type card after some changes.

First, let's look at the initial numbers: 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. That's a total of 90 cards.

Now, James loses 8 water type cards, so he's left with 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

He also buys 14 more grass type cards, bringing his total grass type cards to 20 + 14 = 34.

The new total number of cards is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96.

To find the probability of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards: 32 / 96 ≈ 0.3333.

Multiply that by 100 to get the percentage chance: 0.3333 * 100 ≈ 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest integer, that's 33%.

6 tomatoes/day (Steve) + 3 tomatoes/day (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes/day

Now, let's calculate their combined weekly consumption:

9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week

We know that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide their combined weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine:

"I'll break down the problem step by step.

Ram starts with 25 pens. When the ink runs low, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens from the empty ones. Now, he has 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens.

This process can be repeated multiple times. To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we can use a geometric series formula. The number of pens Ram has after each refill can be represented as:

25 + 25/5 + 25/5^2 + 25/5^3 + ...

This is a geometric series with the first term (a) = 25 and the common ratio (r) = 1/5. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:

S = a / (1 - r)
= 25 / (1 - 1/5)
= 25 / (4/5)
= 25 * 5/4
= 125/4
= 31.25

However, this is the sum of the number of pens Ram has after each refill, not the total number of pens he gets to have. Since Ram refills his pens 5 times to make a new pen, the total number of pens he gets to have is:

25 + 5 * (31.25 - 25)
= 25 + 5 * 6.25
= 25 + 31.25
= 56.25

However, this is still not the correct answer, as we are counting the number of refills, not the number of pens. Since each refill gives 1 new pen, and we have 31.25 refills, we have 31.25 new pens. Adding the initial 25 pens, we get:

25 + 31.25
= 56.25

However, we can't have a fraction of a pen, so we round down to 56 pens.

However, this is still not the correct answer. We can see that the number of pens Ram has after each refill is:

We can see that the number of new pens Ram gets after each refill is:

5, 5, 5, 5, ... (infinite times)

This is an infinite arithmetic series with the first term (a) = 5 and the common difference (d) = 0. The sum of an infinite arithmetic series is not defined, but we can see that the number of new pens Ram gets after each refill is:

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know Jessa is 20 years old. Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old. Mary is two years younger than Joan, which makes Mary 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now, let's add up their ages: 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68.

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to calculate the number of students who went out through exits A and B first.

First, let's find the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of students who went out through exit A = 30% of 1000
= 0.3 * 1000
= 300

Now, let's find the number of students remaining after exit A:

Number of students remaining after exit A = 1000 - 300
= 700

Next, we'll find the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of students who went out through exit B = 3/5 of 700
= (3/5) * 700
= 420

Now, let's find the number of students remaining after exit B, which is the same as the number of students who went out through exit C:

Number of students who went out through exit C = 700 - 420
= 280

"Let's break this down step by step. We know John has 54 candies, and he has twice as many candies as Robert. So, to find out how many candies Robert has, we'll divide John's candies by 2. That's 54 / 2 = 27 candies for Robert.

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

The question asks how many more candies John has than James. To find that out, we'll subtract James' candies from John's candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

So, when we add the books they've read, we get 3 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

"What's up, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike has 5 pen pals initially, but he stops being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he's left with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. That means he writes 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, Mike writes a total of 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.

Now, we know Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find the total time he spends writing a week, we multiply the total number of pages by the time it takes to write a page: 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes.

Finally, we convert the total minutes to hours by dividing by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

"Hey, let's break down Jason's phone usage. He's got a monthly limit of 1000 minutes. This month, he's had a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and since there are 30 days in the month, that's a total of 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.

On top of that, he's had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, his total minutes used are 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the total minutes used from his monthly limit to find out how many minutes he has left: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Then, Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Next, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. After that, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.

Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, we can calculate the number of fries Ginger gave him by subtracting the fries he had left from the total he ended up with: 27 - 7 = 20.

"Let's dive into this problem. We've got two aquariums with different numbers of snails. One has 4 snails, and the other has 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

Now, we're told that this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can represent the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. The total number of fish in both aquariums would be 2x.

We can set up an equation based on the given information: 2 * 2x = 28 (since the difference in snails is twice the total number of fish).

Simplifying the equation, we get 4x = 28. To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides by 4: x = 28 / 4 = 7.

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Jean's makeup artist charges $250 an hour, and she needs 6 hours of makeup work done each day, 4 times a week. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

First, I'll calculate the total hours of makeup work per week: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week. Then, I'll multiply that by the number of weeks: 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total cost before the discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000. Since the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, I'll calculate the discount amount: 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, I'll subtract the discount from the total cost to find the amount Jean paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

"Hey there, let's break down the cookie situation. We know Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday. 

Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, she had 4 * 5 = 20 cookies that day. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she had 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total cookies each of them ate:
Sue's sister: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Given that 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue's sister: 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
Sue: 46 * 200 = 9200 calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the sister's calories from Sue's calories:

Since there are 30 girls in the school, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Now, we know the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls. So, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

So, today Rick killed 3x = 3 * 12 = 36 wolves and 12 cougars, for a total of 36 + 12 = 48 animals.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73.

"Let's break down the problem. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

However, the problem states that Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls. This implies that there are actually 20 stalls, not 10. Since we're given that the initial 10 stalls have 20 cows each, we can assume the other 10 stalls have 0 cows.

Now, Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls. So, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

The initial 10 stalls now have 20 (initial cows) + 2 (new cows) = 22 cows each. The other 10 stalls have 0 (initial cows) + 2 (new cows) = 2 cows each.

To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we need to know which stalls we're considering. Since the problem doesn't specify, let's assume we're considering the initial 10 stalls with 22 cows each. In this case, the total number of cows in 8 stalls is 22 * 8 = 176.

We know that each 10-foot section of the redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. To find the total weight of the tree, we need to find out how many 10-foot sections are in a 200-foot tree.

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the tree.

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

However, the termites ate 30% of the tree, so we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to find the current weight of the tree.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds
Weight after termites ate 30% = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

The final answer is: 5600"

Brokerage fee: $350,000 * 0.05 = $17,500

Next, we calculate the transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price. We multiply the selling price by 0.12.

Transfer fee: $350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000

Now, we add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price of the house.

Total price of the house: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. To find his net proceeds, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract that from the selling price.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees, which are 3% of the selling price. That's 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, we have the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price. That's 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

In addition to these fees, Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house.

Now, let's add up the total amount he paid: $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

Finally, we subtract the total amount paid from the selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. To find 40% of 20 minutes, I'll multiply 20 by 0.4, which gives me 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

The total time to warm the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes. Now, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook.

To find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, I'll add the time it took to warm the oil and the time it took to cook. That's 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad and $75 on each television ad. He bought 50 newspaper ads and 15 television ads.

First, I'll calculate the cost of the newspaper ads: 50 ads * $5 per ad = $250. Then, I'll calculate the cost of the television ads: 15 ads * $75 per ad = $1125.

Now, I'll add the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Mary bought 3 bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so that's 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. The third bag has a hole in it, so it only has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, which is 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add them all up: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

"Let's break down the problem. We've got 2 houses, each with 3 bedrooms. Each bedroom has 2 windows, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 windows per house from the bedrooms.

In addition to the bedroom windows, each house has 4 more windows. So, for each house, we've got 6 windows from the bedrooms + 4 extra windows = 10 windows per house.

Since there are 2 houses, we multiply the number of windows per house by 2. That gives us 10 * 2 = 20 windows in total.

First, I'll add up the cost of the items the mother bought: 
$4.20 for cocoa, $9.45 for laundry, and $1.35 for pasta. 
So, the total cost is $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99.

Now, I'll subtract the total cost from the amount she paid, which is $20. 
The change is $20 - $14.99 = $5.01.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so that's 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, so the two sleeves must take 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches by 2: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

First, I'll calculate the cost of the tomato seeds: 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

Next, I'll calculate the cost of the celery seeds: 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.

Now, I'll add the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds together: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sean has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. The solo song has 54 lines.

Now, let's move on to the first scene. It has twice the number of lines as the song, which means it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines. However, only a third of them are his lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines for the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of them are his lines, so he has to memorize 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines for the second scene.

Now, let's add up the lines for the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

Carly had 80 cards, and we need to find out how many of them had the letter D on them. To do that, we'll first find out how many cards had the letters A, B, and C.

First, 2/5 of the cards had the letter A on them. That's 2/5 * 80 = 32 cards.

Now, we subtract those 32 cards from the total: 80 - 32 = 48 cards left.

Next, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them. That's 1/2 * 48 = 24 cards.

We subtract those 24 cards from the remaining: 48 - 24 = 24 cards left.

Then, 5/8 of the rest had the letter C on them. That's 5/8 * 24 = 15 cards.

We subtract those 15 cards from the remaining: 24 - 15 = 9 cards left.

And that's it! The remaining 9 cards had the letter D on them.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig the small holes. Matthew digs 30 small holes, and each one takes 3 minutes. So, the total time for small holes is 30 * 3 = 90 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time for the large holes. Matthew digs 15 large holes, and each one takes 10 minutes. So, the total time for large holes is 15 * 10 = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for small and large holes together to get the total time in minutes: 90 + 150 = 240 minutes.

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write that as R = 6S, where R is Ruby's age and S is Sam's age.

Now, in 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. That gives us the equation R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Let's simplify that equation by expanding it: R + 9 = 3S + 27.

Now, substitute R = 6S into the equation: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtract 3S from both sides: 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 3S = 18.

Divide both sides by 3: S = 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a cobra has 70 spots and that it has twice as many spots as a mamba. To find the number of spots on a mamba, we can divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2.

Number of spots on a mamba = 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park.

Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70 = 2800
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35 = 2100
Total spots on all snakes = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

We're asked to find half the number of spots they all have combined. To do this, we simply divide the total number of spots by 2.

Half the number of spots = 4900 / 2 = 2450

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the pizza problem for Maddy.

First, we need to figure out how many people are going to be at the soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so that's 12 + 3 = 15 people right there. 

Each team member is also bringing 2 guests, so we need to add those to the total. That's 12 team members * 2 guests each = 24 guests. 

Now, let's add up all the people: 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs. That's 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, each pizza costs $15, so we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 * 15 = 195.

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of sterling silver beads, we divide the total length taken up by the beads by the length of each bead: 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We have a 76-star flag with three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. We need to find out how many rows of 5 stars are there.

First, let's calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows. 
3 rows of 8 stars = 3 * 8 = 24 stars
2 rows of 6 stars = 2 * 6 = 12 stars

So, the total number of stars in these rows is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Now, we subtract this from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows. 
76 (total stars) - 36 (stars in 8-star and 6-star rows) = 40 stars

Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, we divide the total number of stars in 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows.
40 stars / 5 stars per row = 8 rows

Now, we know the car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles, and we want to find out how long it took the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance. We can use the formula time = distance / speed to figure this out.

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

Now, let's add the number of medals Ali and Izzy have: 22 (Ali's medals) + 17 (Izzy's medals) = 39 medals.

The problem states that together, Ali and Izzy have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have.

So, we multiply the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have by 10: 10 * 39 = 390.

To find out how many chocolate bars are left for the kids, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total: 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and they'll share the remaining chocolate bars equally. So, each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars.

Now, in the fourth round, anyone with over 20 points gets an extra point. Mike and Tony qualify for this, so they each get 1 extra point. Jim doesn't qualify, so he stays at 18 points.

After the extra points are distributed, Mike's got 22 points, Jim's still at 18 points, and Tony's got 43 points.

Now, let's see what he did on the second day. He did 20 more pushups than the first day, so that's 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. He did 10 fewer squats, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats. And he doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

On the second day, Darren did a total of 120 + 40 + 40 = 200 activities.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much rice each person consumes in a day. Since each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal and there are two meals (lunch and dinner), the daily consumption per person is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

Now, since there are 5 members in the household, the total daily consumption is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Finally, we can divide the total weight of the rice bag (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

"Hey there, let's break down John's driving expenses. 

First, we need to figure out how many miles he drives in a year. His work is 30 miles away, and he makes a round trip every day, so that's 60 miles per day. Since he does this 5 days a week, that's 60 * 5 = 300 miles per week. With 50 weeks in a year, he drives 300 * 50 = 15,000 miles per year.

Now, let's calculate the cost of those miles. John gets charged $2 per mile, so 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000 per year.

In addition to the mileage cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus every month. That's $150 * 12 months = $1,800 per year.

To find the number of pieces of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 4, since each piece of paper has 4 pages (2 on the front and 2 on the back).

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 4

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so we can find out how much he loses in a week by dividing 8 by 4. That's 2 pounds per week.

Now, we're told Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, that means Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks (8 pounds), we can divide the total weight by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks. That's 8 / 2 = 4, and then multiply by 4 since that's how long it takes Sandy to lose 2 pounds. So, 4 * 4 = 16 weeks.

"Hey there, let's calculate the total savings when buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

First, I'll find the savings from the ice cream. The original price is $13, and the sale price is $11. So, the savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we're buying 2 tubs, the total savings from the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

Next, I'll calculate the savings from the milk. The discount is $0.5 per packet, and we're buying 4 packets. So, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Now, let's add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings: $4 + $2 = $6.

"Let's break down the problem. Helena's serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every three days and an extra leg every five days. We need to find out how many new limbs will grow in 15 days.

First, let's calculate the number of new arms. Since a new arm grows every 3 days, we can divide 15 by 3 to get the number of new arms: 15 / 3 = 5.

Next, let's calculate the number of new legs. A new leg grows every 5 days, so we can divide 15 by 5 to get the number of new legs: 15 / 5 = 3.

Now, we add the number of new arms and new legs to get the total number of new limbs: 5 + 3 = 8.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Theo's expenses for his business trip to South Africa.

First, he buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so that's 6 * $100 = $600. Then, he gets 3 suitcases at $50 each, which is 3 * $50 = $150. Next, he purchases a flight ticket that costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that is $500, and adding $700 gives us $1200 for the flight ticket.

Now, let's add up his total expenses: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950. Theo has a budget of $6000 and wants to save $2000, so we subtract his expenses and savings from his budget: $6000 - $1950 - $2000 = $2050.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We've got a family of 5, and 3 of them eat 3 eggs each day. That's 3 * 3 = 9 eggs for those three. The other 2 family members eat 2 eggs each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 eggs for them.

Now, let's add those together to get the total daily egg consumption: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day. Since they eat eggs every day, we multiply that by 7 to get the total for the week: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"I'm happy to help you out. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Cera is currently 46 years old. To find her age six years ago, we subtract 6 from her current age: 46 - 6 = 40.

Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, we can find his age at that time by dividing Cera's age by 2: 40 / 2 = 20. This was Noah's age six years ago.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, we multiply Noah's age at that time by 3000: 20 * 3000 = 60,000. This was the population of Chile six years ago.

Finally, we're told that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. To find the current population, we multiply the population six years ago by 2: 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

Population of Chile now: 120,000"
"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We've got a football team with 105 members, and we need to figure out how many players are on the defense.

Let's use a variable to represent the number of players on the defense. I'll call it D. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. And since there's half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know the total number of players is 105, so we can set up an equation:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify things, let's multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Martha's party guest list.

First, we need to figure out how many people were invited. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, which is 2 * 6 = 12 people. She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, which is 3 * 4 = 12 people. So, the total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Now, let's subtract the people who couldn't make it. 8 people were out due to illness. On top of that, 1/4 of the people who were ill had previous commitments, which is 8 * 1/4 = 2 people. So, the total number of people who couldn't make it is 8 + 2 = 10.

To find out how many people showed up, we subtract the no-shows from the total invited: 24 - 10 = 14.

"What's up, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Solomon initially had 50 marbles in the store. He then bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so now he has 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find out how many marbles that is, we multiply 20 by 2/5. That's 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, let's add the marbles his father gave him to the total. 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so to find the total weight, we multiply the number of marbles by the weight of each marble. That's 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet and then multiply it by the cost per cubic foot.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for volume is length times width times depth. In this case, the pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. So, the volume is:
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Now that we know the volume, we can multiply it by the cost per cubic foot, which is $0.1. 
Cost = volume * cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * 0.1
Cost = 12

"Let's break down the problem. We know the classroom has 30 boys. Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3. 

Number of girls = 3 * 30 = 90

We also know there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we multiply the number of boys by 1/10.

Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children:
Total children = 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We're given a ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

We're also told that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. To find the total number of electric poles required, we can set up a proportion using the given ratio.

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. We can set up the proportion as follows:

1 pole / 3 wires = x poles / 45 wires

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for x:

3x = 45
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party, so the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3. This means the remaining 7 people who left must be women (since 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men).

So, the number of women who stayed is 15 - 7 = 8.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. To find out how many pencils are in the boxes, we subtract the loose pencils: 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in the boxes.

Since there are 3 boxes, we divide the total pencils in the boxes by 3 to find out how many pencils each box can hold: 24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box.

Now, let's add the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have: 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold: 72 / 8 = 9.

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"Hey, let's break down the problem. Shannon's coffee cools by 13 degrees with each ice cube, and she wants it to cool by 65 degrees. To find out how many ice cubes she needs, we divide 65 by 13, which gives us 5 ice cubes.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker. On top of that, she's adding 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. 

So, the total weakening is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of junior programmers. Since they make up 2/5 of the total employees, we can calculate this as 2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Now, to find the number of senior programmers, we subtract the number of junior programmers from the total employees: 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Next, we know junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their salary is $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000 per month.

The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000 per month.

Finally, we add these two amounts together to get the total amount paid to all programmers: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that at the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in, resulting in a net gain of 1 person. 

Before that, at the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, if we denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x, then the total number of people after the first stop is x + 5.

After the second stop, the total number of people is x + 5 + 1, which simplifies to x + 6. We're told that this total is 20 people. 

So, we can set up the equation x + 6 = 20. Solving for x, we get x = 20 - 6 = 14.

On his way home, Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave away 14, he buys 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he's got 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

That night, Oscar eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, so he's got 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

We multiply the remaining percentage by the time it takes to charge 1 percentage-point: 40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes.

Now, we convert minutes to hours by dividing by 60. So, 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.

"What's up, I'm Kai. Let's break down these job options for Nick.

First, we need to calculate the net income for each job. For Job A, the gross income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year, which equals $30,000/year. With a 20% total tax rate, the taxes would be $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. So, the net income for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Now, let's look at Job B. The gross income is $42,000/year, but we need to subtract the $6,000 property tax. That leaves us with $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. Then, we apply the 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax, which is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. The net income for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Since Job B has a higher net income, we need to find the difference between the two net incomes. That's $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. April needs to donate plant pots to a local school for their new garden. They need 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. To find out how many they need for the roses, we multiply 30 by 2, which gives us 60.

Now, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses: 30 + 60 = 90. So, the school needs a total of 90 plant pots.

April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the number needed from the number bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Andrea started with $36 and spent some of it on an $11 sweater and gave her brother $4. To find out how much she saved, we need to figure out the total amount she spent.

The total amount she spent is the cost of the sweater plus the money she gave her brother, which is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, let's subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount: $36 - $15 = $21.

"Let's break down John's activities to find out how much time he spent sightseeing.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This was 30% of the time he spent, so we can set up the equation:
15 = 0.3x, where x is the total time spent.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:
x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

So, the total time spent is 50 hours.

He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so we can calculate the time spent sightseeing:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20

"Hey, let's break down Annabelle's savings. She's got a goal to save for a $400 phone and already has $80 in her savings.

For her first job, Annabelle earns $10 per hour and worked 20 hours, so that's 10 * 20 = $200. At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and worked 15 hours, which is 5 * 15 = $75.

Adding these amounts to her initial savings, Annabelle now has 80 + 200 + 75 = $355.

Since the phone costs $400, Annabelle still needs 400 - 355 = $45.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's figure out the height of the tallest tree in Eddy's backyard.

First, we know the shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet taller than that, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Now, let's add the heights of the shortest and second tree: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so we multiply 17 by 2. That gives us 17 * 2 = 34 feet.

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Dean's mom gave him $28 to spend at the toy store. He bought 6 toy cars for $2 each, so that's 6 * $2 = $12. He also bought 5 teddy bears for $1 each, which is 5 * $1 = $5. The total cost of the toys is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean spent $17 out of the $28 his mom gave him, so he had $28 - $17 = $11 left. But then, his mom felt generous and gave him an extra $10. Now, he has $11 + $10 = $21.

"Hey there, let's break down Morgan's birthday party budget. She's got $90 to spend, and she wants to make sure everyone gets to play mini-golf, have some arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice.

First, let's calculate the total cost per person. A round of mini-golf is $5, the arcade tokens are $5, and two go-kart rides cost $10 * 2 = $20. So, the total cost per person is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Now, let's divide the total budget by the cost per person to find out how many people Morgan can invite, including herself. $90 / $30 = 3. Since Morgan is one of those people, we subtract 1 from the result to find out how many friends she can invite: 3 - 1 = 2.

"Hey there, let's break down Marisa's savings. She gets $5 as pocket money every day and spends $1 on 4 lollipops that cost 25 cents each. To find out how much she saves each day, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money.

$5 (daily pocket money) - $1 (cost of lollipops) = $4 (daily savings)

Since Marisa saves for 5 days, we multiply her daily savings by 5:
$4 * 5 = $20

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know Billy bought 40 gumballs at $.05 each, so the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * .05 = $2.

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, the total change he had must have been 2 * 2 = $4.

We know Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is 10 - 4 = $6.

Now, we know the candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we can divide the amount he spent on candy by the cost per pound: 6 / 1.5 = 4.

"Let's break down the problem. We know Carver is 45 years old, and his age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. If we denote the son's age as 'x', we can set up an equation based on this information.

The equation would be: 45 = 2x - 5

To solve for 'x', we'll add 5 to both sides of the equation, which gives us: 50 = 2x

Now, we'll divide both sides by 2 to find the value of 'x': 50 / 2 = 25

So, the son's age is 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the train's route. It travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, and then 100 miles from the second city to the third city. To find the distance from the third city to the first city, we need to calculate 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs. 

The combined distance of the first two legs is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, let's find the total distance traveled by the train in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To determine how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's get to the problem at hand. Mark makes custom dog beds, and we need to figure out how much stuffing he needs for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

First, we need to determine the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. Since it's the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler bed (8 pounds) and a chihuahua bed (2 pounds), we calculate it as (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total stuffing needed. For 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing. For 3 collie beds, he needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

Adding these amounts together, we get 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"What's up, I'm Kai. Let's break down John's road trip to figure out how long it took him.

First, we need to calculate the time it took John to drive to his friend's house. The original distance was 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles, making it a total of 210 miles. He drove at a speed of 70 mph, so we can calculate the time as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 210 miles / 70 mph
Time = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time it took John to drive back home. The distance was 240 miles, and he drove at a speed of 80 mph. Here's the calculation:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

To find the total time of the trip, we simply add the time it took to drive to his friend's house and the time it took to drive back home:

Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time = 6 hours

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We know there are 96 fourth-graders at Small Tree School, and 43 of them are girls. To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.

Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls
Number of boys = 96 - 43
Number of boys = 53

Now, we're told that 4 fourth-grade boys were absent on Friday. To find the number of boys present, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

Number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of boys absent
Number of boys present = 53 - 4
Number of boys present = 49

To find out how many points she needs on the third test, we'll subtract the points she has from the total points required.

So, she has 15 + 18 = 33 points so far. Now, let's subtract that from the total: 42 - 33 = 9.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We know that 3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. Then, we have a number of people kicked out for shoplifting, which is four times the number of people kicked out for not wearing masks, minus 5. So, that's 4 * 3 - 5 = 7 people.

Next, we have three times the number of shoplifters kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. That's 3 * 7 = 21 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people kicked out for these reasons: 3 (not wearing masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31 people.

We're told that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the given reasons from the total: 50 - 31 = 19.

Erin's current points = 3 * 8
Erin's current points = 24

Now, we know Erin scored 14 points. To find out how many points Erin had before, we subtract 14 from her current points.

Erin's points before = Erin's current points - 14
Erin's points before = 24 - 14
Erin's points before = 10

"What's up, I'm Kai. Let's break down the senior gift costs.

First, we've got 44 seniors who need picture frames that cost $20 each. That's 44 * $20 = $880. But wait, we're not done yet. Each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds 20% to the cost. So, the etching cost is 0.2 * $880 = $176. Now, add that to the frame cost: $880 + $176 = $1056.

Next up, 2 seniors are getting pins that cost $5 each. That's 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, let's talk about the officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 seniors. They need cords that cost $12 each, so that's 11 * $12 = $132.

"I'm happy to help you out. Let's break down the shoe sales for the weekend.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. That's a good start.

The next day, Saturday, they sold double that number. So, that's 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract those. That leaves us with 14 - 6 = 8 pairs sold on Sunday.

Now, let's add up the pairs sold each day: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100 shoes.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. The company bought $400,000 worth of equipment, but 40% of it was faulty. To find the amount spent on functioning equipment, we need to calculate the amount spent on faulty equipment first.

The amount spent on faulty equipment is 40% of $400,000. To find 40% of $400,000, we multiply 0.4 by $400,000, which gives us $160,000.

Now, we subtract the amount spent on faulty equipment from the total amount spent to find the amount spent on functioning equipment. So, $400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each half. Since there are 30 sheep in total, half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the milk from the first half. 15 sheep * 1 kg of milk each = 15 kg of milk.

Next, let's calculate the milk from the other half. 15 sheep * 2 kg of milk each = 30 kg of milk.

So, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday:

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Karan's loan to figure out her monthly payment.

First, we need to calculate the interest she owes. The interest rate is 10% per year, but she's only borrowing the money for 5 months. To calculate the interest, we'll convert the time to years: 5 months is approximately 5/12 of a year.

Now, let's calculate the interest:
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
= $3,650 * 10% * (5/12)
= $3,650 * 0.10 * 0.4167
= $152.08

The total amount Karan needs to pay back is the principal plus the interest:
Total amount = Principal + Interest
= $3,650 + $152.08
= $3,802.08

To find the monthly payment, we'll divide the total amount by the number of months:

She sells each cup for $1, so her total revenue is 36 * $1 = $36. To find her profit, we subtract her initial cost from her revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Now, we know she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how many hours she spends running the stand, we divide the total cups by the hourly sales: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

To ride all 9 rides, Dasha needs 9 * 2 = 18 tickets. Since each ticket costs $2, the total cost of Dasha's tickets is 18 * $2 = $36.

Now, let's compare the costs. David spent $30 on his ride bracelet, while Dasha spent $36 on tickets. To find out how much David saved, we subtract the cost of his ride bracelet from the cost of Dasha's tickets: $36 - $30 = $6.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We know the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we need to first find out how many popsicles each of them has.

The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Since the ratio of their popsicles is 5:6, the total parts is 5 + 6 = 11.

Now, let's divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total parts (11) to find the value of 1 part: 
165 ÷ 11 = 15.

Since Betty has 5 parts, she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.

Since Sam has 6 parts, he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Tim is switching from a $60 cable package to streaming services. He's getting Netflix for $10 a month. He's also getting Hulu and Disney Plus, which normally cost $10 each, but he's saving 20% by bundling them.

First, let's calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount. The original cost is $10 + $10 = $20. The 20% discount is 0.20 * $20 = $4. So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix to find the total cost of the streaming services: $16 + $10 = $26.

To find out how much money Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 - $26 = $34.

First, we need to find the total number of books the shelving system can hold. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns: 6 * 6 = 36.

Next, we need to find double the number of books, which is 2 * 36 = 72.

Finally, Wendy wants 20 more than double the number of books, so we add 20 to 72: 72 + 20 = 92.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Erica started with the cards she made, which is 20. Then, her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards from her dad. 

Now, let's add those to the cards she made: 20 + 30 = 50. 

Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards. 

To find out how many cards she has left, we subtract the cards she passed out from the total: 50 - 29 = 21. 

Finally, Erica received 17 cards from family and friends. So, we add those to the cards she has left: 21 + 17 = 38.

"Hey, let's break down the pizza problem. We've got 12 slices to start with. Jenny gives 1/3 to Bill, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 slices. Then, she gives 1/4 to Mark, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 slices. After that, Jenny eats 2 slices herself.

Now, let's subtract the slices given to Bill, Mark, and the slices Jenny ate from the total number of slices: 
12 - 4 - 3 - 2 = 3

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Mark has $50 in his bank account and wants to buy a bike that costs $300. To find out how many days he needs to save, we first need to calculate how much more he needs to save.

The amount Mark needs to save is the cost of the bike minus the amount he already has: $300 - $50 = $250.

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can divide the amount he needs to save ($250) by his daily earnings ($10) to find out how many days he needs to save:

$250 ÷ $10 = 25 days

"I'm happy to help you out. So, Nancy's got a bunch of bugs in her woodshed, and we need to figure out how many there are in total.

First, let's start with the spiders. She saw 90 of those. Then, there are the millipedes. We know there are 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders, so that's 1/3 * 90 = 30 millipedes.

Now, the stink bugs are a bit trickier. There are twice as many stink bugs as millipedes, minus 12. So, that's 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

To get the total number of bugs, we just add up the spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica. So, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35 years.

Now, since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, we can find Alice's age by adding 7 to Beth's age. That makes Alice 35 + 7 = 42 years old.

The difference between Alice's and Erica's ages is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

2 glasses * 8 ounces/glass = 16 ounces

Now, we know milk has 3 calories per ounce. To find the total calories John consumed, we multiply the total ounces by the calories per ounce:
16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The builder works 4 weeks every month and 6 days every week. To find out how many days he works in a month, we multiply the number of weeks by the number of days per week:
4 weeks/month * 6 days/week = 24 days/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of days he works in a month by 12 to get the total number of days he works in a year:
24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year

Now, let's calculate his total earnings in a year. He earns $50 per day, so we multiply the total number of days he works in a year by his daily wage:
288 days/year * $50/day = $14,400/year

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies, so we need to multiply the ingredients by 4. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk.

For flour, we need 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

For milk, we need 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs to buy 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

Now, let's find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy. We subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day, which means it uses 900 watts of energy each hour. If he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, we need to find out how many kilowatts of electric energy he'll save in 30 days.

First, let's calculate the original energy usage per day: 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours. Since we're asked for the answer in kilowatts, we'll convert this to kilowatt-hours: 7200 watt-hours / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatt-hours.

Now, let's calculate the new energy usage per day: 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours, which is 2.7 kilowatt-hours.

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new energy usage: 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours.

To find the energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30: 4.5 kilowatt-hours * 30 = 135 kilowatt-hours.

Now, let's add up all the stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes in total. Since there are 4 zebras, we divide the total number of stripes by 4 to find the average: 88 / 4 = 22.

For 5 sandwiches, he'll need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so that's 5 * $7.00 = $35.00. The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so that's 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.

Adding those together, Tyson will spend $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00 on meat and cheese.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis initially, and he has 40 cannolis. So, the number of corns he has is 2 * 40 = 80.

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis, bringing the total number of cannolis to 40 + 60 = 100.

Now, he buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, which means he buys 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Adding these new corns to the initial amount, we get 80 + 60 = 140 corns.

Finally, we combine the total number of corns and cannolis: 140 + 100 = 240.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Elliott's steps to figure out how many he took during his jog.

Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps with his friend. So, before the jog, he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that before the jog, he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps taken.

Now, we subtract the steps taken before the jog from the total steps taken before the jog and after the jog: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"Hey, let's break down the problem. Toby's got a 45-page book with 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9000 words. He reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, so it'll take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to finish the book.

After that, he's got a 10-minute drive to the airport. So, in total, he'll need 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.

Since he's got 60 minutes before he needs to leave, we subtract the time he needs from the time he's got: 60 - 40 = 20 minutes.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount paid to the employees in May. Since there are 40 employees, each working 40 hours a week at $15 per hour, the total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600. With approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. Multiply this by the number of employees (40), and we get the total amount paid in May: $2400 * 40 = $96000.

Now, let's move on to June. We know that 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30. The total amount paid to each employee in a week remains the same, $600. With 4 weeks in June, the total amount paid to each employee is still $2400. Multiply this by the number of employees in June (30), and we get the total amount paid in June: $2400 * 30 = $72000.

To find the total amount paid in the two months, we simply add the amounts paid in May and June: $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Sally's expenses to find out how much money she has left.

Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy, and the deal was ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which is $3 * 0.5 = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each. The total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up all her expenses: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on them, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do that, we multiply $1200 by 0.20, which gives us $240. Now, subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150: $960 + $150 = $1110.

Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she'll need 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Now, we know her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many dozens she needs to make, we'll divide the total number of cookies by 12.

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that 99% of Marcy's candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of them will explode. To find the number of candles that will explode, we'll calculate 1% of the total number of candles made, which is 50,000.

Number of candles that will explode = 1% of 50,000
= 0.01 * 50,000
= 500

Now, we're told that 5% of the more dangerous candles (the ones that explode) also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since we already know that 500 candles will explode, we can find the number of candles that will smell like wet dog by calculating 5% of 500.

Number of candles that will smell like wet dog = 5% of 500
= 0.05 * 500
= 25

So, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down this problem step by step.

First, we know Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half that amount from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples. Now, let's say she gathered x apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples, and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples. She didn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500

Combine like terms:

(45 + x) + 105 = 500

Combine constants:

150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

x = 350

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's break down the problem. We have a herd with camels and dromedaries. Camels have two humps, and dromedaries have one hump. We're given that there are 180 heads and 304 humps in total.

We can start by setting up two equations. Let's use 'c' for the number of camels and 'd' for the number of dromedaries. Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is the sum of camels and dromedaries:
c + d = 180

Now, let's consider the humps. Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each. So, the total number of humps is:
2c + d = 304

To solve for 'd', we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting c = 124 into the first equation:
124 + d = 180
d = 56

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Tom's trip to find the total distance he traveled.

First, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for 4 days, so that's 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km. 

Next, he traveled for 2 days, covering only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. To find this distance, we calculate 30% of 800 km, which is 0.3 * 800 = 240 km.

On the 7th day, Tom didn't travel at all, so that's 0 km.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, which is 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

Now, let's add up the distances: 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. To find Timothy's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats run after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5: (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. To find the number of cats left on the rock, we subtract the cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

Next, the normal rate kicks in for 8 months at $12 per month. That's 8 * $12 = $96.

Now, we need to find out how many months are left at the increased rate of $14 per month. Since 2 years is 24 months, we subtract the months already accounted for: 24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months. So, the increased rate period is 10 months at $14 per month, which is 10 * $14 = $140.

To find the total cost, we add the costs of all three periods: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

"What's up, I'm Kai. So, Cole bought two pairs of jeans, tattered and jogger, and saved a total of $6. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less, which is $22.

Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, that's 1/3 * $6 = $2. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we add the savings to the sale price: $22 + $2 = $24.

To find the original price of the tattered jeans, we add the savings to the sale price: $28 + $4 = $32.

Now, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, we subtract the original price of the jogger jeans from the original price of the tattered jeans, but since we want to know how much more the jogger jeans cost, we'll actually be looking for the difference the other way around.

The original price difference between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8. But since the jogger jeans cost less, we'll say the jogger jeans cost $8 less than the tattered jeans. To represent this as ""how much more"" the jogger jeans cost, we'll use a negative number.

The store-bought feeders still attract 20 birds each, and with 3 of those, that's 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

"Let's break down the problem. Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made $150 from selling his cards. Since he sold each card for $1.5, we can find the number of cards he sold by dividing the total amount of money he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5):

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

However, this is the number of cards he sold, not the number he started with. We know that he kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with ""x"". Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3x.

We know that 2/3x = 100, so we can solve for x:

2/3x = 100
x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26. 

Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

Next, Prince Arthur used a spear to slay three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. That's (3/4) * 100 = 75 dragons.

Then, Prince Walter grabbed a rusty iron axe and slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. That's 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Lastly, Prince Bruce, who forgot his sword at home, used a nail file to slay one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. That's (1/5) * 150 = 30 dragons.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many gallons of gas were in each container. Since 15 gallons were divided equally into 5 containers, we can divide 15 by 5.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Now, Josey needs 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. To find out how many gallons that is, we multiply 3 gallons by 1/4.

1/4 * 3 gallons = 0.75 gallons

Finally, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply 0.75 gallons by 8.

0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of $5. To find 99% of $5, we multiply $5 by 0.99, which is $4.95. We convert this to cents: $4.95 x 100 = 495 cents.

George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x 40 = 120 cents on chips. Now, we subtract the amount spent on chips (120 cents) from the total amount spent (495 cents): 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we divide the remaining amount spent (375 cents) by the cost of a candy bar (75 cents): 375 / 75 = 5.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Ray had 25 lollipops and decided to keep 5 for himself. To find out how many lollipops he shared, we subtract the number he kept from the total.

25 (total lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept) = 20 lollipops shared

Now, we know he shared these 20 lollipops equally among his 4 friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends.

20 (lollipops shared) / 4 (number of friends) = 5

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's get to the problem. We've got a cake that weighs 20 ounces, cut into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each have a piece, so that's 2 pieces gone. To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to figure out how much those 2 pieces weighed.

First, we find the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight by the number of pieces: 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece. Now, we multiply the weight of each piece by the number of pieces eaten: 2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces.

The weight of the remaining cake is the total weight minus the weight of the eaten cake: 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces.

"Hey, let's break this down. Sitti and Juris have a total of 34 + 22 oranges, which is 56 oranges. They're sharing these with 6 other friends, so that's 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 friends = 8 people in total.

To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people. That's 56 oranges / 8 people = 7 oranges per person.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount. So, he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box. The total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, let's add the cost of onions and beef stock to get the total cost of the ingredients. $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we'll divide the total cost by the number of servings. $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We know that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne at the premiere. We also know that Wayne's drive to the theater takes 4 minutes. Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, her drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Now, let's find the difference in their travel times. That's 16 - 4 = 12 minutes. But we're not done yet. Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to add those extra 5 minutes to the difference in their travel times.

So, Bernadette should leave 12 + 5 = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to convert the length of Billie's room from yards to feet. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, we can multiply the length in yards by 3 to get the length in feet:

Length (in feet) = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length, we can use the area of the room to find the width. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

Area = Length * Width

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width:

Width = Area / Length
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We have two sisters, Elizabeth and Margareth, who bought beads. Elizabeth got 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, while Margareth got 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Each pack contains 20 beads.

First, let's calculate the total number of packs each sister bought. Elizabeth has 1 + 2 = 3 packs, and Margareth has 3 + 4 = 7 packs.

Now, we multiply the number of packs by 20 to find the total number of beads. Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads, and Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number. That's 140 (Margareth's beads) - 60 (Elizabeth's beads) = 80 beads.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

Marcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees each hour. So, the total temperature increase from baking is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees. Adding this to the initial temperature, we get 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equal to 3 intervals of 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease is 2 * 3 = 6 degrees. Subtracting this from the temperature after baking, we get 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate Jon's total time. 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Now, let's calculate James' time for the swim and bike ride. 
- James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. 
- 10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
- James' swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes
- James took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. 
- James' bike ride time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' time for the run:
- James' total time: 180 minutes
- James' swim and bike time: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes
- James' run time: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Movie C is 1.25 hours long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour.

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we're told Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B.

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

Finally, we know Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

Movie A = Movie B / 4
Movie A = 80 minutes / 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we need to find out how far the horse runs. We know it runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. To calculate the distance, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is half an hour, so the horse runs for 0.5 hours. Now, we can calculate the distance: 

Distance = speed * time = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay.

The cost of the hay is 8 bails * $3 per bail = $24.

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30. To find out how much change he has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money he has: 

$30 - $24 = $6

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, and each tray holds 5 glasses. To find out how many eggs are needed per tray, we multiply the number of eggs per glass by the number of glasses per tray: 5 * 5 = 25 eggs per tray.

Now, let's divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per tray: 50 eggs / 25 eggs per tray = 2 trays.

The regular movie ticket costs $12, and the soda costs $3, so together that's $12 + $3 = $15.

To find the regular price of popcorn, we subtract the cost of the ticket and soda from the total amount spent: $19 - $15 = $4.

To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. The distance traveled at 60 mph is 60 * 2 = 120 miles, and the distance traveled at 30 mph is 30 * 1 = 30 miles. So, the total distance traveled is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

First, we need to find the volume of each raised bed. To do that, we multiply the width, length, and height: 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet. Since there are 10 raised beds, the total volume is 32 cubic feet * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Now, we need to figure out how many bags of potting soil Bob needs. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so we divide the total volume by the volume of each bag: 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet = 160 bags.

Lastly, he buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, which is 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add all these weights together: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we'll divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity: 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Since 2 trips will be enough to carry all the feed, with no remainder, the answer is indeed 2.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Sarah spent $300 on books, and each book costs $15. To find out how many books she bought, we need to divide the total amount she spent by the cost of each book.

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Now, since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. To find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one thing, we need to add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts, but then subtract the number of kids who are allergic to both to avoid double-counting.

So, let's do the math: 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15. Then, subtract 3 (both) = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know that 12 kids are allergic to at least one thing. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class: 32 - 12 = 20.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We have 3 groups of employees, with 200 employees in each group. That's a total of 3 * 200 = 600 employees. Each group also has 7 tour guides, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 tour guides. To find the total number of people going on the tour, we add the employees and tour guides together: 600 + 21 = 621.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the cost of Tom's anniversary getaway.

First, we have the plane tickets, which cost $5000 each. Since Tom and his wife are both going, that's 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel. The normal price is $1500 per day, but it's 20% more expensive because it's a busy weekend. To find the increased price, we'll calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. So, the hotel price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

Since they're staying for 3 days, the total hotel cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Now, let's add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to get the total cost of the trip: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Now, Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. That's 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes Jasper has, we add the blue and yellow tubes together: 2 + 9 = 11.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's solve this problem together.

We have two kinds of pennies, a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, and the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny first.

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies:
Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 + 48
Combined weight = 84

"Hey, let's break down the problem. Keegan and Tashay need to raise $200 for their baseball camp. By 3 pm, Keegan had earned $83 and Tashay had earned $91. To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to add the amount they've already earned and then subtract that from their goal.

So, let's add their earnings: $83 + $91 = $174. Now, subtract that from their goal: $200 - $174 = $26.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Gabriel has 20 songs on his player, and Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. So, Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Now, let's see how many songs each of them can add to their player. Gabriel's player can store up to 100 songs, so he can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs. Luri's player can also store up to 100 songs, so he can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs.

The question asks how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his. To find this out, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

So, 2/5 of 60 is (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 oranges.

Now, since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange, the total amount he gave up is 24 * $10 = $240.

12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Now, we know James runs 10 miles an hour. To find the total hours he runs a week, we divide the total miles he runs a week by his hourly running speed:
60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much oats each horse consumes in a day. Since each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal and they're fed twice a day, that's 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per horse per day.

Now, Uncle Ben has 4 horses, so the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

We need to find out how much oats they'll consume in 5 days, so we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Finally, since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats needed by the weight of one bag: 200 / 50 = 4 bags.

(2/3) * 27 = 18

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. Now, we need to find out how many of those Pomeranians are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate that by multiplying 18 by 1/3.

(1/3) * 18 = 6

Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack. They are currently on sale for buy one get one free. She also has a $2.00 coupon. To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors after the discount and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free offer, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be:

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have a total of 8 razors. Now, we can calculate the cost per razor:

$2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

$0.25 * 100 = 25 cents

The bottom level has 4 girls, each 64"" tall, so their total height is 4 * 64"" = 256"". 
The middle level has 3 girls, each 64"" tall, so their total height is 3 * 64"" = 192"". 
The top level has 2 girls, each 64"" tall, so their total height is 2 * 64"" = 128"". 
The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, add the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 636"" / 12 = 53 feet.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, which means she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Together, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we can find out how many pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by 3: 120 / 3 = 40.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have two venues to choose from, each with its own pricing structure. The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, plus $5 per guest for food. The second venue charges $25 per guest, with food included.

To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, we can set up an equation. Let's say the number of guests is 'x'. The total cost for the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost). The total cost for the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want the costs to be equal, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for x:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

So, the two venues will be equal in cost when there are 10 guests.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's start by using variables to represent the number of insects each person found. Let's say Bodhi found B insects, David found D insects, and Lily found L insects.

We know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write an equation: D = B/2.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write another equation: L = D + 7.

We're also given that the total number of insects they found is 43, so we can write a third equation: L + D + B = 43.

Now, let's substitute the first two equations into the third equation. We can substitute D = B/2 into the equation L = D + 7 to get L = B/2 + 7.

Now, substitute L and D into the equation L + D + B = 43:
(B/2 + 7) + (B/2) + B = 43

Combine like terms:
2B/2 + 7 = 43
B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
B = 36

Now that we know Bodhi found 36 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:
D = B/2
D = 36/2
D = 18

Now that we know David found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:
L = D + 7
L = 18 + 7
L = 25

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, which is 1/4 * 364 yards = 91 yards.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is 1/2 * 364 yards = 182 yards.

Since Suzie paid $7 in all, the total cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

For 2 x 4 wood, Frederick can get 200 sticks, and it costs $4. That's 200 sticks / $4 = 50 sticks per dollar.

For 2 x 8 wood, he can get 400 sticks, and it costs $6. That's 400 sticks / $6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar.

Since 2 x 8 wood gives more sticks per dollar, that's the way to go. Now, let's see how many 2 x 8 woods Frederick can buy with his $24 budget:
$24 / $6 = 4

Each 2 x 8 wood gives 400 sticks, so we multiply the number of 2 x 8 woods by the number of sticks per wood:
4 * 400 = 1600

Now, let's count the total number of animals at each place:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

Adding these up, we get 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 skeins per grandchild. Since there are 3 grandchildren, we multiply 21 by 3 to get the total number of skeins needed: 21 * 3 = 63.

"I'm happy to help Chris with his math homework. Let's break it down step by step.

Chris has 100 math problems to complete in total. On Monday, he completes 12 problems. That's a good start!

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. So, he completes 3 * 12 = 36 problems on Tuesday. Now, let's add the problems he completed on Monday and Tuesday: 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

Now, we subtract the problems he completed from the total number of problems: 100 - 48 = 52 problems remaining.

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13 problems. So, he completes 13 problems on Wednesday.

Let's add the problems he completed on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 48 + 13 = 61 problems.

Finally, we subtract the problems he completed from the total number of problems: 100 - 61 = 39 problems.

Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's get down to business and figure out how many quarts of strawberries Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm.

First, we know Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. Bobby, on the other hand, picks one less quart than Tony, so that's 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour for Bobby.

Now, Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries as Bobby, which means she can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour. And Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so that's 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour for Ricky.

To find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour, we simply add their individual rates together: 6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The Beverly Hills Bakery started with 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, so the total number of loaves sold is 93 + 39 = 132.

Now, let's subtract the total number of loaves sold from the initial number of loaves: 200 - 132 = 68.

But wait, a grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. So, we need to add those to the remaining loaves: 68 + 6 = 74.

The bakery had 74 loaves of bread left."
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's get to the problem at hand. Jackson is planting tulips, and we need to figure out how many rows he'll have in total.

First, let's calculate the number of rows for the red tulips. Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row, and he buys 36 of them. To find the number of rows, we divide the total number of tulips by the number of tulips per row:
36 ÷ 6 = 6 rows of red tulips.

Next, let's do the same for the blue tulips. Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, and he buys 24 of them. Again, we divide the total number of tulips by the number of tulips per row:
24 ÷ 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
6 rows (red) + 3 rows (blue) = 9 rows.

"Heather's got a big bag of raisins and wants to make some treats. Let's break it down. She's dividing the 27 cups of raisins equally among oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. So, for the cookies, she'll use 1/3 of the raisins, which is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Now, each batch of oatmeal cookies needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we'll divide the 9 cups by 3/4. To do this, we can multiply 9 by 4 and then divide by 3. That gives us 9 * 4 / 3 = 12.

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Ada's electric bill situation.

First, we need to calculate her daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device. Initially, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. The new device will add 2 kilowatts per hour to that. So, her daily consumption after adding the device will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh). This gives us:
Daily consumption before: 12 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 288 kWh
Daily consumption after: 14 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 336 kWh

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption:
Weekly consumption before: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
Weekly consumption after: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour, so we multiply the weekly consumption by the cost:
Weekly cost before: 2016 kWh * $1.50 = $3024
Weekly cost after: 2352 kWh * $1.50 = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is:
$3528 - $3024 = $504

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, that means they can paint a whole house in 10 days, since painting a whole house is twice as much work.

Now, let's convert those 10 days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days is equal to 10 * 24 = 240 hours.

Here's the thing: if one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, having more people will speed up the process. With 5 people working together, they can finish the job in 1/5 the time. So, we divide 240 hours by 5.

The final answer is: 48"
"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, to find the number of chairs Ophelia has, we add 2 to the number of sofas: 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Now, Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, which means Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we subtract 2 from the number of chairs to find the number of sofas: 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna:
Total sofas = 20 (Ophelia) + 64 (Jenna) = 84
Total chairs = 22 (Ophelia) + 66 (Jenna) = 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Tom spent a total of $48 on a CD and a headphone set. The CD cost $4, so the headphone set must have cost $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, if Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he could've spent that $44 on more CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we can divide $44 by $4 to find out how many more CDs he could've bought: $44 / $4 = 11.

So, Tom could've bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

For 5 weeks, Josh spent 4 hours working out each week. That's a total of 5 * 4 = 20 hours. 

Then, there were 2 consecutive weeks where he spent 5 hours each week, which adds up to 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Lastly, there was one week where he spent 6 hours working out.

Now, let's add up the total hours spent: 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We start with 48 people on the bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving us with:
48 - 8 = 40

Now, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus. Now the total number of passengers is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

On the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

On the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer is 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get on the bus. Now the total number of passengers is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find Jame's current age. Since he'll turn 27 in 5 years, we subtract 5 from 27 to get his current age: 27 - 5 = 22.

Next, we need to find Jame's age in 8 years, which will be 22 + 8 = 30.

Now, let's consider Jame's cousin. In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 2 * 30 = 60. So, the cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

To find the cousin's current age, we subtract 8 from 55: 55 - 8 = 47.

Finally, we need to find the difference in their current ages. The difference is 47 - 22 = 25.

"Let's break down the problem. Errol spent a total of $2,400 on a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer. We know the computer cost $1,100. We also know he paid $400 less for the printer than the computer. So, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's add the cost of the computer and printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. This means the 2 monitors cost $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300.

"Let's break down the problem. We have 20 kids divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, so that's 10 boys and 10 girls. The boys went out and brought back 60 shells each, which means they brought back a total of 10 x 60 = 600 shells.

Now, the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys, plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, we need to calculate four times the number of shells brought by the boys, which is 4 x 600 = 2400. Then, we add the number of shells brought by the boys to that, which is 2400 + 600 = 3000.

Since there are 10 girls, we need to divide the total number of shells they brought back by 10 to find out how many each girl brought. So, 3000 / 10 = 300.

Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6 years

Now that we know Alyana is 6 years old, we can find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2 years
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8 years

To find out how many vlogs she has left to make, we need to add up the vlogs she's already made: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54. Now, let's subtract that from the total number of vlogs she needs to make: 72 - 54 = 18.

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her monthly goal.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Elvis's savings goal for April. He wants to save a total of $1125 for the month, and he's planning to save twice as much each day in the second half of the month compared to the first half.

Since April has 30 days, we can split it into two halves of 15 days each. Let's say Elvis saves 'x' dollars per day in the first half. Then, in the second half, he'll save 2x dollars per day.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half. We can set up an equation to represent this:

15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Combine like terms:
15x + 30x = 1125
45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So, Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2x = 2 * 25 = 50 dollars per day in the second half.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

Now, she re-writes everything she's already written. That means she re-writes the initial 52 letters and the additional 13 letters, for a total of 52 + 13 = 65 letters re-written.

To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters from each step: 52 (initial) + 13 (half) + 65 (re-written) = 130 letters.

"I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you out. Let's dive into the problem.

We know that when the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. To find out how long it takes him to swim a mile in warm water, we need to calculate twice the time it takes in cold water and add 2 minutes.

Twice the time it takes in cold water is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that makes it 32 + 2 = 34 minutes. Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim in hot water, we'll assume it's the same as the time for warm water, which is 34 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

7 * 2 = 14 holes

Now, let's find out how many buttons have 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 have 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is:
21 - 7 = 14 buttons

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

So James needs 4 packs of candles. The total cost will be the number of packs multiplied by the cost per pack: 4 * $3 = $12.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pages Judy read in the first week. We know she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Now, we're given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in the first week, we can calculate:
105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages = 105 / 1.5 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we simply add the pages from both weeks:
140 pages (first week) + 100 pages (second week) = 240 pages.

"I'm happy to help you out. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, and in 7 years, he'll be three times as old as his nephew. To start, we need to find out how old Shiloh will be in 7 years. We can do this by adding 7 to his current age:
Shiloh's age in 7 years = 44 + 7
Shiloh's age in 7 years = 51

Now, we know that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. We can set up an equation to represent this:
51 = 3 * nephew's age in 7 years

To find the nephew's age in 7 years, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:
nephew's age in 7 years = 51 / 3
nephew's age in 7 years = 17

Finally, to find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 from his age in 7 years:
nephew's current age = 17 - 7
nephew's current age = 10

Sharon got $5 for the first tooth. Then, for the next three teeth, she received $1 each, which is 3 x $1 = $3. 

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half the amount she got for each of the previous three teeth. Since she got $1 for each of those, half of that is $0.50 per tooth. So, for the last two teeth, she got 2 x $0.50 = $1.

Now, let's add it all up: $5 + $3 + $1 = $9.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We know Richie scored 80 goals, which is 20 more than Mark and 45 more than Anna. To find Mark's score, we subtract 20 from Richie's score:
Mark's score = 80 - 20
Mark's score = 60

To find Anna's score, we subtract 45 from Richie's score:
Anna's score = 80 - 45
Anna's score = 35

Now, we add up all their scores to find the total:
Total goals = Richie's score + Mark's score + Anna's score
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"What's up, I'm Kai. Let's break down Peter's action figure shopping spree.

Peter's got $70 to spend over 7 days, so he's got a daily budget of $70 / 7 = $10. From Sunday to Wednesday, he's buying wooden action figures for $5 each. That's 4 days, so he can get 2 wooden action figures per day. That's a total of 2 * 4 = 8 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week, Thursday to Saturday, he's switching to plastic action figures for $2 each. With his daily budget, he can get 5 plastic action figures per day. That's 3 days, so he can get 5 * 3 = 15 plastic action figures.

Adding it all up, Peter's got 8 wooden action figures and 15 plastic action figures. That's a total of 8 + 15 = 23 action figures.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Ford grows 40 roses every week and supplies them to three local flower shops. The first shop orders 20 roses, the second orders 15, and the third orders 30 per week.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered per week:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Now, let's subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"Hey, let's break down the numbers for the grilled cheese food truck. 

First, we need to figure out how much they make from selling 10 sandwiches. Since each sandwich is sold for $7.00, the total revenue is 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. The bread costs $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00. They also spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches. So, the total cost is $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $70.00 (revenue) - $33.00 (cost) = $37.00.

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons to make a muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the total number of muffins:
192 crayons / 8 crayons per muffin = 24 muffins

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the area of Michael's bedroom. The room measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new carpet. It costs $12 per square foot, so for 216 square feet, it's 216 * $12 = $2592. The padding underneath costs $2 per square foot, so that's 216 * $2 = $432.

Next, we need to consider the cost of removing the old carpet, which is $4 per square foot. For 216 square feet, that's 216 * $4 = $864. Finally, the cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so for 216 square feet, it's 216 * $34 = $7344.

To find the total cost, we add up all these expenses: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

Mack saw a total of 50 birds on days one and two, none on day three, 120 birds on days four and five, 20 on day six, and 90 on day seven. To find the average number of birds he saw per day, we need to calculate the total number of birds and divide it by the number of days.

Total birds for the week: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280

Then, we divide the resulting value by 5, which gives us 30 / 5 = 6.

After that, we subtract 12 from the starting value, which gives us 20 - 12 = 8.

Finally, we multiply the resulting value from the division by the result of the subtraction, which gives us 6 * 8 = 48.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's tackle this oven temperature problem.

Maggie's oven is off by a certain percentage, and we need to figure out what temperature she should set it to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. We know that when she sets it to 450, the actual temperature is 468.

First, let's calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. We can do this by finding the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then dividing by the set temperature.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18. To find the percentage, we'll divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now that we know the oven is off by 4%, we can use this information to find the correct temperature for Maggie's recipe. Let's call the temperature she should set her oven to ""x"". Since the oven is off by 4%, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

We know the actual temperature should be 520, so we can set up the equation: x + (4% of x) = 520. To find 4% of x, we'll multiply x by 0.04: x + 0.04x = 520.

Combine like terms: 1.04x = 520. Now, divide both sides by 1.04: x = 500.

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

First, let's find 30% of Herb's house value: 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800. Now, subtract that from Herb's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200. So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

Now, let's add the values of both houses to find the combined value: $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

Now, let's calculate the cost of 2 boxes. Each box is originally $100.00, but it's 10% off. The discount is $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00. So, the cost of 1 box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00. For 2 boxes, it's $90.00 * 2 = $180.00.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of contacts. Since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), we'll divide the total cost by the total number of contacts and then multiply by 2.

$180.00 ÷ 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact
$1.00 * 2 = $2.00 per pair of contacts

"Hey there, let's break down Hannah's water needs. She's got a pretty intense workout routine going on. 

First, we need to figure out how many calories she burns in total. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories per hour. That's 2 * 500 = 1000 calories. Then, she spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories per hour. That's 1 * 600 = 600 calories. 

Adding those together, we get 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories burned in total.

Now, we know Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many 200-calorie increments she burned, we divide the total calories by 200. That's 1600 / 200 = 8.

To start, I'll represent the number of blue jelly beans as B. Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B. And with 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B.

Now, we know the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up an equation:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:

First, let's calculate the weight change for each option. If Martin eats Cheerios, he'll lose 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, that's 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds lost.

On the other hand, if Martin eats donuts, he'll gain 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, that's 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds gained.

"Let's break down the problem. We have a triangle with three angles, and we know that they add up to 180 degrees. We also know that one angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle.

Let's call the smallest angle x. Then, the other two angles are 2x and 3x. We can write an equation based on the fact that the three angles add up to 180 degrees:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

In the third year, Steve buys 4 games per month, so that's 48 games. He gets 5 more games for Christmas, making it 48 + 5 = 53 games. Adding this to his previous total, Steve now has 51 + 53 = 104 games.

The final answer is: 104"
"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so we can find its rate by dividing the distance by the time. 

The plane's rate is 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Now, we need to figure out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate. We can do this by dividing the distance by the rate:
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, so to find out how much he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. That's 60 pounds of chocolates per hour for Ruiz.

Now, Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. But since we're comparing it to Ruiz's hourly production, we need to calculate 3/4 of his hourly production. That's 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds of chocolates per hour for Marissa.

If they work for 12 hours, Ruiz will make 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates, and Marissa will make 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260.

"I'm happy to help you out. So, let's break down Howard's spending at the arcade.

On Monday, he spent $8. That's a pretty chill day at the arcade, if you ask me.

On Tuesday, things got a bit more intense. He spent twice as much as he did on Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16.

And then, on Wednesday, he really went all out. He spent 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64. Whoa, that's a lot of quarters!

So, the total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Now, let's see how much money he has left. He originally had $100, so if we subtract the amount he spent, we get $100 - $88 = $12.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Patrick's lemonade sales to find out how much he earned in total.

First, we'll calculate the earnings from the first 4 hours. Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, in 4 hours, he sold 15 * 4 = 60 cups. The total earnings from the first 4 hours = 60 * $0.50 = $30.

Next, we'll calculate the earnings from the next 2 hours. Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, in 2 hours, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups. The total earnings from the next 2 hours = 20 * $0.60 = $12.

Now, let's add the earnings from both periods to find the total. The total earnings from 6 hours = $30 + $12 = $42.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know that every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. To find the number of rotations per mile, we'll divide 725 by 2.

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so we'll multiply the rotations per mile by the miles driven per month to get the total rotations per month.

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we'll multiply the rotations per month by 12 to get the rotations per year.

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

The tires can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before they need to be replaced. To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we'll divide the total rotations by the rotations per year.

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We know the jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and gives 120 washings with 2 pumps. If Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, we need to find the cost of each pump in cents.

First, let's find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, the bottle must have enough shampoo for 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

Now, we can find the cost of each pump. The cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is 2400 cents. To find the cost per pump, we'll divide the total cost by the total number of pumps.

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = 2400 cents / 240 pumps
Cost per pump = 10 cents

"What's up, I'm Kai. So, Joe's got $50 to spend on an outfit for his field trip, and there's a sweet 30% off sale at the clothing store. He's eyeing a $25 shirt and $35 shorts. Let's crunch some numbers.

First, we add the prices of the shirt and shorts: $25 + $35 = $60. Now, we need to calculate the discount. 30% of $60 is 0.3 * $60 = $18. So, the discount is $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total price: $60 - $18 = $42. Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add anything else. Finally, we subtract the final cost from Joe's initial $50: $50 - $42 = $8.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's get to the problem at hand. Juan wants to add croissants to his bakery menu and needs to figure out how much butter he'll need. He's planning to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

First, we need to calculate how much butter is needed to make 4 dozen croissants. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter needed per dozen:
4 dozen * 1/4 pound/dozen = 1 pound

Now, we need to find out how much butter Juan will need for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily amount of butter by 7:
1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds

"Hey, let's break down the problem. We need to find the cost difference between repaving Monica's street and Lewis' street. 

First, we calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street. Since it's 150 meters long and costs $194 per meter, the total cost is 150 * $194 = $29,100.

Next, we calculate the cost of repaving Lewis' street. It's 490 meters long, so the total cost is 490 * $194 = $95,060.

Now, to find the cost difference, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960.

"What's up, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. This works out to $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.

Since the research takes 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months. The cost per month for these months is 50% more than the initial funding, which is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

The cost for the remaining 45 months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

Adding this to the initial $100,000, the total cost of the research is $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"What's up guys, it's Kai. So, let's break down the problem. We've got three players eating meat, and we need to find out how many ounces they consumed in total.

The first player had a 6-ounce steak, easy enough. The second player had beef tips, 8 of them, and each one was an ounce. So, that's 8 ounces right there. The third player went all out with a one-pound steak. Now, we need to convert that to ounces since that's what we're working with. One pound is equal to 16 ounces, so the third player had 16 ounces.

Now, let's add it all up: 6 ounces from the first player, 8 ounces from the second, and 16 ounces from the third. That's 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players didn't eat any meat since they ordered vegetarian meals, so we don't need to worry about them.

First, we know the group has 1000 members, and each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. So, the total posts per day from all members would be 3 posts/day * 1000 members = 3000 posts/day.

Since March has 31 days, we can find the total posts in March by multiplying the daily posts by the number of days: 3000 posts/day * 31 days = 93,000 posts.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of water for laundry in a year. The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons used by the cost per gallon: 2080 * 0.15 = $312.

Now, we know the bull weighs 750kg. To find out how many days it'll take Prince to sell the meat, we divide the weight of the bull by the amount of meat he sells per day: 750kg / 150kg per day = 5 days.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of seats in the auditorium. Since there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, we can calculate the total number of seats by multiplying the number of rows by the number of seats per row.

Total number of seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we know that one-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators. To find the number of seats occupied by administrators, we can multiply the total number of seats by 1/4.

Seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Now, let's find the remaining seats by subtracting the seats occupied by administrators from the total number of seats.

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

We're told that one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents. To find the number of seats occupied by parents, we can multiply the remaining seats by 1/3.

Seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Finally, the rest of the seats were occupied by students. To find the number of seats occupied by students, we can subtract the seats occupied by parents from the remaining seats.

Seats occupied by students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

On top of that, he chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, adding up to 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces total.

Jim started with 20 pieces, so after chewing 6, he's got 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister and keeps the other 7.

Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb per second, and we need to convert it to Mb per hour. We know that 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb.

First, let's convert 20 kb to Mb. Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide 20 by 1000 to get 0.02 Mb per second.

Next, we need to convert seconds to hours. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

First, we need to find out how much the company paid to acquire each car. They paid 30% of the selling price, which is $25,000. So, the cost price of each car is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500.

Now, let's calculate the profit on each car. It's the selling price minus the cost price, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"Let's break this down step by step. We're trying to find out how many men can stay upright on the wave. First, we need to figure out how many riders in total can stay upright. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet, we'll multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright. Now, we know that 60% of these riders are women. To find the number of women, we'll multiply 25 by 0.6.

25 * 0.6 = 15

This means 15 of the riders who can stay upright are women. To find the number of men, we'll subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

Now, we're told the price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, we subtract $400 from the price of the gold jewel:
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

To find the total price of all three jewels, we add the prices together:

Let's work backwards. If the cost per class is $10, and the total cost is $60, then Manny can attend:
$60 / $10 = 6 classes

The volume of a rectangular hole is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth. So, let's do that:
Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. To find the total time, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot:

And finally, the upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add all these costs together: $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500.

The suits cost $750 each, so that's 10 * $750 = $7,500. The dress pants are 1/5 the cost of a suit, which is $150 each. So, 10 dress pants will be 10 * $150 = $1,500. Now, the dress shirts are $60 each, and he got 3 for each suit, so that's 3 * 10 * $60 = $1,800.

Adding all these up, we get $7,500 + $1,500 + $1,800 = $10,800.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We have two websites publishing articles daily. The first one publishes an average of 20 articles per day, and the second one publishes an average of 10 articles per day. We need to find the total number of articles they published together in February, which has 28 days.

First, let's calculate the total number of articles the first website publishes in a month: 20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles.

Next, let's calculate the total number of articles the second website publishes in a month: 10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles.

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites: 560 + 280 = 840.

"Let's break down the information we have. Steve is 60 years old, and his wife is 4 years older than him. So, his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Now, their son is half as old as his mom, which means he's 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Lastly, their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. So, we subtract 3 from her husband's age: 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

"Hey there, let's get to the problem. We've got a bag of flour divided into 8 portions, each weighing 2 kilograms. To find out how much flour was in one bag, we multiply the number of portions by the weight of each portion. That's 8 portions * 2 kilograms per portion = 16 kilograms per bag.

Now, we need to find the total amount of flour in three bags. We do that by multiplying the weight of one bag by 3. So, 16 kilograms per bag * 3 bags = 48 kilograms.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We need to find the total miles Alisa and Stanley biked. To do that, we'll calculate the distance each of them covered.

For Alisa, the distance is her speed (12 miles per hour) multiplied by the time she biked (4.5 hours). That's 12 * 4.5 = 54 miles.

For Stanley, the distance is his speed (10 miles per hour) multiplied by the time he biked (2.5 hours). That's 10 * 2.5 = 25 miles.

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total miles they biked: 54 + 25 = 79 miles.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Bill to dig through the soil. He can dig 4 feet per hour, and he has to dig through 24 feet of soil. To find the time, we'll divide the total feet by his rate:

24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes him to dig through the clay. Since he digs half as fast through clay, his rate is 2 feet per hour (half of 4 feet/hour). He has to dig through 8 feet of clay, so:

8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

Now, let's add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to find the total time:

6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's figure out how many cupcakes Howie should buy. 

First, we need to know the total number of people in the class. That's Howie, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. So, 25 classmates + 1 teacher + 1 Howie = 27 people.

Since Howie wants to get one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake for each person, we multiply the number of people by 2. That's 27 * 2 = 54 cupcakes.

"Hey, let's break down the problem. Fishio initially received 2000 likes on her selfie. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number. 

So, after 4 weeks, the total number of likes would be the initial likes plus 70 times the initial likes. That's 2000 + (70 * 2000) = 2000 + 140000 = 142000.

Recently, she received 20000 more new likes. To find the total number of likes, we add these new likes to the previous total: 142000 + 20000 = 162000.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Clara bought 20 pomegranates on Tuesday at $20 each, so the total cost would be 20 * $20 = $400. She got a $2 discount, so the final price she paid is $400 - $2 = $398.

The next day, the price per pomegranate increased to $30, and Sheila bought 20 pomegranates. The total cost would be 20 * $30 = $600. However, there was a 10% discount on the total cost. 10% of $600 is 0.1 * $600 = $60. So, the final price Sheila paid is $600 - $60 = $540.

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days. The difference is $540 - $398 = $142.

"Hey there, let's break down Ariadne's hat sales. We know her sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, and that's half the amount she earned from selling green hats. So, if we let the sales from green hats be x, we have:

400 = 1/2 * x
x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, her sales from green hats were $800. Now, let's find the total sales for the first month:

Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales for the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales for the first month = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:

Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * Total sales for the first month
Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales for the second month = 900

Now, let's find the total amount she made in two months:

Total amount she made in two months = Total sales for the first month + Total sales for the second month
Total amount she made in two months = 1200 + 900
Total amount she made in two months = 2100

"Hey there, let's break down James' carriage rental. He rented it from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. Since he gets 1 hour free, he only pays for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice as much as the previous one. So, the second paid hour is $15 * 2 = $30, and the third paid hour is $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, let's add up the costs: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

"Hey, let's break down Sally's situation. She started the week with $200 in her bank account, and now it's at $420. Since she didn't receive any other money, the difference is her wage. So, $420 - $200 = $220 is what she actually got.

Her expected wage is $300, though. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract what she got from what she should've gotten: $300 - $220 = $80.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, and each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves. She's inviting 16 guests to her party.

First, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves she'll need in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat.
16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Now, since 1 egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the number of eggs needed.
48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 eggs

Finally, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs she'll need. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the number of eggs by 12.
24 eggs / 12 = 2

"Hey, let's break down the problem. Shiela needs to submit a 15-page research paper and has already finished 1/3 of it. To find out how many pages she has left, we need to calculate 1/3 of 15 pages.

1/3 of 15 pages is 15 * 1/3 = 5 pages. Since she's already written 5 pages, we subtract that from the total number of pages.

15 (total pages) - 5 (pages written) = 10 pages

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Mike's reading assignment. He's got a 200-page book to finish in 30 days, and he plans to read 10 pages a day.

First, we need to figure out how many days it'll take Mike to finish the book. We can do this by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day.

200 pages / 10 pages per day = 20 days

So, Mike will finish the book in 20 days. Since the deadline is 30 days, we subtract the number of days it took Mike to finish the book from the deadline to find out how many days before the deadline he finishes.

30 days - 20 days = 10 days

"What's up, I'm Kai. So, let's break down the costs for James' plane. The initial cost of the plane is $150,000. Then, there's the monthly hangar rental, which is $5,000. On top of that, James spends twice as much on fuel, so that's $10,000 per month. 

To find the total monthly cost, we add the hangar rental and fuel costs: $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000. Since we're looking at the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total cost for the first year: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

"Hey, let's break down the problem. Finley bought rice, beans, and pork, and we know it took her 30 minutes to cook the rice. It took her 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice, so the pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook.

Now, let's find the cooking time for the beans. The combined cooking time for the pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Since the beans took half the combined cooking time of the pork and rice, the beans took 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to cook.

To find the total cooking time, we add the cooking time for each item: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We have two types of nuts: almonds and walnuts. A pound of almonds costs $10, and a pound of walnuts costs $15. We're comparing the cost of two different mixtures.

Mixture 1 is 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. To find the cost, we multiply the weight of each nut by its price per pound. For almonds, that's 1/2 * $10 = $5. For walnuts, it's 1/3 * $15 = $5. So, the total cost of Mixture 1 is $5 + $5 = $10.

Mixture 2 is 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. Using the same calculation, the cost of almonds is 1/5 * $10 = $2, and the cost of walnuts is 1/3 * $15 = $5. The total cost of Mixture 2 is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two mixtures. That's $10 - $7 = $3.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We know that Lee has sheep and geese on his farm, and we're given two pieces of information: the total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20.

Let's use variables to represent the number of sheep (S) and the number of geese (G). Since each animal has one head, we can write an equation based on the total number of heads:
S + G = 20

Now, let's think about the legs. Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2 legs. We can write another equation based on the total number of legs:
4S + 2G = 70

To solve for S, we can try to eliminate G from the equations. One way to do this is to multiply the first equation by 2, which gives us:
2S + 2G = 40

Now, subtract this equation from the second equation:
(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for S:
S = 15

The number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15."
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. Since it costs 20% more than the normal brand, we'll calculate 20% of the normal price. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, so 20% of that is 0.2 * $5 = $1. This means the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Next, we need to find out how much coffee Roger buys. He uses 1 pound of coffee per day and wants to buy a week's worth, which is 7 days. So, he buys 7 pounds of coffee. At $6 per pound, the total cost of the coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

Finally, we add the cost of the donut, which is $2. So, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

Add the bucket of fried chicken for $8.00, so that's $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Then, there's the bottle of soda for $1.00, making it $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

So, let's do the math:
Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C = 198 + 209 = 407
Now, subtract that from the total:

Now, we know John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find the number of recipes he learns, we divide the total hours by 1.5. 

Number of recipes = 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes

Number of math teachers = 40% of 150
= 0.4 * 150
= 60

Now, we know each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers spend sleeping, we'll multiply the number of math teachers by the hours each teacher sleeps per day.

Now, we know Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so we can calculate Rayna's amount by adding $60 to Kassidy's amount.

Rayna's amount = $90 + $60 = $150.

Now that we know how much each person has, let's add their money together: $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.

We know her first 8 days were good, and then the next 8 days were bad, and the last 8 days were neutral, with 6 days left over. Since 8 + 8 + 8 is 24, the last 6 days must have been a mix of good, bad, and neutral. We know she had 12 good days, and 8 of those were in the first 8 days, so that leaves 4 good days in the last 14 days (6 leftover days + 8 neutral days). 

Now, if the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good, that's 2 more good days. So, the total good days left in the month would be the 2 good days from the last 3 days.

Now, we want to find out how many days it'll take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. To do this, we need to find the difference between the target height and the current height:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can calculate Max's cookies by adding 5 to Katarina's total. So, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Now, we know Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. To find the Cookie Monster's total, we subtract 12 from Max's total. The Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Lastly, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. We can find Summer's total by adding 23 to Max's total. Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many, so Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

Now, let's add the cookies they both baked: 30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90 cookies.

After baking, they eat 10 cookies, so we subtract those from the total: 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, we need to find the age of one of the twins.

Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation:

T = t + 7

We know that there are two twins and three triplets, so the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages are 44, so we can write another equation:

2T + 3t = 44

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation:

2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

2t + 14 + 3t = 44

Combine like terms:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

t = 6

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin:

T = t + 7
T = 6 + 7
T = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's help John figure out how much time he has for a nap.

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner, which is equivalent to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. He needs to finish his homework first, which consists of 20 minutes of math, 40 minutes of reading, and 20 minutes of history. 

To find the total time spent on homework, we add these up: 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has for a nap: 180 - 80 = 100 minutes.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. We know that each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.

Now, let's find the cost of the 4 candies. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. This is the total cost of 4 candies.

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost by the number of candies: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. 
10 lollipops cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00
10 candies cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00
The total cost is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Rong saves 20 coins every month, and Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find out how many coins Neil saves, we need to calculate 2/5 of 20, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate the total coins saved by each of them in a year. Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year, and Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year.

Since they've been saving for 10 years, we multiply their yearly savings by 10. Rong has 240 * 10 = 2400 coins, and Neil has 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have, we add their savings: 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

John's dog needs 2 vaccines, which cost $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so we can write the equation:
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for x:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the crate consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. To find the total price, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them up.

First, we're given that one apple costs $0.5. Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, the price of a banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Oranges are the most expensive, costing three times as much as a banana. So, the price of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding up these costs, we get $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Brittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares. We know the number of red squares is 14. The number of blue squares is 4 more than the red squares, so that's 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

The number of green squares is 6 more than the blue squares, which is 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. Lastly, the number of white squares is 12 fewer than the green squares, so that's 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add up the number of squares: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"Hey, I'm Kai. Let's figure out how many more chairs Mia needs for her restaurant. 

First, we need to find the total number of people attending the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of people is:

Now, let's find out how many chairs Mia already has. We know she has 8 high chairs, and there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, the number of regular chairs is:
5 * 8 = 40

The total number of chairs available is the sum of regular chairs and high chairs:
40 + 8 = 48

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of people:
57 - 48 = 9

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We've got Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom collecting school points for a trip. The goal is to hit a minimum threshold of 400 points.

Adam's got 50 points, and Betty's done better with 30% more. To find Betty's points, we calculate 30% of Adam's points: 0.3 * 50 = 15. So, Betty's got 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Now, Tom's got 30 points less than Betty, which means Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha's collected 3 times more points than Tom, so Martha's got 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Let's add up the points: Adam's 50 + Betty's 65 + Tom's 35 + Martha's 105 = 255 points.

The class needs 400 points for the trip, and they've got 255 so far. To find out how many points they're missing, we subtract the total from the threshold: 400 - 255 = 145 points.

Next, she's using 20% of her paycheck for her monthly car payment. That's 0.2 * $2400.00 = $480.00 going towards her car.

So, if we add up the amount she's putting into retirement and the amount she's using for her car, we get $1200.00 + $480.00 = $1680.00.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many fireworks the city is setting off. They have 15 boxes, and each box contains 20 fireworks. So, the total number of city fireworks is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which gives us 120. So, Hannah will see 120 city fireworks.

Now, let's not forget about the fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard. She has 3 boxes, and each box contains 5 fireworks. So, she'll set off a total of 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the city fireworks she can see (120) to the fireworks she'll set off in her backyard (15). This gives us a total of 120 + 15 = 135.

Speed of turtle = 15 feet/second / 5
Speed of turtle = 3 feet/second

Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can find the distance it can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

2 minutes * 200 taps/minute * 2 feet = 800 taps

When her arms are at her sides, she taps 300 times per minute with her right foot and 250 times per minute with her left foot. Since she does this for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps with arms at her sides is:
3 minutes * (300 taps/minute + 250 taps/minute) = 3 minutes * 550 taps/minute = 1650 taps

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. To make the calculation easier, I'll convert the length to just inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, let's use the given information that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. If we denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x, we can set up the equation:
9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:
9x = 90

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of windows for students' cars and teachers' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows for students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256. 

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we need to find one-fourth of 256. To do this, we can multiply 256 by 1/4 or divide by 4. So, 256 / 4 = 64 windows smashed for students' cars.

Now, let's move on to the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows for teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64. 

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows. To find 3/4ths of 64, we can multiply 64 by 3/4. This is the same as multiplying 64 by 3 and then dividing by 4. So, 64 * 3 = 192, and 192 / 4 = 48 windows smashed for teachers' cars.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars. 64 + 48 = 112.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's get to the problem. We need to find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue. To do this, we'll first find the total number of blue spools and the total number of spools.

Candy has 15 light blue spools and 45 dark blue spools, so the total number of blue spools is 15 + 45 = 60. 

Now, let's find the total number of spools. We have 15 light blue, 45 dark blue, 40 light green, and 50 dark green spools. Adding these up, we get 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.

To find the percentage of blue spools, we'll divide the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100. This gives us (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

We start with 5000 people lined up at the polling station. By midday, 2/5 of them had voted. To find out how many people that is, we multiply 5000 by 2/5, which gives us 2000 people.

Now, we subtract the number of people who voted by midday from the total number of people to find out how many are left: 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. We multiply the remaining number of people (3000) by 2/3 to find out how many voted by 16:00: (2/3) * 3000 = 2000.

So, the total number of people who voted by 16:00 is 2000 (by midday) + 2000 (by 16:00) = 4000.

To find the number of people who hadn't voted by 16:00, we subtract the total number of people who voted from the initial number of people: 5000 - 4000 = 1000.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's figure out how many packs of gum Parker will need. 

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, and he wants to know how many packs he'll need for 30 days. First, we need to find out how many pieces of gum he'll chew in 30 days. We can do that by multiplying the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days:
4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we know that a pack of gum has 15 pieces. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack:
120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

"Hey there, let's break down the s'mores situation. We've got 9 kids who want 2 s'mores each, and 6 adults who want 1 s'more each. To find the total number of s'mores needed, we'll calculate the number of s'mores for the kids and the adults separately and then add them together.

For the kids: 9 kids * 2 s'mores/kid = 18 s'mores
For the adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 s'mores
Total s'mores needed: 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores

Now, since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores, we'll divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed:
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we can see that we need exactly 1 box to cover the 3 sleeves needed.

Next, we find Dora's mother's age, which is four years younger than Dora's father. So, her age is 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can calculate the total combined age by adding the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
15 + 38 + 34 = 87

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We've got a student council election with three candidates: A, B, and C. Candidate A got 20% of the votes, and candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. The rest of the votes went to candidate C. We're told there were 100 voters.

First, let's find out how many votes candidate A got. 20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Now, candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. To find 50% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.5, which gives us 10. So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes candidates A and B got is 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Since there were 100 voters, we subtract the votes for A and B from the total to find candidate C's votes: 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. To find out how many apples Beck has, we subtract 23 from 100: 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. This means Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

The question asks how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now. To find this out, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has: 90 - 87 = 3.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Peter's ice cube situation. He's got 32 ounces of water and wants to make different sized ice cubes. 

First, we need to figure out how much water he uses for each type of cube. He makes 3 giant cubes that use 4 ounces each, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 ounces. Then, he makes 7 medium cubes that use 2 ounces each, which is 7 * 2 = 14 ounces. Finally, he makes 8 small cubes that use 0.5 ounces each, so that's 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, let's add up the total amount of water he uses: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

Now, we know Alice has 6 more books than Steven. To find out how many books Alice has, we'll add 6 to Steven's total. That's 10 + 6 = 16 books for Alice.

Finally, to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we'll subtract Alice's total from Clara's total. That's 20 - 16 = 4.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Cecelia spent. She bought 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5 = $50
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3 = $48

We're told that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, let's find the total number of students who like to bake, play basketball, or play music. That's 10 (bake) + 5 (basketball) + 10 (music) = 25.

Since there are 50 students in total, the number of students who like to play video games is 50 - 25 = 25.

1/3 of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4 birds.

So, Jeremy scared away 4 birds. The number of birds left is 12 - 4 = 8.

Now, we're told that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4.

40 * 0.4 = 16 girls per class

Since the remaining students are boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24 boys per class

To find out how many animals she'll groom each day, we need to calculate the total number of animals first.

8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals

Since Melissa wants to split the jobs evenly over the days of the week, we'll divide the total number of animals by 7.

The first park charges $26 per adult and $12 per child, while the second park charges $14 per adult and $10 per child. We've got 2 adults and 2 kids in the family, so let's calculate the total cost for each park.

For the first park, the cost would be:
- 2 adults: 2 * $26 = $52
- 2 kids: 2 * $12 = $24
Total cost for the first park: $52 + $24 = $76

For the second park, the cost would be:

- 2 kids: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now, let's find out how much they can save by choosing the second park:
Cost difference = Total cost for the first park - Total cost for the second park

First, let's look at the original cost. The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250. Now, with the new supplier, he's paying $.4 per tomato, which brings his daily cost down to 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is $250 - $200 = $50. To find the weekly savings, we multiply this by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.9, which gives us 27. Since 3 small stickers are worth 1 large button, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Now, she has 3 small stickers left and 9 large buttons. She also has 40 large stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

Now, she has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons (9 + 20), and 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, she has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons, and 60 small buttons.

Since 1 large button is worth 3 small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons. 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons. Adding these to the 60 small buttons she already has, she gets 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

She also has 3 small stickers left, which are worth 3 small buttons. So, in total, she has 147 + 3 = 150 small buttons.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. We can represent the number of votes against as x. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

Given that there are 33 people on the council, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of votes. Since each member votes either in favor or against, the total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and against, which is x + 2x = 3x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, so we can set up the equation 3x = 33. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 33 / 3
x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:
Votes in favor = 2x
Votes in favor = 2 * 11
Votes in favor = 22

"Hey, let's break this down. To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. If he wants to make 4 liters, he'll need 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Now, each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of kilograms by the cost per kilogram: 20 * $3 = $60.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Ezra read 300 books in one hour, which is twice as many as Ahmed. To find out how many books Ahmed read, we can divide Ezra's total by 2.

Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, Ezra wants to read 150 more books, so we add that to his initial total: 300 + 150 = 450 books.

To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we add their individual totals: 450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600 books.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Tanya's earnings for those two days of teaching.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, that's 5 * $15 = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also gets a $5 bonus. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. At $15 per hour, that's 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches 2 classes, which is less than 3, she doesn't get the bonus. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $80 + $30 = $110.

$110"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. The perfume company has 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents. By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each vanilla scent and 2 of each fruity scent.

To find the total sales of each type, we multiply the number of scents by the number of sales per scent. For vanilla, that's 4 scents * 5 sales each = 20 sales. For fruity, it's 8 scents * 2 sales each = 16 sales.

Now, let's find the difference in sales: 20 (vanilla sales) - 16 (fruity sales) = 4.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. He's already made some money from selling eggplants, so let's calculate that first. He sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, which means he made 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, we need to figure out how much more money Bennet needs to make to reach his goal of $135. To do that, we'll subtract the amount he already made from the total amount he wants to make: $135 - $60 = $75.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell, and he needs to make $75 from them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we'll divide the amount he needs to make by the number of ears of corn: $75 / 25 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"Hey there, let's break down Tatiana's weekend schedule. She's got 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so that's a total of 12 hours. She spends 3 hours reading, which leaves her with 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

Now, she spends 1/3 of the remaining time playing video games. That's 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours. So, she's got 9 - 3 = 6 hours left for soccer.

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we can divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100. That's (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

Anthony starts with 50 pencils and gives 1/2 of them to Brandon. To find out how many pencils he gave away, we multiply 50 by 1/2:
50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon and was left with:
50 - 25 = 25 pencils

Next, he gives 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils he gave to Charlie, we multiply 25 by 3/5:
25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils

Now, let's subtract the pencils he gave to Charlie from the remaining pencils:
25 - 15 = 10 pencils

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Jack's trip to the museum.

First, we need to calculate the time Jack spends driving to and from the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. To find the time, we divide the distance by the speed: 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours. Since he drives back home at the same speed, the time spent driving back is also 2 hours. So, the total time spent driving is 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

Next, we add the time Jack spends at the museum, which is 6 hours. To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we add the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum: 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's figure out how many wheels Henry will have left. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the toys. Each car needs 4 wheels, and there are 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228 wheels. 

Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, and there are 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146 wheels.

Now, let's add the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels available: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. So you want to know how much you'd have to pay for that laptop after a 20% discount? Let's break it down.

First, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do that, we'll find 20% of the original price, which is $1000.

Discount = 20% of $1000
= 0.20 * $1000
= $200

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the final amount you'd have to pay.

Amount to pay = Original price - Discount
= $1000 - $200
= $800

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Mike's movie collection and figure out how much it'll cost him to replace it with digital versions.

First, we know Mike has 600 movies. A third of those are part of a series, which can be bought together at a discounted price. That's 600 / 3 = 200 movies in series. Since buying the series together costs 1/6 of the price of a normal movie, and a normal movie costs $10, the series movies will cost $10 / 6 = $1.67 each. So, the total cost for the series movies is 200 * $1.67 = $334.

Now, let's look at the remaining movies. We have 600 - 200 = 400 movies left. Out of those, 40% are older movies that cost $5 each. That's 400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies. The total cost for these older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

The remaining movies are normal movies that cost $10 each. We have 400 - 160 = 240 normal movies left. The total cost for these normal movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.

Adding up the costs, we get $334 + $800 + $2400 = $3534.

The final answer is: $3534"

First, we need to find the cost of each type of fruit. For peaches, Winston picked 6 pounds at $2.00 per pound, so that's 6 * $2.00 = $12.00. For plums, he picked 8 pounds at $1.00 per pound, which is 8 * $1.00 = $8.00. Lastly, he picked 6 pounds of apricots at $3.00 per pound, so that's 6 * $3.00 = $18.00.

Now, let's add up the costs: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the time the Llesis family spent driving. They drove and hiked for a total of 6 hours, and they hiked for 1.5 hours. So, the time spent driving is 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Next, we can calculate the distance they drove. Their average driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so the distance driven is 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

Now, let's find their hiking speed. It's 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour, so their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

We know they hiked for 1.5 hours, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Finally, we can find the total distance to their vacation spot by adding the distance driven and the distance hiked: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ava and Emma are competing in a video game, and we need to find the difference between their scores. We know that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries, but finishes the level 4 seconds slower.

Let's calculate the points each of them scored. For every enemy they jump on, they receive 10 points, for each berry they collect, they receive 5 points, and for every second left on the timer when they finish the level, they receive 30 points.

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies, she gets 8 * 10 = 80 more points from enemies. She also collects 3 more berries, so she gets 3 * 5 = 15 more points from berries. However, she finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she loses 4 * 30 = 120 points from the timer.

The net difference in points is 80 + 15 - 120 = -25.

The final answer is: -25"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars in total. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas.

So, the cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 30 = 34 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 34 / 2 = 17 dollars.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which is a total of 5 * 3 = 15 rides. On the other two days, they ride twice as many times as they do on usual days, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 rides per day. For those two days, they ride a total of 2 * 6 = 12 times.

To find the total number of rides in a week, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days: 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

"Let's break down the problem. Bob initially had 7 fish, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. After buying more fish, he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, the total number of white fish is x + 4 (since he already had 4 white fish). The total number of orange fish is 3 + (17 - x), since he bought 17 fish in total.

We know that the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish, so we can set up the equation:

3 + (17 - x) = 2(x + 4)

Simplifying the equation:

20 - x = 2x + 8

Combine like terms:

20 - 8 = 3x

12 = 3x

x = 4

However, this doesn't seem to work, as it would mean Bob bought 13 orange fish, which is not possible since he bought 17 fish in total.

Let's try another approach. If Bob bought 6 white fish, he would have 10 white fish in total (6 + 4). This would mean he has 20 orange fish (twice the number of white fish). Since he already had 3 orange fish, he would have bought 17 orange fish, which is not possible.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Andy drives in a week. Since he only drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 2 x 5 = 10 miles per day.

Now, let's calculate the total distance he drives in a week: 10 miles/day x 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we need to find out how much gas he uses in a week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money his car is consuming per week. The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money his car is consuming per week is 5 gallons/week x $3/gallon = $15/week.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carrie's aunt gave her 10 twenties and 140 quarters for lunch. We need to find out how much she spent if she used all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties.

First, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount spent from the quarters is:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, and she spent 3/5 of the twenties, we can find the total amount spent from the twenties as follows:
3/5 * 10 * $20 = 3/5 * $200 = $120

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount spent:
$35 + $120 = $155

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's get to the problem. Ricardo has tomato and eggplant plants in his garden. Each tomato plant gives 22 tomatoes, and each eggplant plant gives 4 eggplants. He's got 5 tomato plants and 8 eggplant plants.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes. Since each plant gives 22 tomatoes, and he has 5 plants, that's 22 * 5 = 110 tomatoes.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants. Each plant gives 4 eggplants, and he has 8 plants, so that's 4 * 8 = 32 eggplants.

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants: 110 + 32 = 142.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We know that one-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

For the smart TVs, we have 1/4 * 40 = 10. For the analog TVs, we have 1/8 * 40 = 5. Now, let's add these two numbers together: 10 + 5 = 15.

Since the rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs, we subtract the total number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. John's school trip costs $300, and the school is covering half of that. To find out how much the school is contributing, we can divide the total cost by 2.

$300 ÷ 2 = $150

So, the school is covering $150. Now, let's subtract that from the total cost to find out how much John needs to cover on his own.

$300 - $150 = $150

John already has $50, so we subtract that from the amount he needs to cover.

$150 - $50 = $100

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's figure out how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing.

First, we need to find out the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder at night compared to the day, we subtract 33 from the daytime temperature of 45 degrees.

Nighttime temperature: 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, so we need to find out how many degrees the temperature needs to rise to reach 32 degrees.

Temperature rise needed: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed, we divide the temperature rise needed by the heat provided by each log.

Number of logs needed: 20 / 5 = 4

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many groups were formed. Since there are 90 people and each group has 9 people, we can divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Now, 3/5 of the groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. To find the number of groups that brought seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

Number of groups that brought seashells = Total number of groups * 3/5
= 10 * 3/5
= 6

Since each group has 9 members, the total number of people who brought seashells is:

Number of people who brought seashells = Number of groups that brought seashells * Number of people per group
= 6 * 9
= 54

Each of these people brought 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells is:

Total number of seashells = Number of people who brought seashells * Number of seashells per person
= 54 * 2
= 108

172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 more people get on the train, so we add those to the new total:
125 + 13 = 138

Finally, at the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract those from the total:
138 - 38 = 100

The number of people on the train is 100."
"What's up, I'm Kai. So, let's break down Damien's bottle cap currency. He finds 10 bottle caps a day, and each one is worth $0.25. To figure out how much he makes in a 30-day month, we need to calculate the total number of bottle caps he finds and multiply it by the value of each one.

First, let's find the total number of bottle caps he finds in a month:
10 bottle caps/day * 30 days = 300 bottle caps

Now, let's multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each one:
300 bottle caps * $0.25/bottle cap = $75

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Jamie's pay for last Tuesday. She earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work each day, and if she needs to work extra hours, she gets a special rate that's 150% of her regular rate.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

Now, for the additional 3 hours, her special rate is 150% of $20, which is:
1.5 * $20/hour = $30/hour
So, her earnings for the extra 3 hours are:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

To find the total amount Jamie was paid, we add her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours:
$160 + $90 = $250

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We've got a company that's hiring 20 new employees every month, and we want to find out how much they're paying their employees after three months.

First, we need to figure out how many employees the company has after three months. They started with 200 employees and added 20 new ones each month, so after three months, they've got:

200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3)
= 200 + 60
= 260 employees

Now, each employee makes $4000 per month, so the total amount the company pays its employees in one month is:

260 (total employees) * 4000 (monthly salary per employee)
= 1,040,000

To find the total amount the company pays its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly salary by 3:

1,040,000 (monthly salary) * 3 (number of months)
= 3,120,000

The final answer is: 3120000"

First, we need to calculate the total time for ""Deck the Halls"". Since they're singing it twice, we multiply 150 seconds by 2, which gives us 300 seconds.

Next, we add the time for ""Jingle Bells"", which is 240 seconds. So, the total time is 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Billy started with a $10 hourly wage, then got a $0.50 raise after 2 months, and another $1.00 raise after a year. That brings his total hourly wage to $10 + $0.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial wage, so she makes $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their earnings for 20 hours of work. Billy's earnings would be 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230. Sally's earnings would be 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210.

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

First, let's find half of Pierson's points. That's 278 / 2 = 139. Now, Nikita scored 11 more than that, so Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150 points.

Now that we know both scores, we can find the total. Pierson scored 278 points and Nikita scored 150 points. Adding those together, we get 278 + 150 = 428.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of students and teachers in the school. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class, so the total number of students is 25 * 40 = 1000.

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Now, let's calculate the total number of teachers. There are 3 teachers per class, and there are 40 classes, so the total number of teachers is 3 * 40 = 120.

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

To find the total number of trees planted, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers: 1000 + 240 = 1240.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's dive into Bubbles' stuffed animal collection. She's got 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. To find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has, we add them all up: 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14.

Now, Bubbles wants to buy some stuffed goats, and she wants them to make up 30% of her total collection. Let's say she buys x stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals she'll have after buying x goats is 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Hey there, let's break down Kris's gaming schedule. She's trying to hit 30 hours to earn that achievement.

First, Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, that's 2 * 7 = 14 days. So, she plays 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours in those 2 weeks.

Next, she plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Adding those together, Kris has played a total of 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours she still needs to play, we subtract the hours she's already played from the total hours required: 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We've got two cars on the highway, one going 60 miles per hour and the other going 70 miles per hour. The second car passes the first one, and we want to know how far apart they'll be after 2 hours.

First, let's calculate how far each car will travel in 2 hours. The first car, going 60 miles per hour, will cover:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car, going 70 miles per hour, will cover:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Now, since the second car is ahead, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

"Hey, let's break down the problem. James bought a ring with a diamond that cost $600 and gold that cost $300. So, the total cost of the ring is $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, he paid a 30% premium for it to be made. To find the premium cost, we need to calculate 30% of $900. That's 0.3 * $900 = $270.

Finally, we add the premium cost to the total cost of the ring. So, the total amount James paid is $900 + $270 = $1170.

"What's up, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We've got the results of Herbert Hoover Elementary School's annual standardized test. We know that 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, and 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed. Now, we're told that the 400 fifth graders had a pass rate that was twice the fourth graders' pass rate.

First, let's find the pass rate of the fourth graders. It's 40 out of 100, which is 40%. Now, since the fifth graders' pass rate is twice that, it's 2 * 40% = 80%. With 400 fifth graders, that means 80% of them passed, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320 students.

Now, let's add up the total number of students who passed: 340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 320 (fifth graders) = 700 students.

The total number of students is 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000 students.

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students: 700/1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left from the party. We also know that four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, and 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students who drank 1.5 quarts each:
4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts

Next, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students who drank 2 quarts each:
16 * 2 = 32 quarts

Now, we add the total amount of tea consumed by both groups:
6 + 32 = 38 quarts

We also know that there are 10 quarts of tea left, so we add that to the total amount consumed:
38 + 10 = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea to gallons by dividing by 4:
48 / 4 = 12 gallons

"What's up, I'm Kai. So, let's break down Dale's butterscotch candy situation. He initially ordered 100 candies, but then he sold 150. That's a problem, since he didn't have enough candies to begin with. To fulfill those orders, he ordered 100 more candies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of candies Dale has. He initially ordered 100, and then he ordered 100 more, so that's:
100 (initial order) + 100 (additional order) = 200

Dale has already sold 150 candies, so to find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each type of flower. 

Rose picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 petals. Then, she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each, which is 4 * 6 = 24 petals. After that, she added 5 flowers with 4 petals each, giving us 5 * 4 = 20 petals. Lastly, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each, resulting in 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

However, Rose dropped 1 flower of each type, so we need to subtract the petals from the dropped flowers. She dropped 1 flower with 5 petals, 1 flower with 6 petals, 1 flower with 4 petals, and 1 flower with 7 petals. That's a total of 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals dropped.

To find the total number of petals in the vase, we subtract the dropped petals from the total: 101 - 22 = 79 petals.

So, the total marshmallows used and dropped is 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21. Now, let's subtract that from the initial number of marshmallows in the bag. 

Marshmallows left = 35 (initial) - 21 (used and dropped) = 14

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter, so for 240 minutes, he'll use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends aren't as good, so they can only play for half as long, which is 10 minutes per quarter. They'll use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The other friend is a total boss and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so that's 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He'll use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Adding all these up, we get 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

And the number of cards Becca has:
Becca has 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards

Becca has 153 cards."
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Cindy has 5 green eggs. She has twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs. She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, which means she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. Lastly, she has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so that's 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color to find the total number of eggs:
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost per pound is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. They also charge $0.08 per mile, and the distribution center is 20 miles away, so the cost per mile is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32. So, the refund amount is 0.75 * $32 = $24.00.

Now, let's calculate the total loss. The total loss is the book cost minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost. So, the total loss is $32 - $24.00 + $3.00 = $11.00.

Now, she buys two pairs of jeans for $30 each, which is $60, and a bag for $20. That's a total of $80 spent.

To find out how much she's got left, we subtract the amount she spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

"Hey there, let's break down Boris's chocolate production. We know he produces 50,000 bars each month. 

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars. The second week, he produces half as much, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. Then, in the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, we subtract the production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the fourth week's production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

14,000"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Britany's TikTok activities and calculate the total time she spends on them in a month.

First, she records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, that's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 72 * 4 = 288 minutes recording videos.

Next, she spends 2 hours a week writing songs. That's 2 hours * 4 weeks = 8 hours per month. Converting this to minutes, we get 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

Lastly, she spends 15 minutes, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. That's 15 * 6 = 90 minutes per week. For a month, that's 90 * 4 = 360 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity: 288 + 480 + 360 = 1128 minutes.

The final answer is: 1128"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the installation costs for Angela.

The interior design firm's initial installation package includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures for $129.00. Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that need to be installed.

First, let's calculate the number of additional items: 
- Mirrors: 6 (Angela's) - 4 (initial package) = 2 extra mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 (Angela's) - 1 (initial package) = 1 extra chandelier
- Pictures: 20 (Angela's) - 10 (initial package) = 10 extra pictures

The firm charges $15.00 per additional item. So, the cost of the extra items is:
2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00
Total cost of extra items = $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Now, let's add the initial installation cost to the cost of the extra items:
$129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (extra items) = $324.00

"Let's break this down step by step. We know Eva has saved $20. Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, so Anthony has $20 + $10 = $30.

Now, we need to find out how much Roy has saved. We know Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30 by 0.4, which is $12. Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we add $12 to Anthony's savings: $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We know Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay's limit is 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami's limit is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto's limit is 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour, and he travels for 4 hours, then another 6 hours. To find the total distance, we'll calculate the distance for each part of his journey and add them together.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"Let's break this down step by step. We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. To find the time it would take one kangaroo, we multiply 18 hours by 3, since the kangaroos are traveling at the same speed. This gives us 54 hours for one kangaroo.

Now, we're told that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means they'll take twice as long to cross the highway. So, we multiply the time it takes one kangaroo (54 hours) by 2, which gives us 108 hours for one turtle.

Since all four turtles are traveling at the same speed, it'll still take them 108 hours to cross the highway.

The final answer is: 108"

"Hey there, let's break down Erika's situation. She wants a laptop that costs $600, but she can get a $200 discount if she trades in her old one. So, the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika got $150 from her part-time job and her mom chipped in $80, so that's $150 + $80 = $230. We know she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has $400 - $50 = $350.

Now, let's figure out how much she had in her purse initially. We subtract the amount she got from her job and her mom from the total amount she has: $350 - $230 = $120.

First, we need to calculate the total number of slices Adam had initially. He sliced 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 slices. He also sliced 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so that's 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

Now, let's add those together to get the total number of slices: 15 (large) + 15 (small) = 30 slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the slices he ate from the total: 30 - 15 = 15.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. The farmer has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day. So, the total milk produced per day is 3 * 5 = 15 liters.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To find out how many more liters he needs, we subtract the current production from the desired production: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we divide the additional liters needed by the liters per cow to find out how many more cows are needed: 10 / 5 = 2.

First, we'll calculate the used length of each glue stick. The first one has 1/6 left, so 5/6 of it is used. That's 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm used.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so 1/3 of it is used. That's 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm used.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so 1/2 of it is used. That's 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm used.

Now, we add up the lengths of the glue sticks that are used: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Jack collected 60 dishes, and he collected twice as many dishes as socks. So, the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30.

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

Now, let's look at the dishes. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the individual totals:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180.

First, let's find the number of students good at both subjects. We can do this by subtracting the students good at math only and English only from the total number of students.

Students good at both math and English = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13

Since the interest is simple, it's the same every year. So, in 3 years, she'll earn $225 * 3 = $675 in interest.

To find the total amount after 3 years, we add the interest to the original amount: $300 + $675 = $975.

Now, let's compare the number of floral shirts with no buttons to the number of white shirts with no collars. We've got 30 floral shirts with no buttons and 20 white shirts with no collars. The difference between the two is 30 - 20 = 10.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's solve this problem together.

The farmer has 900 eggs and wants to sell them in trays that hold 30 eggs each. To find out how many trays he can fill, we'll divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
Number of trays = 900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray
Number of trays = 30

Now, we know the farmer can fill 30 trays. Since he sells each tray for $2.5, we can calculate his total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
Total earnings = 30 trays * $2.5 per tray
Total earnings = $75

First, let's calculate the number of goats left in Farm X:
55 - 10 = 45

Now, let's find out how many goats he sold from Farm Y. Since he sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as from Farm X, that's 2 * 10 = 20 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes. That's a good starting point.

In the second year, they'll build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, that's 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of homes built in the first two years: 12 + 36 = 48 homes.

In the third year, they'll double the total number of homes built so far. But here's the thing - they're doubling the amount they've built, which means they're adding the doubled amount to the existing total. So, they'll build 2 * 48 = 96 new homes in the third year.

To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we add the homes built in the first two years (48) to the homes built in the third year (96). That gives us a total of 48 + 96 = 144 homes.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that I am three years younger than my brother, and I am 2 years older than my sister. Let's denote my brother's age as B, my sister's age as S, and my age as Y.

Since I am three years younger than my brother, we can write an equation:
Y = B - 3

Since I am 2 years older than my sister, we can write another equation:
Y = S + 2

We also know that my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. Let's denote my mom's age as M:
M = 3B - 1

When you add all our ages, you get 87. So, we can write the equation:
B + Y + S + M = 87

Substituting the expressions for Y and M from the previous equations, we get:
B + (B - 3) + (Y - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Since Y = B - 3, we can substitute this expression for Y in the equation above:
B + (B - 3) + ((B - 3) - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
B + B - 3 + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87

Combine like terms again:
5B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:
5B = 96

Divide by 5:
B = 19.2

Since B must be a whole number, we round it to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we will try both 19 and 20 to see which one works.

If B = 20:
Y = B - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17
S = Y - 2 = 17 - 2 = 15
M = 3B - 1 = 3(20) - 1 = 59

B + Y + S + M = 20 + 17 + 15 + 35 = 87 (this works)

So, my age is 17.

If we let the number of books Fawn has be F, then Anne has F - 12 books, and Sofie has (F - 12) + 25 books. Since together they have 85 books, we can set up the equation:
F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85

Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85
Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84
Divide by 3:
F = 28

Fawn has 28 books."
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. Then, she bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes. To find the weight of the sweet potatoes, we multiply the weight of the potatoes by 2: 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, we subtract 3 from the weight of the sweet potatoes: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many jello cups Greg needs for the party. Since there are 30 kids and each kid gets 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is:
30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Now, we know that one box of jello makes 10 jello cups. To find out how many boxes Greg needs, we'll divide the total number of jello cups by the number of cups per box:
120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost. Each box of jello costs $1.25, so we'll multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:
12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Madeline and Keenan share the cost of groceries, which is $400 per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, we can calculate Keenan's share by finding 40% of the total cost.

Keenan's monthly share = 40% of $400
Keenan's monthly share = 0.4 * $400
Keenan's monthly share = $160

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. Since there are 4 weeks in the month, we divide Keenan's monthly share by 4.

Keenan's weekly share = $160 / 4
Keenan's weekly share = $40

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

Tobias started with 60 pieces of pizza. On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the pieces. To find out how many pieces that is, we multiply 60 by 2/5:
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To find out how many pieces that is, we multiply 26 by 7/13:
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add the pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We need to find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

First, we'll find the cost of one bottle of soda. Since 7 bottles cost $21.00, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
$21.00 ÷ 7 = $3.00 per bottle of soda

Next, we'll find the cost of one bottle of water. Since 4 bottles cost $8.00, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
$8.00 ÷ 4 = $2.00 per bottle of water

Now, let's calculate the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 × $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 × $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

Next, Paul loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles that is, we multiply 80 by 0.25 (since 1/4 = 0.25):
80 * 0.25 = 20

So, Paul loses 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from 80:

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Amy's test scores.

First, we have the multiple-choice questions. There are 10 of them, and Amy gets 80% correct. That's 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correct. Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points.

Next up are the true/false questions. There are 20 of these, and Amy gets 90% correct. That's 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correct. Again, each question is worth 1 point, so she scores 18 points.

Last but not least, we have the long-answer questions. There are 5 of these, and Amy gets 60% correct. That's 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correct. Since each question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, let's add up the points: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

"To find out how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell and how much he will make from selling them.

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. 
3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

He plans to sell the chickens at $50 per chicken and make a profit of $2000. 
So, the total amount he will make from selling the chickens is the cost price plus the profit. 
Let's call the cost price x. 
Then, the selling price is x + $2000.

The selling price per chicken is $50, so the total selling price is 180 * $50 = $9000.

We know that the total selling price is the cost price plus the profit, so we can set up the equation:
x + $2000 = $9000

Subtracting $2000 from both sides gives us:
x = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses of lemonade. Julie sold 14 glasses, and the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses.

First, I'll find out how many glasses the boys sold together. To do that, I'll subtract the number of glasses Julie sold from the total number of glasses sold: 32 - 14 = 18.

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, I'll divide the result by 2 to find out how many glasses Micah sold: 18 / 2 = 9.

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, I'll subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold: 14 - 9 = 5.

"Hey, let's break down Kelly's grocery shopping trip. We need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, the 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total. Next, the 6 packets of chicken cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since 5 packs of bacon cost $10, 1 pack of bacon costs $2. So, 1 packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4. The total cost of 6 packets of chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

Kelly also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each, so the total cost is $4 * 3 = $12. Additionally, she has 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. The total cost of 7 packs of apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60

Kelly's budget is $65, so she has:
$65 - $60 = $5

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and she also performs a 15-minute encore. We know the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. 

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as x minutes. Since the final concert is twice as long, the runtime of the final concert (excluding the encore) is 2x minutes. Adding the 15-minute encore, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 minutes.

We can set up an equation using the given information:

2x + 15 = 65

Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:

2x = 50

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 25

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"

Now, I'll subtract those 10 microphones from the total to find out how many will be arranged in pairs. That's 50 - 10 = 40 microphones.

Since the microphones are arranged in pairs, I'll divide the remaining microphones by 2. That's 40 / 2 = 20 pairs.

Lastly, Jerry spots 3 groups of eight birds each feeding. We can find the total number of birds feeding by multiplying the number of groups by the number of birds in each group: 3 * 8 = 24 birds.

Now, let's add up the number of birds in each category: 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34.

Speed of thingamabob = 121 meters/second / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters/second

Now that we know the thingamabob's speed, we can find the whirligig's speed. The whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob, so we'll multiply the thingamabob's speed by 5.

Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11 meters/second
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters/second

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times, which would be 3 * $6 = $18. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times, which would be 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's add up the money she made from mowing lawns: $6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) + $30 (Alba) = $54.

Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, so to make 20 small masks, we need to find out how many sets of 4 masks she can make. That's 20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 sets. Since each set requires 2 yards, she'll need 5 * 2 yards = 10 yards for the small masks.

For the large masks, Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. To make 8 large masks, we need to find out how many sets of 3 masks she can make. That's 8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 2.67 sets (we can't make a fraction of a set, but we can calculate the total material needed). Since each set requires 2.25 yards, she'll need 2.67 * 2.25 yards = 6 yards for the large masks.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Harold's daily schedule to figure out how much free time he has.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night, which is a pretty good chunk of the day. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so that's 10 - 2 = 8 hours of work. On top of that, he spends 1 hour walking his dog.

To find out how much free time he has, we need to add up the hours he spends on these activities: 10 hours (sleep) + 8 hours (work) + 1 hour (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we subtract the hours he's already accounted for from the total: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Duncan's current age is 60, and we need to find Adam's age in 8 years. To do this, we'll first figure out Adam's current age.

Eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old. We're told that this was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, if we let Adam's current age be A, then four years ago, Adam was A - 4 years old.

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can set up the equation:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

52 = 2A - 8

Adding 8 to both sides, we get:

60 = 2A

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

A = 30

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

So, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres. Adding 100 acres to that makes Farmer Smith's farm 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, let's find the total number of acres by adding the sizes of both farms: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Colby's earnings. He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, and he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

In an eight-hour workday, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages. Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the day. Multiply the number of packages by the amount he earns per package: 320 * 0.20 = 64 dollars.

"What's up, I'm Kai. So, let's break down this problem. John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is 30 minutes. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, but we're dealing with an extreme sudoku, which takes 4 times that long.

First, we need to find out how long the extreme sudoku takes: 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes. Now, we divide the total time by the time interval at which John drinks a bottle of water, which is 30 minutes.

180 minutes / 30 minutes = 6

"Let's break this down step by step. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. We know there were 20 red balloons, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, we subtract the bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total number of bologna pieces thrown, which is 58. This gives us 58 - 40 = 18 bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. This gives us 18 / 3 = 6.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so we need to find out how many miles he drives in total.

Total miles driven in a month = miles driven per day * number of days in a month
Total miles driven in a month = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles driven in a month = 3000 miles

Now, we know Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs, we'll divide the total miles driven by the miles required for a tune-up.

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven in a month / miles required for a tune-up
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000 miles
Number of tune-ups = 3

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Bruce's work hours for the three days.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours. That's a good starting point.

On Wednesday, he puts in double the time he did on Tuesday, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Now, Thursday is a bit different. He works 2 hours less than he did on Wednesday, which means he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

To find the total hours Bruce works, we simply add up the hours for each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream for their dad's birthday. The cake costs $11, and a dozen balloons cost $0.5 for every 2 balloons, which is $3 for a dozen. They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, totaling $14.

The total amount they spent is $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since they combined their allowance, we can assume they each had the same amount. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2.

$28 / 2 = $14

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We've got 30 students selling lollipops, and each student sells 10 lollipops on average. The lollipops cost $0.8 each, and the students bought them for $0.5 each.

First, let's find out how many lollipops were sold in total. That's 30 students * 10 lollipops per student = 300 lollipops.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. That's 300 lollipops * $0.8 per lollipop = $240.

Next, we need to find the total cost. That's 300 lollipops * $0.5 per lollipop = $150.

The total profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, that's $240 - $150 = $90.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Larry has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, which means he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Now, let's talk about the fish tank. He has three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

Lastly, he has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to add up the number of each type of pet:
3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's figure out how many shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday.

Martha has been collecting shells since she turned 5 years old, and she collects one shell every month. To find the total number of shells, we need to calculate the number of months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year, and from 5 years old to 10 years old is 5 years. So, we multiply the number of years by the number of months in a year: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects 1 shell per month, she'll have collected a total of 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Lana has 27 cups of tea and divides them into 3 rows. She also uses 15 cups to brew cinnamon tea. To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to figure out how many cups are used for chamomile and mint tea.

First, let's subtract the cups used for cinnamon tea from the total: 27 - 15 = 12 cups. These 12 cups are used for both chamomile and mint tea.

Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows and creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, we can divide the 12 cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row: 12 / 3 = 4 cups.

Now, we know that each row has 4 cups, and half of those are mint tea. So, we can divide 4 by 2 to find the number of cups of mint tea in each row: 4 / 2 = 2 cups.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and it takes him 4 hours to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.

Since each trip takes 4 hours, the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours. To find the least number of berries he can pick up per trip, we need to divide the total number of berries (24) by the number of trips (2).

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: 12"

Now, the tank is being emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. We need to find out how much water will be left after 6 days. To do that, we'll calculate the total amount of water emptied in 6 days:

500 * 6 = 3000 gallons

Finally, we subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount in the tank:

5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons

"What's up, I'm Kai. Let's break down Colby's movie budget.

Colby's parents give him $150 each month for movies. He's already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays at $10 each, so that's 5 * $10 = $50. He's also seen 8 movies on other days at $7 each, which is 8 * $7 = $56. On top of that, he's had 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each, totaling 2 * $8 = $16, and 4 boxes of candy at $2 each, which is 4 * $2 = $8.

Adding all that up, Colby's spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130 so far. That leaves him with $150 - $130 = $20.

Tonight, he wants to get a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2), so he'll have $20 - $8 - $2 = $10 left for a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the movie ticket costs $10, which is exactly what he has left.

"Hey there, let's get to it. To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, then add them together.

First, we'll find the calories in a mini cinnamon roll. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, we'll find the calories in a mini blueberry muffin. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, which is 450 / 3 = 150 calories. Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Now, let's add the calories from the cinnamon rolls and the blueberry muffins to find the total calories. The total calories from all the pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Rita removed Junebugs from her plants over the course of five days. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs. Then, on Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs each day. Thursday she removed 48 Junebugs, and on Friday she removed 57.

To find the average number of Junebugs she removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and divide it by the number of days. The total number of Junebugs removed is 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300. Since there are 5 days, we divide the total by 5.

300 / 5 = 60

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We've got a bus and a car traveling at different speeds for different amounts of time. To figure out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus is cruising at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
= 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
= 300 miles

The car, on the other hand, is moving at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
= 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
= 240 miles

Now, let's find the difference in distance:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
= 300 miles - 240 miles
= 60 miles

First, let's add up the number of toys she had before buying the bouncy balls: 31 blocks + 8 stuffed animals + 9 stacking rings = 48 toys.

Now, let's subtract that number from the new total: 62 (total toys) - 48 (toys before bouncy balls) = 14.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Peter, Paul, and Jean's combined age is 100 years. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote Jean's age as J, Paul's age as P, and Peter's age as Pe.

Since Paul is 10 years older than Jean, we can express Paul's age as:
P = J + 10

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
Pe = P + J

Substituting P from the first equation into the second equation:
Pe = (J + 10) + J
Pe = 2J + 10

Now, we know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
Pe + P + J = 100

Substituting Pe and P from the above equations:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
P = J + 10
P = 20 + 10
P = 30

Now that we know Paul and Jean's age, we can find Peter's age:
Pe = P + J
Pe = 30 + 20
Pe = 50

Now, since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they need 60 / 2 = 30 tables in total.

They already own 15 tables, so to find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables needed. That's 30 - 15 = 15 new tables.

"What's up guys, it's Kai. So, we've got a watermelon seed spitting contest going on between Zoey and Sydney. To find the average total distance they spat, we need to calculate each of their individual distances first.

Zoey's got 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet. So, her total distance is 40 x 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney's got 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet. So, her total distance is 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

Now, to find the average, we add their distances and divide by 2. That's (400 + 420) / 2 = 820 / 2 = 410 feet.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have two machines: the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, while the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. Each widget sells for $6.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a month. There are 30 days in a month, and each machine runs 24 hours a day.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours, it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it makes 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours, it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it makes 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money each machine can make in a month. We multiply the total number of widgets by the price of each widget, which is $6.

The Widgeteer 3000 will make 43200 * 6 = $259200 in a month.

The WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32400 * 6 = $194400 in a month.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the amount made by the WidgetMaster 9000 from the amount made by the Widgeteer 3000.

$259200 - $194400 = $64800

"What's up, buddy? I'm Kai. So, let's break down Cameron's hotel stay. He arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. After 12 hours, visitors can add 70 pesos for every additional hour. Cameron decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours.

Let's calculate the cost of his stay using both options. For the 24-hour stay, it's a straightforward 1600 pesos. For the 12-hour stay + additional hours, the first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos, and the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) would cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's see how much Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's figure out how much hay Nate needs for his livestock. 

First, we need to determine how much hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Amount each sheep needs = 2 * 5 - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 10 - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 7 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 goats * 5 pounds
Total hay for goats = 75 pounds

Total hay for sheep = 12 sheep * 7 pounds
Total hay for sheep = 84 pounds

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159 pounds

Next, we need to calculate how many bottles she gives away to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles given away is:
29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

"Let's break down the problem. We know Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D.

We can set up two equations based on the given information: B = A + 20 and B = D + 10.

Since B is equal to both A + 20 and D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10. Solving for D, we get D = A + 10.

We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so A + B + D = 45. Substituting B = A + 20 and D = A + 10 into this equation, we get A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms to get 3A + 30 = 45. Subtract 30 from both sides to get 3A = 15. Divide both sides by 3 to get A = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We've got a book with pages printed on both sides of the paper, and the paper is stacked 100 pages to the inch. Since each paper has two sides, that's 200 pages per inch.

Now, the book is 1.5 inches thick, so we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness to find the total number of pages.

Total number of pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches
Total number of pages = 300 pages

"Hey, let's break this down. We need to find out how many reports Vince stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. 

First, we calculate the total minutes in that time frame. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. 
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples reports in 15-minute intervals, we divide the total minutes by 15. 
900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. 
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

"Hey, let's break down Kim's sleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 8 hours is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so we subtract those 5 minutes: 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

She also sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. We subtract those 23 minutes from the total: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept 452 minutes on her bed that day.

"Let's break down the problem. Jonathan has 2 dozen cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons by multiplying the number of cups by 2/3. This gives us (2/3) * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of cups and the number of measuring spoons: 24 + 10 = 34.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many beds are initially occupied and unoccupied in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 of them occupied. 

Number of occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds
Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Now, let's calculate the number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we multiply this number by the number of days in 2 weeks, which is 14.

Number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

These new patients will occupy some of the unoccupied beds. To find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks, we add the initial number of occupied beds to the number of new patients.

Total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Finally, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity to find the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

Total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

"Hey, let's break down the problem. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of those, 7 are work emails. To find the number of non-work emails, we subtract the work emails from the total.

Non-work emails = Total emails - Work emails = 16 - 7 = 9

Now, we know that two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family. Let's calculate that.

Emails to family = 2/3 * 9 = 6

The remaining emails are to others, including her boyfriend. We can find that by subtracting the emails to family from the non-work emails.

Emails to others = Non-work emails - Emails to family = 9 - 6 = 3

Finally, we're told that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

Emails to boyfriend = 1/3 * 3 = 1

20% of 48 is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

The final answer is: 38"
"What's up guys, it's Kai here. So, let's break down this problem. We know Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried twice as many as Jason. That means Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, we can divide Jason's balls by 2 to find out how many Jeffrey carried. That's 2 / 2 = 1 ball for Jeffrey.

To find the total number of balls, we just add up the number of balls each of them carried: 4 (Jordan) + 2 (Jason) + 1 (Jeffrey) = 7.

Total number of balls: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

We're told that the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day.

To find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11.

First, let's find 50% of $400. That's 0.5 * $400 = $200. Now, we add this to the cost of supplies: $400 + $200 = $600.

So, the cost of travel is $600."
"What's up, trainers. I'm Kai, and I'm here to help you catch the solution to this Pokémon problem.

Let's break it down. We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have caught a total of 339 Pokémon. We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.

Let's use a variable to represent the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught. I'll call it 'x'. Then, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is 4x - 13, and the number of Pokémon Alex has caught is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of Pokémon caught:
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon Stan has caught:
Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 147

"Hey there, let's break down the bird's journey to find the distance between her northern and southern homes.

First, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, covering a distance of 10 * 30 = 300 miles.

Then, she changes direction and flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, covering a distance of 2 * 18 = 36 miles.

Finally, she changes direction again and flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, covering a distance of 5 * 22 = 110 miles.

To find the total distance between her northern and southern homes, we need to subtract the distance she flew north from the total distance she flew south. So, the net distance is 300 + 110 - 36 = 374 miles.

Greta made a batch of brownies, which is 1 dozen, or 12 brownies. At her office party, she received 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. And at her surprise party, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies. 

To find the total number of brownies, we add these together: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies. To find the number of brownies left, we subtract the brownies eaten from the total brownies: 66 - 18 = 48.

Next up, we've got 5 racquets that need polyester string. That takes 22 minutes per racquet, so that's 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

Last but not least, we've got 4 racquets that need hybrid sets, which are half synthetic gut and half polyester string. That takes 18 minutes per racquet, so that's 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total slats = 2 * 50
Total slats = 100

Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, but he still needs to cover the remaining amount. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:

$39 - $14 = $25

First, let's find out how many boxes of gingerbread Sunny sold on Sunday. Since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday than on Saturday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread he sold. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes, and on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes. So, the total number of boxes of gingerbread is 10 + 15 = 25.

Next, let's find out how many boxes of apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday. We know that he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday, and on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. So, on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes of apple pie he sold. On Saturday, he sold 11 boxes, and on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes. So, the total number of boxes of apple pie is 11 + 15 = 26.

The gingerbread costs $6 per box, and the apple pie costs $15 per box. To find out how much Sunny earned, we multiply the total number of boxes of each item by their respective costs:

25 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $150
26 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $390

Adding these amounts together, we get the total amount Sunny earned:

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48.

Since 5 years will pass before Emil turns 24, we subtract 5 from his dad's age at 24 to find his current age: 48 - 5 = 43.

Now, let's consider Emil's brother. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12.

To find his brother's current age, we subtract 5 from his age at 24: 12 - 5 = 7.

Next, we're told that 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can calculate this by multiplying the number of remaining students (24) by 0.25.

Number of cheerleaders and band members = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Finally, we need to find the total number of students leaving early, which is the sum of football players, cheerleaders, and band members:
Total students leaving early = Football players + Cheerleaders and band members

Now, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Next, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space each flower takes up:

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants. However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

They've already decided to plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations. To find out how much soil they've used so far, we need to calculate the total amount of soil needed for these flowers.

For the sunflowers: 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
For the carnations: 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Adding these together, we get: 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, let's subtract the soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil: 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is: 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

25% of $2,000.00 is $2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00 per month.

Since she saves $500.00 per month, in a year she'll have $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so to find out how many shoes she can buy, we'll divide the total amount she saves in a year by the cost of one pair of shoes: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total temperature change when the air conditioner was running on low for 3 hours. Since it cools the room by 2 degrees an hour, the temperature change is 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.

Next, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. The temperature change in this case is 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.

Now, let's add the temperature changes from both low and high settings: 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up by 2 degrees an hour for 2 hours. So, the temperature increase is 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.

To find the net temperature change, we subtract the warming from the cooling: 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"I'm happy to help you out. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Now, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since the comet takes 75 years to complete one orbit, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 from his age when he saw it for the second time. So, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Buford's check-writing habits. 

Buford writes a check for the electric bill and the gas bill once a month. That's 2 checks per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, that's 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year for the electric and gas bills.

He also writes 2 checks per month for the church, which is 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.

Lastly, Buford writes a check for the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means 1 check every 3 months. There are 4 quarters in a year, so that's 1 * 4 = 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks Buford writes per year: 24 (electric and gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know the second plane makes 44 trips, and that's half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

Now, we're told the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. That's 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights to Greece. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights, which are split equally between France and Germany.

Since the flights to France and Germany are split equally, we can divide the remaining flights by 2. So, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so that's 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add up their howling times: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Now, let's add up the money Adam got from his parents: $6 (from mom) + $12 (from dad) = $18.

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his own savings, we subtract the amount he got from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total age of the four children is 20, and we have the ages of two of them: Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's find the average age of the group. Since there are four children, we can set up an equation using the total age:
Total age = Average age * Number of children
20 = Average age * 4

Now, divide both sides by 4 to find the average age:
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can find her age by multiplying the average age by 2:
Helene's age = 2 * Average age
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

Now that we have the ages of three children, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting their ages from the total age:
Wilfred's age = Total age - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age)
Wilfred's age = 20 - (3 + 4 + 10)
Wilfred's age = 20 - 17
Wilfred's age = 3

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We have a family of 6 - 2 adults and 4 kids - and they're dividing a watermelon. The adults get slices that are twice as big as the kids'. We need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets.

Let's say each kid gets a slice of size x. Then, each adult gets a slice of size 2x. Since there are 4 kids and 2 adults, the total number of slices is 4x (for the kids) + 4x (for the adults), which equals 8x.

Now, to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we divide the number of slices each adult gets (2x) by the total number of slices (8x) and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (2x / 8x) * 100
= (1/4) * 100
= 25%

"Hey, I'm Kai. Let's break down Doctor Jones' schedule for Monday. He's spending 9 hours at the clinic, and we need to figure out how much time he'll have left to update his records.

First, we need to calculate the time spent on rounds and appointments. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes, so that's 9 * 20 = 180 minutes. He also has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes, which adds up to 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

Since Doctor Jones is at the clinic for 9 hours, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

- Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Adding all these up, we get: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting this to hours and minutes, we get 3 hours.

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we subtract the total time from the serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

The latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know Lisa and Peter sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. We also know how many boxes they each sold: Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. To find the total number of boxes, we add these two numbers together: 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Now, we need to figure out how many chocolate bars are in a box. To do this, we divide the total number of chocolate bars (64) by the total number of boxes (8). 

64 ÷ 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the earnings per week would be $40 * 3 = $120.

To find the expected earnings in a month, we'll assume a 4-week month. So, the earnings per month would be $120 * 4 = $480.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each. We also know Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars.

To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars he has by the number of boxes: 64 ÷ 4 = 16. So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, let's do the same for Martha: 56 ÷ 7 = 8. Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

The question asks how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. To find this out, we subtract the number of chocolate bars Martha has in each box from the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box: 16 - 8 = 8.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of female porcupines in the park. We know that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, which is 50. So, we multiply 50 by 3/5.

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Now, each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. To find the total number of babies born in a month, we multiply the number of female porcupines by 4.

Number of babies per month = 30 * 4 = 120

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of babies per month by 12 to find the total number of babies born in a year.

Number of babies per year = 120 * 12 = 1440

Finally, we add the initial population of 50 to the number of babies born in a year to find the total number of porcupines after a year.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's dive into the problem. The Smith family needs to fill their swimming pool, and we need to calculate the cost. To do this, we first need to find the volume of the pool.

The pool's dimensions are 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. To find the volume, we multiply these dimensions together.

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

The pool company instructed the Smiths to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the gallons of water needed.

Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260

Now, we know the cost is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = gallons * $0.10
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

Shandy's speed was 45 miles per hour, and she traveled for 10 hours, so her total distance is 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

Now, let's find the difference between their distances. To do this, I'll subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.

Now, for the students under 16, we've also got 1500 students. One-half of these students are male, so that's 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.

To find the total number of male students, we add the male students over 16 and under 16: 375 + 750 = 1125 male students.

Since there are 3000 students in total, the number of female students is 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's add up the total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days:

3000 + 1125 = 4125 (second day)
7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he's already purchased. He bought 3 peaches at $.5 each, so that's 3 * .5 = $1.5. He also got 4 pears at $.5 each, which is 4 * .5 = $2. Then, there are 2 kiwis at $1 each, totaling 2 * 1 = $2. Lastly, he picked up 5 apples at $.75 each, so that's 5 * .75 = $3.75.

Year 1: 
The price increase is 5% of $120, which is 0.05 * $120 = $6. So, the price after 1 year is $120 + $6 = $126.

Year 2: 
The price increase is 5% of $126, which is 0.05 * $126 = $6.30. Now, the price after 2 years is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

We also know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. This means S = 2L.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is 12L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is 4S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation: 4S = 4(2L) = 8L.

The total earnings from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation: 12L + 8L = 120.

Combine like terms: 20L = 120.

Divide both sides by 20: L = 6.

Since S = 2L, S = 2 * 6 = 12.

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

Now, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. To calculate this, we find 50% of 24, which is 0.5 * 24 = 12. Adding this to the amount he can mine with an iron pickaxe, we get 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Since we have 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes, we multiply the amount each dwarf can mine per day by the number of dwarves: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds per day.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Tom's situation. He buys a bedroom set for $3000 and uses the $1000 he got from selling his old bedroom set to pay for part of it. To find out how much he still owes, we subtract the $1000 from the initial cost.

$3000 (initial cost) - $1000 (from selling old set) = $2000 (remaining amount owed)

Now, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month. To calculate this, we multiply the remaining amount by 0.10 (which is the same as 10%).

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

Sally starts with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. Then, a gust of wind causes 40% of the red balloons to burst. To find out how many red balloons she lost, we calculate 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, she has 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons are unaffected, so she still has 7 green balloons. But she accidentally releases half of the yellow balloons, which is 12 / 2 = 6. So, she has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

As she approaches the school, she finds 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and adds 75% of them to her collection. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's count the total number of balloons she has: 
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"What's up, I'm Kai. So, let's break down Marcus's situation. He's trying to figure out if he really needs to do his homework. There are a few factors at play here.

First, there's a 50% chance that a substitute teacher will come in tomorrow and not collect the homework. That's a pretty sweet deal for Marcus.

But, if the normal teacher comes in, there's still a chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. The teacher might give everyone an extension, which happens 40% of the time. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

Now, if the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension (which happens 60% of the time), Marcus might be able to convince her that his dog ate his assignment. This happens 20% of the time. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Adding up all the ways Marcus can get out of turning in his homework, we get 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher with extension) + 6% (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 76%. This means there's a 100% - 76% = 24% chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We know the Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 people. Out of these, 950 seats are reserved for graduates and 300 seats are for faculty members. To find out how many seats are left for friends and family, we subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity.

Total seats taken = 950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250
Seats available for friends and family = 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, assuming each graduate gets an equal number of tickets, we divide the available seats by the number of graduates. Since there are 950 seats reserved for graduates, we can assume there are 950 graduates.

Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's figure out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat.

We know it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so that's 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3 to find the number of small beans. So, 150 * 3 = 450.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Melissa's jury duty pay. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so that's a total of 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

Melissa earns $15 per day, and she works for 3 days, so her total pay is 15 * 3 = $45. However, she also has to pay $3 for parking each day, which adds up to 3 * 3 = $9.

To find out how much she makes after expenses, we subtract her expenses from her pay: $45 - $9 = $36.

Now, let's calculate her hourly pay after expenses. We divide her pay after expenses by the total hours worked: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

"What's up, I'm Kai. So, Richard's trying to create a sweet science experiment with diet soda and candy. He's got a 24-foot wide driveway and wants to set up a soda bottle every 3 feet. To figure out how long it'll take him to set off all the fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move between each one.

First, let's find out how many bottles he'll need. We can do that by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle: 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles.

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he'll only need to move to 7 more bottles. It takes him 5 seconds to get from one bottle to the next, so we multiply the number of bottles he needs to move to by the time it takes: 7 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 35 seconds.

The answer is: 35"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many apples Uncle Franky has in total. Since he ordered two boxes, and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes.

Total number of apples = 40 apples/box * 2 boxes = 80 apples

Now, we know Uncle Franky wants to pack 8 apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in one pack.

Number of packs = Total number of apples / Number of apples in one pack
= 80 apples / 8 apples/pack
= 10 packs

Adding those together, the total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40. Amor started with $50, so to find out how much she has left, we subtract the cost of the cheese from her initial cash: $50 - $40 = $10.

"Let's break down Jim's situation. He's taking out $50,000 in loans each year for 4 years, so the total amount of loans is $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Before college, Jim had a $25,000 per year job. Since he's not working while in school, he's losing $25,000 per year for 4 years, which is a total of $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

So, the total amount Jim needs to earn to cover the loans and the lost income is $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

After college, Jim's income triples to $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year. To find out how long it'll take him to earn $300,000 at this rate, we can divide the total amount by his new income: $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's figure out how much fabric Jim needs for his king-sized bed comforter.

First, we need to determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long, and Jim wants the fabric to be 2 feet longer, so the length of the fabric is 6 + 2 = 8 feet.

Next, the bed is 8 feet wide, and Jim wants the fabric to be 2 feet wider, so the width of the fabric is 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric by multiplying the length and width: 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2: 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. To find one-fifth of 425, we divide by 5: 425 ÷ 5 = 85. Then, we add 17 to get the total for Tuesday: 85 + 17 = 102.

Now, let's move on to Wednesday. They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. Adding 5 to that gives us 204 + 5 = 209.

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add up the letters delivered each day: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Johnny's dad had a bit of a rollercoaster at the horse racing event. 

First, he lost $5 on the first race. Then, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, which is 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so that's 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost. We subtract the amount won from the total amount lost: $5 (lost) + $16.50 (lost) - $11 (won) = $10.50.

To find the average amount lost, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races, which is 3. So, the average amount lost is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

So, in each country, we've got 5 cities with 1000 people each, which gives us:
5 cities * 1000 people per city = 5000 people per country

"Hey, let's figure this out. We need to find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after they've both grown over the summer.

First, we need to get both of their heights in the same units. Since Cole's height is already in inches, let's convert Xavier's height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

Xavier's original height in inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
Xavier's new height: 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Now, let's calculate Cole's new height:
Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

The difference in their heights is:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height = 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

"Let's break down the problem. We have three people who divided an amount of $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first, and the third person took twice what the second person took. We need to find the share of the first person.

Let's denote the share of the first person as x. Then, the second person's share is x + 80, and the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

Since the total amount is $1920, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

So, the share of the first person is $420.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that a team of 4 painters worked on a mansion for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks. To find the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's convert 3/8ths of a day to hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can multiply 3/8 by 24:
3/8 * 24 = 9 hours per day

Now, let's calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:
3 weeks = 3 * 7 days = 21 days
Total hours worked in 21 days = 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Finally, let's divide the total hours worked by the number of painters:
189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter

"Let's break down the problem. We know Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total, and we need to find out how many he retrieved in the first set.

Let's say the number of balls retrieved in the second set is x. Then, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4, since he retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

To simplify the equation, let's multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Ben bought a car for $20000 in 2007, and the price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. We need to find the price of the car in the year 2010.

To do this, we'll calculate the depreciation for 3 years (from 2007 to 2010).

First, let's find the price after 1 year (2008):
Price after 1 year = Initial price - (Initial price * Depreciation rate)
= $20000 - ($20000 * 0.21)
= $20000 - $4200
= $15800

Next, let's find the price after 2 years (2009):
Price after 2 years = Price after 1 year - (Price after 1 year * Depreciation rate)
= $15800 - ($15800 * 0.21)
= $15800 - $3328
= $12472

Finally, let's find the price after 3 years (2010):
Price after 3 years = Price after 2 years - (Price after 2 years * Depreciation rate)
= $12472 - ($12472 * 0.21)
= $12472 - $2618.52

Total distance driven = 325 km/day * 4 days = 1300 km

Now, let's subtract the total distance driven from the total distance to find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive.

Total number of tiles required = Total area of the kitchen floor / Area of each tile
Total number of tiles required = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Total number of tiles required = 200

Now, let's calculate the total cost. Each tile costs $12, so we multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons: 35 + 210 = 245 dollars.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

Sidney initially ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

However, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, leaving him with 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total to 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches.

Now, let's find out how many meatballs are in the remaining sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. However, a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures and couldn't deliver the fertiliser.

First, let's find out how many trucks had mechanical failures:
1/4 * 20 trucks = 5 trucks

Now, we subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks to find out how many trucks delivered the fertiliser:
20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we multiply the number of trucks that delivered by the tons each truck was carrying:
15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers:

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter to make 6 dozen croissants. The grocery store has a promotion where you can buy one pound of butter and get one half off. 

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds, we can pair them up to take advantage of the promotion. So, 3 pounds will be at full price, and the other 3 pounds will be at half price.

The full-price pounds will cost 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. The half-price pounds will cost 3 * $2.00 = $6.00. 

Adding these together, we get $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

"What's up, I'm Kai. So, let's break down the party costs for Kayla's birthday bash.

First, we need to figure out how many people are actually coming. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. That's a total of 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests. But, 4 people said they couldn't make it, so we subtract those: 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The theater rental fee is $125 for 20 guests, and then it's $6 for each additional guest. We've got 21 extra guests (41 - 20 = 21), so the cost for them is 21 * $6 = $126.

Adding the initial fee to the cost of the extra guests, we get: $125 + $126 = $251.

"Hey there, let's break this down. Maggie and Riza each started with $60. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is $60 * 0.25 = $15. So, she has $60 - $15 = $45 left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is $60 * (1/3) = $20. So, she has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

Now, let's add the money they have left: $45 + $40 = $85.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas to feed his three monkeys for a week. To find out how many bananas they eat in a day, we'll divide 315 by 7. That's 315 ÷ 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, let's look at each monkey's eating habits. The first monkey eats 10 bananas a day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first, so that's 10 + 4 = 14 bananas a day.

The first two monkeys eat a total of 10 + 14 = 24 bananas a day. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we'll subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total daily bananas. That's 45 - 24 = 21 bananas a day.

The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"I'm happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem. Jenny buys 15 roses, and we need to figure out how much she pays and how much change she gets.

First, we know that a dozen roses cost $15, and she buys 15 roses. That's a dozen roses plus 3 more. The dozen roses cost $15, and the 3 extra roses cost $2 each, so that's 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny pays with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

Now, let's calculate the change. The change is the amount she paid minus the cost of the roses, which is $25 - $21 = $4.

The florist only has quarters for change, and each quarter is worth $0.25. To find out how many quarters Jenny gets, we divide the change by the value of a quarter: $4 / $0.25 = 16.

Lastly, he sold 20 sodas for $1.50 each. That's 20 * $1.50 = $30.

Now, let's add up the total amount: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

"What's up, I'm Kai. So, let's break down Paul's train situation. We need to figure out how long he'll be waiting for his train.

First, the initial train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. That means it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

Next, the second train shows up half an hour after the first one leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. This train stays for a quarter of the time the first one did, so that's 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. The second train leaves at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

Then, the third train arrives an hour after the second one leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since it leaves right away, it's gone at 125 minutes.

Finally, the fourth train – the one Paul needs – arrives 20 minutes after the third one leaves. That's 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

So, Paul will be waiting for 145 minutes for his train.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for her sculpture, and she's been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she already has, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks she's been saving them.

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since she needs 200 toothpicks, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks needed.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Since he bought it at 75% of the original price, we can calculate it as follows:
Original price = $2000
Price Mr. Rogers bought it = $2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. So, the price his friend paid is:
Price friend paid = $1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, let's find the discount obtained by the friend from the original price. The discount is the difference between the original price and the price the friend paid:
Discount = $2000 - $1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we'll divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
Percentage discount = ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

"Let's dive into this problem. We've got 5 springs, and each one creates a new jellyfish every second. We need to figure out how many jellyfish they'll create in 4 hours.

First, we need to convert 4 hours into seconds. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So, 1 hour is equal to 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds. Multiply that by 4, and we get 14400 seconds.

Now, since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, we can multiply the total number of seconds by the number of springs. That gives us 5 * 14400 = 72000 jellyfish.

Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. Now, we add 15 to that result to get Frankie's score.

Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195

"I'd be happy to help you out. So, James is walking to the store, but he forgets something and has to head back home. Let's break this down.

First, we need to figure out the total distance James walked. He walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles (since his home is 4 miles from the store), and then he walked back home, which is another 2 miles. After that, he walked the full 4 miles to the store. So, the total distance is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 miles.

Now, we know James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find the total time it took him to reach the store, we can divide the total distance by his speed:

Time = Total distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

If she bought the bananas individually, she would have paid 40 * $0.80 = $32.

However, she bought them in bunches, which cost $3.00 each. So, she paid 10 * $3.00 = $30.

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32 - $30 = $2.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We know Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence to split, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. To find out how much Sam gets, we can use a simple equation.

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet. The total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now that we know it grows 2 inches per year, we can multiply that by 13 years to find the total growth.

2 inches per year * 13 years = 26 inches

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Marcel's bike sales to figure out how much he earned.

Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes, with half of them being Trekking bikes. That's 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes. To find the number of BMX bikes, we multiply 300 by 0.15, which gives us 45 BMX bikes.

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

The prices for each bike are: MTB ($500), BMX ($250, which is half the price of an MTB), and Trekking ($450).

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

Next, I'll calculate the total number of bales the truck picks up in 6 hours: 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales.

Now, to find out how many bales are left in the field, I'll subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

"What's up, I'm Kai. Let's break down John's learning schedule.

John has 8 periods a day, with each period being 40 minutes long. That's 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day. Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

Now, let's calculate his extra learning time. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday. To find the total weekly minutes, we'll call it 'x'. The extra learning time is (1/16)x, and the class time is 1600 minutes. So, the total weekly minutes 'x' is the sum of class time and extra learning time:

x = 1600 + (1/16)x

Multiplying both sides by 16:

16x = 25600 + x

Subtracting x from both sides:

15x = 25600

Dividing both sides by 15:

x = 25600 / 15
x = 1706.67

Now, let's convert the total weekly minutes to hours:

Total hours per week = x / 60
Total hours per week = 1706.67 / 60
Total hours per week = 28.44

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so that's 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so that's 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

= 200 bags

Now that we know 200 bags were sold, we can multiply that by the price per bag, which is $5.

Now, we know the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, which means the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons are required: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Finally, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon, which is $12: 12 * 12 = $144.

Her brother came by and took 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, which means there are now 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas left.

When Ellen's friend arrives, there are 8 sodas to choose from, and 2 of them are shaken. To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed, we need to calculate the probability of choosing a shaken soda. That's the number of shaken sodas (2) divided by the total number of sodas (8), which is 2/8 or 1/4.

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 1/4 * 100 = 25%.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

For the second train, it's:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to calculate 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2, which gives us 10 days off.

Now, let's find the number of days Billy works. We subtract the days off from the total number of days: 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people Billy helps, we multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works: 6 people per day * 40 days = 240 people.

Micah's miles = 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.

Now, let's add up the miles run by Amber and Micah. 
Total miles run by Amber and Micah = 8 + 28 = 36 miles.

"Hey there, let's break down Sheila's credit card transactions.

She initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise. Then, she returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract that from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off the original price of $20.00. To find the discount, we calculate 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00. So, the frying pan cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off the original price of $30.00. The discount is 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00. So, the towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the new purchases is $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00. Adding this to the balance after the return, we get $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lauren wants to save for a retirement period of 20 years, and she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000. So, her retirement savings goal is:

$100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000 per year

For 20 years, she'll need:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000

Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck, which is:

$100,000 per year * 0.20 = $20,000 per year

To calculate how many years it will take her to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the goal by her annual savings:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

However, Lauren wants to retire in 20 years. Since she's already been working and saving, let's assume she's already saved some amount. We know she needs to save a total of $800,000, and she saves $20,000 per year.

The amount she'll save in the next 20 years is:

$20,000 * 20 = $400,000

This means she's already saved:

$800,000 - $400,000 = $400,000

Since she saves $20,000 per year, she's already worked:

$400,000 / $20,000 per year = 20 years

However, this is the total number of years she's worked so far, not the number of years she needs to work from now. Since she wants to retire in 20 years, and she's already worked for some years, the number of years she needs to work from now is equal to the number of years she needs to work to save the remaining amount.

Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he needs to cut into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we'll divide the total length by 4:
100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part

Now, each of these 4 parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. So, we'll divide the length of each part by 5:
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. To find the total number of students, we need to figure out what 100% of the population is.

Think of it like this: if 40% is 240, then 1% would be 240 divided by 40, which is 6. Now, multiply 6 by 100 to get 100% of the population, which is 600.

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Since 240 are boys, we subtract 240 from 600 to find the number of girls.

"Hey there, let's calculate how much my friend's mom spent at the gardening shop. 

First, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil. The pots cost $19, and the garden soil costs $26. So, $19 + $26 = $45.

Then, we subtract the coupon discount of $7 from the total. $45 - $7 = $38.

"Hey there, let's get straight to it. We've got three women wearing 4-inch heels and three wearing 2-inch heels. To find the average height of heels, we need to calculate the total height and divide it by the number of women.

The total height of the 4-inch heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches, and the total height of the 2-inch heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches. Adding these together gives us a total height of 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

There are 6 women in total, so to find the average height, we divide the total height by the number of women: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Soledad's hiking plan. She wants to hike 9,300 miles in June, which has 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide 9,300 miles by 30 days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad plans to hike twice a day, we divide 310 miles by 2:

310 miles / 2 = 155 miles per hike

However, Soledad is currently planning to hike 125 miles per time. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we subtract 125 miles from 155 miles:

155 miles - 125 miles = 30 miles

Soledad needs to hike 30 more miles per hike to complete her journey on time.

"Hey there, let's calculate the total amount the store will receive after all the balls are sold. 

First, we need to find the total cost of each type of ball. For the red balls, we have 3 balls at $9 each, so that's 3 * $9 = $27. 

Next, the blue balls - we have 11 of those at $5 each, so that's 11 * $5 = $55.

Lastly, the green balls - 25 of those at $3 each, which is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, let's add all those amounts together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

"Let's break down the problem. Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. Peter wants a quarter of that, and Paul wants 1/3 of that. To find out how many kilograms Jacques will have left, we need to calculate the total amount taken by Peter and Paul.

Peter wants a quarter of 12 kg: 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg
Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg: 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg
Total taken: 3 + 4 = 7 kg
Apples left: 12 - 7 = 5 kg

Since Jacques is the only one left, he will have 5 kg of apples.

After buying the two books, Anna had $2 left. This means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount she spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

First, I'll divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes to get the rate: 255 blinks ÷ 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, I'll use this rate to find out how many minutes it'll take for the light to blink 459 times: 459 blinks ÷ 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's dive into the problem. We've got Tate's garden pond with some guppies and goldfishes. Initially, there are 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes. Then, Tate buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

First, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes. 
Male fishes: 4 (initial guppies) + 3 (initial goldfishes) + 2 (bought guppies) + 2 (bought goldfishes) = 11
Female fishes: 7 (initial guppies) + 5 (initial goldfishes) + 1 (bought guppy) + 3 (bought goldfishes) = 16

Now, to find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes, we subtract the number of male fishes from the number of female fishes:
16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

"What's up, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. John visits his parents twice a month, and it takes him 2 hours to drive there at 70 mph. We need to figure out the total miles he drives in a month.

First, we need to find the distance of the round trip. Since it takes 2 hours to drive there, the round trip will take 4 hours. Now, we can calculate the distance:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 4 hours
Distance = 280 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the distance by 2:

Total miles per month = 280 miles * 2
Total miles per month = 560 miles

"Let's break down the problem. We have 5 workers, and we know the production rates of 4 of them. Two workers produce 6 toys an hour, and the other two produce 4 toys an hour. They all work for 10 hours, and the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to fulfill the order of 400 toys.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers in 10 hours. The two workers producing 6 toys an hour will make 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys. The other two workers producing 4 toys an hour will make 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys. So, the total number of toys produced by these 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys and still needs 20 more after the 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, let's find out how many toys the fifth worker produced. We subtract the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers from the total number of toys produced in 10 hours: 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

First, let's find the weight of Elijah's first dog. Since it's one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, we can calculate it as 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

Next, we'll find the weight of Elijah's second dog, which is half the weight of Kory's dog. That's 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the dogs: Kory's dog (60 pounds) + Elijah's first dog (15 pounds) + Elijah's second dog (30 pounds) = 105 pounds.

Since Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris. Luis used half of the stickers, so to find out how many stickers Luis had initially, we multiply 16 by 2. This gives us 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.

Now, we know Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. To find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning, we multiply the number of stickers Luis had by 2. This gives us 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

"What's up, I'm Kai. So, let's break down this M&M problem. John's got 3 large bags of M&M's, each weighing 10 ounces. That's a total of 3 * 10 = 30 ounces of M&M's.

Now, we know that each ounce has 30 M&M's, so we multiply 30 ounces by 30 M&M's per ounce to get the total number of M&M's. That's 30 * 30 = 900 M&M's.

John wants to put 10 M&M's in each small bag, so we divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find out how many small bags he can make. That's 900 / 10 = 90.

First, we need to find out what half the circumference of the earth is. The circumference is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that would be 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Now, we know Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it'll take him to cover 20,000 kilometers, we'll divide the distance by his daily flying distance:
20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we multiply 120 by 5 to get the speed of the 2nd fastest car.

2nd fastest car speed = 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour

Now, we're told the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the fastest car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.

Fastest car speed = 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour

Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. Since his age was twice Vince's age at that time, Vince must have been 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago.

To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago: 7 + 2 = 9.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. To find out how many eggs each of them painted, let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation x + (x + 12) = 30.

Combine like terms: 2x + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2x = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 9.

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 

The difference is 21 - 13 = 8.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Next, we need to find the total weight of the boxes. Since Nik wants to put the crayons into groups of 8, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes: 200 crayons / 8 crayons/box = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes to find the total weight in ounces: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can divide the total weight in ounces by 16: 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

First, we need to find out how much of the tree John can actually use to make logs. Since he can use 80% of the 80-foot tree, we multiply 80 by 0.8:
80 * 0.8 = 64 feet

Now, we know John cuts the tree into 4-foot logs. To find out how many logs he can make, we divide the usable part of the tree (64 feet) by the length of each log (4 feet):
64 / 4 = 16 logs

Next, we're told that John can cut 5 planks from each log. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log:
16 * 5 = 80 planks

Finally, we know John sells each plank for $1.2. To find out how much he makes in total, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank:
80 * $1.2 = $96

"Hey, let's break down the problem. Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. To find her brother's salary, I'll multiply Valerie's salary by 2. That's $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month for her brother.

Now, let's calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000, and her brother earns $10,000, so together they earn $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is $15,000 * 2 = $30,000 per month.

"Let's break down the problem. Grandma walks 3 miles every day, with 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We know she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and we need to find the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

First, let's find her speed on the beach. We can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time. In this case, the distance is 2 miles, and the time is 40 minutes.

Speed = 2 miles / 40 minutes
Speed = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we know she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, so her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * (1/20 miles per minute) = 1/10 miles per minute.

Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, we can find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute)
Time = 10 minutes

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk is the sum of the time she spends on the beach and the time she spends on the sidewalk:

Total Time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes
Total Time = 50 minutes

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we subtract 10 from 36.

36 - 10 = 26

"Let's break down the problem. Donny has two mugs of water, one at 33 degrees and the other at an unknown temperature. He mixes 4 ounces of the 33-degree water with 1 ounce of the unknown water and is now able to drink it, meaning the temperature is at least 40 degrees.

To find the minimum temperature of the second mug, we can use a weighted average. The total weight of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug). The weighted average temperature of the mixture is:
(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:
4 * 33 + x ≥ 200
132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:
x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 68 degrees.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Then, he gets 20 cows and 10 chickens every day for three weeks. First, we need to find out how many days are in three weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, three weeks would be 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Now, let's calculate the number of cows and chickens added over 21 days. 
Cows added per day: 20
Chickens added per day: 10
Total cows added: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total chickens added: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Next, we add these to the initial number of animals.
Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20
Total number of cows after three weeks: 50 + 420 = 470
Total number of chickens after three weeks: 20 + 210 = 230

Finally, we find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks by adding the total number of cows and chickens.
Total number of animals after three weeks: 470 + 230 = 700

To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $40.00, which is $4.00. Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels. To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

To find out how many potatoes make one scoop, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops: 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Finally, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop to find out how many potatoes he ate: 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

To find the total number of eggs, we add those two numbers together: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs. 

Since we're asked about dozens of eggs, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

Faraday sells individual sunflowers for $2 each and bouquets of sunflowers for $8 each. We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
$26 (daily earnings from individual sunflowers) / $2 (cost per sunflower) = 13 individual sunflowers per day

Since we want to find the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days, we multiply the number of individual sunflowers per day by 3:
13 * 3 = 39 individual sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
$56 (daily earnings from bouquets) / $8 (cost per bouquet) = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets per day is:
7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers per day

For 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets is:
84 * 3 = 252 sunflowers

- Small-sized scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

However, Lauren can work on different scenes in a single day. To minimize the total number of days, she can work on the scenes with the largest remainder first.

A more efficient approach would be to work on the scenes in a combination. She can do 5 large-sized scenes, 6 medium-sized scenes, and 7 small-sized scenes in 6 days, 1 day, and 7 days respectively. 

So, she can do 30 large-sized scenes, 36 medium-sized scenes, and 42 small-sized scenes in 6 days. Then she can do the remaining 15 large-sized scenes in 3 days, and the remaining 7 small-sized scenes in 1 day.

However, she can do the last 7 small-sized scenes in the 3 days that she is doing the last 15 large-sized scenes. 

So, the total number of days is 6 + 3 = 9 days.

May has 31 days. Since Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, the daily cost of food for the fish is 3 * $1 = $3. Now, let's multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: 31 days * $3 per day = $93.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. To find Sid's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled and the total time taken.

Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours and then an additional 140 miles in 3 hours. So, the total distance is 110 + 140 = 250 miles. The total time taken is 2 + 3 = 5 hours.

Now, let's calculate the average speed. Average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. So, it's 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We've got two lottery tickets, and we want to find the probability that both of them are winners.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. Now, the second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply their individual probabilities:
20% * 60% = 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.12 * 100 = 12%

"Hey there, let's break down the seashell collection. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up the total number of seashells they collected: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

They decided to divide the seashells equally among themselves. To find out how many each person got, we'll divide the total by 3. So, 60 / 3 = 20 seashells per person.

On weekends, he eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, so that's 5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots. To find the total, we add the carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends: 20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots.

"What's up, I'm Kai. So, let's break down the problem. We've got a cassette with two songs, and we know the first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first one. To find the length of the second song, we need to calculate 60% of 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes. Since the second song is 60% longer, we add those 3 minutes to the original 5 minutes. So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

Now, let's find the total time of the cassette. We add the length of the first song (5 minutes) to the length of the second song (8 minutes). That's 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's figure out the length of Carl's cane.

We know Isabel is 7 feet tall. Since Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height by subtracting 2 from 7, which gives us 5 feet.

Now, Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so we add 1 to Ned's height, making Carl 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.

The problem states that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we divide Carl's height by 2. So, 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know that Hortex produces 4200 bottles of carrot juice per day, and each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand. 

First, we need to figure out how many bottles it takes to cover 100% of one person's daily energy needs. Since 1 bottle covers 20%, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles to cover 100% of one person's daily energy needs.

Now, to satisfy 100% of 2300 people's daily energy needs, we need 5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex already produces 4200 bottles per day, the number of additional bottles needed is 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carla has 8 identical octuplets. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. To find the number of babies wearing each color, we can multiply the total number of babies by the given fractions.

Babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6
Babies wearing blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2

Now, we know that all the blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows. To find the number of purple-wearers with bows, we can multiply the number of purple-wearers by 1/3.

Purple-wearers with bows: 1/3 * 6 = 2

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of blue-wearers and purple-wearers with bows.

Total babies with bows: 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we can divide the number of purple-wearers with bows by the total number of babies with bows, and multiply by 100.

"I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem step by step.

Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land. He sells half of it, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters, for $50.

Next, he sells 1/4 of his original land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30.

Now, let's calculate how much land he has left. He started with 80 square meters, sold 40, and then sold 20 more. So, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left.

He sells this remaining land for $3 per square meter, which means he earns 20 * 3 = $60 from the last sale.

To find the total amount of money he earned, we add the money from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

To find the total number of eggs found, we add them all up: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden to find out how many eggs are still hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. John collects garbage from three apartment complexes. The first two have 200 apartments each, and the last one is 60% bigger than the other two combined.

First, I'll calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes: 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. Now, I'll find 60% of this total: 0.6 * 400 = 240. Since the last complex is 60% bigger, it has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

He gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is 3120 * 0.40 = 1248.

Now, we're told that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We also know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. So, the 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

The tree doesn't produce any fruits during the 9th year, so that's 0 fruits. Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced in 10 years:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We know the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If we denote the length of the yellow rope as y, then the length of the blue rope is y - 7.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4(y - 7).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6y = 72

Divide by 6:
y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
Blue rope = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
Red rope = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4(5) = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given thrice as much, which is 3 * $5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's say they each gave x dollars. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x, and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get:

-x = -$3

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = $3

So, they each gave $3 to their little sister. Now, let's find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

So, the yellow paint takes up 6 pints (half of 12). That leaves us with 6 pints for the other three colors. Since there's an equal amount of red, white, and purple paint, we can divide the remaining 6 pints by 3.

That gives us 2 pints of red paint.

First, we need to find the area of one bedroom. The dimensions are given as 20 by 12 feet, so we multiply the length and width to get the area: 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, we multiply the area of one bedroom by 4 to get the total area of the bedrooms: 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so we multiply the area of one bedroom by 5 to get the area of the living room: 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So, the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, let's find out the cost per pod. Since the special size box costs $12, we divide the cost by the number of pods: 12 / 120 = $0.1 per pod.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. To find out how many 20 dollar bills he has, we divide 1000 by 20, which gives us 50 bills.

Next, he loses 10 bills, so we subtract 10 from 50, leaving him with 40 bills.

Then, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 left.

The value of the remaining 20 dollar bills is 20 * 20 = 400 dollars.

After that, Thomas triples his money, so we multiply 400 by 3, which gives us 1200 dollars.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch per day (if the chalk was full). Since the chalk is not full, we will use the remaining length to calculate the number of days.

However, the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, so he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches.

Let's calculate the number of days until the chalk is less than 2 inches:
The teacher has 2.75 inches left and uses 1 inch per day. 
2.75 - 1 = 1.75 inches after the first day.
1.75 - 1 = 0.75 inches after the second day.

Since 0.75 inches is less than 1 inch, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after the second day of using 20% of the original chalk length per day.

However, the question asks for the number of days before he has to recycle the chalk. Therefore, the answer is 2 days before he has to recycle the chalk on the third day.

W = 5(C + 7)

Second, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, let's solve these equations. We can start by substituting the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute. However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate at which Jay gains snowballs, we subtract the rate at which they melt from the rate at which he builds them. To do this, we need a common denominator, which is 15 in this case. So, we convert 1/3 to 5/15 and then subtract 2/15: 
5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can do this by dividing 60 by the net rate: 
60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

The final answer is: 300"
"What's up, I'm Kai. So, you wanna know how old Jim is, right? Alright, let's break it down. John is 28 now, and 20 years ago, he was twice as old as Jim. 

First, we need to find out how old John was 20 years ago. That's easy, just subtract 20 from 28.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Now, since John was twice as old as Jim back then, we can set up a simple equation. Let's say Jim's age 20 years ago was x. Then, John's age 20 years ago would be 2x. We already know John's age 20 years ago was 8, so:

2x = 8
x = 8 / 2
x = 4

So, Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. To find his current age, we just add 20 to that.

Jim's current age = 4 + 20 = 24

"Hey, let's break down the problem. Doxa started with 8 slices of apple. She ate 1 slice, so that's a good starting point.

Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, which means she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.

Now, her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we add up the slices eaten by each person: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the nurses had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, at the end of the third day, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

Since they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, this means that they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the previous days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

Now, we know that they had 3 bandages left from the previous days at the end of the third day. This 3 bandages is the sum of the bandages left at the end of the first day (12) and the bandages left at the end of the second day. Since they used 28 bandages on the second day and only had 12 left from the first day, they must have had 28 - 12 = 16 more bandages at the start of the second day. This means they had 16 more bandages at the start of the first day.

So, the total bandages they had at the start of the first day is 50 (from the bulk pack) + 12 (left at the end of the first day) + 16 (extra bandages) = 78.

"Hey, I'm happy to help you out. So, May's getting her hair cut and colored, and we need to figure out the total cost. The color costs $40, and the haircut costs $30 per inch. 

First, let's find out how many inches were cut off. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8, so that's 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

Now, we multiply the number of inches cut off by the cost per inch, which is 2 * $30 = $60 for the haircut.

Adding the cost of the color, we get $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

"Hey, let's break down Jen's earnings for April. She works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, and her hourly rate is $1.5. Since there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate her total hours worked.

Total hours worked per week = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
Total hours worked in April = 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours
Total earnings from hours worked = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen didn't incur any absences in April, she gets an additional $10 for each week. That's $10 * 4 weeks = $40. Adding this to her total earnings, we get:

Total earnings = $270 + $40 = $310

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Jason's earnings from his chores.

Jason earned $3.00 for doing his laundry, which he did once. He also cleaned his room once, which earned him $1.50. For taking the trash out, he did it twice, so that's 2 * $0.75 = $1.50. Lastly, he emptied the dishwasher 6 times, which is 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

Now, let's add up all his earnings: $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning his room) + $1.50 (taking the trash out) + $3.00 (emptying the dishwasher) = $9.00.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's dive into the problem. We know that each whale has 40 gallons of blood, and a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. To find the amount of blood in one shark, we multiply the amount of blood in a whale by 3: 40 * 3 = 120 gallons.

Now, we need to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks. We multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks: 120 * 10 = 1200.

Finally, three times the number of people who entered in the morning come in, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people who entered the restaurant:
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (twice the 10:00 group) + 150 (three times the morning group) = 320

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 red pens.

Now, she bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. That means she bought 2 * 5 packs = 10 packs of black pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of black pens is 10 packs * 5 pens per pack = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

"Let's break down the problem. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle.

Now, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which means he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac. The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch per bottle. To find the cost of cognac per bottle, we calculate 50% of $60, which is $30. So, the cost of cognac per bottle is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 × $90 = $1800. To find the total cost of everything, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many trees Mr. Julius planted on the first day. We know he planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, that's 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, on the first day, he planted a total of 20 + 40 = 60 trees.

Now, let's move on to the second day. Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. For Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than he did on the first day. That's 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, on the second day, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees. The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80.

To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days, we add the trees planted on both days: 60 + 80 = 140.

"What's up guys, it's Kai here. So, let's break down this root beer situation. Fred initially made 24 gallons, but things didn't quite go as planned.

First, his kids got to it and drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons. Then, his wife Barbie spilled 7 gallons, which brings it down to 20 - 7 = 13 gallons. And if that wasn't enough, his friend Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

Now, it's party time, and there are 3 guests, plus Fred, making a total of 4 people. To find out how much root beer each person can have, we divide the remaining amount by the number of people:

8 gallons / 4 people = 2 gallons per person.

"Let's break down the problem. We're told that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40. To represent this mathematically, we can use 'x' to denote the number of coffee mugs. The equation would be:

4x + 8 = 40

Now, let's solve for 'x'. First, we'll subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we'll divide both sides by 4:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"Hey there, let's dive into the problem. We've got 66 fish in the tank, and we need to figure out how many have red stripes and blue stripes.

First, we know that one-third of the fish have red stripes. To find that number, we'll divide 66 by 3. That gives us 22 fish with red stripes.

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. We're told that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. To find the remaining fish, we'll subtract the fish with red stripes from the total: 66 - 22 = 44.

Next, we'll calculate 5/11 of 44. To do that, we'll multiply 44 by 5 and then divide by 11. That gives us 20 fish with blue stripes.

Finally, we'll add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes to get our answer. That's 22 + 20 = 42.

"Let's break down Amy's eyeshadow collection. She had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 colors. She also had three makeup sets with six colors each, which is 3 * 6 = 18 colors.

Her sister swiped one of the palettes, leaving Amy with 8 - 4 = 4 colors from the palettes. The makeup sets are still intact at this point, so she still has 18 colors from those.

Now, Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each set has 6 colors, she used 6 / 2 = 3 colors. So, she's left with 18 - 3 = 15 colors from the makeup sets.

Adding the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets, Amy has 4 + 15 = 19 colors.

Next, we're told the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, which means it's 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house. That gives us 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Team Alphas found 40% of the shells, and team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells. We need to find out how many shells team Gogetters found.

First, let's calculate the number of shells team Alphas found:
40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells

Now, let's find the remaining shells after team Alphas found their share:
700 - 280 = 420 shells

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:
60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells

Now, let's find the remaining shells after team The finders found their share:
420 - 252 = 168 shells

Now, let's add up the miles the first three dogs need: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the miles the first three dogs need from the total miles: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

So, John gets a loan of $100,000. He uses 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. Let's calculate 60% of $100,000.

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much water the dehumidifier removes on each setting. The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. The medium setting removes twice as much as the low setting, so that's 2 liters per day. The high setting removes twice as much as the medium setting, which is 4 liters per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water removed on each setting. Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, so that's 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters. Then, he ran it for 3 days on the medium setting, which is 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters. Finally, he ran it for 5 days on the high setting, which is 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

To find the total amount of water removed, we add up the amounts from each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

Now, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali's school (120 students) to the capacity of John's school (30 students). 

The combined capacity of both schools is 120 + 30 = 150 students.

"What's up, I'm Kai. Let's break down this jelly bean problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total volume of the jar. The jar has a square base, so we multiply the length of the base by itself to get the area, which is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. Then, we multiply the base area by the height to get the volume, which is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, we need to find 80% of the total volume to get the actual volume of jelly beans. This is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we know that a single jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. To find the total number of jelly beans, we divide the actual volume of jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean: 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

The problem states that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the estimated number of red jelly beans: 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

We're told that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off the guess was, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 864 = 36.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop get on the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, the total number of people after the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90.

Now, at the third stop, the number of passengers doubles. This means the total number of people after the third stop is 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x. We know the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. This gives us the equation: x + 4x = 40.

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

"Let's break this down step by step. We know Samantha has 27 paintings, and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. To find out how many paintings Shelley has, we add 12 to Samantha's total: 27 + 12 = 39.

Now, we know Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim. So, to find out how many paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from Shelley's total: 39 - 8 = 31.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the price of the toy after the 80% increase in December. To do this, we'll calculate 80% of the initial price and add it to the initial price.

Initial price in November: $40
Increase in December: 80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
Price in December: $40 + $32 = $72

Next, we need to find the price of the toy after the 50% decrease in January. To do this, we'll calculate 50% of the price in December and subtract it from the price in December.

Decrease in January: 50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36
Price in January: $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Charlie's earnings for the day. He's got a standard fee of $80 per hour for lessons, but he gives a 25% discount to veterans.

For the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate, Charlie earns:
4 x $80 = $320

Now, let's calculate the discounted rate for the veteran lessons. A 25% discount means he earns 75% of his standard rate, which is:
$80 x 0.75 = $60 per hour
For the 2 1-hour lessons with the veteran, Charlie earns:
2 x $60 = $120

Adding these amounts together, Charlie's total earnings for the day are:
$320 + $120 = $440

"Hey there, I'm Kai. To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her scores and divide by the total number of quizzes.

Let's add up her scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

Total score: 630

There are 9 quizzes. To find the mean, we divide the total score by the number of quizzes:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Eve started with 20 pieces of pomelos and ended up with 1/4 of that amount. To find out how many she was left with, we multiply 20 by 1/4 (or 0.25):
20 * 0.25 = 5

So, Eve has 5 pomelos left. Now, to find out how many she gave away, we subtract the remaining amount from the original amount:
20 - 5 = 15

"Hey there, let's break down the problem step by step.

Walter initially bought 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples. So, he had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

Next, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples, which is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples. So, he had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Walter then sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple: 27 * 3 = 81 dollars.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and that's 3/4 of the number of novels she's written this year. To find the total number of novels she's written this year, we need to figure out what number 9 is 3/4 of.

Think of it like this: if 9 is 3/4 of the total, then the total is 9 divided by 3/4. To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. So, we multiply 9 by 4/3.

9 * (4/3) = 12

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many hours Michael traveled. Since he traveled for 3 days, and there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours as follows:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we know Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. To find the distance he covered, we multiply his speed by the total hours he traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of this distance that Michael covered, we'll divide the distance he covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as her to make a full glass of juice. So, her brother used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

Now, we know their mom used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. That's a total of 4 * 12 = 48 grapes used by their mom.

To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to add up the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mom. That's 6 (Madeline) + 30 (her brother) + 48 (their mom) = 84 grapes.

The answer is: 84"
"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We know that 13 out of 82 teachers at Rydell Elementary School were sick. To find the number of teachers who were actually at school, we subtract the sick teachers from the total number of teachers. Then, we add the 9 substitute teachers who were called in to help.

So, the calculation would be: 82 (total teachers) - 13 (sick teachers) + 9 (substitute teachers) = 78.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Bud spends $1.00 on pasta, $3.00 on cheddar cheese, and twice that amount, which is $6.00, on gruyere cheese. To find the total cost per week, we add these amounts together: $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we multiply the total cost per week by the number of weeks in a year, which is 52. So, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total time spent cleaning all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time per classroom:
80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

The custodian has 5 days to complete the task, so we divide the total time by 5:
1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes per day

Now, let's convert the custodian's 8-hour workday to minutes:
8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we divide the daily cleaning time by the total daily time and multiply by 100:
(240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's figure out how many bookcases Elly needs to hold all her books.

First, we need to determine the total number of books one bookcase can hold. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so that's 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which is 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so that's 20 - 5 = 15 books.

In total, one bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Now, let's divide the total number of books Elly has (110) by the number of books one bookcase can hold (55). 

110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

Now, she's selling the eggs for $1 for every 3 eggs. So, she'll sell 60 / 3 = 20 sets of eggs. Her total revenue will be 20 x $1 = $20.

To find her profit, we subtract her total cost from her total revenue: $20 - $12 = $8.

Now, we're left with 100 - 50 = 50 hats that are not red.

Out of these 50 hats, 3/5 are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply 50 by 3/5, which gives us 30 blue hats.

The remaining hats are white. So, we subtract the number of blue hats from the non-red hats: 50 - 30 = 20.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Archie buys a bag of beef jerky with 30 sticks, and it originally costs $18.00. However, he gets a $3.00 discount. To find the cost per stick, we first need to calculate the total cost after the discount.

Total cost after discount = Original cost - Discount
Total cost after discount = $18.00 - $3.00
Total cost after discount = $15.00

Now, we convert the total cost to cents, since we want the cost per stick in cents.
$15.00 = 1500 cents

Next, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.
Cost per stick = Total cost in cents / Number of sticks
Cost per stick = 1500 cents / 30 sticks
Cost per stick = 50 cents

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Audrey's situation. She needs to pass two math tests to move on to the 7th grade, and she must get 70% of the total questions correct.

First, we need to find out how many questions she got right on the first test. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct. To find 60% of 70, we multiply 0.6 by 70, which gives us 42 questions.

Now, let's look at the total number of questions. The first test has 70 questions, and the second test has 40 questions, making a total of 110 questions. To pass, Audrey needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct. We find 70% of 110 by multiplying 0.7 by 110, which gives us 77 questions.

Since Audrey already got 42 questions correct on the first test, we subtract that from the total number of questions she needs to get right: 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Mary's making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them, and we need to figure out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

We know she makes some strawberry cubes, and the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If we let 's' be the number of strawberry cubes and 'b' be the number of blueberry cubes, we can write an equation: b = 5s - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write another equation: s + b = 116.

Now, let's substitute the expression for 'b' into the second equation: s + (5s - 4) = 116. This simplifies to 6s - 4 = 116.

Adding 4 to both sides gives us 6s = 120. Dividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20.

Now that we know 's', we can find 'b': b = 5s - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

Now, for every 25 telephone calls he makes, 1 customer comes into the dealership. To get 30 customers, we can multiply 30 by 25, since that's how many calls it takes to get one customer. So, Jason needs to make 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Now, let's talk candles. Half the rooms get 4 small candles each, and the other half get 5 medium candles each. Since there are 8 rooms, half of that is 4. So, 4 rooms get 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 candles. The other 4 rooms get 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 candles. Adding those together, we get 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Now, let's add the total number of flashlights and candles to get the final answer.

First, we need to find the total number of chips. Since Mitchell bought 2 bags with 55 chips each, we multiply 2 by 55.

Total number of chips = 2 * 55 = 110

Now, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members to find out how many chips each person gets.

Number of family members = 5

Chips per person = Total number of chips / Number of family members
Chips per person = 110 / 5
Chips per person = 22

Now, we know the number of robots is half the number of helmets. To find the number of robots, we divide the number of helmets by 2.

Number of robots = 20 / 2

On land, Phineas cruises at 20 yards per minute. To find out how long it takes him to cover 100 yards, we divide the distance by his speed: 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

In the water, Phineas swims at 10 yards per minute. Same deal – we divide the distance by his speed: 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

In the second year, the boat depreciated by another 30%. This time, we need to find 30% of the new value, which is $6300. So, the depreciation is 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. This means the boat's value after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

Finally, in the third year, the boat depreciated by 20%. We need to find 20% of the new value, which is $4410. So, the depreciation is 0.2 * $4410 = $882. This means the boat's value after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

"What's up, I'm Kai. Let's break down this Starbursts problem. We've got a big bag with 232 pieces of candy, and we know the number of red, orange, and yellow candies. There are 54 red ones, twice that amount of orange ones, which is 54 * 2 = 108, and half as many yellow ones as red ones, which is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract this total from the total number of candies in the bag: 232 - 189 = 43.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down Helen's trip expenses. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of her hotel stay. She booked a hotel for 3 nights at $80 per night, so that's 3 * $80 = $240.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of her bus rides. Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8. Since she rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus rides is 7 * $8 = $56.

Now, let's add the cost of the hotel stay and the bus rides to get the total cost of her trip. $240 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $296.

"Hey there, let's break this down. We know Mazie started with 52 marbles and gave them to the twins, Dallas and Darla. We also know Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4 in the playground. 

To figure out how many marbles Dallas had initially, we need to add the 4 marbles he dropped to the 21 he has now. That's 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Now, since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas got 25, we can find out how many marbles Darla got by subtracting 25 from 52. That's 52 - 25 = 27.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. We've got a family of three going to the cinema - two adults and one child. The adult tickets cost $12 each, and the child ticket costs $8. So, the total cost for the tickets is 2 * $12 + $8, which equals $24 + $8, giving us $32.

Next, they buy 2 popcorns for $3 each, so that's 2 * $3, which is $6.

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns together: $32 + $6 = $38.

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total weight of the car, including the luggage and the two children. The car itself weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children weigh 75 pounds each. So, the total weight of the children is 2 * 75 = 150 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights: 1200 (car) + 250 (luggage) + 150 (children) = 1600 pounds.

The problem states that the force to move the car is 1% of the weight. To find 1% of the total weight, we multiply 1600 by 0.01.

1600 * 0.01 = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds.

The final answer is: 16"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. To figure out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of his rectangular backyard fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).

Given the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2(35)
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper.

"I'd be happy to help you out. So, we know Mia is 40 years old and she's 16 years younger than Emma. To find Emma's age, we just add 16 to Mia's age, which gives us 40 + 16 = 56 years old for Emma.

Now, to find the average of their ages, we add their ages together and divide by 2. So, (40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48.

"Hey, I'd be happy to help Avery with her holiday dinner expenses. To figure out how much she'll spend on place settings, we need to calculate the cost of one setting and then multiply it by the number of guests.

One 3-piece setting consists of a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl. The dinner plates cost $6.00 each, the bowls cost $5.00 each, and the salad plates cost $4.00 each. So, the total cost of one setting is:
$6.00 (dinner plate) + $4.00 (salad plate) + $5.00 (bowl) = $15.00

Since Avery is having 12 people over for dinner, she needs 12 settings. To find the total cost, we multiply the cost of one setting by the number of guests:
12 settings * $15.00 per setting = $180.00

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Dexter has five pigs, and each one eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day. So, the daily feed consumption for one pig is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total daily feed consumption for all the pigs is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total feed consumption for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the total feed consumption from the total amount ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"Hey there, let's break down the hot dog situation for John's birthday party. We know he's invited 20 people, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs required is 20 * 2 = 40.

John already has 4 hot dogs leftover from a previous party, which means he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of packs he needs to buy: 36 / 6 = 6 packs.

Now, let's talk about the cost. Each pack costs $2, so the total cost will be 6 * $2 = $12.

Frances sold 20 cupcakes for $2 each, so she made 20 * $2 = $40 from cupcakes. She also sold 40 cookies at $1 each, which adds another $40 to her total. So, her total earnings are $40 + $40 = $80.

On the other hand, Frances bought 5 trays at $4 each, which cost her 5 * $4 = $20.

Now, let's subtract her expenses from her earnings to find out how much money she has left: $80 - $20 = $60.

First, let's calculate the total meals she gave out: 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals.

Now, let's subtract the total meals given out from the total meals she had: 1,360 - 142 = 1,218.

"Hey there, let's break down Charisma's meditation and yoga practice routine. 

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes, twice a day. That's 30 minutes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, she meditates for 30 * 7 = 210 minutes per week. In 4 weeks, that's 210 * 4 = 840 minutes.

She also practices 1 hour of yoga, 5 days a week. That's 60 * 5 = 300 minutes per week. In 4 weeks, that's 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

"Hey, I'd be happy to help Octavia figure out the size of her quilt. To do that, we need to calculate the total square feet of fabric from each type of shirt and add them together.

First, let's start with the small shirts. Since each small shirt is 3 square feet of fabric, and Octavia is using 11 of them, that's 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.

Next, we have the medium shirts. Each medium shirt is 4 square feet, and she's using 8 of them, so that's 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.

Lastly, we have the large shirts. Each large shirt is 6 square feet, and she's using 6 of them, so that's 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

Now, let's add all those up: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

Now, we know Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so we subtract 2 inches from Anne's height to find Jackie's current height. Jackie's current height is 72 - 2 = 70 inches.

Since Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, we need to subtract 3 inches from her current height to find her height before summer. Jackie's height before summer is 70 - 3 = 67 inches.

5000 bars/day * 7 days/week = 35000 bars/week

Now, let's multiply that by 2 to get the total number of bars produced in two weeks:
35000 bars/week * 2 weeks = 70000 bars

For the T-shirts, Jake pays full price for the first one, which is $8, and 50% off for the second one. That 50% off is half of $8, so it's $4. Adding those together, the T-shirts cost $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, Jake buys a pair of shoes that are 40% off the original price of $40. To find the discount, we calculate 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16. So, the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends. That's $12 + $24 = $36.

First, I'll calculate the cost of making one jar. The passion fruit costs 2 * $6 = $12, the jackfruit costs 1.5 * $8 = $12, and the honey costs 2 * $10 = $20. So, the total cost per jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of making 10 jars. That's $44 * 10 = $440.

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is $50 * 10 = $500.

Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can determine that Aaron ran half that distance, which is 2 miles.

Now, we're told that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, it would take Vanessa twice as long to run the same distance. So, if Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, Vanessa would take 16 * 2 = 32 minutes to run 2 miles.

To find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles, we simply multiply the time it took her to run 2 miles by 2, since she ran twice the distance. Therefore, Vanessa took 32 * 2 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

Now, we know the vendor sold the watermelons at a 25% profit. To find the profit amount per watermelon, we'll calculate 25% of the cost price.

Profit amount per watermelon = 25% of $1.60 = 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40

Finally, we'll add the profit amount to the cost price to find the selling price per watermelon.

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit amount per watermelon
= $1.60 + $0.40
= $2.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. To find her current age, we subtract 3 from 12, which gives us 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, we multiply Dora's age by 2 to find James' age. So, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

Now, we know that John was 19 years old when James was born. This means that the age difference between John and James is 19 years. To find John's current age, we add James' age to the age difference: 18 + 19 = 37 years.

Next, we're told that John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. To find the age difference between John and his youngest son, we subtract 32 from John's current age: 37 - 32 = 5 years.

This means that John's youngest son is currently 5 years old. To find his age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 5 + 3 = 8 years.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. We've got Ana and Jane peeling oranges, and we want to know how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour.

First, we need to figure out how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour. Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange, so in 60 minutes, she can peel:
60 / 3 = 20 oranges

Jane, on the other hand, takes 4 minutes to peel an orange, so in 60 minutes, she can peel:
60 / 4 = 15 oranges

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5

"Hey, I'm Kai. So, let's break down the problem. Mark needs a new radiator, and he finds one at a junk shop for 80% off the original price of $400. To find the cost of the radiator, we need to calculate 20% of $400, since 100% - 80% = 20%.

20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

So, the radiator costs $80. Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install it, and the mechanic charges $50 per hour for 3 hours.

$50 * 3 = $150

Now, let's add the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's labor to find the total cost.

$80 + $150 = $230

"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they're either chickens or cows. We also know that the total number of legs is 70. 

Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. Let's use 'c' to represent the number of chickens and 'w' to represent the number of cows. We can set up two equations based on the information we have.

First, the total number of animals is 20, so we can write:

c + w = 20

Next, the total number of legs is 70, so we can write:

2c + 4w = 70

To make things easier, let's simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:

c + 2w = 35

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to get:

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

Now that we know there are 15 cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'w' into the first equation:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"Hey there, I'm Kai. Let's break down the problem. Henry and his 3 friends have 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. To find out how many slices they have in total, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza: 7 * 8 = 56 slices.

Now, since there are 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends) and they want to share the slices equally, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 / 4 = 14.

Answer: 14"
