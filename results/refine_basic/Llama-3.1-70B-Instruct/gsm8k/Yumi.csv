"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Janet's daily egg sales.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 for breakfast and 4 for baking muffins, so that's a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs used. To find out how many eggs she sells, we subtract the eggs used from the total eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Since Janet sells each egg for $2, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem. A robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber, and it needs half that amount of white fiber. To find the amount of white fiber, we'll divide the amount of blue fiber by 2. So, 2 bolts of blue fiber divided by 2 is 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, let's add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts. 

The final answer is: 3"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Josh's house flipping adventure.

First, we need to calculate the total cost Josh incurred. He bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs, so the total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% + 150%). To find the new value, we multiply the original value by 2.5. So, the new value is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

Now, let's calculate the profit. The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down James' running routine to find out how many meters he runs in a week.

James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week. So, the total number of sprints he runs in a week is 3 * 3 = 9 sprints.

Since each sprint is 60 meters, we multiply the total number of sprints by the distance of each sprint: 9 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day. Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total cost of the glasses Kylar wants to buy.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the original price, we can find the cost of the second glass by multiplying $5 by 0.6. This gives us $3 for every second glass.

Now, let's pair the glasses: the first glass costs $5, and the second glass costs $3. The total cost for each pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, which is 8 pairs. To find the total cost, we multiply the cost of one pair ($8) by the number of pairs (8). 

8 * $8 = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together.

We know Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. That's a lot of sheep!

Now, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep. That's even more sheep!

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Carla's file download situation.

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before Windows forces a restart. To find out how much she downloaded, we calculate 40% of 200 GB, which is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla's download speed is 2 GB per minute, it takes her 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to download 80 GB.

After the restart, which takes 20 minutes, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. So, she downloads the entire 200 GB file. At 2 GB per minute, the complete download takes 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the initial download time, the restart time, and the complete download time: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down John's journey to find out how far he is from home.

First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply his speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Now, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move.

After the traffic, he drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he travels in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

For the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), John drives at 80 mph. The distance he travels in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance John travels in the 4 hours after turning around is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Since John was trying to get back home, we subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the distance he traveled before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Eliza's earnings for the week.

Eliza earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week. For this week, she worked 45 hours, so we'll calculate her regular pay and overtime pay separately.

Her regular pay is 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

Since she worked 5 hours more than the regular 40 hours, we'll calculate her overtime pay. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. So, her overtime pay is 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

Now, let's add her regular pay and overtime pay to find her total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the program had 60 downloads in the first month. 

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. So, we multiply 60 by 3 to get 180 downloads.

Now, for the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

To find the total number of downloads, we add the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total cost of the pastries Toula bought.

First, we have 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen, so that's 3 x $68 = $204. Then, there are 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen, which is 2 x $80 = $160. Lastly, we have 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen, so that's 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add all these costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carlos is planting a lemon tree that costs $90 to plant. Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. However, it costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree.

To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) plus the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree ($3 per year). The total revenue is the annual revenue from selling lemons (7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year).

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.5
Year 2: Total cost = $93 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $96, Total revenue = $10.5 * 2 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $99, Total revenue = $10.5 * 3 = $31.5
Year 4: Total cost = $99 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $102, Total revenue = $10.5 * 4 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $105, Total revenue = $10.5 * 5 = $52.5
Year 6: Total cost = $105 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $108, Total revenue = $10.5 * 6 = $63

Since the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108) in year 6, we need to calculate for more years.

Year 7: Total cost = $108 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $111, Total revenue = $10.5 * 7 = $73.5
Year 8: Total cost = $111 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $114, Total revenue = $10.5 * 8 = $84
Year 9: Total cost = $114 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $117, Total revenue = $10.5 * 9 = $94.5
Year 10: Total cost = $117 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $120, Total revenue = $10.5 * 10 = $105
Year 11: Total cost = $120 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $123, Total revenue = $10.5 * 11 = $115.5
Year 12: Total cost = $123 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $126, Total revenue = $10.5 * 12 = $126

However, in year 12, the total revenue ($126) is still not more than the total cost ($126). We need to calculate for year 13.

Year 13: Total cost = $126 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $129, Total revenue = $10.5 * 13 = $136.5

In year 13, the total revenue ($136.5) is more than the total cost ($129). Therefore, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie starts with an unknown number of vacuum cleaners, which we'll call 'x'. She sells a third of them at the green house, which is x/3. Then, she sells 2 more to the red house. To find out how many vacuum cleaners are left after these two sales, we subtract the number sold from the total: x - x/3 - 2.

To simplify this, we can rewrite x as 3x/3, so we have 3x/3 - x/3 - 2, which equals 2x/3 - 2.

Next, Melanie sells half of what's left at the orange house. To find out how many vacuum cleaners are left after this sale, we divide the remaining number by 2: (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1.

We know Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:
x/3 - 1 = 5

To solve for x, we add 1 to both sides:
x/3 = 6

Then we multiply both sides by 3:
x = 18

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we have 20 students in the dance class. 20% of them enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

Now, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left. 25% of these remaining students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

So, the number of students left for hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100. 

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the merchant's options to determine the best choice for maximizing profit.

The merchant has two options: purchasing jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000. The expected increase in value for the jewelry is 2.5%, while the electronic gadgets are expected to rise by 1.2%.

To calculate the potential profit from each option, we'll multiply the initial value by the expected increase.

For the jewelry: $5,000 * 2.5% = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125
For the electronic gadgets: $8,000 * 1.2% = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, the best option is the jewelry, with a profit of $125.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have two trains that start at the same point, San Rafael, and travel westward for 80 miles on the first day. The direction doesn't affect the distance, so each train covers 80 miles.

The next day, they change direction and travel northward, covering 150 miles. Again, the direction doesn't matter, so each train covers 150 miles.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distance covered on the first day to the distance covered on the second day.

Total distance covered by each train: 80 + 150 = 230 miles

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Jill's annual salary.

First, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching. She earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. She earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks.

First, we need to find out how many days are in 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, so she eats 3 eggs per day. To find the total number of eggs she'll eat in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of days by the number of eggs she eats per day: 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Now, let's convert the total number of eggs to dozens. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12: 84 / 12 = 7.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Marissa's hiking problem.

Marissa wants to hike a 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour. To find the total time she has to complete the trail, we can divide the total distance by her desired average speed.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. She has 6 miles left to walk. To find the time left, we subtract the time already taken from the total time.

Time left = Total time - Time already taken
Time left = 3 hours - 2 hours
Time left = 1 hour

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink. Since we spilled 1 liter, we're left with 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink. The amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink. We have 15 liters of pineapple drink, and the amount of water in it is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at which son was born
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

We know that Kyle bought the book for $19.50, which is 25% off the original price. To find the original price, we need to figure out what 100% of the price is.

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, he paid 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). We can set up an equation to represent this:

0.75x = 19.50

Here, 'x' is the original price of the book. To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Marie's order to figure out how many boxes of pizza she bought.

First, we know the chicken meal costs $12. Then, there are 5 packs of milk at $3 each, so that's 5 * $3 = $15. She also got 4 apples at $1.50 each, which is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Adding these up, we get $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. This is the total cost of everything except the pizza.

Since Marie paid $50 in total, we subtract $33 from that to find the cost of the pizza: $50 - $33 = $17.

Now, we know each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie bought, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost per box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Gunter's friends have given their guesses for the number of jelly beans in the jar. The first friend thinks there are 80 jelly beans.

The second friend thinks there are 20 more than half the first friend's guess. To find this, we need to calculate half of 80, which is 40. Then, we add 20 to get 60.

The third friend thinks there are 25% more than the first friend's guess. To find 25% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.25, which gives us 20. Then, we add 20 to 80 to get 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the sum by the number of guesses, which is 3. So, the average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. To find the number of gold coins, we can start by using a variable to represent the number of silver coins. Let's call it 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

John sold his lego sets for $15 each and bought video games for $20 each, with $5 left over. To figure out how many lego sets he still has, we need to find out how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John made some money from selling his lego sets, but we don't know how many he sold. Let's call the number of lego sets he sold ""x"". Since he sold x lego sets for $15 each, he made 15x dollars.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160 on video games.

We know that the total amount he made from selling his lego sets minus the amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal zero. We can set up an equation:

15x - 160 - 5 = 0

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15x - 165 = 0

Adding 165 to both sides, we get:

15x = 165

Dividing both sides by 15, we get:

x = 11

So John sold 11 lego sets. He had 13 lego sets initially, so the number of lego sets he still has is:

13 - 11 = 2

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem to find John's running speed.

We know John runs 60 miles a week and runs 3 days a week. His running time is 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, his running time for the other two days is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each.

Now, let's calculate the total time John runs in a week:
Total time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day)
Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5
Total time = 6 hours

To find John's running speed, we'll divide the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. This means her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Now, since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she can travel in 2 hours while running is 2 * 6 = 12 miles.
The distance she can travel in 4 hours while walking is 4 * 1.5 = 6 miles.

The total distance she can travel in 6 hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

We know Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's. So, Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Now, since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age by multiplying Ben's iPhone age by 4. That's 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"Hello there, friend. I'm Yumi, and I'm here to help you solve this delightful problem. Let's dive right in, shall we?

We know that Polly can throw the gold javelin a distance of 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone. However, when she holds the gemstone, her throwing distance triples. To find the new distance, we multiply 400 by 3, which gives us 1200 feet.

Now, we need to determine how far outside the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the beast. The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet, so we subtract this from Polly's new throwing distance: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many grams of chips you can eat.

First, we need to find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. You have 2000 calories as your target and you have already consumed 1800 calories. That leaves you with 200 calories.

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories. To do that, we'll divide 200 by 250, which gives us 0.8 servings.

Now, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings. To find out how many grams 0.8 servings is, we'll first find out how many grams are in one serving. We'll divide 300g by 5 servings, which gives us 60g per serving. Then, we'll multiply 60g by 0.8, which gives us 48g.

The answer is: 48"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Charlie's candle-making business to find his net profit.

Charlie makes 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, and he needs to make 20 candles. To find out how many pounds of beeswax he needs, we divide the number of candles by the number of candles per pound: 20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds.

The cost of one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00, so for 2 pounds, it's 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so for 20 candles, he makes 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Meredith's writing schedule for the week.

Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find out how many more articles she wrote, we'll calculate 2/5 of 5, which is (2/5) * 5 = 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. Then, she bought a package of Post-it notes, which we'll call x. So, the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package is 80 + x.

At work, she used 220 Post-it notes, leaving her with (80 + x) - 220 Post-it notes. We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, so we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Now, let's solve for x:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we divide the total amount spent by the cost of each tie: 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he must have bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

Now, we're told that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. To find the cost of a red tie, we calculate 50% of the cost of a blue tie and add it to the original cost: 40 + (0.5 * 40) = 40 + 20 = $60 per red tie.

The total amount spent on red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

Finally, to find the total amount spent on ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

Tracy has a 4-foot wire that she wants to cut into 6-inch pieces. To find out how many pieces she'll get, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches).

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

So, Tracy will get 8 pieces of wire.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to first calculate the total number of units. Since there are 15 floors with 8 units each, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor.

Total number of units = 15 * 8
Total number of units = 120

Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4.

Number of occupied units = 120 * (3/4)
Number of occupied units = 90

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.

Number of unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Number of unoccupied units = 30

252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozen eggs per day

Now, let's calculate Lloyd's daily earnings. He sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so we'll multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:
21 dozen eggs per day * $2 per dozen = $42 per day

To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we'll multiply his daily earnings by 7:
$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now that we know the distance, we can find the time it takes him to get back at a rate of 6 mph.

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. He has comic books that weigh 1/4 pound each and toys that weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove.

First, let's calculate the weight of the comic books he removed. 30 comic books at 1/4 pound each is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds of toys.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so the number of toys he needs to remove is 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. To find the total revenue for Thursday, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately.

The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.

Now, let's compare the revenue for both days. Thursday's revenue is $520, and Friday's revenue is $480. Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue.

To find the difference in revenue, we subtract Friday's revenue from Thursday's revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

We know Sophia's car has a 12-gallon tank, and she recently drove 100 miles before needing to fill up with 4 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) first.

To do this, we'll divide the distance she traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used (4 gallons).

mpg = Total miles / Total gallons used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know Sophia's car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can multiply this by the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons) to find the total miles she can drive on a single tank.

180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

After the first 180 days, the puppy will need 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of the year. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day for:
365 days - 180 days = 185 days

Now, let's calculate the total amount of dog food consumed during this period:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

To find the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year, we add the amounts from both periods:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can find the number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year by dividing the total amount of dog food by the amount per bag:

To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package. For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.833 per flower. For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower.

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.833 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price: 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages, and 9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the other price, the cost would be: 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages, and 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is $15 - $9 = $6.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the cost of the dog grooming after the discount.

The original price is $100, and the groomer is offering a 30% discount for new customers. To find the discount amount, I'll multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

Discount amount = 30% of $100 = 0.3 * $100 = $30

Now, I'll subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price.

Discounted price = $100 - $30 = $70

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We have 24 liters of water, and two girls each got 1/6 of it. To find out how much water each girl got, we need to divide 24 by 6, which is 4 liters per girl. Since there are two girls, they got a total of 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

Now, a boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken is 8 (girls) + 6 (boy) = 14 liters.

To find out how much water is left, we subtract the total amount of water taken from the initial amount: 24 - 14 = 10 liters.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many stickers Charlie has left.

First, we need to calculate the total number of stickers Charlie had. He started with 10 stickers, bought 21 more, and got 23 for his birthday. So, the total number of stickers he had is:
10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers

Then, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 to decorate a greeting card. So, the total number of stickers he gave away and used is:
9 + 28 = 37 stickers

Now, let's subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used from the total number of stickers he had:
54 - 37 = 17 stickers

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

First, we need to find Alex's weight. We know Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Since Grace weighs 125 pounds, we can calculate Alex's weight as follows:

4 times Grace's weight is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds.
Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, we add their weights together to find their combined weight:
125 (Grace's weight) + 498 (Alex's weight) = 623 pounds.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total number of thorns on Dan's rose bushes.

First, we need to find the total number of roses. Since Dan has 3 rose bushes, and each bush has 25 roses, we multiply the number of bushes by the number of roses per bush.

Total roses = 3 * 25
Total roses = 75

Now, we know that each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose.

Total thorns = 75 * 8
Total thorns = 600

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem. The football team played a total of 22 games. We know they won 8 more games than they lost. To solve this, I'll use a simple equation.

Let's say the number of games they lost is 'x'. Then, the number of games they won is 'x + 8'. Since the total number of games is 22, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

So, the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is:
7 + 8 = 15

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many quilt blocks Gene has.

Gene has been going on vacations since he was 23 years old, and now he's 34. To find out how many years he's been vacationing, we subtract his age when he started from his current age: 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations a year, we multiply the number of years by the number of vacations per year: 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Each vacation corresponds to one quilt block, so Gene has a total of 44 quilt blocks.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The alarm rings three times a day, and we need to find the total number of times it rang today. 

The first time it rang, it rang 4 times. The second time, it rang three times as long as the first time, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 times. The third time, it rang half as long as the second time, which is 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. After 5 years, the company increases her salary by 10% of the initial salary. To find the increase, we multiply the initial salary by 0.10.

$600 * 0.10 = $60

Now, we add the increase to the initial salary to find Sylvie's new monthly salary.

$600 + $60 = $660

Since Sylvie's salary increase is only given once after 5 years, her monthly salary will remain $660 for the next three years. To find her annual salary, we multiply the monthly salary by 12.

$660 * 12 = $7920

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $7920."
"Let's break down the problem. We know Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x', then Marilyn sold 10x copies.

Since they sold 88,000 copies combined, we can set up the equation:
x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many guests will actually show up to the party. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of guests that will show up as follows:

Number of guests that will show up = Total number of guests - (1/4 * Total number of guests)
= 16 - (1/4 * 16)
= 16 - 4
= 12

Now, we know Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest. To find the total number of gift bags she needs, we multiply the number of guests that will show up by 0.75:

Total gift bags = 0.75 * Number of guests that will show up
= 0.75 * 12
= 9

Finally, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of gift bags by the cost per gift bag, which is $2:

Total cost = Total gift bags * Cost per gift bag
= 9 * 2

Now, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults and children. There are 20 adults, so they will eat 20 * 10 = 200 lbs of potato salad. There are 5 children, so they will eat 5 * 5 = 25 lbs of potato salad.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

"Let's figure out how many pets Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have in total.

We know Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Now, Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, which means Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

Now, we also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. That makes Amy 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. To find Jackson's age, we subtract 5 from Amy's age: 9 - 5 = 4.

Jackson is 4 years old."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he's 2 seconds faster than Gerald's original time. So, to find Gerald's original time, we add 2 seconds to Lee's time.

Gerald's original time = Lee's time + 2 seconds
Gerald's original time = 38 + 2
Gerald's original time = 40 seconds

Now, Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means his new time will be 90% of his original time. To find 90% of his original time, we multiply by 0.9.

Gerald's new time = 0.9 * Gerald's original time
Gerald's new time = 0.9 * 40
Gerald's new time = 36 seconds

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We also know that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60.

First, let's find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, we multiply the number of dogs by 2: 60 * 2 = 120 cats.

Now, we add the number of dogs and cats to find the combined total: 60 + 120 = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined total, so we subtract 12: 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Finally, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood: 168 + 60 + 120 = 348.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 200 Grade 5 students in total, and 2/5 of them are boys. To find the number of boys, we multiply 200 by 2/5.

Number of boys = 200 * (2/5) = 80

Now, let's find the number of girls. Since the total number of students is 200, and 80 are boys, the number of girls is:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys = 200 - 80 = 120

We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we multiply the number of girls by 2/3.

Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 * (2/3) = 80

Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

Now, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes are in 64 ounces. Each can is 16 ounces, so we divide 64 by 16 to get the number of cans: 64 / 16 = 4.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to get the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12.

The city is 42 miles across, so let's do the math:

Time to cover the whole city = (Distance across the city / Distance covered in 10 minutes) * 10 minutes

Now, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. Then, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. To find a third of 750, we can multiply 750 by 1/3, which gives us 250 pieces.

So, the total number of pieces placed is 250 (by Poppy) + 250 (by her mom) = 500 pieces.

Length (L) = 5 - 1 - 1 = 3 inches
Width (W) = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4 inches
Height (H) = 4 - 1 - 1 = 2 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions: 
Inner volume of each box = L * W * H = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

So, the total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Now, let's find out how many hours he watched on Wednesday. We subtract the hours watched on other days from the total hours: 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is 90 minutes. 

To find the number of 30-minute episodes, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes per episode: 90 / 30 = 3.

First, we need to find the total cost of the gas. The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = Price per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10

First, we need to find out how far Julia rowed to reach the shore. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can calculate her rowing speed.

Rowing speed = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second

Since the shore was 64 seconds away, we can multiply the time by the speed to find the total distance.

Total distance = Speed * Time = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. To find out how many 10-foot intervals Julia rowed, we can divide the total distance by 10.

Number of 10-foot intervals = Total distance / 10 = 80 feet / 10 = 8 intervals

First, we need to calculate the total cost price of the lumber. Sasha has 10 (2 x 4 x 10) boards that cost her $10 each, and 5 (4 x 4 x 10) boards that cost her $16 each.

Cost price of 10 (2 x 4 x 10) boards = 10 * $10 = $100
Cost price of 5 (4 x 4 x 10) boards = 5 * $16 = $80
Total cost price = $100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price.

Selling price of 10 (2 x 4 x 10) boards = 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150
Selling price of 5 (4 x 4 x 10) boards = 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120
Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270

Now, let's calculate the profit Sasha makes by subtracting the total cost price from the total selling price.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that on the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles from the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day. To find the number of vehicles imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles from the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4.

The number of containers imported on the second day is 4."
"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and it increased by 40% over the four years. To find his new salary, we can calculate:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, let's find Lylah's salary four years ago. We know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. So, we can set up the equation:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper. To find out how many sheets he uses in a week, we multiply the number of pads by the number of sheets per pad:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Sadie's sleep schedule for the week.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less, so that's 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. She did this for Tuesday and Wednesday, so that's 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week, which is Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she slept 1 hour more than those two days. That's 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. Since there are 4 days, that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours for the entire week: 8 hours for Monday, 12 hours for Tuesday and Wednesday, and 28 hours for the rest of the week. That's a total of 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Rosie's running distance into two parts. 

First, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. To find the distance she covers in the first 3 hours, we multiply her speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

After the first 3 hours, Rosie has 7 - 3 = 4 hours left. In these 4 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. To find the distance she covers in the next 4 hours, we multiply her speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances she covers in the two parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

12 - 5 = 7

However, we also know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. To find out how many spoons Julia had initially, we need to add those 3 spoons back in.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the price of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we're told that an orange costs $5 less than a watermelon. So, the price of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dillon needs to buy:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we add up the costs: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

First, we need to calculate the total time spent by the doctors in minutes. With 500 patients and an average of 24 minutes per patient, the total time is:
500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Now, let's convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital pays the doctors $150 per hour, so the total cost is:
200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

On the other hand, the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour. So, the total revenue is:
200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

Now, let's add their rides together: 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

We know his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total mileage for Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday:

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions. Again, we multiply the number of hours by the rate: 6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions.

Now, let's add the number of questions Mark completed in both tests: 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

The total number of questions in both tests is 75 + 100 = 175 questions.

To find the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we subtract the number of questions he completed from the total number of questions: 175 - 70 = 105 questions.

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, let's calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100

We have 700 bees in a hive, and we know the ratio of queens to baby bees to worker bees. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, and twice as many worker bees as baby bees.

Let's use variables to represent the number of each type of bee. We'll call the number of queens Q, the number of baby bees B, and the number of worker bees W.

Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, we can write B = 2Q. And since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, we can write W = 2B.

We also know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation Q + B + W = 700.

Now, let's substitute B = 2Q and W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q into the equation. This gives us Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms, and we get 7Q = 700. Divide by 7, and we find Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W. B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, and W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

To find the total expenses, we need to calculate the cost of supplies for all 8 clients. 
Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each, so the cost of bleach per client is 2 * $2 = $4. 
Each client also needs a pack of cloths at $5. 
The total cost per client is $4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9. 
For 8 clients, the total cost is 8 * $9 = $72.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time.

After that, a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's denote the original number of fries as x. The number of fries remaining after Dave and the seagull ate is x - 14 - 7 = x - 21. The pigeons ate 9 fries, so the number of fries remaining is x - 21 - 9 = x - 30.

The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, so the number of fries the raccoon stole is 2/3 * (x - 30). The remaining number of fries is 1/3 * (x - 30).

The ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, 1/3 * (x - 30) = 5 + 1 = 6.

Now, we can solve for x:

Kelly, on the other hand, runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each of these trips is 80 yards (40 yards each way). So, Kelly's total distance is 200 + (34 * 80) = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Now, let's compare their distances. Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards. To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate how much Raphael spent on school supplies.

First, we need to find the total cost of the pens. Since each pen costs $1.5 and he bought 4, the total cost of the pens is 4 x $1.5 = $6.

Next, we calculate the cost of the notebooks. Each notebook costs $4, and he bought 2, so the total cost of the notebooks is 2 x $4 = $8.

Lastly, we add the cost of the rim of bond paper, which is $20.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Finn starts with 11 tadpoles that he can see. Then, 6 more come out of hiding from under a lily pad, so we add those to the total: 11 + 6 = 17.

But then, 2 of them hide under a rock, so we subtract those from the total: 17 - 2 = 15.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

We know the tank's initial water depth on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, 7 more feet of water are added, so the depth on Tuesday becomes:
17 + 7 = 24 feet

Now, we're told that on Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find this, we'll multiply the depth on Tuesday by 2/3:
(2/3) * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16 feet

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"Ohayou, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so that's 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. And, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's count the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin. Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish. Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish. Adding them together, we get 19 + 13 = 32.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

We have a bag of marbles that costs $20 initially, and its price increases by 20% every 2 months. We need to find the cost of the bag after 36 months.

To solve this, we'll calculate the price increase every 2 months.

Initial price = $20
Price increase every 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

We'll apply this increase 18 times (36 months / 2 months per increase).

Let's calculate the price after each increase:

$20 * 1.20 = $24 (after 2 months)
$24 * 1.20 = $28.80 (after 4 months)
$28.80 * 1.20 = $34.56 (after 6 months)
$34.56 * 1.20 = $41.47 (after 8 months)
$41.47 * 1.20 = $49.76 (after 10 months)
$49.76 * 1.20 = $59.71 (after 12 months)
$59.71 * 1.20 = $71.65 (after 14 months)
$71.65 * 1.20 = $85.98 (after 16 months)
$85.98 * 1.20 = $103.18 (after 18 months)
$103.18 * 1.20 = $123.82 (after 20 months)
$123.82 * 1.20 = $148.58 (after 22 months)
$148.58 * 1.20 = $178.30 (after 24 months)
$178.30 * 1.20 = $213.96 (after 26 months)
$213.96 * 1.20 = $256.75 (after 28 months)
$256.75 * 1.20 = $308.10 (after 30 months)
$308.10 * 1.20 = $369.72 (after 32 months)
$369.72 * 1.20 = $443.66 (after 34 months)
$443.66 * 1.20 = $532.39 (after 36 months)

The final cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is:

Now, the doll is a bit more interesting. It costs as much as 3 action figures, which we've already calculated to be $15. It's also mentioned that the doll costs as much as one red car, but that's not necessary for our calculation since we already know the cost of 3 action figures.

Finally, let's add up the cost of all the toys: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

On the other hand, hiring an accountant will cost her $90.

To find out how much more money she'll have if she hires the accountant, we need to subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the lost income. So, $105 - $90 = $15.

So, the total cost is: €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get enough eggs for her Spanish flans.

To make a Spanish flan, Sandra needs 3 eggs, and she has to make 15 flans for her school fundraiser. So, the total number of eggs she needs is 3 eggs/flan * 15 flans = 45 eggs.

Since Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits, we can divide the total number of eggs she needs by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job:
45 eggs / 9 eggs/job = 5 jobs.

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke. To make things easier, let's use a variable to represent Brooke's age. I'll call it 'x'. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2x.

Now, let's think about what will happen in 2 years. Brooke will be x + 2 years old, and Seth will be 2x + 2 years old. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28.

We can write an equation to represent this: (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28

Combine the x terms and the constants: 3x + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 24

Divide both sides by 3: x = 8

So Brooke is 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

The final answer is: 16"

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Jessica's monthly debt payments.

First, we need to calculate the total minimum payment. Jessica's student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. 

Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we calculate the increase:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, we add the increase to the minimum payment:
$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut a single potato. It takes him 1 minute and 30 seconds to peel a potato. To make the calculation easier, let's convert the time to just minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 30 seconds is half a minute. Therefore, peeling a potato takes 1.5 minutes.

Next, it takes Billy 5 seconds to cut a potato. To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). So, 5 seconds is equal to 5/60 = 0.0833 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to peel and cut a potato: 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes = 1.5833 minutes per potato.

Since Billy has 60 potatoes, we multiply the time per potato by 60: 1.5833 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 95 minutes.

First, let's calculate the cost per gallon: $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5 per gallon.

Next, we'll find the revenue per gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50 per glass = $10 per gallon.

Now, let's calculate the profit per gallon: $10 (revenue) - $5 (cost) = $5 per gallon.

Since they made a total profit of $25, we can find the total number of gallons: $25 (total profit) / $5 (profit per gallon) = 5 gallons.

Finally, we can find the total cost of lemons: 5 gallons * $3 (lemons per gallon) = $15.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Zaid's expenses and donations to find out how much he'll have left.

First, we need to calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500. He also spends 1/3 on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000.

Adding these two expenses together, we get 1500 + 2000 = 3500. This means he has 6000 - 3500 = 2500 left.

Next, Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. Half of 2500 is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250. So, after the donation, he has 2500 - 1250 = 1250 left.

Finally, Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$. The total amount he gives them is 200 + 700 = 900. Subtracting this from the remaining amount, we get 1250 - 900 = 350.

One team is well-rounded, with each member running their 400 meter leg in 55 seconds. The other team is less well-rounded, with their first runner taking 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner being 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

To determine the winning margin, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team. The well-rounded team's total time is straightforward:

Jerry is rolling a six-sided die, and we want to find out how much more likely it is that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die: 4, 5, and 6. So, the probability is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.

Next, we'll calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5. Since the die is rolled twice, we multiply the probabilities together: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

Now, let's find the difference between the two probabilities: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25.

There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can find the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by subtracting the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and the hamsters. This is 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15. There are 3 cages of rats, so the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

Next, they went on 2 different rides, each costing $33. The total cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's calculate the total cost by adding the cost of tickets, food, and rides: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

First, let's add the number of men and women: 8417 + 9092 = 17509.

Now, let's subtract this from the total population: 23786 - 17509 = 6277.

So, there are 6277 kids in Soda.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Elaine's Pokémon card collection.

Elaine started with 20 Pokémon cards. In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month. So, that's 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

Now, let's calculate the total cards collected in the first two months: 60 + 40 = 100 cards.

In the third month, Elaine collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. That's 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we add the cards she collected each month to her initial number of cards: 
20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark edits an equal number of sentences for two publishers, and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. To find out how many sentences he edits for each publisher, we'll divide the total number of sentences by 2. 

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Now, let's calculate how much Mark earns from each publisher. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so he earns:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents from Publisher A

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence. Mark earns:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents from Publisher B

To find Mark's total weekly earnings, we'll add the amount he earns from each publisher:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Baldur collects water twice a day, in the morning and the afternoon. In the morning, he gets 5 pails of water, and in the afternoon, he gets 6 pails of water. To find the total number of pails, we add the morning and afternoon amounts:
5 pails + 6 pails = 11 pails

Now, we know that each pail contains 5 liters of water. To find the total liters of water, we multiply the total number of pails by the number of liters per pail:
11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters

"Konnichiwa, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate John's total earnings for the year.

First, we need to calculate his earnings before the raise. John makes $2000 per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, so his total earnings before the raise would be:

$2000 per week * 52 weeks = $104,000 per year

Since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the 5% raise for the entire year. The 5% raise is calculated as:

$2000 per week * 0.05 = $100 per week increase

So, John's new weekly salary after the raise is:

$2000 per week + $100 per week = $2100 per week

His total earnings after the raise would be:

$2100 per week * 52 weeks = $109,200 per year

Adding the one-time monetary reward of $5000, John's total earnings for the year would be:

$109,200 per year + $5000 = $114,200

Josie's farm is 10 acres, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. To find the total tons of grapes produced, we multiply the number of acres by the tons per acre:
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Now, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. To find the total barrels of wine produced, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the barrels per ton:
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Carl's cheese usage for the week.

Carl had a sandwich for lunch every day, and since there are 7 days in a week, that's 7 sandwiches. He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, so that's 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

For breakfast, Carl had cheese and egg omelets for 3 days. He used one more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich, which means he used 3 slices per omelet. So, that's 3 * 3 = 9 slices.

Lastly, Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up all the slices: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (dinner) = 31 slices.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total number of pens Janet has now.

First, we'll add the number of green and yellow pens Janet initially had: 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Next, we'll find out how many blue pens she bought. Since there were 9 pens in each bag and she bought 6 bags, she got 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

Then, we'll calculate the number of red pens she bought. With 6 pens in each bag and 2 bags purchased, she got 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the blue and red pens: 54 + 12 = 66 pens.

Finally, we'll add the initial number of pens to the pens she bought: 32 + 66 = 98.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score from the six tests. Since she can remove the lowest score, we'll consider the average of the remaining five scores. To find the total score required, we multiply the desired average by 5:
93 * 5 = 465.

Now, let's look at Brinley's scores on the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We'll add these scores:
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since the lowest score (71) will be removed, we subtract it from the total score:
438 - 71 = 367.

To find the required score on the sixth test, we subtract the total score of the remaining four tests (367) from the total score required (465):
465 - 367 = 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Micheal's bike rides to find the total kilometers he rode.

Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week for 4 weeks, covering 25 kilometers each time. To find the total kilometers for these 4 weeks, we multiply the number of rides (5 times/week * 4 weeks = 20 times) by the distance per ride (25 kilometers). This gives us 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

After that, Micheal changed his routine to riding 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time, and he did this for 3 weeks. To find the total kilometers for these 3 weeks, we multiply the number of rides (2 times/week * 3 weeks = 6 times) by the distance per ride (60 kilometers). This gives us 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the kilometers from both periods: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total weight of Joe's bag of candy.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and there are 25 chocolate bars. So, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Now, let's add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

On Wednesday, she went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she did on Tuesday. That's 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given that half a dozen plates cost $6000 each, and we need to find the cost of each cup. First, we calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since half a dozen is 6, the total cost is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of 20 dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since 1 dozen is 12, 20 dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost by the number of cups: $34800 / 240 = $145.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Sara's situation to figure out how many times she needs to mow the lawn.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

The total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, Sara still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4). 

$40 / $4 = 10

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Jerry has a flock of chickens, with red chickens producing 3 eggs a day and white chickens producing 5 eggs a day. He collects 42 eggs every day. Also, he has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's use variables to represent the number of red chickens (r) and the number of white chickens (w). Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, we can write an equation: w = r + 2.

Now, let's think about the total number of eggs collected per day. We can set up another equation based on the number of eggs each type of chicken produces: 3r + 5w = 42.

Substituting w = r + 2 into the second equation, we get: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42.

Expanding the equation, we get: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42.

Combine like terms: 8r + 10 = 42.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 8r = 32.

Divide both sides by 8: r = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we need to calculate the distance he covers and then divide it by his walking speed.

The park is a rectangle, so we need to find its perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). Given the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now that we know the distance, we can divide it by Gary's walking speed, which is 3 miles per hour.

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means there were 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

To find the total number of customers on the first two days, we add the customers from both days: 100 + 150 = 250.

Now, we know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total: 500 - 250 = 250.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

We have two pools, both leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. We're given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. We need to find out how much water the small pool has now.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water, it had 2x gallons.

In 4 minutes, both pools lost 16 gallons (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes). So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

We know that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

So, the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

24 - 16 = 8

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, let's divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage of $8.00 to find out how many hours she needs to work.

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Janeth's situation. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. To find the total amount she needs to pay back, we'll calculate the additional 10% first. 

The additional 10% is 0.1 * $2000 = $200. So the total amount she needs to pay back is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth plans to pay $165 a month for 12 months. To find the total amount she will pay, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months: $165 * 12 = $1980.

- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, which is 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

Water left = Initial water - Water used
Water left = 120 - 90
Water left = 30 liters

Now, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. So, we multiply the water left by 2 to find the amount of rainwater collected.

Rainwater collected = 2 * Water left

6 tomatoes/day (Steve) + 3 tomatoes/day (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes/day

Now, let's calculate their combined weekly consumption:

9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we can find out how many vines they need by dividing their combined weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine:

20 friends * 4 slices/friend = 80 slices

Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, we can divide the total number of slices required by 8 to find the number of pizzas needed:
80 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

Ram buys 25 pens and uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low. He can mix the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we can use a geometric series.

The initial number of pens is 25. When the ink runs low, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens. Now, he has 25 + 5 = 30 pens.

We can see a pattern emerging. The number of new pens he can make is always 1/5 of the total number of pens he has. This is a geometric series with a common ratio of 1/5.

The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula:

S = a / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term, and r is the common ratio.

In this case, a = 25 and r = 1/5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 25 / (1 - 1/5)
S = 25 / (4/5)
S = 25 * (5/4)

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Johnny starts with his allowance of $20 and adds an extra $10 to it. To find the total amount he has initially, we add these two values together: $20 + $10 = $30.

Now, we know that this sum of money tripled in a year. To find the final amount, we multiply the initial sum by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

So, after a year, Johnny has a total of $90.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out the sum of the ages of the three girls.

We know Jessa is 20 years old. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Now, Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

To find the sum of their ages, we simply add them up: 
20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 1000 students in the school hall, and they exit through three entrances/exits: A, B, and C. First, 30% of the students leave through exit A. To find out how many students that is, we calculate 30% of 1000.

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students

Now, we have 1000 - 300 = 700 students remaining. Next, 3/5 of these remaining students leave through exit B. Let's calculate that.

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students

So, we have 700 - 420 = 280 students left. Since the rest of the students leave through exit C, we can conclude that:

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. To find out how many candies Robert has, we can divide John's candies by 2: 54 ÷ 2 = 27. So, Robert has 27 candies.

Now, we're told that James has 6 more candies than Robert. To find James' total, we add 6 to Robert's candies: 27 + 6 = 33. So, James has 33 candies.

Finally, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We can do this by subtracting James' candies from John's candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

Pandora will read her 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so that's 3 books for Pandora.

To find the total number of books they collectively read, we add the books read by Dolly and Pandora: 3 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

"Konnichiwa, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he's now pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. That means he writes 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week. Since each letter is 5 pages long, he writes a total of 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.

Now, let's calculate the time he spends writing. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing a week is 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

In addition to these daily calls, Jason had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes used are:
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, let's subtract the total minutes used from his monthly limit to find out how many minutes Jason has left:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

"Ohayou gozaimasu, let's solve this problem together.

Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Then, Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.

After that, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.

Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, we can calculate the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin by subtracting the fries Griffin had left from the total number of fries Griffin ended up with: 27 - 7 = 20.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem. We have two aquariums with different numbers of snails - one has 4 snails and the other has 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

Now, we're told that this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can represent the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. The total number of fish in both aquariums would be 2x.

We can set up an equation based on the given information: 2 * 2x = 28 (since the difference in snails is twice the total number of fish).

Combine like terms and solve for 'x': 
4x = 28
x = 28 / 4
x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total hours of makeup work per week. Since the makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, the total hours per week would be 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total hours of makeup work would be 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost would be 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

As a token of appreciation for the large amount of work, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To calculate the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1: $30,000 * 0.1 = $3,000.

Finally, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the amount Jean paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, we'll divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many cookies Sue and her sister ate. On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's find the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's sister: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
Sue's sister: 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 3 classes with 20 students each, making a total of 3 * 20 = 60 students in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, we have 60 / 2 = 30 boys and 30 girls.

Now, let's look at the number of girls in each class. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students in total, and 3 of them are girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many apps Travis has on his tablet now.

Travis started with 61 apps. He deleted 9 apps he didn't use anymore, so we subtract 9 from 61. That's 61 - 9 = 52.

Then, he downloaded 18 more apps. We add 18 to 52. That's 52 + 18 = 70.

So, Travis now has 70 apps on his tablet.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that last night Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, for a total of 10 + 15 = 25 animals.

Now, let's calculate the number of animals he killed today. We know that he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say he killed x cougars. Then, he killed 3x wolves. We also know that he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so x = 15 - 3 = 12.

So, today Rick killed 3x = 3 * 12 = 36 wolves and 12 cougars, for a total of 36 + 12 = 48 animals.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the number of animals he killed last night and today: 25 + 48 = 73.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out which floor Bill is on now.

Bill starts on the 3rd floor and rides the elevator up to the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6. To find the floor, we need to multiply 4 by his starting floor, which is 3, and then add 6.

So, 4 times 3 is 12, and 12 plus 6 is 18.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

We know Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down, we need to calculate 30% of 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. Since Anne went down 30% less, we subtract 9 from 30. So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne. To find out how many times Robert went down, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4. That's 21 * 4 = 84.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

First, we need to find out how many cows are in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, but the problem later mentions 20 stalls. Assuming the initial 10 stalls are part of the 20 stalls, we'll proceed with 20 stalls.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 2 (new cows) = 22 cows.

To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's count the money in Brady's piggy bank together.

First, we have 100 pennies. Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 100 by $0.01 to get $1.

Next, we have 40 nickels. Each nickel is worth $0.05, so we multiply 40 by $0.05 to get $2.

Then, we have 20 dimes. Each dime is worth $0.10, so we multiply 20 by $0.10 to get $2.

Lastly, we have 40 pieces of dollar bills, which is a straightforward $40.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We're given that each 10-foot section of a redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. The tree is 200 feet tall, and termites ate 30% of its wood. To find the weight of the tree, we need to calculate its total weight before the termites' damage and then subtract the weight of the wood they ate.

First, let's find the total weight of the tree. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 and multiply by 400 pounds.

200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to find 30% of the total weight, which is the weight of the wood eaten by the termites.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

To find the weight of the tree after the termites ate 30% of its wood, we subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the total weight.

Weight after termites ate 30% = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

The final answer is: 5600"

$0.50 * 8 = $4.00

In addition to the cost of the overdue books, Nancy also has to pay a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. To find the total amount she has to pay, we add the cost of the overdue books to the flat fee:

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Andrea has 52 apples, and she has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Now, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. This means Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's count the total number of fruits. Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, which is 52 + 24 = 76 fruits. Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, which is 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have: 76 + 92 = 168.

First, we need to find out the total number of cookies Carla is making. She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so we add those together.
36 + 30 = 66 cookies

Since a dozen is 12 cookies, we divide 66 by 12 to get the total number of dozens.
66 / 12 = 5.5 dozen cookies

Now, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies. To find the total amount of flour needed, we multiply 5.5 by 2.

Two thirds of 9,300 is (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200 pennies.

Now, let's convert 6,200 pennies to dollars. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 pennies, we can divide 6,200 by 100.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of $350,000. To do this, we multiply the selling price by 0.05.

Brokerage fee: $350,000 * 0.05 = $17,500

Next, we calculate the transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price. We multiply the selling price by 0.12.

Transfer fee: $350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000

Now, we add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price of the house.

Total price of the house: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. To find his net proceeds, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract that from the selling price.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees, which are 3% of the selling price. 
Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

Next, we'll calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price.
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

We also know that Mr. Tan paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house.

Now, let's add up the total amount he paid.
Total amount paid = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
Total amount paid = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000
Total amount paid = $282,000

Finally, we can find Mr. Tan's net proceeds by subtracting the total amount he paid from the selling price.

First, it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. To find 40% of 20 minutes, I'll multiply 20 by 0.4, which gives me 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

The total time to warm the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Therefore, it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook.

Now, let's add the time it took to warm the oil and the time it took to cook. The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 
900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, we subtract the stitches we've already accounted for to find the total stitches for the two sleeves: 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

First, let's find the number of cards with the letter A. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we can calculate this as follows:
2/5 * 80 = 32

Now, we subtract the cards with A from the total:
80 - 32 = 48

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we can calculate this as follows:
1/2 * 48 = 24

Now, we subtract the cards with B from the remaining:
48 - 24 = 24

Then, we find the number of cards with the letter C. Since 5/8 of the rest had the letter C, we can calculate this as follows:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides gives us:
3S + 9 = 27

Three rows of 8 stars have a total of 3 * 8 = 24 stars. Two rows of 6 stars have a total of 2 * 6 = 12 stars. So, the total number of stars in these rows is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Now, let's subtract the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag. This will give us the number of stars in the 5-star rows: 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

We know the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. To find the speed of the car in the slow lane, we'll divide the speed of the car in the fast lane by 2.

Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we need to find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance of 480 miles. We can use the formula time = distance / speed.

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

Ali has 22 medals for counting super fast, and his friend Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali. So, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have.

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 * 39 = 390.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

We have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each, which means they'll get a total of 4 * 6 = 24 chocolate bars.

To find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total: 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars will be shared equally among them. So, each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Susan's earnings from her online task.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a 30-minute break, so we subtract that from her total time: 
3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, let's convert 2.5 hours to minutes: 
2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can divide the total minutes by 10 to find the number of 10-minute intervals she worked: 
150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by her earnings per interval: 
15 * $5 = $75

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have three friends, Mike, Jim, and Tony, who are playing a game. After 3 rounds, Mike has 21 points, Jim has 3 points less than Mike, and Tony has 2 times more than Mike.

First, let's calculate the points for each player:
Mike has 21 points.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, in the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Mike and Tony have over 20 points, so they each get 1 extra point. Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.

After the extra points have been distributed, the total points for each player are:
Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
Jim: 18 points (no change)
Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

The total points for all three players after the extra points have been distributed is: 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

Will buys 15 oranges and asks his 2 sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest is half as old as the oldest. To find out how many oranges the youngest son is, we need to divide the oldest son's age by 2. So, the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Now, let's add the ages of the two sons to find out how many oranges they washed in total. 8 (oldest son's age) + 4 (youngest son's age) = 12 oranges.

Since Will bought 15 oranges, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges to find out how many are left unwashed. 15 - 12 = 3.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Darren's exercise routine for the first two days.

On the first day, Darren did 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. 

On the second day, he did 20 more pushups than the first day, which is 100 + 20 = 120 pushups. He did 10 fewer squats, so that's 50 - 10 = 40 squats. He also doubled the number of dumbbell presses, which is 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

Now, let's add up the total number of activities for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"Konnichiwa. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of rice each person consumes per day. Since each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal and there are two meals (lunch and dinner), the daily consumption per person is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

Now, let's multiply this by the number of people in the household, which is 5:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Finally, we can divide the total weight of the rice bag (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

Over the weekend, Sam sold 20 crates of bread. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and on Thursday 18 crates. To find the total number of crates sold, we'll add these numbers together:
20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To determine how many crates he was off from his target, we'll subtract the total crates sold from the target:

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down John's driving expenses.

First, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year. John's work is 30 miles away, and he makes a round trip every day. So, the total miles driven per day is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles. Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles * 5 = 300 miles. With 50 weeks in a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles * 50 = 15,000 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for miles driven per year. John gets charged $2 per mile, so the total cost is 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000.

In addition to the mileage cost, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. With 12 months in a year, the total bonus is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

To find the total cost per year for driving, we add the mileage cost and the bonus: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the total time by 2. So, we multiply 39 by 2, which gives us 78 minutes.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem of the simple folding newspaper or tabloid.

When creating a 32-page tabloid, the pages are arranged in a specific way. Page 1 is printed on the left back, page 2 is printed on the left front, page 32 is printed on the right back, and page 31 is printed on the right front. This arrangement implies that the pages are paired in a way that requires a certain number of pieces of paper.

To determine the number of pieces of paper used, let's consider how the pages are paired. Since each piece of paper has a front and a back, we can pair the pages as follows:

Page 1 (back) and Page 2 (front)
Page 3 (back) and Page 4 (front)
...
Page 31 (back) and Page 32 (front)

However, this pairing is not as straightforward as it seems. The pages are arranged in a way that requires 8 pieces of paper for the front and 8 pieces of paper for the back, but these are the same 8 pieces of paper, just viewed from different sides.

So, the correct answer is that 8 pieces of paper are used to create a 32-page tabloid.

The final answer is: 8"

We also know that she sold 45 books this year and twice as many in the first year, which means she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

Now, let's find out how many books she sold in the second year. We can do this by subtracting the books sold in the first and current year from the total number of books sold: 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Since each book sells for 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300$.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Watson's earnings for April.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, which means he works 50 hours per week. Since he earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 50 * $10 = $500 per week.

Assuming a 4-week month, Watson's total earnings from his hourly wage would be $500 * 4 = $2000.

As the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total bonus for the month is $300 * 4 = $1200.

Adding his hourly wage earnings and the bonus, Watson's total earnings for the month are $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

Since 80% is the percentage of people he beats, the percentage of people he loses to is 100% - 80% = 20%. Now, let's calculate 20% of 20.

20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4

So, John lost to 4 people.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. To find out how many loaves are sold in the morning, we need to calculate two-thirds of 60. 

Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total to find out how many are left: 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight he loses in a week, we can divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in a week, he loses 8 / 4 = 2 pounds.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks, which is 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, to lose 8 pounds, it will take her 8 / 2 * 4 = 16 weeks.

Next, I'll calculate the savings from the milk. The discount is $0.5 per packet, and we're buying 4 packets. So, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Next, the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases at $50 each will be 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. It costs $700 more than 5 times as much as a business suit. So, 5 * $100 = $500, and adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up all these expenses: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo has a budget of $6000 and wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, if we subtract his total expenses from his budget, we get $6000 - $1950 = $4050. Then, subtracting the amount he wants to save, we get $4050 - $2000 = $2050.

The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. To find the current population, we multiply the population six years ago by 2: 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how long it'll take to fully charge that phone.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged. Since it recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it'll take to charge the remaining 40%.

To do this, we multiply the remaining percentage by the time it takes to charge 1 percentage-point: 40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes.

Now, let's convert those minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we'll divide 120 by 60.

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mom gives her 10 more, so now she has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17, which is 17 - 3 = 14.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the customer's shopping trip to find out how much they paid.

The customer earned rewards from their last shopping trip, where they spent $80. Since they get $1 off for every $20 spent, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards of $1 each.

This shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards, which is a $4 discount. They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, so the coupon discount is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total discount is $4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12.

To find out how much the customer paid, we subtract the total discount from the amount they spent: $43 - $12 = $31.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem and find out which job has a higher net pay rate.

First, let's calculate the net income for Job A. The gross income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. With a 20% total tax rate, the taxes would be $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. So, the net income for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Now, let's calculate the net income for Job B. The gross income is $42,000/year, but we need to subtract the $6,000 property tax first. That leaves us with $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. With a 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax, the taxes would be $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. So, the net income for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Since Job B has a higher net income, we need to find the difference between the two net incomes. That would be $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

Now, we know that half of these ruined castles are unmanned. So, we'll find half of 88.

Number of unmanned ruined castles = 88 / 2
= 44

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the two offers to find the cost difference.

First, we'll calculate the total cost of Furniture United's offer. The advance payment is $1,350, and the 6 monthly installments of $350 each add up to $2,100. So, the total cost is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Next, we'll calculate the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer. The advance payment is $1,100, and the 9 monthly installments of $250 each add up to $2,250. So, the total cost is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers. To do this, we'll subtract the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer from the total cost of Furniture United's offer: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

"Ohayou, let's solve this problem together. We have four friends - Nick, Richard, Jason (also known as DJ), and RJ - who have paintball guns. DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. If they decide to share their guns equally, we need to find out how many guns each of them would have.

First, let's find the total number of guns they have. We add the number of guns each of them has: 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ) + 5 (Richard) = 24 guns.

Now, we divide the total number of guns by the number of friends: 24 guns / 4 friends = 6 guns per friend.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

For the suckers, Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar per batch. Since he's making 8 batches, he'll need 8 * 30 = 240 ounces of sugar.

For the fudge, he needs 70 ounces of sugar per batch. Since he's making 1 batch, he'll need 1 * 70 = 70 ounces of sugar.

Now, let's add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge: 240 + 70 = 310 ounces.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each, so the initial total value is 8 * $8 = $64.

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4. So, the new price per share is $8 + $4 = $12. Now, the total value is 8 * $12 = $96.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we calculate 25% of $12, which is 0.25 * $12 = $3. So, the new price per share is $12 - $3 = $9. Now, the total value is 8 * $9 = $72.

The final value of all Maria's shares is $72."

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 200 students divided into 3 groups. Two of the groups have the same number of students, and the third group (the smallest) has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups.

Let's call the number of students in the two equal groups ""x"". Then, the number of students in the smallest group is ""x - 10"".

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up an equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide by 3:

x = 70

Now, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and they're all either chickens or cows. He also has twice as many chickens as cows. To start, let's say the number of cows is x. Since there are twice as many chickens, the number of chickens is 2x.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of animals:
x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:
3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 2(20) = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs. 
Total legs = (number of cows * 4) + (number of chickens * 2)
Total legs = (20 * 4) + (40 * 2)
Total legs = 80 + 80
Total legs = 160

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem. We have a pink frog that weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, but 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, and 20 pounds more than a red bird. Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can determine the weights of the other animals.

Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, they also weigh 50 pounds each. The yellow snake is 10 pounds heavier than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds. On the other hand, the red bird is 20 pounds lighter than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself, which weighs 20 pounds. 

Total weight = Pink frog + Blue beetle + Green toad + Yellow snake + Red bird + Container
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20

Now, they sell 5 silos a day at $220 per silo, so their current daily earnings are 5 * $220 = $1100.

The difference in daily earnings is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, and then 100 miles from the second city to the third city. To find the distance from the third city to the first city, we need to calculate 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs. The combined distance is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, let's add up the distances to find the total distance traveled in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so to find the number of days it goes between services, we'll divide the total distance by the daily distance: 18,000 / 900 = 20.

We also need to consider the cords for the officers. Since 1/4 of the seniors are officers, that's 44 / 4 = 11 seniors. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Finally, let's add up the total cost of the senior gifts: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the market cost and subtract it from the market cost.

The market cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. To find 20% of this, we multiply $400 by 0.20. This gives us $80. Since Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, he saves this amount.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the market cost: $400 - $80 = $320.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. That's a great start to the sale.

The next day, Saturday, they sold double that number. So, they sold 2 * 14 = 28 pairs of shoes.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the number of pairs sold each day to find the total number of pairs sold: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs.

Since each pair contains 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100 shoes.

The company bought $400,000 worth of equipment, but 40% of it was faulty. To find the amount spent on faulty equipment, we need to calculate 40% of $400,000.

40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000.

This means the company spent $160,000 on faulty equipment. To find the amount spent on functioning equipment, we subtract the amount spent on faulty equipment from the total amount spent.

$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

Mary has 30 sheep, and she gets milk from all of them. Half of them give her 1 kg of milk each, and the other half give her 2 kg of milk each.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each half. Since there are 30 sheep in total, half of them is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the milk from the first half. 15 sheep give her 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

Next, let's calculate the milk from the other half. 15 sheep give her 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Karan's loan to figure out her monthly payment.

First, we need to calculate the interest on the loan. The interest rate is 10% per year, but Karan only borrowed the money for 5 months. To calculate the interest, we'll convert the time to years: 5 months is approximately 5/12 of a year.

Now, let's calculate the interest:
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
= $3,650 * 10% * (5/12)
= $3,650 * 0.10 * 0.4167
= $152.08

The total amount Karan needs to pay back is the principal plus the interest:
Total amount = Principal + Interest
= $3,650 + $152.08
= $3,802.08

To find the monthly payment, we'll divide the total amount by the number of months:
Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Millie's lemonade stand situation.

Millie buys supplies for $18, which allows her to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she can make a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup for $1, so her total revenue will be 36 * $1 = $36.

To find her profit, we subtract her total cost from her total revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we can find the total number of hours she spends running the stand by dividing the total cups by the cups sold per hour: 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Now, let's calculate her profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

We know that Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. To find the original amount of land he had, we can start by setting up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"

To ride all 9 rides, Dasha needs 9 * 2 = 18 tickets. Since each ticket costs $2, the total cost of Dasha's tickets is 18 * $2 = $36.

Now, let's compare the costs. David spent $30 on his ride bracelet, while Dasha spent $36 on tickets. To find out how much David saved, we subtract the cost of his ride bracelet from the cost of Dasha's tickets: $36 - $30 = $6.

We know the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we need to first find the total number of popsicles each of them has.

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can start by finding the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11.

Now, let's divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total parts (11) to find the value of 1 part:
165 ÷ 11 = 15.

This means each part is equal to 15 popsicles. Since Betty has 5 parts, she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles. And since Sam has 6 parts, he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

20% of $20 (Hulu + Disney Plus) is 0.20 * $20 = $4. So, the discount is $4. Now, subtract the discount from the original cost: $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, add the cost of Netflix to find the total cost of the streaming services: $16 + $10 = $26.

To find the amount of money saved, subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 - $26 = $34.

First, we need to calculate the original energy usage per day. Since Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day, the energy usage is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours. To convert this to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000 (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts), which gives us 7.2 kilowatt-hours per day.

Now, let's calculate the new energy usage per day. If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours, he'll be using it for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. The new energy usage is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours, or 2.7 kilowatt-hours per day.

To find the energy saved per day, we subtract the new energy usage from the original energy usage: 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours.

Since there are 40 employees, each working 40 hours a week at $15 per hour, the total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600. With approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400.

Now, let's move on to June. We know that 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30. The total amount paid to each employee in a week remains the same, $600. With 4 weeks in June, the total amount paid to each employee is still $2400. Multiply this by the number of employees in June (30), and we get the total amount paid in June: $2400 * 30 = $72000.

To find the total amount paid in the two months, we simply add the amounts paid in May and June: $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Sally's expenses to find out how much money she has left.

Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy, and the deal was ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which is $3 * 0.5 = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each. The total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up all her expenses: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total amount Tim spent on fireworks.

First, we have the cost of the two packages. One package is $400, and the other is twice that amount, which is $800. So, the total cost of the packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage: $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150: $960 + $150 = $1110.

"Ohayou gozaimasu, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, and she wants to have enough for 30 days. So, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights: 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

Marcy makes homemade candles that she markets as 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means 1% of the candles will explode. We're also told that 5% of the more dangerous candles (the ones that explode) have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

To find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the intersection of these two events.

First, let's find the number of candles that will explode. Since 1% of the candles will explode, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of candles that will explode = 1% of 50000
= 0.01 * 50000
= 500

Now, let's find the number of candles that will smell like wet dog. 5% of the candles that explode will have this defect.

Number of candles that will smell like wet dog = 5% of the number of candles that will explode
= 0.05 * 500
= 25

So, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total cost of the discounted blouses.

First, we need to find the discount on each blouse. The regular price is $20, and the discount is 30% of that. To find 30% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.3.

$20 * 0.3 = $6

So, the discount on each blouse is $6. Now, let's find the discounted price of each blouse by subtracting the discount from the regular price.

$20 - $6 = $14

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we multiply the discounted price by 4 to find the total cost.

$14 * 4 = $56

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem and find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

First, we know Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half that amount, which is 15 apples, from the shortest trees. We'll denote the number of apples she gathered from the average trees as x.

Now, let's look at her sister's gathering. Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples, and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples. She didn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Joanne's apples + Sister's apples = 500
(30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500

Combine like terms:

(45 + x) + 105 = 500

Combine constants:

150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

x = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We have a herd with camels and dromedaries. The total number of heads is 180, and the total number of humps is 304. We know that camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each.

Let's use 'c' to represent the number of camels and 'd' to represent the number of dromedaries. Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is the sum of camels and dromedaries:
c + d = 180

Now, let's consider the humps. Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each. So, the total number of humps is:
2c + d = 304

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now, we can substitute c = 124 into the first equation to find d:
124 + d = 180
d = 56

The number of dromedaries is 56."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Tom's trip to find the total distance he traveled.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so that's 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km. Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first four days, which is 0.3 * 800 = 240 km. On the 7th day, he didn't travel at all, so that's 0 km.

Now, let's move on to the second week. Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so that's 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

To find the total distance, we add up the distances: 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. To find Timothy's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches

Now, let's calculate how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb. Oliver is currently at 3,000 feet, so he needs to climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We start with 50 adorable cats on a rock. Then, four boats arrive and take away 5 cats each. To find out how many cats were taken, we multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each boat took: 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30. So, there are 30 cats left on the rock.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats decide to chase a mouse. To find out how many cats that is, we multiply 30 by 3/5: (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that chased the mouse from the number of cats left on the rock: 30 - 18 = 12.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the cost of Bill's streaming service for 2 years.

First, we have the introductory period, which is 6 months at $8 per month. That's 6 * $8 = $48.

Next, the normal rate kicks in for 8 months at $12 per month. So, that's 8 * $12 = $96.

Now, let's calculate the remaining time. 2 years is equal to 24 months. We subtract the introductory and normal rate periods: 24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months. For these 10 months, the rate is $14 per month. That's 10 * $14 = $140.

To find the total cost, we add the costs of all three periods: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

"Ohayou, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

Cole bought two types of jeans: tattered jeans and jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we add the savings to the sale price: $22 + $2 = $24.

To find the original price of the tattered jeans, we add the savings to the sale price: $28 + $4 = $32.

The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, we need to find the difference and make it negative.

The original price difference between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8. Since the jogger jeans cost less, we make it negative: -$8.

Lillian has a total of 6 bird feeders - 3 that she built herself and 3 that she bought. Each bird feeder initially attracts 20 birds throughout the day. However, the birds seem to prefer the feeders Lillian made, which attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones.

So, the homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. Since there are 3 homemade feeders, they attract a total of 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

The store-bought feeders still attract 20 birds each. With 3 store-bought feeders, they attract a total of 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see, we add the birds attracted by the homemade and store-bought feeders: 90 + 60 = 150.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Kenny wants to buy a ticket to an amusement park that costs $100, and he also wants to have $50 in spending cash. This means he needs to make a total of $150 from selling his Pokémon cards.

Since he sells each card for $1.5, we can find the number of cards he sold by dividing the total amount of money he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5):

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

However, this is the number of cards he sold, not the number he started with. We know that he kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with ""x"". Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3x.

We know that 2/3x = 100, so we can solve for x:

2/3x = 100
x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The caterer initially prepared hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them able to have two hotdogs. This means 18 guests could have two hotdogs, and the other 18 could have one. So, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 18 * 2 (for the 18 guests who could have two) + 18 * 1 (for the other 18 guests) = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26. 

Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

3 gallons × 1/4 = 0.75 gallons

Since we need to find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in 1 gallon, so we multiply 0.75 gallons by 8.

We know George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x 40 = 120 cents on chips.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on chips (120 cents) from the total amount spent (495 cents): 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

We know the area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet, and the length of his room is 3 yards. First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, we can multiply 3 yards by 3 feet/yard to get the length in feet:

Length (in feet) = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Now, let's find James' time for the swim and bike ride. 
- James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. 
- 10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
- James' swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes
- James took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon.

First, we need to figure out how far Michael's horse runs. We know it runs for 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour. To calculate the distance, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance:

Distance = speed * time = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat a total of:

16 miles * 0.5 bails/mile = 8 bails of hay

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:

8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

6 * $5 = $30

To find out how much change he has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money he has:

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs. Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs, which is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. She also has 2 loose eggs, so the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs needed per tray. Each glass needs 5 eggs, and each tray holds 5 glasses, so each tray needs 5 * 5 = 25 eggs.

Finally, let's divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per tray: 50 eggs / 25 eggs per tray = 2 trays.

First, Joey scores 26 points, so we add that to his initial score: 214 + 26 = 240.

Next, Marcy scores 10 points, so we add that to her initial score: 225 + 10 = 235.

Now, to find out by how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's score from Joey's score: 240 - 235 = 5.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the salesman spent on the sneakers. He bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from Monday's sale is 17 * $20 = $340.

Now, let's find out how many sneakers were left after the flash sale. The salesman had 48 sneakers initially and sold 17, so he had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.

These 31 sneakers were sold to a department store for $25 each throughout the rest of the week. The revenue from the rest of the week is 31 * $25 = $775.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from Monday's sale and the revenue from the rest of the week, which is $340 + $775 = $1115.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue. The profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

Beatrice bought ten packets of crayons, but they're not all the same. Six packets have 8 colors each, and the other four packets have 16 colors each. To find the total number of colors, we need to calculate the total number of colors in each type of packet and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of colors in the packets with 8 colors each. Since there are 6 packets, we multiply 6 by 8: 6 * 8 = 48.

Next, let's calculate the total number of colors in the packets with 16 colors each. Since there are 4 packets, we multiply 4 by 16: 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors in both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the super ticket costs $20 and includes a movie ticket, popcorn, and a soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost of the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

On the other hand, if you buy a regular ticket, it costs $12, and you also need to buy popcorn and a soda. The soda costs $3, and let's say the popcorn costs x dollars.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket option is $21 - $2 = $19.

We can set up an equation to represent the total cost of the regular ticket option: $12 (ticket) + $3 (soda) + x (popcorn) = $19.

Combine the constants: $12 + $3 = $15. Now the equation becomes $15 + x = $19.

Subtract $15 from both sides: x = $19 - $15 = $4.

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the original cost per balloon. We know that the total cost of filling 20 helium balloons was $900. To find the cost per balloon, we divide the total cost by the number of balloons: $900 ÷ 20 = $45 per balloon.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We multiply the number of balloons by the new cost per balloon: 170 × $65 = $11,050.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. To find the car's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at each speed. The car drives 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance traveled at this speed is 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then, it drives 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance traveled at this speed is 30 * 1 = 30 miles.

The total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances: 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's get started on solving the problem.

To find the total cost of the potting soil, we need to calculate the total volume of the raised beds and then divide it by the volume of each bag of soil.

First, we calculate the volume of each raised bed: 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet. Since there are 10 raised beds, the total volume is 32 cubic feet * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Next, we divide the total volume by the volume of each bag of soil, which is 2 cubic feet. So, the number of bags needed is 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet = 160 bags.

Finally, we multiply the number of bags by the cost of each bag, which is $12. The total cost is 160 bags * $12 = $1920.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

We have 15 red cards, and the number of green cards is 60% more than the red cards. To find the number of green cards, we'll calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15.

60% of 15 is 0.6 * 15 = 9. So, the number of green cards is 15 + 9 = 24.

Now, the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards, which is 15 + 24 = 39.

To find the total number of cards, we'll add the number of red, green, and yellow cards: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's find out what percentage of all the puppies have spots.

First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots. To do this, we'll divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies, and then multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 35%

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed.

First, we need to find the total weight of the feed. The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so that's 2 * 1 = 2 pounds. He also buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, which is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds. For hay, he buys 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds, so that's 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds. Lastly, he buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, which is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we'll divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity: 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Since 2 trips will not be enough to carry the remaining 0 pounds of feed, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, 2 trips will be enough to carry all the feed, but the second trip will not be full. So, the farmer will need 2 trips.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Grayson's recycling earnings.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, in a week, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents from aluminum cans. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans.

She also drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, in a week, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents from plastic bottles. In a 4-week month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

To find the total amount she earns in a month, we add her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

She also has five boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, which is 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards. Adding these together, we get 150 + 200 = 350 cards in total.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so she gives the remaining cards to her students. To find out how many cards she gives away, we subtract the cards she keeps from the total: 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Since each student gets 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the total number of cards given away by the number of cards per student: 300 / 10 = 30 students.

Now, let's add all the shoes together:
200 (initial shoes) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. To find out how many shoes he has left, we subtract 180 from 300:

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

Jana has 27 adorable puppies, and two thirds of them are Pomeranians. To find out how many Pomeranians Jana has, we need to calculate two thirds of 27. 

Two thirds of 27 is (2/3) * 27 = 18. So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Now, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. To find out how many girl Pomeranians Jana has, we need to calculate one third of 18.

One third of 18 is (1/3) * 18 = 6.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. To find the average highest temperature of Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia, we need to add their highest temperatures and divide by 3.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit, in Northlandia it's 21 degrees Fahrenheit, and in Midlandia it's -3 degrees Fahrenheit. Let's add them up:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many days it'll take for the 8-year-old to save up for that toy car.

First, we need to find out how much more money the child needs. The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 in savings. So, the remaining amount needed is $12 - $4 = $8.

Since the child promises to save $2 daily from their allowance, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find the number of days it'll take to save the remaining amount.

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
= $8 / $2
= 4 days

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the trays.

Jaime has 2 trays, and each tray can hold 24 eggs. To find the total number of eggs the trays can hold, we multiply the number of trays by the number of eggs each tray can hold:
2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Jaime has 64 eggs, so we subtract the total number of eggs the trays can hold from the total number of eggs he has:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

"Konnichiwa, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the cost of each individual razor.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but with the buy one get one free offer, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be:

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have a total of 8 razors. Now, we can calculate the cost per razor:

$2.00 ÷ 8 razors = $0.25 per razor

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

$0.25 * 100 = 25 cents

We have 9 cheerleaders who are 64"" tall and 1 cheerleader who is 60"" tall. The pyramid structure consists of 4 girls at the bottom, 3 on top of them, 2 on top of the 3, and the shortest girl at the very top.

The total height of the bottom level is 4 * 64"" = 256"". 
The middle level has 3 girls, so their total height is 3 * 64"" = 192"". 
The top level has 2 girls, so their total height is 2 * 64"" = 128"". 
The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, let's add the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we'll divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 636"" / 12 = 53 feet.

Since Angela's age in four years will be three times Brett's current age, we can calculate it by multiplying Brett's age by 3. 

3 * 14 = 42

This means in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find her current age, we subtract 4 from 42.

Angela's current age = 42 - 4 = 38

Now, Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Together, they have a total of 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have two venues to consider for the surprise party. The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, but we need to add the cost of food, which is $5 per guest. The second venue charges $25 per guest, and the food is already included in the price.

To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, we can set up an equation. Let's say the number of guests is 'x'. The total cost for the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost). The total cost for the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Now, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

To solve for x, we can subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x

Next, we can divide both sides by 20:

x = 200 / 20
x = 10

So, the two venues will be equal in cost when there are 10 guests.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's start by using variables to represent the number of insects each person found. We'll use B for Bodhi, D for David, and L for Lily.

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, we can write an equation: D = B/2.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write another equation: L = D + 7.

Now, let's use the fact that together they collected 43 insects: L + D + B = 43.

We can substitute the first two equations into the third one. First, substitute D = B/2 into L = D + 7 to get L in terms of B: L = B/2 + 7.

Now, substitute L and D into the equation L + D + B = 43:
(B/2 + 7) + (B/2) + B = 43

Combine like terms:
2B/2 + 7 = 43
B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
B = 36

Now that we know Bodhi found 36 insects, we can find out how many David found:
D = B/2
D = 36/2
D = 18

Finally, we can find out how many Lily found:
L = D + 7
L = 18 + 7
L = 25

Next, we calculate how many yards of yarn her grandma used. She used 1/2 of a skein, so we multiply 1/2 by 364. Her grandma used 1/2 * 364 = 182 yards.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma: 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3. To find the total cost of the strawberry gum, we subtract this amount from the total amount Suzie paid: $7 - $3 = $4.

Since Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost by 2 to find the cost of each pack: $4 / 2 = $2.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make.

To maximize the number of sticks, we need to find the most cost-effective option. We have two types of wood: 2 x 4 and 2 x 8. The 2 x 4 costs $4 and gives 200 sticks, while the 2 x 8 costs $6 and gives 400 sticks.

Let's calculate the number of sticks per dollar for each option:
For 2 x 4: 200 sticks / $4 = 50 sticks per dollar
For 2 x 8: 400 sticks / $6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar

The 2 x 8 wood is the better deal, so let's see how many of those Frederick can buy with his $24 budget:
$24 / $6 = 4

Now, we multiply the number of 2 x 8 woods by the number of sticks per wood:
4 * 400 = 1600

Now, let's count the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh):
Daily consumption before: 12 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 288 kWh
Daily consumption after: 14 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 336 kWh

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption:
Weekly consumption before: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
Weekly consumption after: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour, so we multiply the weekly consumption by the cost:

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem. Tom spent a total of $48 on a CD and a headphone set. The CD cost $4, so the headphone set must have cost $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, let's see how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we can divide $44 by $4 to find out how many CDs he could have bought: $44 / $4 = 11.

However, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set. Since he already bought 1 CD, we subtract 1 from 11: 11 - 1 = 10.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Josh's workout routine to find the total number of hours he spent working out.

Josh worked out for 8 weeks, with 4 hours being his usual weekly routine. However, there were some exceptions. He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks and 6 hours in one week. To find the total hours, we need to calculate the hours spent in each type of week.

Josh spent 4 hours a week for 5 weeks (since 2 weeks were 5 hours and 1 week was 6 hours). So, the total hours spent in those 5 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

For the 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours, the total hours spent is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

For the week where he spent 6 hours, the total hours spent is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours spent in all the weeks: 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

Total hours spent working out:

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We start with 48 people on the bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving us with:
48 - 8 = 40

Now, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus. The total number of passengers is now:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

On the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving us with:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer is 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get on the bus. The total number of passengers is now:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. To find his current age, we subtract 5 from 27, which gives us 22.

Next, we need to find Jame's age in 8 years. We add 8 to his current age, so 22 + 8 = 30.

Now, let's consider Jame's cousin. In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 2 * 30 = 60. So, the cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

To find the cousin's current age, we subtract 8 from 55, which gives us 47.

Finally, we need to find the difference in their current ages. The difference is 47 - 22 = 25.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. The computer cost $1,100, and he paid $400 less for the printer. To find the cost of the printer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer: $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

Since the total cost of all items is $2,400, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer to find the cost of 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of 2 monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

We have 20 kids divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, so that's 10 boys and 10 girls. The boys went out and brought back 60 shells each. To find the total number of shells brought by the boys, we multiply the number of boys by the number of shells each boy brought: 10 x 60 = 600.

Now, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + (4 x 600) = 600 + 2400 = 3000 shells.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many shells each girl brought: 3000 / 10 = 300.

Now, let's add up the thickness of all four books:

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Elvis's savings goal for April. He wants to save a total of $1125 for the month. Since April has 30 days, we can divide it into two halves: the first 15 days and the second 15 days.

Elvis plans to save twice as much daily in the second half as he does in the first half. Let's call the daily savings in the first half 'x'. Then, the daily savings in the second half would be 2x.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half. We can set up an equation to represent this:

15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Combine like terms:
15x + 30x = 1125
45x = 1125

Now, divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So, Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2x = 2 * 25 = 50 dollars per day in the second half.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the fruits: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

To do this, we'll calculate the total weight Mark lost during those 3 months. Since he lost 10 pounds per month, we multiply the weight lost per month by the number of months:

10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

We know that Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold. When the water is warm, he takes 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. To find the time it takes him to swim a mile in warm water, we need to calculate twice the time it takes in cold water and add 2 minutes.

Twice the time it takes in cold water is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that makes it 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim in hot water, we'll assume that the time for warm water is the same as the time for hot water, which is 34 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes. So, 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, and in 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew. To find the nephew's age, we need to first determine Shiloh's age in 7 years.

Shiloh's age in 7 years will be 44 + 7 = 51 years.

Since Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew in 7 years, we can set up an equation to find the nephew's age in 7 years:

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, and we need to find out how many roses he lacks to supply all the flower shops every month. First, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week. 

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. So, the total number of roses ordered per week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, that's 12 * 2 = 24 months. Multiply the monthly withdrawal by the number of months: $100 * 24 = $2400. This is the total amount she'll remove from her account.

Now, let's subtract this from her initial savings: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

"Konnichiwa, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each. That's easy: 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. The food truck spends $3.00 on a loaf of bread, which makes 10 sandwiches. They also spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches. So, the total cost is $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $70.00 (revenue) - $33.00 (cost) = $37.00.

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons to make one muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:
192 crayons / 8 crayons per muffin = 24 muffins

Now, let's calculate how much money Kate can make by selling each muffin for $1.50:
24 muffins * $1.50 per muffin = $36

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal of the old carpet, and installation of the new carpet.

First, let's find the area of the bedroom. The length is 18 feet and the width is 12 feet, so the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

Now, let's calculate the cost of each component:

- The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so for 216 square feet, it's 216 * $12 = $2592.
- The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so for 216 square feet, it's 216 * $2 = $432.
- The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so for 216 square feet, it's 216 * $4 = $864.
- The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so for 216 square feet, it's 216 * $34 = $7344.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

First, we need to find the total number of birds he saw over the week. On days one and two, Mack saw 50 birds. On day three, he didn't see any birds. Then, on days four and five, he saw 120 birds. On day six, he saw 20 birds, and on day seven, he saw 90 birds.

So, the total number of birds is: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280

Since Mack counted birds for 7 days, we'll divide the total number of birds by 7 to find the average.

Average birds per day: 280 / 7 = 40

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We start with a value of 20. To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations.

First, we find half the number, which is 20 / 2 = 10. Then, we add this to the starting value, giving us 20 + 10 = 30.

Next, we divide the resulting value by 5, which gives us 30 / 5 = 6.

Now, we subtract 12 from the starting value, which is 20 - 12 = 8.

Finally, we multiply the resulting value (6) by the starting value minus 12 (8), giving us 6 * 8 = 48.

Final answer: 48"

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's get to the problem at hand. Maggie's oven is malfunctioning, and we need to figure out the correct temperature setting for her recipe.

First, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off. We know that when Maggie sets it to 450, the actual temperature is 468. To find the percentage, we'll calculate the difference between the actual and set temperatures, then divide by the set temperature.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18. Now, let's calculate the percentage: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%. So, the oven is off by 4%.

Now that we know the percentage, we can find the correct temperature setting for Maggie's recipe, which calls for 520 degrees. Let's call the correct setting ""x"". Since the oven is off by 4%, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

We know the actual temperature should be 520, so we can set up the equation: x + 0.04x = 520. Combining like terms, we get 1.04x = 520. Dividing both sides by 1.04, we find that x = 500.

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many minutes it'll take Max to watch those two movies.

First, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, that's 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the hours to minutes, we get 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Adding the 5 minutes, that's 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, let's add the time for both movies: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

$76,000 * 0.3 = $22,800

Now, we subtract this from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value.
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

The combined value of the two houses is the sum of their individual values.
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of utensils:

Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36
Her friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84
Total utensils: 36 + 84 = 120

"Konnichiwa, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of one box of contacts after the discount. The original price is $100.00, and it's 10% off. To calculate the discount, we multiply the original price by 0.10, which gives us $10.00. So, the discounted price of one box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is $90.00 * 2 = $180.00.

Now, let's find out how many contacts he gets in total. One box contains 90 contacts, so 2 boxes contain 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of contacts. However, since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), we'll divide the total cost by the total number of contacts and then multiply by 2.

$180.00 ÷ 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact
$1.00 * 2 = $2.00 per pair of contacts

Now, let's calculate John's total hours. He worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which means he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. On Sunday, he worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Since they are paid $10 an hour, we can calculate their earnings. Jill earned 3 * $10 = $30, and John earned 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned, we divide the total calories by 200. That's 1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the result by 100 ml to find out how much water she needs. 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem at hand. We have a jar containing red, blue, and green jelly beans at the Burger Palace restaurant. The note on the jar states that it contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. We're also given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500.

To solve this, let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as B. Then, the number of red jelly beans would be 0.99B (1% fewer than blue), and the number of green jelly beans would be 1.01B (1% more than blue).

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of jelly beans:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide by 3:

B = 1500

Now, we can find the number of red jelly beans and the number of green jelly beans:

Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:

Day 2: 8 feet (doubled from 4 feet)
Day 3: 16 feet (doubled from 8 feet)
Day 4: 32 feet (doubled from 16 feet)

We want to find out when the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window. On Day 3, the beanstalk is still shorter than the window, but on Day 4, it's already 32 feet tall, which is taller than the window.

Now, let's multiply this by the amount John eats per day, which is 200 grams.

Protein content per day: 0.03 grams/gram * 200 grams = 6 grams of protein per day

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. To find his current age, we can use a variable, let's call it 'x'. This means 5 years ago, Jerry was x - 5 years old. Since he's twice as old now, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:
x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 'x' from both sides:
0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides:

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

We have a triangle with three angles, and we know that they add up to 180 degrees. We also know that one angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle. Let's call the smallest angle x.

So, the three angles are x, 2x, and 3x. Since they add up to 180 degrees, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

First, we need to find out how many times the tires rotate per mile. Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can divide 725 by 2 to get the rotations per mile.

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, let's calculate the total number of rotations per month. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so we multiply the rotations per mile by the miles driven per month.

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the rotations per month by 12 to get the rotations per year.

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we divide the total number of rotations by the rotations per year.

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

We know that the jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and the directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo, which will give you 120 washings. However, Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash. To find the cost of each pump, we need to first determine the total number of pumps in the bottle.

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings. This means that the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

Now, let's calculate the cost of each pump. The cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is 2400 cents. 

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = 2400 cents / 240 pumps

To figure out how much butter Juan needs, we'll break it down step by step. First, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, we'll multiply the amount of butter needed for 1 dozen by 4:
4 * 1/4 pound = 1 pound per day

Now, let's calculate the total amount of butter needed for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we'll multiply the daily amount by 7:
1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street. Since it's 150 meters long and it costs $194 per meter, the total cost is 150 * $194 = $29,100.

Next, let's calculate the cost of repaving Lewis' street. It's 490 meters long, so the total cost is 490 * $194 = $95,060.

Now, to find the difference, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

John initially received $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. To find the monthly funding for the first 5 months, we divide the initial funding by the number of months: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial monthly funding, which is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

The cost for the remaining 45 months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"Konnichiwa, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total number of posts the Reddit group will have in March.

First, we need to know the number of days in March, which is 31. Since each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, we can find the total posts per day from all members by multiplying the number of posts per day by the number of members.

Total posts per day from all members = 3 posts/day * 1000 members = 3000 posts/day

Now, let's find the total posts in March by multiplying the total posts per day by the number of days in March.

Total posts in March = 3000 posts/day * 31 days = 93,000 posts

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour, and he works 10 hours a day. To find out how much meat he sells in a day, we multiply the amount of meat he sells per hour by the number of hours he works:

15kg/hour * 10 hours = 150kg per day

Now, let's consider the weight of the bull, which is 750kg. To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from the bull, we divide the weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day:

750kg / 150kg per day = 5 days

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of seats in the auditorium. Since there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row.

Total number of seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were taken by them, so we calculate 1/4 of the total seats.

Seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by administrators from the total seats to find the remaining seats.

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Then, we find out how many seats were occupied by the parents. One-third of the remaining seats were taken by them, so we calculate 1/3 of the remaining seats.

Seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Finally, we subtract the seats occupied by parents from the remaining seats to find the seats occupied by students.

Seats occupied by students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

We know each DVD can be played 1000 times. There are two DVDs, and one has been played 356 times, while the other has been played 135 times.

To find out how many times each DVD can still be played, we subtract the number of times they've already been played from 1000. For the first DVD, that's 1000 - 356 = 644. For the second DVD, it's 1000 - 135 = 865.

Jim has a 20-pack of gum and chews 1 piece for every 2 hours he's at school. Since his school day is 8 hours long, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

On top of that, he chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, adding up to 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum chewed throughout the day.

Starting with 20 pieces, Jim now has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb per second. To convert this to Mb per hour, we need to do a couple of conversions.

First, we know that 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb. So, we can convert 20 kb to Mb by dividing by 1000. This gives us 20 kb / 1000 = 0.02 Mb per second.

Next, we need to convert seconds to hours. There are 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour. So, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down James' earnings from selling those used cars.

First, we need to find the cost price of each car. The company paid 30% of the selling price, which is $25,000. So, the cost price is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500.

Now, let's calculate the profit on each car. The profit is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 10% of $175,000, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

First, let's calculate the number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25:
100 * 0.25 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we multiply 25 by 0.6:
25 * 0.6 = 15

Since the remaining riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
25 - 15 = 10

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000 = $1600

Now, the price of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. So, I'll subtract $400 from the price of the gold jewel.

Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

To find the total price of all three jewels, I'll add the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

First, we need to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed. This gives us:

To find out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend before the cost exceeds $10 per class. We can do this by dividing the total cost by the maximum cost per class:
$60 ÷ $10 = 6 classes

This means Manny can attend a maximum of 6 classes before the cost exceeds $10 per class. Since there are 10 total classes, Manny can miss:
10 (total classes) - 6 (maximum classes he can attend) = 4 classes

Now, let's move on to the next day. The price per pomegranate increased to $30, and Sheila bought 20 pomegranates. The total cost would be 20 * $30 = $600. However, there was a 10% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount, we multiply $600 by 0.1, which gives us $60. So, the final price Sheila paid is $600 - $60 = $540.

To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we subtract the price Clara paid from the price Sheila paid: $540 - $398 = $142.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. To find the sales from green hats, we can set up a simple equation:

Sales from red hats = 1/2 * Sales from green hats
400 = 1/2 * Sales from green hats
Sales from green hats = 400 * 2
Sales from green hats = 800

Now, let's calculate the total sales for the first month:
Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales for the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales for the first month = 1200

Moving on to the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:
Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * Total sales for the first month
Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales for the second month = 900

Finally, let's find the total amount she made in two months:
Total amount she made in two months = Total sales for the first month + Total sales for the second month
Total amount she made in two months = 1200 + 900
Total amount she made in two months = 2100

James rented the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. Since he gets 1 hour free, he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost for the first paid hour is $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice as much as the previous one. So, the second paid hour costs 2 * $15 = $30, and the third paid hour costs 2 * $30 = $60.

Now, let's add up the costs: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

First, we need to find out how much money Sally received this week. We know her bank account had $200 at the start of the week and $420 at the end. To find the amount she received, we subtract the initial amount from the final amount: $420 - $200 = $220.

Now, we know Sally's expected wage is $300. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the amount she received from her expected wage: $300 - $220 = $80.

"Ohayou gozaimasu, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori needs, we first need to find out how many deviled egg halves she needs in total. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she's inviting 16 guests, we multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves per guest.

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Now, we know that 1 egg makes 2 deviled egg halves. So, to find the number of eggs needed, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 eggs

Finally, since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens needed.

24 eggs / 12 = 2

1/3 of 15 pages is 15 * 1/3 = 5 pages.

Since Shiela has already written 5 pages, she has 15 - 5 = 10 pages left to write.

To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day.

200 pages / 10 pages per day = 20 days

Since Mike finishes the book in 20 days and the deadline is 30 days, we subtract the number of days it took Mike to finish the book from the deadline to find out how many days before the deadline he finishes.

30 days - 20 days = 10 days

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the costs for James' plane.

First, the initial cost of the plane is $150,000. Then, there's the monthly hangar rental cost, which is $5,000. On top of that, James spends twice as much on fuel, so that's $5,000 * 2 = $10,000 per month.

To find the total monthly cost, we add the hangar rental and fuel costs: $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000. Since we want to know the cost for the first year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total cost for the first year: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Now, let's find the combined cooking time for pork and rice, which is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. The problem states that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

To find the total cooking time, we add the cooking time for each item: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have two types of nuts: almonds and walnuts. A pound of almonds costs $10, and a pound of walnuts costs $15. We want to find the cost difference between two mixtures.

Mixture 1 consists of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. To calculate the cost, we multiply the weight of each nut by its price per pound. For almonds, that's 1/2 * $10 = $5. For walnuts, it's 1/3 * $15 = $5. So, the total cost of Mixture 1 is $5 + $5 = $10.

Mixture 2 consists of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. Using the same calculation, the cost of almonds is 1/5 * $10 = $2, and the cost of walnuts is 1/3 * $15 = $5. The total cost of Mixture 2 is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two mixtures. We subtract the cost of Mixture 2 from the cost of Mixture 1: $10 - $7 = $3.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Lee has sheep and geese on his farm. Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20.

Let's use variables to represent the number of sheep (S) and the number of geese (G). We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1) The total number of legs: 4S + 2G = 70
2) The total number of heads: S + G = 20

To solve for S, we can multiply the second equation by 2, which gives us: 2S + 2G = 40

Now, let's subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate G:
(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
S = 15

The number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. Since it costs 20% more than the normal brand, we'll calculate 20% of the normal price. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, so 20% of that is 0.2 * $5 = $1. This means the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Next, we need to find out how much coffee Roger buys. He wants a week's worth, which is 7 days, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. So, he buys 7 pounds of coffee. At $6 per pound, the total cost of the coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

Finally, we add the cost of the donut, which is $2. So, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

Kassidy's amount = 3/4 * $120 = $90.

Now, we know Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount by adding $60 to Kassidy's amount.

Rayna's amount = $90 + $60 = $150.

Now that we have everyone's amounts, let's add them together: $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.

Let's denote the original length as 'x'. When Shania extends the dress by 50%, the new length becomes 1.5 times the original length. So, the length after extension is 1.5x. Adding the 20cm lace trim, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

Since the final length is 140cm, we can set up the equation:

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet, and their combined ages are 44. To solve this, we'll use a bit of algebra.

Let's say the age of one twin is T and the age of one triplet is t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation:

T = t + 7

Now, we know there are two twins and three triplets, so the total combined ages are 2T + 3t. We're told this equals 44, so we can write another equation:

2T + 3t = 44

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:

2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

2t + 14 + 3t = 44

Combine like terms:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

t = 6

First, let's calculate how many coins Rong saves in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year. After 10 years, Rong will have saved 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's calculate how many coins Neil saves. Since Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, we need to find 2/5 of 20, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. In a year, Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins. After 10 years, Neil will have saved 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have after 10 years, we add the number of coins Rong and Neil have saved: 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

John's dog needs 2 vaccines, which cost $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so we can write the equation:
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for x:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the price of that crate of fruit.

First, we need to find out the individual prices of the fruits. We know that one apple costs $0.5. Since a banana costs twice as much as an apple, the price of a banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1. Oranges are the most expensive, costing three times as much as a banana, so the price of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get the total price of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter.

First, we know there are 14 red squares. Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, we can count the number of squares to find the total area.

The comforter has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, which means there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

Lastly, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add up the number of squares: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many more chairs Mia needs for her restaurant.

First, we need to find the total number of people attending the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of people is:
42 + 15 = 57

Now, let's find out how many chairs Mia already has. We know she has 8 high chairs, and 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, the number of regular chairs is:
5 * 8 = 40

In total, Mia has 40 regular chairs and 8 high chairs, which is:
40 + 8 = 48 chairs

Since there are 57 people and 48 chairs, Mia needs to get more chairs to accommodate everyone. To find out how many more chairs she needs, we subtract the total number of chairs from the total number of people:
57 - 48 = 9

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have four students: Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50 points. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find out how many points Betty has, we need to calculate 30% of 50, which is 0.3 * 50 = 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Now, let's find out how many points Tom has. Tom has 30 points less than Betty, which means Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. To find out how many points Martha has, we multiply Tom's points by 3: 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Martha) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:

Now, let's calculate the total amount deducted from her paycheck: $1200.00 (retirement) + $480.00 (car payment) = $1680.00.

To find out how much she has left to spend, we subtract the total amount deducted from her paycheck: $2400.00 - $1680.00 = $720.00.

Pencils in the box = Total capacity - Missing pencils
Pencils in the box = 20 - 4
Pencils in the box = 16

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of pencils in the box. Since each pair has 2 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

Pairs of pencils = Pencils in the box / 2
Pairs of pencils = 16 / 2
Pairs of pencils = 8

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many fireworks the city is setting off. Since they have 15 boxes with 20 fireworks each, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of fireworks per box: 15 * 20 = 300.

Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, so we need to calculate 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4: 300 * 0.4 = 120. This means Hannah can see 120 of the city's fireworks.

In addition to the city's fireworks, Hannah will also set off some fireworks in her backyard. She has 3 boxes with 5 fireworks each, so we multiply the number of boxes by the number of fireworks per box: 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of city fireworks she can see to the number of fireworks she will set off: 120 + 15 = 135.

Each person has 2 drinks and 3 snacks. To find the total number of drinks and snacks, we multiply the number of people by the number of drinks and snacks per person. The total number of drinks is 20 * 2 = 40, and the total number of snacks is 20 * 3 = 60.

Now, we add the total number of drinks and snacks to find the total number of items: 40 (drinks) + 60 (snacks) = 100.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, let's add the capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks: 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

The three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. To find out how many pounds Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the total weight that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total weight that the three trucks can carry: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem. We have a group of friends consisting of 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. We're also told that each female ate 3 dumplings.

To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males and females. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Now, let's move on to the males. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. There are 8 males, including Larry. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings Larry cooked is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females, which is 18 + 32 = 50.

Speed of turtle = Speed of cat / 5
Speed of turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Amount raised per hour = $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal of $6300. We can do this by dividing the total amount by the amount raised per hour.

Total number of hours = Total amount / Amount raised per hour
Total number of hours = $6300 / $700 per hour
Total number of hours = 9 hours.

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. Candy has 15 light blue, 45 dark blue, 40 light green, and 50 dark green spools. So, the total number of spools is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of blue spools. Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We start with 5000 people lined up at the polling station. By midday, 2/5 of them had voted. To find out how many people that is, we multiply 5000 by 2/5.

(2/5) * 5000 = 2000

So, 2000 people had voted by midday. To find the number of people remaining, we subtract 2000 from the initial 5000.

5000 - 2000 = 3000

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. We multiply 3000 by 2/3 to find out how many people that is.

(2/3) * 3000 = 2000

Now, we add the people who voted by midday (2000) to the people who voted by 16:00 (2000) to find the total number of people who had voted.

2000 + 2000 = 4000

Finally, we subtract the total number of people who had voted from the initial 5000 to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

5000 - 4000 = 1000

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many packs of gum Parker will need.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, and he wants to know how many packs he'll need to last him 30 days. A pack of gum has 15 pieces of chewing gum per pack.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days:
4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack to find out how many packs he'll need:
120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's get started on solving this problem.

To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required. There are 9 kids who want 2 s'mores each, and 6 adults who want 1 s'more each.

For the kids: 9 kids * 2 s'mores/kid = 18 s'mores
For the adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 s'mores
Total s'mores needed: 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores, we can divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed:
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Given that there are 3 sleeves in a box, we can see that the number of sleeves needed is equal to the number of sleeves in a box. Therefore, we need:

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We know Dora is 15 years old. To find her father's age, we need to calculate eight more than twice Dora's age. That would be 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Now, let's find Dora's mother's age. We know she is four years younger than Dora's father, so her age is 38 - 4 = 34 years.

To find the total combined age, we add the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
15 + 38 + 34 = 87

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's books.

Cindy has two books that weigh 2 pounds each, which are her math and science books. So, their total weight is 2 * 2 = 4 pounds.

Her French book weighs 4 pounds, and her English book weighs 3 pounds. Now, let's consider her history book, which weighs twice as much as her English book. That means her history book weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

To find the total weight, we'll add the weights of all her books: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that candidate A got 20% of the votes. To find the number of votes, we multiply 100 (the total number of voters) by 0.2 (which is the same as 20%). This gives us 20 votes for candidate A.

Next, we're told that candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. To find this, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes, which is 0.5 * 20 = 10 votes. Then, we add this to candidate A's votes to get candidate B's total: 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we add the votes for candidates A and B: 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Since there are 100 voters in total, we subtract the votes for candidates A and B from the total to find the votes for candidate C: 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. To find out how many apples Beck has, we subtract 23 from 100: 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. This means Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has: 90 - 87 = 3.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many ounces of water Peter has left.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube. Peter makes 3 giant cubes that use 4 ounces per cube, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 ounces. He also makes 7 medium cubes that use 2 ounces per cube, which is 7 * 2 = 14 ounces. Lastly, he makes 8 small cubes that use 1/2 an ounce per cube, so that's 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how many ounces he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

Now, we know Alice has 6 more books than Steven. To find out how many books Alice has, we can add 6 to Steven's books. So, Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

Finally, to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we can subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has: 20 - 16 = 4.

Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5 = $50
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3 = $48
Total amount spent = $50 + $48 = $98

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have a class of 50 students with various hobbies. 10 students like to bake, and 5 students like to play basketball. The rest of the students either like to play video games or play music.

First, let's find out how many students like to play music. We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, let's find out how many students like to play video games or play music. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who like to bake and play basketball from the total number of students. So, 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 students like to play video games or play music.

Since we know that 10 students like to play music, we can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting 10 from 35. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

1/3 of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4 birds.

So, Jeremy scared away 4 birds. The number of birds left is 12 - 4 = 8.

Later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. The total number of birds now is 8 + 20 = 28.

We know that there are two classes with a total of 80 students, and each class has the same number of students. To find the number of students in each class, we divide the total number of students by 2.

80 ÷ 2 = 40 students per class

Now, we're told that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4.

40 × 0.4 = 16 girls per class

Since the remaining students are boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24

So, there are 24 boys in each class.

To find out how many animals she'll groom each day, we need to calculate the total number of animals first.

8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals

Since Melissa wants to split the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, we'll divide the total number of animals by 7.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The first amusement park charges $26 per adult and $12 per child. Since there are 2 adults and 2 children, the total cost would be:
- 2 adults: 2 * $26 = $52
- 2 children: 2 * $12 = $24
Total cost for the first park: $52 + $24 = $76

The second amusement park charges $14 per adult and $10 per child. For Jake's family, the total cost would be:
- 2 adults: 2 * $14 = $28
- 2 children: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second park: $28 + $20 = $48

Candy's chair rental business has different rental rates for weekdays and weekends. On weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day, and on weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. We need to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in a week. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.

- Weekdays: 60 chairs/day * 5 days = 300 chairs
- Weekends: 100 chairs/day * 2 days = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week = 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, let's find the total number of weeks in two 4-week months. Since each month has 4 weeks, two months will have:
- 2 months * 4 weeks/month = 8 weeks

Finally, we multiply the total chairs rented in a week by the number of weeks:
- 500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

Initial number of glasses: 8 dozen * 12 = 96 glasses
Initial number of plates: 4 dozen * 12 = 48 plates

Total initial items: 96 glasses + 48 plates = 144 items

Now, let's subtract the number of broken items from the total initial items. We know that 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken.

Total broken items: 10 glasses + 6 plates = 16 items

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.9, which equals 27. Since 3 small stickers are worth 1 large button, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Now, Lorraine has 3 small stickers left and 9 large buttons. She then trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

Lorraine now has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons (9 + 20), and 20 large stickers left. She trades the remaining large stickers for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

In total, Lorraine has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons, and 60 small buttons. We can convert the large buttons to small buttons since 1 large button is worth 3 small buttons. So, 29 large buttons equal 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons. Adding these to the 60 small buttons, she has 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

Since 1 small sticker is worth 1 small button, we can convert the small stickers to small buttons. Lorraine has 3 small stickers, which is equivalent to 3 small buttons. Adding these to the 147 small buttons, she has 147 + 3 = 150 small buttons.

However, we need to find the total number of buttons, not just small buttons. Since we already know she has 29 large buttons, we can add the equivalent of these large buttons in small buttons to the small buttons she has. But we already did that. So we just need to add the 3 small stickers converted to small buttons to the 87 small buttons from the 29 large buttons and the 60 small buttons. But we did that too. So the answer is the 29 large buttons and the 147 small buttons. Since the question asks for the total number of buttons, we can just add the 29 large buttons to the 147 small buttons.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Joey's football matches for the week.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday and 1 match on Friday. On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add up the matches: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem. We have a council with 33 members, and they're voting on a new regulation. The vote passes with twice as many votes in favor as there are against it. To solve this, I'll use a simple equation.

Let's say the number of votes against the regulation is x. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number against, the number of votes in favor is 2x. The total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and against, which is 2x + x = 3x.

Since the total number of council members is 33, we can set up the equation 3x = 33. To solve for x, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 33 / 3
x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:
Votes in favor = 2x
Votes in favor = 2 * 11
Votes in favor = 22

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many shirts Krissa needs to order for her preschool students.

First, we know 11 students need size extra-small. Since twice as many students need size small as extra small, that's 2 * 11 = 22 students.

Next, we're told four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, that's 22 - 4 = 18 students.

Now, half as many students need size large as size medium, which is 18 / 2 = 9 students.

Lastly, six more students need size extra-large than large, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 students.

To find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we add up the number of students for each size:
11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. To find the price of the bag after the discount, we need to calculate the discount amount first. 

The bag is marked at $140, and it has a 5% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage. 

Discount amount: $140 * 0.05 = $7

Now, let's subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the price after the discount.

Price after discount: $140 - $7 = $133

First, let's find the total number of songs: 300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs. Since each song is 10 hours long, we multiply the total number of songs by the duration of each song: 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60,000 hours.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many people think horse #2 will win. Since 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 people

Now, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 will win from the total number of people to find the remaining people:

50 - 10 = 40 people

Next, we're told that 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Let's calculate this:

60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people

Finally, to find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

40 - 24 = 16 people

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply the number of Pomeranian girls by 3.

6 Pomeranian girls * 3 = 18 Pomeranians

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Since we have 18 Pomeranians, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of puppies. Let's call the total number of puppies ""x"". We can write the proportion as:

(2/3)x = 18

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 18 * (3/2)
x = 27

So, Jana has a total of 27 puppies.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the three homes will need a total of 250 cases of shingles. We also know the relationship between the number of cases needed for each house. The first house needs 1/2 of the second, and the third needs double the first.

Let's denote the number of cases needed for the first house as x. Then, the second house needs 2x (since it's double the first), and the third house needs 2x (since it's double the first).

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of cases needed:
x + 2x + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:
5x = 250

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 50

Now, we know the third house needs 2x, which is 2 * 50 = 100 cases of shingles.

George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas. To find the number of pears, we need to calculate 45% of 200 and add that to the number of bananas.

First, let's find 45% of 200. To do this, we multiply 200 by 0.45.
200 * 0.45 = 90

Now, we add 90 to the number of bananas to find the number of pears.
200 + 90 = 290

So, George has 290 pears. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Ezra read 300 books in one hour, and he read twice as many books as Ahmed. To find out how many books Ahmed read, we can divide Ezra's total by 2.

Ahmed's total books = Ezra's total books / 2
Ahmed's total books = 300 / 2
Ahmed's total books = 150

Now, we know Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so we need to add those to his initial total.

Ezra's new total = Initial total + Additional books
Ezra's new total = 300 + 150
Ezra's new total = 450

To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we add their individual totals.

Total books = Ezra's new total + Ahmed's total

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Tanya's earnings for those two days of teaching.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, that's 5 * $15 = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also gets a $5 bonus. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, that's 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches 2 classes, which is less than 3, she doesn't get the $5 bonus. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we need to calculate the total sales of each type. For vanilla scents, that's 4 scents * 5 sales each = 20 sales. For fruity scents, that's 8 scents * 2 sales each = 16 sales.

Now, let's find the difference in sales: 20 (vanilla sales) - 16 (fruity sales) = 4.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell, and he needs to make $75 from them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we can divide the amount he needs to make by the number of ears of corn: $75 / 25 = $3.

Out of the remaining 9 hours, she spends 1/3 playing video games. To find out how many hours that is, we multiply 9 by 1/3, which is 3 hours.

Now, let's subtract the time spent playing video games from the remaining time: 9 - 3 = 6 hours. This is the time Tatiana spends playing soccer.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Jack's trip to the museum.

First, we need to calculate the time Jack spends driving to and from the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. To find the time, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time spent driving to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home at the same speed, the time spent driving back is also 2 hours. So, the total time spent driving is 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

We also know that Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. To find the total time he's gone from home, we add the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

Total time = Time spent driving + Time spent at the museum

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Mike's movie collection and calculate the cost of replacing it with digital versions.

Mike has 600 movies in total. A third of these movies are part of a series, which can be purchased at a discounted rate. To find the number of movies in series, we'll divide the total number of movies by 3:
600 ÷ 3 = 200 movies in series

Since these movies can be purchased as a series, the cost is 1/6 of a normal movie, which is $10. So, the cost per movie in a series is:
$10 ÷ 6 = $1.67 per movie
The total cost for the series movies is:
200 movies × $1.67 per movie = $334

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of these movies are older movies, which cost $5 each. To find the number of older movies, we'll multiply the remaining movies by 0.4:
400 × 0.4 = 160 older movies
The total cost for the older movies is:
160 movies × $5 per movie = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies, which cost $10 each. To find the number of normal movies, we'll subtract the older movies from the remaining movies:
400 - 160 = 240 normal movies
The total cost for the normal movies is:
240 movies × $10 per movie = $2400

"I'd be happy to help you with that problem.

So, let's break it down step by step. The Llesis family drove and hiked a total of 6 hours to reach their vacation spot. We know they drove for some time and hiked for 1.5 hours. To find the time they drove, we subtract the hiking time from the total time: 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Now, we know their average driving speed is 50 miles per hour. To find the distance they drove, we multiply their driving speed by the time they drove: 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

Next, we need to find their hiking speed. We're told it's 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 less than that is 20 miles per hour.

Now that we know their hiking speed, we can find the distance they hiked by multiplying their hiking speed by the time they hiked: 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Finally, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

"Hey there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ava and Emma are competing in a video game, and we need to find the difference between their scores. We know that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries, but finishes the level 4 seconds slower.

Let's calculate the points for each action:
- Jumping on an enemy: 10 points
- Collecting a berry: 5 points
- Time left on the timer: 30 points per second

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies, she gets 8 * 10 = 80 more points than Emma from enemies. She also collects 3 more berries, which gives her 3 * 5 = 15 more points from berries.

However, Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, which means she loses 4 * 30 = 120 points from the timer.

Now, let's calculate the net difference in points:
80 (from enemies) + 15 (from berries) - 120 (from timer) = -25

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem. We know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars in total. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas.

So, the cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 30 = 34 dollars. Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 34 / 2 = 17 dollars.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

We know Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. He then bought 17 more fish, and after adding them to his pond, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, the total number of white fish is x + 4 (he already had 4 white fish). The total number of orange fish is 3 + (17 - x), since he bought 17 fish in total.

We can set up an equation based on the fact that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:

2(x + 4) = 3 + (17 - x)

Expanding the equation, we get:

2x + 8 = 20 - x

Now, let's solve for x:

2x + x = 20 - 8
3x = 12
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

However, this doesn't seem to work, as 2(4 + 4) is not equal to 3 + (17 - 4). Let's try another approach.

We know that the total number of orange fish is 2 times the total number of white fish. Since Bob already had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish, the number of orange fish he bought is 2 times the number of white fish he bought, minus 3 (to account for the initial 3 orange fish), plus 3 (to account for the initial 3 orange fish being part of the total).

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Then, the number of orange fish he bought is 2x - 3 + 3 = 2x.

We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - x.

Since 2x = 17 - x, we can solve for x:

2x + x = 17
3x = 17
x = 17 / 3
x = 5.67

However, since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we need to round down to the nearest whole number that would make the total number of fish Bob bought an integer. If x = 5, then the number of orange fish he bought is 2x = 2 * 5 = 10. The total number of fish he bought is 5 + 10 = 15, which is less than 17.

If x = 6, then the number of orange fish he bought is 2x = 2 * 6 = 12. The total number of fish he bought is 6 + 11 = 17, which is correct.

First, we need to find out the total distance Andy drives in a week. Since he drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 2 x 5 = 10 miles per day.

Now, let's calculate the total distance he drives in a week: 10 miles/day x 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we need to find out how much gas his car uses in a week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money his car is consuming per week. The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money his car is consuming per week is 5 gallons/week x $3/gallon = $15/week.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carrie received 10 twenties and 140 quarters from her aunt. We need to find out how much she spent for lunch, given that she used all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties.

First, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount spent from the quarters is:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, and Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties, we can find the total amount spent from the twenties as follows:
3/5 * 10 * $20 = 3/5 * $200 = $120

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount spent:
$35 + $120 = $155

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his garden.

First, we need to find out how many tomatoes he'll get. Since each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes and he has 5 plants, the total number of tomatoes is 22 * 5 = 110.

Next, we'll calculate the number of eggplants. Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and he has 8 plants, so the total number of eggplants is 4 * 8 = 32.

Now, let's add the number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits: 110 + 32 = 142.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem. We know that one-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

For the smart TVs, we multiply 1/4 by the total number of TVs sold, which is 40. So, 1/4 * 40 = 10 smart TVs.

For the analog TVs, we multiply 1/8 by the total number of TVs sold, which is 40. So, 1/8 * 40 = 5 analog TVs.

Now, let's add the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold: 10 + 5 = 15.

Since the rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs, we subtract the total number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem. John is trying to raise money for a school trip that costs $300. Luckily, the school is covering half the cost. To find out how much the school is contributing, we can divide the total cost by 2.

$300 ÷ 2 = $150

So, the school is covering $150. Now, let's subtract the school's contribution and the money John already has ($50) from the total cost to find out how much he's missing.

$300 (total cost) - $150 (school's contribution) - $50 (John's money) = $100

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing.

First, we need to find out the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder at night compared to the day, we subtract 33 from the daytime temperature of 45 degrees.

Nighttime temperature: 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, so we need to find out how many degrees the temperature needs to rise to reach 32 degrees.

Temperature rise needed: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed, we divide the temperature rise needed by the heat provided by each log.

Number of logs needed: 20 / 5 = 4

"Konnichiwa, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We have 90 people who need to be split into 9-person groups. To find the number of groups, we'll divide the total number of people by the number of people per group.

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Now, 3/5 of these groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. To find the number of groups that brought seashells, we'll multiply the total number of groups by 3/5.

Number of groups that brought seashells = Total number of groups * 3/5
= 10 * 3/5
= 6

Since each group has 9 members, the total number of people who brought seashells is:

Number of people who brought seashells = Number of groups that brought seashells * Number of people per group
= 6 * 9
= 54

Each of these people brought 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells is:

Total number of seashells = Number of people who brought seashells * Number of seashells per person
= 54 * 2
= 108

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many people are on the train.

We start with 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172. That leaves us with 172 - 47 = 125 people. Then, 13 more people get on, so we add 13 to 125, which gives us 125 + 13 = 138 people.

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138. That gives us 138 - 38 = 100 people.

Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day, and each bottle cap is worth $0.25. To find the total amount of money he makes, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds in a month by the value of each bottle cap.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottle caps he finds in a month:
10 bottle caps/day * 30 days = 300 bottle caps

Now, let's multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap:
300 bottle caps * $0.25/bottle cap = $75

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Jamie's earnings for last Tuesday.

Jamie earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work each day. For the regular 8 hours, her earnings are:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

If she needs to work additional hours, she's paid a special hourly rate that's 150% of her regular rate. To find this rate, we multiply her regular rate by 1.5:
$20/hour * 1.5 = $30/hour

Since Jamie worked 11 hours, she worked 3 hours at the special rate. Her earnings for these hours are:
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

To find her total earnings, we add her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours:

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price: $40 - $10 = $30.

Mike pays with a $50 bill, so we subtract the discounted price from $50 to find out how much money he'll have left over: $50 - $30 = $20.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of employees after three months. The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after three months, the total number of employees will be:

200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3)
= 200 + 60
= 260

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month. Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, so the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month is:

260 (total employees) * 4000 (monthly salary per employee)
= 1,040,000

Since we want to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to multiply the monthly salary by 3:

1,040,000 (monthly salary) * 3 (number of months)
= 3,120,000

Now, let's find out Sally's hourly wage. It's $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, which is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, so we can calculate their total earnings:

Billy's earnings: 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's earnings: 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

Total number of students: 25 students/class * 40 classes = 1000 students
Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Total number of teachers: 3 teachers/class * 40 classes = 120 teachers
Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Bubbles has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. To find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has, we'll add them up:
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let's assume she needs to buy x stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Kris's gaming schedule to figure out how many hours she still needs to play to earn that achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, that's 2 * 7 = 14 days. So, she plays 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours in those 2 weeks.

Then, she plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Adding those together, Kris has played a total of 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

We have two cars, one traveling at 60 miles per hour and the other at 70 miles per hour. The second car passes the first car, and we want to find out how many miles will separate them after 2 hours.

To do this, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours. The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will cover a distance of:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will cover a distance of:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Now, to find the distance between the two cars, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, and 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed. We also know that the 400 fifth graders had a pass rate that was twice the fourth graders' pass rate.

To find the pass rate of the fifth graders, we need to calculate the pass rate of the fourth graders first. The pass rate of the fourth graders is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. Since the pass rate of the fifth graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth graders, it is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%.

Now, let's find the number of fifth graders who passed. We can do this by multiplying the total number of fifth graders (400) by their pass rate (0.8). This gives us 400 * 0.8 = 320.

Next, we need to find the total number of students who passed. We can do this by adding the number of third graders who passed (340), the number of fourth graders who passed (40), and the number of fifth graders who passed (320). This gives us 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

Finally, we need to find the total number of students. We can do this by adding the number of third graders (500), the number of fourth graders (100), and the number of fifth graders (400). This gives us 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

Now, we can find the overall pass rate by dividing the total number of students who passed (700) by the total number of students (1000). This gives us 700/1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts

The 16 students who drank 2 quarts each consumed a total of:
16 * 2 = 32 quarts

So, the total amount of tea consumed is:
6 + 32 = 38 quarts

Now, let's add the remaining amount of tea (10 quarts) to the total amount consumed:
38 + 10 = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea to gallons by dividing by 4:

To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial amount. 

Marshmallows used and dropped = 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21
Marshmallows left = 35 (initial) - 21 (used and dropped) = 14

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter, so he'll use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Now, let's add up the total number of quarters used: 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Tanya makes a salt scrub using salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She fills a 10-ounce jar each time. We know that she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. Also, she uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as 'x'. Then the amount of fragrance is also 'x', the amount of salt is '2x', the amount of sugar is '2x', and the amount of oil is '4x' (twice the amount of salt).

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10

Combine like terms:
10x = 10

Since we need the total time in minutes, we multiply the total hours by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the school parking lot. Then, 20 more cars were added during the first break. To find the total number of cars before lunch break, we simply add these two numbers together: 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, we know that 1/2 of the cars left during lunch break. To find the number of cars that remained, we need to divide the total number of cars before lunch break by 2. So, 70 / 2 = 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down John's weekly earnings.

John completes 30 cycles of work each day, and each cycle consists of 5 tasks that pay $1.20 per task. To find out his daily earnings, we need to calculate the total amount he earns per cycle and then multiply it by the number of cycles he does in a day.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, so the total amount he earns per cycle is:
5 tasks * $1.20 per task = $6 per cycle

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are:
$6 per cycle * 30 cycles = $180 per day

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:
$180 per day * 7 days = $1260

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game, Julie's score in the first game was 14 - 4 = 10 points.

Now, let's move on to the second game. Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. So, Sasha's score in the second game was 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

To find out how many more tins of cat food Kimberly bought than dog food, we need to calculate the total number of tins of each type of food.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food. Since each package contains 11 tins, and Kimberly bought 8 packages, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food. Since each package contains 6 tins, and Kimberly bought 6 packages, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food: 
88 - 36 = 52.

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem and find out how many cards Becca has.

We know that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 cards. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.

Let's start by representing the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

Now, we can set up an equation using the total number of cards:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

And the number of cards Becca has:
Becca has 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards

Becca has 153 cards."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Cindy has 5 green eggs. She has twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she has 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, which means she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, she has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color to find the total number of eggs:
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost per pound is:
4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40

The shipping company also charges $0.08 per mile, and the distribution center is 20 miles away, so the cost per mile is:
20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60

Now, let's add the cost per pound and the cost per mile to get the total shipping cost:
$1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32. So, the refund amount is:
75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24.00

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
Total loss = Book cost - Refund amount + Shipping cost
Total loss = $32 - $24.00 + $3.00
Total loss = $11.00

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Boris's chocolate production.

Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week. In the second week, he produces half as much, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. Then, in the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"Hey there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Britany's TikTok activities and calculate the time she spends on them in a month.

First, Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, she spends 18 * 4 = 72 minutes per week recording videos. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 72 * 4 = 288 minutes per month recording videos.

Next, Britany spends 2 hours per week writing amateur songs. In a month, that's 2 * 4 = 8 hours. To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60, so 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per month.

Lastly, Britany spends 15 minutes per day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. That's 15 * 6 = 90 minutes per week. In a month, she spends 90 * 4 = 360 minutes on makeup.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity: 288 + 480 + 360 = 1128 minutes.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the installation costs for Angela.

The interior design firm's initial installation package includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures for $129.00. Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that need to be installed.

First, let's calculate the number of additional items: 
- Mirrors: 6 (Angela's) - 4 (initial package) = 2 additional mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 (Angela's) - 1 (initial package) = 1 additional chandelier
- Pictures: 20 (Angela's) - 10 (initial package) = 10 additional pictures

The cost of these additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost for the extra items is:
2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00
Total cost for additional items = $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Now, let's add the initial installation cost to the cost of the additional items:
$129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

"Hello there, friend. I'm Yumi, and I'm here to help you solve this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, which means Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. So, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Mason's bike journey to find the total distance he traveled.

Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour, and he travels for 4 hours initially. To find the distance, we multiply his speed by the time: 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles.

After taking a rest, Mason continues his journey for another 6 hours. We calculate the distance for this part of the journey in the same way: 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles.

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance Mason traveled: 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into this problem together.

We're given that 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to cross a highway. To find the time it would take one kangaroo, we multiply the total time by the number of kangaroos, which gives us 18 * 3 = 54 hours for one kangaroo.

Now, we know that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means they're a bit slower, so they'll take longer to cross the highway. Since they're half as fast, they'll take twice as long as a kangaroo. Therefore, one turtle would take 54 * 2 = 108 hours.

The question asks about four turtles, but since they're all traveling at the same speed, the time it takes them to cross the highway will be the same as the time it takes one turtle. So, the answer is still 108 hours.

Erika wants a laptop that costs $600, but she can get a $200 discount if she trades in her old laptop. So, the new price of the laptop is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has some money from her part-time job, which is $150, and her mom gave her $80 to help out. That's a total of $150 + $80 = $230.

We know Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has $400 - $50 = $350.

Now, let's subtract the money she got from her job and her mom from the total amount she has: $350 - $230 = $120.

Now, let's add those together to get the total number of slices: 15 (large) + 15 (small) = 30 slices.

Adam ate 15 slices, so to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the slices he ate from the total: 30 - 15 = 15.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used up. We multiply 1/3 by the original length of 12 mm: 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used up. We multiply 1/2 by the original length of 12 mm: 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm.

Now, let's talk about the dishes. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, which means Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add them up:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built so far. This means they will build 2 * 48 = 96 new homes. To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to add the homes built in the first two years (48) to the homes built in the third year (96). 

So, the total number of homes built is 48 + 96 = 144.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have four people: a brother, a sister, you, and your mom. Let's denote the brother's age as B, the sister's age as S, your age as Y, and your mom's age as M.

We know that you are three years younger than your brother, so we can write an equation:
Y = B - 3

We also know that you are 2 years older than your sister, so we can write another equation:
Y = S + 2

Now, let's talk about your mom's age. It's one less than three times your brother's age, so we can write:
M = 3B - 1

When we add all your ages, we get 87. So, we can write the equation:
B + Y + S + M = 87

Now, let's substitute the expressions for Y and M from the previous equations:
B + (B - 3) + (Y - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Since Y = B - 3, we can substitute this expression for Y in the equation above:
B + (B - 3) + ((B - 3) - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
B + B - 3 + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87

Combine like terms again:
5B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:
5B = 96

Divide by 5:
B = 19.2

Since B must be a whole number, we'll try both 19 and 20 to see which one works.

If B = 20:
Y = B - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17
S = Y - 2 = 17 - 2 = 15
M = 3B - 1 = 3(20) - 1 = 59

B + Y + S + M = 20 + 17 + 15 + 35 = 87 (this works)

So, I think I've found the answer!

On day 1, the 10 infected people will infect 10 * 6 = 60 others. So, the total number of infected people on day 1 is 10 (initial) + 60 = 70.

On day 2, the 70 infected people will infect 70 * 6 = 420 others. So, the total number of infected people on day 2 is 70 (previous) + 420 = 490.

On day 3, the 490 infected people will infect 490 * 6 = 2940 others. So, the total number of infected people on day 3 is 490 (previous) + 2940 = 3430.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Rafaela received tips from 40 customers, and each customer gave her $20. To find the total amount of money Rafaela received, we multiply the number of customers by the tip amount. 
40 customers * $20 per customer = $800

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Julieta received. We know that Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. 
10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80
So Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720

The total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is $800 + $720 = $1520

Jennifer bought 12 oranges from the market. She gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. Her only boy got 3 oranges, so in total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total oranges given to her children from the total oranges she bought:
12 - 9 = 3

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month, so in a year, she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, which means she earns 1 badge every 2 months. To find out how many badges Amber earns in a year, we can divide 12 months by 2, which gives us 6 badges.

Wendy, on the other hand, earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, we multiply the number of badges Claire earns in a year (12) by 3, which gives us 36 badges.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year:

36 (Wendy's badges) - 6 (Amber's badges) = 30

Paige bakes 2 banana bread loaves per hour, and she baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. So, she baked 5 * 2 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Since each slice is sold for 50 cents, or $0.50, we can multiply the number of slices by the price per slice to find the total amount raised: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that Gretchen has some coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. We're also given that she has 70 gold coins. To find the total number of coins, we need to find the number of silver coins first.

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can subtract 30 from the number of gold coins to find the number of silver coins. So, the number of silver coins is 70 - 30 = 40.

Now, let's add the number of gold coins and silver coins to find the total number of coins. Total number of coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) = 110.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the bumper car rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Next, they have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. So, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, let's add up the number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

The rink has a total of 75 cars, and we want to find out how many yellow cars they have. To do this, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have a total of 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's use variables to represent the number of books each person has. We'll say Anne has A books, Sofie has S books, and Fawn has F books.

Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, we can write an equation: S = A + 25.

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write another equation: A = F - 12.

Now, we can substitute the expression for A into the first equation to get: S = (F - 12) + 25.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation: A + S + F = 85.

Substituting the expressions we found earlier, we get: (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) + F = 85.

Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84.

Divide by 3: F = 28.

Fawn has 28 books.

Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. She also bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes. To find the weight of the sweet potatoes, we multiply the weight of the potatoes by 2. So, the sweet potatoes weigh 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

Now, let's find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. To find the weight of the carrots, we subtract 3 from the weight of the sweet potatoes. So, the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Now, we know that one 3-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes Greg needs, we'll divide the total number of jello cups by the number of cups one box can make:
120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Keenan's monthly share = 40% of $400
Keenan's monthly share = 0.4 * $400
Keenan's monthly share = $160

Tobias started with 60 pizza pieces. On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the pieces. To find out how many pieces that is, we multiply 60 by 2/5:
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To find out how many pieces that is, we multiply 26 by 7/13:
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add the pieces he ate each day:

To find out how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to figure out how many chickens he plans to sell and how much he will make from selling them.

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. 
3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

He plans to sell the chickens at $50 per chicken and make a profit of $2000. 
So, the total amount he will make from selling the chickens is the cost price plus the profit. 
Let's call the cost price x. 
Then, the selling price is x + $2000.

The selling price per chicken is $50, so the total selling price is 180 * $50 = $9000.

We know that the total selling price is the cost price plus the profit, so we can set up the equation:
x + $2000 = $9000

Subtracting $2000 from both sides gives us:
x = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Kelly's grocery shopping expenses to see how much she has left in her budget.

First, we know the 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, each costing twice as much as a pack of bacon, we need to find the cost of one pack of bacon. To do this, we divide the total cost of bacon ($10) by the number of packs (5), which gives us $2 per pack. Since the chicken costs twice as much, one packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4. The total cost of 6 packets of chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

Next, we have 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4. So, the total cost of strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12. Kelly also has 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. Half of $4 is $2, so the total cost of apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60

65 minutes (total runtime) - 15 minutes (encore) = 50 minutes

We also know that she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, and the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, we can assume that's for one mowing.

So, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times, which would be 3 * $6 = $18. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times, which would be 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's add up the money she made from mowing lawns: $6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) + $30 (Alba) = $54.

"Ohayou gozaimasu, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this cookie problem together.

Susan made 100 cookies and wants to divide them equally among her 6 nephews. However, her husband sneaked 4 cookies before she could package them. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to subtract the cookies taken by Susan's husband from the total number of cookies and then divide the result by the number of nephews.

First, let's subtract the cookies taken by Susan's husband: 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left. Now, we'll divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews: 96 ÷ 6 = 16 cookies per nephew.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Denise read 10 pages yesterday, and today she read 5 more than Daniel's 13 pages from yesterday. So, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. In total, Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages.

On the other hand, Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and didn't read any pages today. So, his total is 13 pages.

Now, let's find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel. We subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 28 - 13 = 15.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. He's an adult, and he'll be eating with his adult wife and their two children. Since everyone eats one bowl at a meal, we need to figure out how many bowls will be left over.

The adults (Calvin and his wife) will eat 2 bowls, which is equivalent to 4 child bowls (since 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls). The 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. So, the total number of child bowls eaten is 4 + 2 = 6.

The leftover soup is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls. Since there are 2 children, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate how much William spent at the educational shop.

First, we need to find the total cost of the notebooks. Since each notebook costs $1.50 and William bought 5, we multiply the cost by the number of notebooks: 5 x $1.50 = $7.50.

Next, we add the cost of the ballpen, which is $0.50.

So, the total amount William spent is $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how much material Jo needs to make those face masks.

First, we need to calculate the material needed for the small masks. Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. To make 20 small masks, she would need:
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 * 2 yards = 10 yards

Next, we calculate the material needed for the large masks. Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. To make 8 large masks, she would need:
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 2.67 * 2.25 yards = 6 yards

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

"Hey there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem. Deepa has seen each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies three times in the theatre, and she's spent a total of $216.

To find the average price she paid per ticket, we need to calculate the total number of tickets she bought. Since she saw each movie three times, we multiply the number of movies by 3.

Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 times/movie = 27 tickets

Now, we divide the total amount she spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Harold's daily schedule to find out how much free time he has left.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night, which is a good amount of rest. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours. On top of that, he walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

To find out his free time, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on these activities and subtract that from 24 hours (the total hours in a day). So, let's add up the hours: 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

Now, subtracting the total hours spent on other activities from 24 hours, we get: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

We know Duncan's current age is 60. To find Adam's age, we need to work backwards. Eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

We're also told that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Let's use this information to find Adam's current age. If we let Adam's current age be A, then four years ago, Adam was A - 4 years old.

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can set up the equation:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

52 = 2A - 8

Adding 8 to both sides, we get:

60 = 2A

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

A = 30

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is 30 minutes. To find out how many bottles he drinks while solving the extreme sudoku puzzle, we need to calculate the total time he spends on it.

First, we know that a normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. Since an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, we multiply 45 minutes by 4:
45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes

Now, we divide the total time by the time interval at which John drinks a bottle of water, which is 30 minutes:
180 minutes / 30 minutes = 6

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving the extreme sudoku puzzle.

He threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons, and 20 of the balloons were red.

First, let's calculate how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons. Since there were 20 red balloons, and 2 pieces of bologna were thrown at each, that's 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna.

Now, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total number of pieces thrown: 58 - 40 = 18. This means 18 pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can divide the total number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3 to find the number of yellow balloons: 18 / 3 = 6.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in a month. Since he drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, we can multiply the miles driven per day by the number of days in a month.

Total miles driven in a month = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles driven in a month = 3000 miles

Now, we know that Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs, we can divide the total miles driven by the miles required for a tune-up.

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven in a month / miles required for a tune-up
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000 miles
Number of tune-ups = 3

Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream for their father's birthday. The cake costs $11, and 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for every 2 balloons. Since there are 12 balloons in a dozen, we can calculate the cost of the balloons as 12 / 2 * $0.5 = $3. They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total amount they spent: $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, the total amount they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2.

30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. Each lollipop costs $0.8, so the total revenue is:
300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240

Next, we need to find the total cost. The students bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, so the total cost is:
300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

First, let's figure out how many cups are used for chamomile and mint tea. Since 15 cups are used for cinnamon tea, we subtract that from the total: 27 - 15 = 12 cups.

Now, we know these 12 cups are divided into 3 rows, with equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row. So, we divide 12 by 3 to find the total number of cups in each row: 12 / 3 = 4 cups.

Since each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, we divide the 4 cups by 2 to find the number of cups of mint tea in each row: 4 / 2 = 2 cups.

To find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours, we can divide the total time (8 hours) by the time it takes for one trip (4 hours). 

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he can make 2 trips in that time, we can divide the total number of berries by the number of trips to find the least number of berries he can pick up per trip.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Now, let's calculate how much water is emptied from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the amount of water emptied will be 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's get baking... I mean, calculating.

To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, then add them together.

First, let's look at the cinnamon rolls. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Now, let's move on to the blueberry muffins. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, which is 450 / 3 = 150 calories. Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

To find the total number of Junebugs removed, we add the Junebugs removed each day: 
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300

We know that Peter, Paul, and Jean's combined age is 100 years. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote Jean's age as J, Paul's age as P, and Peter's age as Pe. We can set up the following equations:

1. Pe + P + J = 100 (combined age is 100 years)
2. P = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than Jean)
3. Pe = P + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age)

Now, let's substitute P from equation 2 into equation 3:
Pe = (J + 10) + J
Pe = 2J + 10

Now, substitute Pe and P from the above equations into equation 1:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know J, we can find P:
P = J + 10
P = 20 + 10
P = 30

Now that we know P and J, we can find Pe:
Pe = P + J
Pe = 30 + 20
Pe = 50

The age of Peter is 50."

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a month with 30 days, running 24 hours a day.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

If Cameron chooses the 24-hour stay, he'll pay 1600 pesos.

For the 12-hour stay, he'll pay 1000 pesos. Since he's staying for 17 hours, he'll need to add 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) at 70 pesos per hour. The additional hours will cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. So, the total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours

First, we need to calculate how much John earned. He makes 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 * 6 = 300 dollars

Next, we subtract his expenses. He spends 50 dollars on gas, leaving him with:
300 - 50 = 250 dollars

Then, he wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that too:
250 - 100 = 150 dollars

After that, he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, which totals to:
5 * 10 = 50 dollars

Now, we subtract the cost of the pencils from his remaining money:
150 - 50 = 100 dollars

Finally, we want to know how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining 100 dollars. To do that, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of a pen:
100 / 25 = 4

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word. 
Craig's total letters = 20 words * 15 letters/word = 300 letters.

Now, let's consider Craig's brother. He has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. To find the brother's total letters, we add 50 to Craig's total letters.
Brother's total letters = 300 + 50 = 350 letters.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled is the sum of Craig's total letters and his brother's total letters.
Total letters = 300 + 350 = 650 letters.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how many children can be in the drill.

We know that the children stand 8 in a row, and there are 7 rows for each of the 5 schools. To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in a row by the number of rows, and then multiply that result by the number of schools.

So, let's do the math: 8 children/row * 7 rows = 56 children per school. Since there are 5 schools, we multiply 56 by 5.

56 * 5 = 280

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. To find the total number of bottles, we multiply the number of coupons by the number of bottles per coupon:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Now, the teacher gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice. To find the total number of bottles given away, we multiply the number of students by the number of bottles per student:
29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given away from the total number of bottles:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Patty's Plumbing charges a visit fee of $40, plus $35 per hour (or part thereof) for labor, and the cost of parts. For this particular job, the labor time was 2.25 hours, and the parts cost $60.

First, we need to calculate the labor cost. Since the labor time is 2.25 hours, we round up to the nearest hour, which is 3 hours. The labor cost is then 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

Now, let's add up the total charge: the visit fee, labor cost, and parts cost.

Total charge = Visit fee + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60
Total charge = $205

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down James' CD purchase and sale to figure out how much money he was out.

First, James bought 10 CDs at $15 each, so the total cost would be 10 * $15 = $150. However, he got them for 40% off, which means he paid 60% of the total cost. To find 60% of $150, we multiply $150 by 0.6, which gives us $90.

Later, James decided to sell 5 of the CDs for $40. Now, let's calculate how much money he was out. We subtract the amount he got back ($40) from the amount he paid ($90). 

$90 - $40 = $50

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

James is swimming across a 20-mile lake at a pace of 2 miles per hour. He swims 60% of the distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. To find the time taken to swim 12 miles, we divide the distance by his speed: 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming 12 miles, James takes a break on an island. He rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, James has 20 - 12 = 8 miles left to swim. However, he swims at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

To find the total time taken, we add the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

He also sold 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal at $15 each, so the total sales for the Wall Street Journal is 10 * $15 = $150.

Next, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper. Cayley earns a 10% commission on the New York Times, so his commission is $30 * 0.10 = $3. He earns an 8% commission on the Wall Street Journal, so his commission is $150 * 0.08 = $12.

Finally, we add the commissions together to find the total commission earned by Cayley: $3 + $12 = $15.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D.

We can set up two equations based on the given information: B = A + 20 and B = D + 10.

Since the total points scored by the team is 45, we can write another equation: A + B + D = 45.

Now, let's substitute B in the equation A + B + D = 45 using the first equation B = A + 20. We get A + (A + 20) + D = 45.

We can also express D in terms of A using the first equation B = A + 20 and the second equation B = D + 10. This gives us D = (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10.

Substituting D = A + 10 in the equation A + (A + 20) + D = 45, we get A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms to get 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides to get 3A = 15.

Divide both sides by 3 to get A = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem. We have a book printed on paper that's stacked 100 pages to the inch, and each paper is printed on both sides. To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper has two sides, that's 2 pages per paper. With 100 papers to the inch, we get 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, let's multiply the total number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book, which is 1.5 inches. 

Total number of pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches
Total number of pages = 300 pages

First, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are there from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. To do this, we'll calculate the total minutes in 15 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we'll divide the total minutes by 15 to find the number of 15-minute intervals:

900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we'll multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he can staple in each interval:

60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Kim's sleep pattern to find out how many minutes she slept on her bed that day.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 8 hours is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom, so we subtract those 5 minutes: 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

Additionally, she was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is a total of 23 minutes. We subtract those 23 minutes from the total: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept 452 minutes on her bed that day.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of cups and the number of measuring spoons: 24 + 10 = 34.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many beds are initially occupied and unoccupied in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 of them occupied.

Number of occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds
Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Now, let's calculate the number of new patients admitted into the hospital in 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we multiply this number by the number of days in 2 weeks, which is 14.

Number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

After 2 weeks, the total number of occupied beds will be the sum of the initial occupied beds and the new patients admitted.

Total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Finally, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity to find the total number of unoccupied beds.

Total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

Non-work emails = Total emails - Work emails
Non-work emails = 16 - 7
Non-work emails = 9

Now, we know that two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family. Let's calculate that.

Emails to family = 2/3 * Non-work emails
Emails to family = 2/3 * 9
Emails to family = 6

The remaining emails are to others, including her boyfriend. We can find this by subtracting the emails to family from the non-work emails.

Emails to others = Non-work emails - Emails to family
Emails to others = 9 - 6
Emails to others = 3

Finally, we're told that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. Let's find that.

Emails to boyfriend = 1/3 * Emails to others
Emails to boyfriend = 1/3 * 3

20% of 48 is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, let's subtract 9.6 from 48:

We're told that the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

"Hello there, Pokémon trainers. I'm Yumi, and I'm here to help you solve this puzzle. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have caught a total of 339 Pokémon. We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.

Let's denote the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught as 'x'. Then, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is 4x - 13, and the number of Pokémon Alex has caught is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

Since the total number of Pokémon caught is 339, we can set up the equation:
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon Stan has caught:
Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13

Finally, she changes direction again and flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, covering a distance of 22 * 5 = 110 miles.

To find the total distance between her northern and southern homes, we need to subtract the distance she flew north from the total distance she flew south. So, the net distance is 300 + 110 - 36 = 374 miles.

To find the total number of brownies, we add them all up: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 dozen is 12, 1 1/2 dozen is 18 brownies.

In total, Sunny sold 10 + 15 = 25 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, let's look at the apple pie sales. On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

The blue car costs $100. To find 40% of $100, we multiply it by 0.4: $100 * 0.4 = $40. Now, let's subtract the discount from the blue car's price: $100 - $40 = $60. So, the red car costs $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add their prices: $100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We know Emil is 19 years old now, and when he turns 24, he'll be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48. Since 5 years will pass before Emil turns 24, his dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he'll be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12. Since 5 years will pass before Emil turns 24, his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7.

Now, let's find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother:
Sum = Dad's age + Brother's age
Sum = 43 + 7
Sum = 50

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's count the beads Adrianne received.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads from her sister. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add all the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

"Ohayou gozaimasu, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem, shall we?

Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. Then, on Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total pounds of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3. So, 21 / 3 = 7.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this as follows:
20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Now, let's find the number of remaining students:
30 - 6 = 24 students

Next, we're told that 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can calculate this as follows:
25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

To find the total number of students leaving early, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members:
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders and band members) = 12 students

We know Sophie wears size 5 boots, and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's. To find Charlie's boot size, we multiply Sophie's size by 5. So, Charlie wears 5 * 5 = 25.

Now, we need to find the average size of their shoes. To do this, we add their shoe sizes and divide by 2. The total size is 5 + 25 = 30. 

Dividing the total by 2, we get 30 / 2 = 15.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's get started on solving Pat's flower bed problem.

First, we need to figure out how many flowers Pat can fit in her 111-foot long flower bed. Since each flower is 12 inches wide and needs 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between them, the total space each flower takes up is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

To find the total number of flowers Pat can fit, we need to convert the length of the flower bed to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, let's divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space each flower takes up:

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants. However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

44 - 17 = 27 flowers

Each flower costs $6, so Pat will spend:

27 flowers * $6/flower = $162

18 ÷ 2 = 9

So, Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day. To find out how many he eats in a week, we multiply 9 by 7 (the number of days in a week).

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total cost of filling those hanging baskets for Katherine.

First, we need to find out how many petunias and sweet potato vines she'll need in total. Since she has 5 baskets and wants 3 petunias in each, that's 3 * 5 = 15 petunias. For the sweet potato vines, she wants 2 in each basket, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 vines.

Now, let's calculate the cost. The petunias cost $3.00 each, so 15 petunias will be 15 * $3.00 = $45.00. The sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each, so 10 vines will be 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

Adding these costs together, we get $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's get started with the problem.

Artemis and her father have a 30-pound bag of soil. They want to plant some flowers, and each type of flower needs a different amount of soil. Sunflowers need 3 pounds, carnations need 1.5 pounds, and roses need 1 pound.

They've already decided to plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations. To find out how much soil they've used so far, we need to calculate the total amount of soil needed for these flowers.

For the sunflowers: 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
For the carnations: 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Adding these together, we get: 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, let's subtract the soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil: 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is: 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month, and she sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. To find out how much she saves each month, we'll calculate 25% of $2,000.00:
$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

Since she saves $500.00 per month, in a year she'll have:
$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so to find out how many shoes she can buy in a year, we'll divide the total amount she saves in a year by the cost of one pair of shoes:
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Next, we need to determine how long it takes her to saute 90 shrimp. She can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can saute 3 shrimp per minute. To saute 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 3 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to saute the shrimp. The total time is 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total temperature change when the air conditioner was running on low for 3 hours. Since it cools the room by 2 degrees an hour, the temperature change is 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.

Next, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. The temperature change in this case is 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.

Now, let's add the temperature changes from both low and high settings: 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the temperature increase is 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.

To find the net temperature change, we subtract the warming from the cooling: 18 degrees (cooling) - 4 degrees (warming) = 14 degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

We know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Now, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to work backwards.

First, let's find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the second time. Since Bill was three times the age his father was, we multiply his father's age by 3: 3 * 30 = 90 years old. That's how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the second time.

Now, we know the comet orbits the sun every 75 years. So, to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we subtract 75 from the age he was when he saw it for the second time: 90 - 75 = 15.

Buford writes a check for the electric bill once a month, so that's 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year. He also writes a check for the gas bill once a month, which is another 12 checks/year.

Twice a month, Buford writes a check to the church, so that's 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year.

Lastly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year.

Now, let's add up all the checks: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks/year.

Now, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. To find the number of flights to Greece, we multiply 88 by 3/4, which gives us 66 flights.

The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights, and these are split equally between France and Germany. 

So, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

"Hello there, friend. I'm Yumi, and I'm here to help you with your question.

Let's dive into the world of the three little wolves - Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous. We know that Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote, being the enthusiastic one, howls for twice as long as Tobias, which means Chikote's howl lasts for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.

Now, Igneous is a bit of a show-off, howling for as long as the other two wolves combined. So, Igneous's howl lasts for 20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) = 60 seconds.

To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we add their individual howl times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

Since we want the answer in minutes, we'll convert the total seconds to minutes by dividing by 60 (because there are 60 seconds in a minute). This gives us 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We have four children: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the total age of the children is 20. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.

First, let's find the average age of the group. Since there are 4 children, we can set up an equation using the total age and the number of children:
Total age = Average age * Number of children
20 = Average age * 4

Now, divide both sides by 4 to find the average age:
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can find her age by multiplying the average age by 2:
Helene's age = 2 * Average age
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

Now, let's find Wilfred's age. We know the ages of Akbar (3 years old), Alessandro (4 years old), and Helene (10 years old). We can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of the other three children from the total age:
Wilfred's age = Total age - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age)
Wilfred's age = 20 - (3 + 4 + 10)
Wilfred's age = 20 - 17

Total number of cookies = Number of guests * Number of cookies per guest
Total number of cookies = 100 * 15
Total number of cookies = 1500

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, we need to find half of the total number of cookies:

Number of cookies given to the church = 1/2 * Total number of cookies
Number of cookies given to the church = 1/2 * 1500
Number of cookies given to the church = 750

Now, we know that each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we can divide the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

Number of people in the church next door = Number of cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
Number of people in the church next door = 750 / 15
Number of people in the church next door = 50

To solve this, let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices. We have 4 kids, each getting a slice of size x, and 2 adults, each getting a slice of size 2x. So, the total number of slices is 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Since each adult gets 2x, we can calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets by dividing 2x by the total number of slices (8x) and multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (2x / 8x) * 100

Adding these together, we get 180 + 300 = 480 minutes spent on rounds and appointments.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to hours: 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

Adding these costs together, we get: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $.25 each, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy:
$0.75 / $.25 = 3

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Anne has a box of sweets with 15 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces. She decides to keep 2 packs for herself and gives the rest to her 10 friends equally.

First, we need to find out how many packs she gave away. Since she kept 2 packs, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces she gave away. Each pack has 60 pieces, so 13 packs would be 13 * 60 = 780 pieces.

Finally, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends to find out how many pieces each friend received. That would be 780 / 10 = 78.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the price of carrots after three years. 

The initial price of carrots is $120, and it increases by 5% every year. To find the price after three years, we'll calculate the price increase for each year.

Year 1: 
The price increase is 5% of $120, which is 0.05 * $120 = $6. So, the price after 1 year is $120 + $6 = $126.

Year 2: 
The price increase is 5% of $126, which is 0.05 * $126 = $6.30. The price after 2 years is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Year 3: 
The price increase is 5% of $132.30, which is 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615. The price after 3 years is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put the same number of pics into 8 albums. We need to find out how many portraits and selfies she had.

First, we need to find out how many pictures are in each album. To do that, we'll divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

72 pictures ÷ 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. Let's calculate the number of selfies and portraits.

Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27
Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18

To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we'll add the number of selfies and portraits.

Total number of portraits and selfies = 27 + 18 = 45

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out how long James spent reading his book.

We know James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to read one page, we can divide the time by the number of pages: 10 minutes / 3 pages = 10/3 minutes per page.

Since James read 18 pages, we multiply the time per page by the total number of pages: 18 pages * (10/3 minutes per page) = 18 * 10/3 = 60 minutes.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many questions are easy, average, and difficult. Since 40% of the questions are easy, we can calculate that as follows:
40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

The rest of the questions, which is 60%, are equally divided as average and difficult. So, we can find the number of average and difficult questions:
60% of 60 = 0.6 * 60 = 36 questions.
Since these are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions Aries is sure to get correctly:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions.
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9 questions.
- Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9 questions.

Total questions Aries is sure to get correctly: 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We can write this relationship as S = 2L.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is 12L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is 4S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation: 4S = 4(2L) = 8L.

The total earnings from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation: 12L + 8L = 120.

Combine like terms: 20L = 120.

Divide both sides by 20: L = 6.

Since S = 2L, S = 2 * 6 = 12.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

"Hello there, friend. I'm Yumi, and I'm here to help you with your question.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We have one dwarf who can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day. Now, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. To calculate this, we add 50% of 24 to 24, which is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now that we know how much one dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe, let's multiply this by the number of dwarves and the number of days. We have 40 dwarves and 30 days, so the total amount of ore they can mine is 36 pounds/day * 40 dwarves * 30 days = 43,200 pounds.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's figure out the price of that package with 8 sandwiches.

We know the store offers three different package sizes, and the prices are proportional. The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second has 4 sandwiches for $6. To find the price per sandwich, I'll divide the cost by the number of sandwiches in each package.

For the first package, that's $3 ÷ 2 = $1.50 per sandwich. For the second package, it's $6 ÷ 4 = $1.50 per sandwich as well. Since the prices are proportional, this price per sandwich should be the same for all packages.

Now, let's multiply the price per sandwich by 8 to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches: $1.50 × 8 = $12.

$3000 (initial cost) - $1000 (from selling old set) = $2000 (remaining amount owed)

Now, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month. To calculate this, we multiply the remaining amount by 0.10 (which is the same as 10%).

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sally starts with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. When 40% of the red balloons burst, she loses 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she has 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons are unaffected, so she still has 7 green balloons.

When Sally releases half of the yellow balloons, she loses 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she finds 8 blue balloons and adds 75% of them to her remaining balloons. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she has: 
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Marcus's situation and calculate the chances of him having to turn in his homework tomorrow.

First, there's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there are two possible scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: the teacher gives everyone an extension (40% chance) or Marcus gets a personal extension (20% chance, but only if the teacher doesn't give an extension, which is 60% of the time).

Let's calculate the probabilities of these scenarios:

- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Normal teacher with extension: 50% * 40% = 20%
- Normal teacher without extension but with personal extension: 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we subtract the probability of him not having to turn it in from 100%: 100% - 76% = 24%

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 people. Out of these, 950 seats are reserved for graduates and 300 seats are reserved for faculty members. To find out how many seats are left for friends and family, we subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity.

Total seats taken = 950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250
Seats available for friends and family = 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive. Since 950 seats are reserved for graduates, we can assume that the number of graduates is 950.

Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

However, she also has to pay $3 for parking each day, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we need to subtract her expenses from her pay: $45 - $9 = $36.

24 feet (driveway width) ÷ 3 feet (distance between bottles) = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he'll need to move to the remaining 7 bottles. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next, so we'll multiply the number of bottles he needs to move to by the time it takes to move to each one.

Before college, Jim had a $25,000 per year job. Since he's not working while in school, he's losing $25,000 per year for 4 years, which is a total of $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

To find the total amount Jim needs to earn, we add the total amount of loans and the total amount of lost income: $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

After college, Jim's income triples to $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year. To calculate the time it would take Jim to earn the total amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income: $300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years.

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

We know that Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls in three sets. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x.

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

To simplify the equation, let's multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Then, twice the number of people who got off board the train, which is 2 * 50 = 100. So, the new total is:
90 + 100 = 190

Finally, at the third stop, 80 people get off, leaving us with:
190 - 80 = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Alison's shopping trip to find the total amount she spent on athletic gear.

First, Alison bought a tank top for $10. Then, she picked up a pair of running shorts that cost $5 more than the tank top, so that's $10 + $5 = $15.

Next, she got a great deal on a pair of tennis shoes. They were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price, which brings the price down to $48 / 2 = $24.

Finally, Alison grabbed a package of athletic socks that normally cost $8, but she had a $2 coupon, so she only paid $8 - $2 = $6 for them.

Now, let's add up the costs: $10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. I'd be happy to help you with your kitchen floor renovation.

To calculate the total cost, we need to figure out how many tiles you'll need. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. Your kitchen floor has a total area of 200 SqFt, so we can divide that by the area of each tile to get the total number of tiles required.

Total number of tiles required = Total area of the kitchen floor / Area of each tile
Total number of tiles required = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Total number of tiles required = 200

Now, let's multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile, which is $12.

Total cost = Total number of tiles required * Cost of each tile
Total cost = 200 * $12
Total cost = $2400

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down James' insurance situation. The normal cost is $120 a month, but since he had an accident, it's 60% more than that. To find the increased amount, I'll calculate 60% of $120.

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72

Now, I'll add this to the normal cost to get James' new monthly rate.

$120 + $72 = $192

Since James pays this amount every month, I'll multiply it by 12 to find his yearly cost.

$192 * 12 = $2304

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. His laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time. To find the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's calculate the number of loads for the twin beds. Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, Greg will need to do 4 / 2 = 2 loads for the twin beds per week.

For the king size bed, he'll need to do 1 load per week.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. To find the total number of loads per year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year: 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem. Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sundays, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturdays, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in a weekend, they watch 4 movies on Saturday and 2 movies on Sunday, making it a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies per weekend.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they can watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Then, last year, he collected 50 more. This year, he was super excited and collected twice as many stickers as he did last year. So, this year he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add all the stickers together: 
100 (initial stickers) + 50 (last year's stickers) + 100 (this year's stickers) = 250

Imma has 3 cats, and she feeds them 60 grams of food twice a day. So, each cat eats 60 * 2 = 120 grams of food per day.

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food they eat per day is 120 * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, let's divide the total amount of food (720 grams) by the amount they eat per day (360 grams):

720 / 360 = 2

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Becky ate 10 slices, and she ate 3 more slices than Jake. So, to find out how many slices Jake ate, we subtract 3 from Becky's total: 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Now, we're told Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. To find Silvia's total, we multiply Jake's slices by 2: 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31 slices.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes.

Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Then, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes. Since the total time is the sum of their parts, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, her part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Oh no, poor Hannah. Let's break down the costs for her doctor's visit.

First, the cast costs $200. Then, the doctor charges $300 per hour, but the visit only lasted 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, the visit itself costs $300 * 0.5 = $150.

Next, Hannah needs 30 painkillers at $4 each, which adds up to $4 * 30 = $120. And don't forget the parking – 2 hours at $6 per hour is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up all these costs: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

So, James responds to 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day. Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, I'll multiply the daily number by 5. That's 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

Now, let's add all these numbers together:

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the pizza problem step by step.

First, the glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we multiply 20 by 0.7, which gives us 14 pizzas. So, the glee club has 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.

Now, let's move on to the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. The football team ate 80% of their pizzas, so we multiply 40 by 0.8, which gives us 32 pizzas. This means the football team has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

To find the total number of pizzas left, we add the leftover pizzas from both groups: 6 (glee club) + 8 (football team) = 14.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 0.05 = 35 dollars, since each small coupon costs 5 cents.

The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 0.15 = 210 dollars, since each big coupon costs 15 cents.

Now, let's add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons to find the total cost of postage: 35 + 210 = 245 dollars.

However, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, leaving her with 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total to 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. However, a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures and couldn't deliver the fertilisers.

To find out how many trucks were able to deliver, we first need to calculate the number of trucks that failed. Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate it as follows:
1/4 * 20 trucks = 5 trucks

Now, we subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks:
20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we multiply the number of trucks that delivered by the tons each truck was carrying:
15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers:

The full-price pounds will cost 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. The half-price pounds will cost 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

Adding these together, we get the total cost: $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

The theater rental fee is $125 for a party of 20, and there's an additional $6 charge for each guest beyond that. Since Kayla has 41 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the extra 21 guests (41 - 20 = 21). The cost for these extra guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

We know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. To find out the daily banana consumption, we'll divide 315 by 7. 

315 ÷ 7 = 45 bananas per day

Now, let's break down the daily banana consumption for each monkey. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

Since the total daily banana consumption is 45 bananas, and the first and second monkeys eat 24 bananas, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas. 

45 - 24 = 21 bananas

The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

Next, the second train will arrive half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, it will arrive at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train will stay for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the second train will leave the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

Then, the third train will arrive an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, it will arrive at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, it will leave at 125 minutes.

Finally, the fourth train, which is the one Paul needs to get on, will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. So, it will arrive at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for her sculpture, and she's been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has already collected, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks she's been saving them.

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks needed.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

First, we need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Since he bought it at 75% of the original price, we can calculate it as follows:
Original price = $2000
Price Mr. Rogers bought it = $2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. So, the price his friend paid is:
Price friend paid = $1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, let's find the discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. The discount is the difference between the original price and the price the friend paid:
Discount = $2000 - $1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, we'll divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
Percentage discount = ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%

Next, 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes. To find the number of BMX bikes, we multiply 300 by 0.15, which gives us 45 BMX bikes.

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

The prices of the bikes are as follows: MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB ($500 / 2 = $250), and a Trekking bike is $450.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down John's weekly learning time.

John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. To find the total weekly minutes, let's call the total weekly minutes 'x'. Then, the extra learning time is (1/16)x.

We know that the class time is 1600 minutes, and the extra learning time is (1/16)x. The total weekly minutes 'x' is the sum of class time and extra learning time:

x = 1600 + (1/16)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 16:

16x = 25600 + x

Subtract x from both sides:

15x = 25600

Divide both sides by 15:

x = 25600 / 15
x = 1706.67

Now, we can convert the total weekly minutes to hours:

Total hours per week = x / 60
Total hours per week = 1706.67 / 60

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into this dinosaur problem together.

We know that a group of lazy Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Since they ate half of what was left, we can calculate that there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat before they had their snack.

Now, the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means that before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so to find the original weight, we need to multiply the remaining weight by 2. Therefore, the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's get started on calculating the cost of painting the room.

First, we need to find the total area of the walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, so we'll divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons we need: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost will be 12 * 12 = $144.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ellen started with 12 sodas and shook 3 of them. Then, she took 1 unshaken soda for herself. This leaves 11 sodas, with 3 shaken and 8 unshaken.

Ellen's brother then took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas, for a total of 8 sodas.

Now, when Ellen's friend comes along, the probability of choosing a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas: 2/8 = 1/4 = 0.25.

To express this probability as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We have two trains departing from the same station, but in opposite directions. One train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the other is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the distance between them after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled. We can do this by multiplying the speed of each train by the time they've been traveling.

For the first train, the distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

For the second train, the distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, we add the distances they've traveled to find the total distance between them:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to calculate 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2, which gives us 10 days off.

Now, let's find the number of days Billy works. We subtract the days off from the total number of days: 50 - 10 = 40 days.

We know Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. To find the total number of people he helps per day, we multiply 2 people per hour by 3 hours: 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Finally, we multiply the number of people Billy helps per day by the number of days he works: 6 people per day * 40 days = 240 people.

First, let's calculate the number of people who arrived in cars: 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people. Then, let's calculate the number of people who arrived in buses: 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people.

"Ohayou, let's dive into the problem. We have two waterslides at Five Flags, and we want to find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest one compared to the second biggest.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide. It's 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet per minute. To find the time, we'll divide the length by the speed: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.

Next, let's do the same for the second biggest slide. It's 240 feet long, and people slide down at 80 feet per minute. Time is length divided by speed: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

Now, let's find the difference in time. We'll subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles. Amber ran 8 miles, and Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. To find out how many miles Micah ran, we multiply Amber's miles by 3.5.

Micah's miles = 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.

Now, let's add the miles run by Amber and Micah to find their total. 
Total miles run by Amber and Micah = 8 + 28 = 36 miles.

Since the total miles run by all three is 52, we can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find Ahito's miles.
Ahito's miles = Total miles - miles run by Amber and Micah = 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Sheila's credit card transactions to find the new balance.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. Then, she returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract that from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, Sheila bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off the original price of $20.00. To find the discount, we calculate 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00. So, the frying pan cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off the original price of $30.00. The discount is 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00. Therefore, the towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the new purchases is $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00. Adding this to the balance after the return, we get: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of these large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. We can use this information to find the total number of jellyfish in the tank.

First, we need to find the total number of large jellyfish. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, we can multiply the number of jellyfish that changed color by 3 to get the total number of large jellyfish. So, 6 * 3 = 18 large jellyfish.

Now, we know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. To find the total number of jellyfish, we can multiply the number of large jellyfish by 5. Therefore, the total number of jellyfish is 18 * 5 = 90.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lauren wants to save for a retirement period of 20 years, and she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000. To calculate her retirement savings goal, we need to determine how much she needs to live on per year and then multiply that by the number of years she wants to retire.

40% of $100,000 is $40,000 per year. For 20 years, she will need:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000

Since Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck, and assuming she gets paid bi-weekly (26 pay periods per year), her annual savings is:

$100,000 per year * 0.20 = $20,000 per year

To calculate how many years it will take her to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the goal by her annual savings:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

However, Lauren wants to retire in 20 years. This means she has already worked for some years and has already saved some amount. Let's assume she has already saved some amount, and she needs to save the remaining amount in the next 20 years.

Since she needs to save a total of $800,000, and she will save $20,000 per year for the next 20 years, she will save a total of:

$20,000 per year * 20 years = $400,000

This means she has already saved:

$800,000 - $400,000 = $400,000

However, we are not interested in the amount she has already saved. We are interested in the number of years she needs to work from now.

Since she will save $400,000 in the next 20 years, and she saves $20,000 per year, the number of years she needs to work from now is indeed 20 years.

240 ÷ 40 = 6

Now that we know 1% is equal to 6 students, we can multiply 6 by 100 to find 100% of the population.
6 × 100 = 600

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad plans to hike twice a day, we divide 310 miles by 2:

310 miles / 2 = 155 miles per hike

However, Soledad is currently planning to hike 125 miles per time. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we subtract 125 miles from 155 miles:

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours. The two workers who produce 6 toys an hour will make 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys. The other two workers who produce 4 toys an hour will make 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys. So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, let's find out how many toys the fifth worker produced. We subtract the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers from the total number of toys produced in 10 hours: 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

We know that Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 Easter eggs. We also know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Additionally, Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

Let's start by finding out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, we can say that Sarah painted x eggs, and Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Together, they painted 30 eggs, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms: 2x + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2x = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 9.

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs.

Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to put them into boxes, with 8 crayons in each box. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. We need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes in pounds.

First, let's calculate the weight of the crayons. Since there are 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:
200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes needed. We can do this by dividing the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box:
200 crayons / 8 crayons/box = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:
25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes to find the total weight in ounces:
200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can divide the total weight in ounces by 16:
400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much of the tree John can use to make logs. Since he can use 80% of the 80-foot tree, we multiply the total length by 0.8:
80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Now, we know that John cuts the tree into 4-foot logs. To find the total number of logs, we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we're told that John can cut 5 planks from each log. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we know that John sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. To find her brother's salary, we multiply Valerie's salary by 2. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Now, let's calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000, and her brother earns $10,000, so together they earn $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Grandma walks 3 miles every day, with 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We know she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and we need to find the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time. In this case, the distance is 2 miles, and the time is 40 minutes.

Speed = 2 miles / 40 minutes
Speed = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we know that Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk. So, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * (1/20 miles per minute) = 1/10 miles per minute.

We can use this speed to find the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute)
Time = 10 minutes

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk is the sum of the time she spends on the beach and the time she spends on the sidewalk:

Total Time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes
Total Time = 50 minutes

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. First, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has initially. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24, we can set up an equation:

Initial marbles + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from both sides:

Initial marbles = 60 - 24
Initial marbles = 36

So Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, he will have:

36 - 10 = 26

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

Donny has two mugs of water, and he can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other is an unknown temperature. When he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug, the mixture is now drinkable.

To find the minimum temperature of the second mug, we can use the concept of weighted averages. The total weight of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug).

The weighted average temperature of the mixture is:
(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:
4 * 33 + x ≥ 200
132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:
x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 68 degrees.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks.

First, we need to find out how many cows and chickens were added over the three weeks. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.

Since there are 21 days in three weeks, the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows. The total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add these to the initial number of animals. There were 50 cows and 20 chickens initially. So, the total number of cows after three weeks is 50 + 420 = 470, and the total number of chickens after three weeks is 20 + 210 = 230.

To find the total number of animals, we add the total number of cows and chickens: 470 + 230 = 700.

Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, and each pack costs $10.00. So, the original cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. However, he gets a 10% discount on this order. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $40.00, which is $4.00. Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels. To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. It's given that he ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we subtract 5 from 23.

23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, let's figure out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. We know it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops.
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop to find out how many potatoes he ate.
18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

To find the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we add the eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

Now, let's add the number of green and red jellybeans: 17 + 34 = 51.

Since there are 60 jellybeans in total, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

Number of lemons per year = 5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons

Now, to find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons per year by 10.

Number of lemons in a decade = 30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

We know the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the initial number of women.

The total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up a proportion to find the number of women:

9/14 = x/84

Cross-multiplying, we get:
9 * 84 = 14x
756 = 14x
x = 756 / 14
x = 54

So, there were initially 54 women on the bus.

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who remained is:

Since we want to find the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days, we multiply the number of individual sunflowers per day by 3:
13 * 3 = 39 individual sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers in bouquets per day is:
7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers per day

For 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets is:
84 * 3 = 252 sunflowers

Finally, we add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in bouquets:

His total cost is the amount he spent on the rocks, which is the same as his initial investment:

20 rocks * $5 = $100

Now, Adam sells 60% of his inventory. To find out how many rocks he sells, we multiply the total number of rocks by 0.6:

20 rocks * 0.6 = 12 rocks

He sells each rock for $7, so his total revenue is:

12 rocks * $7 = $84

To find out how much money Adam loses, we subtract his total revenue from his total cost:

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes, 6 medium-sized picture scenes, or 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. She needs to create 45 large-sized picture scenes, 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 49 small-sized picture scenes.

First, let's calculate the number of days it would take her to complete each type of scene separately:

- Large-sized scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

However, Lauren can work on different scenes in a single day. To minimize the total number of days, let's try to combine the scenes.

One possible combination is:
- 6 days for medium-sized scenes (completing 36 scenes)
- During these 6 days, she can also work on large-sized scenes: 6 * 5 = 30 large-sized scenes (leaving 15 large-sized scenes)
- The remaining 15 large-sized scenes can be completed in 3 days
- The 49 small-sized scenes can be completed in 7 days, but she can work on them during the 6 days for medium-sized scenes and the 3 days for the remaining large-sized scenes. Since she can do 7 small-sized scenes per day, she can complete 6 * 7 = 42 small-sized scenes in the first 6 days, and the remaining 7 small-sized scenes in 1 day, which can be done in the 3 days for the remaining large-sized scenes.

So, the total number of days is 6 days for medium-sized scenes + 3 days for the remaining large-sized scenes = 9 days.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply their individual probabilities:

The total number of seashells collected is the sum of what each person collected: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If we denote the length of the yellow rope as y, then the length of the blue rope is y - 7. Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, its length is 4(y - 7).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6y = 72

Divide by 6:
y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
Blue rope = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
Red rope = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4(5) = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given thrice as much, which is 3 * $5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's say they each gave x dollars. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x, and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. We can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get:

-x = -$3

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = $3

So, they each gave $3 to their little sister. Now, let's find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

$5 - $3 = $2

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the wall mural has four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. The mural used a total of 12 pints of paint. We're also told that half the mural is yellow, which means the other half is divided among red, white, and purple.

First, let's find out how many pints of yellow paint were used. Since half the mural is yellow, we can calculate it as follows:

Yellow paint = 1/2 * Total paint
= 1/2 * 12
= 6 pints

Now, let's find out how many pints of paint were used for the non-yellow colors (red, white, and purple). We can do this by subtracting the amount of yellow paint from the total paint:

Non-yellow paint (red, white, purple) = Total paint - Yellow paint
= 12 - 6
= 6 pints

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can divide the non-yellow paint by 3 to find the amount of red paint used:

Red paint = 1/3 * Non-yellow paint
= 1/3 * 6
= 2 pints

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total area of Tom's house.

First, we need to find the area of the bedrooms. Each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to find the total area:
960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160

On Tuesday, she saw 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she saw 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she saw 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she saw 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds she saw each day:

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem. We have a regular box of 100 dishwasher pods for $12, and a special size box with 20% more pods for the same price. To find out how many pods are in the special size box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100.

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. So, the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, let's find the cost per pod. Since the special size box costs $12, the cost per pod is 12 / 120 = $0.1 per pod.

To determine how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide $1 by the cost per pod. $1 / $0.1 = 10 cycles.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. To find out how many 20 dollar bills he has, we divide 1000 by 20, which gives us 50 bills.

On his way home, Thomas loses 10 bills, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for something. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 left.

The value of the remaining 20 dollar bills is 20 * 20 = 400 dollars.

Then, Thomas triples his money, which gives him 400 * 3 = 1200 dollars.

Finally, he converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide 1200 by 5, which gives us 240 bills.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the soccer match goals.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals, and team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the total goals for each team. Team A scores 4 + 2 = 6 goals, and team B scores 2 + 8 = 10 goals. 

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk and uses 45% of it on Monday, which is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch per day (if the chalk was full). Since the chalk is not full, we will use the remaining length to calculate the number of days.

Let's calculate the number of days until the chalk is less than 2 inches:
The teacher has 2.75 inches left and uses 1 inch per day. 
2.75 - 1 = 1.75 inches after the first day.
1.75 - 1 = 0.75 inches after the second day.

Since 0.75 inches is less than 1 inch, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after the second day of using 20% of the original chalk length per day.

However, the question asks for the number of days before he has to recycle the chalk. Therefore, the answer is 2 days before he has to recycle the chalk on the third day.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

So, the total number of students on varsity is 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students.

Now, let's find out how many students are not on varsity. There are a total of 12 boys and 12 girls in the class, making it 24 students in all. If 7 students are on varsity, then the number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

In total, the dentist fixes 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100:

4000 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $14,000

However, 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date and couldn't be sold. To find the amount of sour milk, we multiply the total gallons by 2/5:
2/5 * 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons

Now, we multiply the number of gallons of sour milk by the cost per gallon to find the refund amount:
1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem and figure out how old Colin is.

We know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. If we denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C, we can write an equation:
W = 5(C + 7)

We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This gives us another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, let's substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
C = 20

$27000 ÷ $500 = 54

Now, we know Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. To find the total number of books, we'll multiply 54 by 100.

54 × 100 = 5400

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we'll divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books each school will get.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends will eat 6 slices each, so that's 6 x 6 = 36 slices. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, Kate will need 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends will eat 4 slices each, so that's 6 x 4 = 24 slices. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, Kate will need 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. In total, that's 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

To find the net rate at which Jay gains snowballs, we subtract the rate at which they melt from the rate at which he builds them. To do this, we need a common denominator, which is 15 in this case. So, we convert 1/3 to 5/15 and then subtract: 
5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Now, Jay needs 60 snowballs. To find the time it will take, we can divide 60 by the net rate:

So, Digimon had its 20th anniversary, and we know that when it came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Now, John is 28 years old. To find Jim's current age, we need to figure out their age difference.

First, let's find John's age 20 years ago. We subtract 20 from his current age: 28 - 20 = 8. That's how old John was 20 years ago.

Since John was twice as old as Jim back then, we can set up a simple equation: John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago. We know John's age, so we can plug that in: 8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago. To find Jim's age, we divide both sides by 2: Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2 = 4.

Now, we add 20 years to Jim's age 20 years ago to find his current age: Jim's current age = 4 + 20 = 24.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the nurses had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, at the end of the third day, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

Since they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, this means that they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the previous days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

Now, we know that they had 3 bandages left from the previous days at the end of the third day. This 3 bandages is the sum of the bandages left at the end of the first day (12) and the bandages left at the end of the second day. Since they used 28 bandages on the second day and only had 12 left from the first day, they must have had 28 - 12 = 16 more bandages at the start of the second day. This means they had 16 more bandages at the start of the first day.

So, the total bandages they had at the start of the first day is 50 (from the bulk pack) + 12 (left at the end of the first day) + 16 (extra bandages) = 78.

Now, let's calculate her earnings from these hours. Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, so her total earnings from hours worked is 180 * $1.5 = $270.

In addition to her hourly earnings, Jen also receives $10 for each week of complete attendance. Since she didn't incur any absences in April, she gets $10 * 4 = $40.

We know that Bernie has 4 dogs, and on average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. To find the total miles all the dogs need, we multiply the number of dogs by the average miles per day: 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, let's add up the miles the first three dogs need: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the miles the first three dogs need from the total miles: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down John's situation. He's getting a loan worth 40% of his house's value, which is $250,000. 

First, we need to find out the loan amount. To do that, we'll calculate 40% of $250,000:
40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Now, John uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts. Let's find out how much that is:
60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

To find out how much money he had leftover after paying his debt, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the loan amount:
$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate how much Deandre will earn from selling the tunas.

First, we need to find the total weight of the tunas. Deandre caught three tunas weighing 56 kilograms, 46 kilograms, and 26 kilograms. 

The total weight of the tunas is: 
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:
128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. To find Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the selling price and then subtract the cost price.

First, let's find the selling price. Since Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them, we multiply the cost price by 11/8. The cost price is $72, so the selling price is 11/8 * 72 = 11 * 9 = 99.

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem. Brian's dehumidifier has three settings: low, medium, and high. The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since the medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, it removes 2 liters per day. The high setting, being twice as efficient as the medium setting, removes 4 liters per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water removed. Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, which is 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters. Then, he ran it for 3 days on the medium setting, which is 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters. Finally, he ran it for 5 days on the high setting, which is 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Adding these amounts together, we get 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"Oh my, I just love water balloon fights. Let's see... Jolene and her friends had 10 packs of balloons, and each pack had 30 balloons. To find the total number of balloons, I'll multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack.

Total number of balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons

Now, if they had 12 balloons left at the end of the afternoon, that means they threw the rest. To find out how many they threw, I'll subtract the number of balloons left from the total.

Number of balloons thrown = Total number of balloons - Number of balloons left
= 300 - 12

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the amount of the second medicine. Since it's 3 times the amount of the first medicine, we multiply 14 mL by 3. That gives us 42 mL of the second medicine.

Now, let's add the amount of the first medicine (14 mL) to the amount of the second medicine (42 mL). We get 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL of medicine in one dose.

To find the amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8: 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. John's classes, on the other hand, have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. To find the capacity of each of John's classes, we multiply 120 by 1/8.

120 * 1/8 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 * 15 = 30 students.

Now, let's find the combined capacity of both schools. We add the capacity of Ali's school (120 students) to the capacity of John's school (30 students).

120 + 30 = 150

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. To find the interest, we multiply the borrowed amount by the interest rate: 0.02 * 300 = $6.

So, the total amount he owes is $300 (initial amount) + $6 (interest) = $306.

For 11 months, Stephen will pay $25 per month. To find the total amount he pays in these 11 months, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months: 11 * 25 = $275.

Now, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month: $306 - $275 = $31.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's dive into the problem and find out how far off Tim's guess was.

First, we need to calculate the total volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. To find the volume, we multiply the base area by the height. The base area is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. Now, we multiply this by the height: 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the actual volume of jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Next, we divide the actual volume of jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean to find the total number of jelly beans. The volume of a single jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. So, the total number of jelly beans is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Now, we know that 30% of the jelly beans are red. To find the estimated number of red jelly beans, we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3: 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract his estimated number from the true number: 900 - 864 = 36.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The bus initially had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, making the total number of people 20 + 40 = 60.

On the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop got on the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, the total number of people after the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers doubled. Therefore, the total number of people after the third stop is 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, and the initial cost per visit is $2. So, the cost per year is 2 * 3 = $6. For the first 5 years, the total cost is 6 * 5 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost per visit increases by 150%. To find the new cost, we calculate 2 + (2 * 1.5) = 2 + 3 = $5. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the new cost per year is 5 * 3 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 15 * 3 = $45.

Ian has a 40-foot long board that he wants to cut into two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. To find the length of the longer piece, let's call the length of the shorter piece 'x'. Then, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up an equation: x + 4x = 40. Combining like terms, we get 5x = 40. Dividing both sides by 5, we find that x = 8.

Now, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4: 4x = 4 * 8 = 32.

80 ÷ 16 = 5 pounds of meat

Now, we know Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. To find the total amount of seasoning needed, we multiply the number of pounds of meat by 2.

To find the discount, we multiply $75 by 0.20, which gives us $15. So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we need to add the cost of the nail art. Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

In total, one bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we divide the total number of books (110) by the number of books one bookcase can hold (55).

If we denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b', we can write this relationship as b = 5s - 4.

We're also told that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write another equation: s + b = 116.

Now, let's substitute the expression for b into the second equation:
s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:
6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:
6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:
s = 20

Since her score for every game is 21 points, we can find the total points scored by multiplying the total games played by her score per game: 160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points.

"Oh my goodness, poor Brendan. Let me help him figure out how many marbles he has left.

So, Brendan started with 10 marbles in his bag. Then, he tripped and dropped half of them. Half of 10 is 5, so he dropped 5 marbles. That means he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left.

After that, he found 3 more marbles, which is great! Now he has 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. But wait, one of those ""marbles"" was actually a bead, so he got rid of it. That means he has 8 - 1 = 7 marbles left.

Brendan ended up with 7 marbles."

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights. Since there's a flashlight for every person, and there are 4 people, that's 4 flashlights. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms, so that's 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights. The total number of flashlights is 4 + 16 = 20.

Now, let's move on to the candles. Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other 4 have 5 medium candles each. The total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16, and the total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20. The total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

Finally, we add the total number of flashlights and candles to get the final answer.

"Ohayou, let's solve this problem together. Mitchell bought 2 bags of chips, each containing 55 chips. To find the total number of chips, we multiply the number of bags by the number of chips in each bag.

Total number of chips = 2 * 55 = 110

Now, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members, which is 5. This will give us the number of chips each person gets.

Chips per person = Total number of chips / Number of family members
Chips per person = 110 / 5
Chips per person = 22

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides: 
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs. Given that there are 20 helmets, we can start by finding the number of footballs. Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, the number of footballs is twice the number of helmets. So, the number of footballs is 2 * 20 = 40.

Next, we can find the number of robots. Since there are half as many robots as helmets, the number of robots is half the number of helmets. So, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Now, let's add up the number of robots, helmets, and footballs to find the total number of items Dominick saw. The total number of items is 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (footballs) = 70.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings: 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes. Now, let's do the same for the new varnish: 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes.

The difference in time is what we're looking for. To find that, we'll subtract the time for the old varnish from the time for the new varnish: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

Crista has 20 plants, and they all need different amounts of water. 4 of her plants need half a cup of water each, which is 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups. Then, 8 plants need 1 cup of water each, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups. The remaining plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. Since there are 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 12, the rest is 20 - 12 = 8 plants. They need 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water.

Now, let's add up the water needed for all the plants: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water.

"Oh my, poor Phineas Frog. Let's help him get back home. To do that, we need to figure out how long it'll take him to hop and swim his way back.

Phineas has to cover a total distance of 200 yards, with half of it on land and the other half in water. So, that's 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

On land, Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. To find the time it takes for him to cover 100 yards, we divide the distance by his speed: 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

In water, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. To find the time it takes for him to cover 100 yards, we divide the distance by his speed: 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land and swim in water: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

- 5 blouses * $5.00 = $25.00
- 2 pants * $8.00 = $16.00
- 1 skirt * $6.00 = $6.00
Total weekly cost = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Now, let's add up the number of people for the first three days:
50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people

For the rest of the week (4 days), Conor saw an average of 60 people per day. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we multiply the average by the number of days:

"Ohayou gozaimasu. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Garrett gets 20 kernels in the first 30 seconds of cooking. Then, in the next 30 seconds, the kernels pop at three times that rate, so that's 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

Next, the kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels in the next 30 seconds.

After that, the popping slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, so that's 80 / 2 = 40 kernels in the final 30 seconds of cooking.

Finally, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up all the popped kernels: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210.

Now, his friend Allen asked for an extra gallon that's twice as tart. This means Tim will need 2 cups of lemon juice for this extra gallon. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he'll need 2 * 6 = 12 lemons for the extra gallon.

Then, he turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed. Again, we multiply the speed by the time: 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the total distance from his house: 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is now 54 miles east of his house.

First, we need to find the value of the boat after the first year. It depreciated by 30%, so we'll calculate 30% of the original price of $9000.

30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700

Now, subtract the depreciation from the original price to get the value after the first year.

$9000 - $2700 = $6300

Next, the boat depreciated by another 30% in the second year. We'll calculate 30% of the value after the first year.

30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890

Subtract the depreciation from the value after the first year to get the value after the second year.

$6300 - $1890 = $4410

Finally, the boat depreciated by 20% in the third year. We'll calculate 20% of the value after the second year.

20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882

So, Dallas had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles initially.

Now, we know that Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins. Since Dallas received 25 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting 25 from 52.

She also practices 1 hour of yoga, 5 days a week. That's 60 * 5 = 300 minutes per week. In 4 weeks, that's 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

To convert the total time to hours, we divide by 60: 2040 / 60 = 34 hours.

The final answer is: 34"
"I'd be happy to help Octavia with her quilt. To find the total square feet of the quilt, we need to calculate the total square feet of fabric from each type of shirt and add them together.

First, let's calculate the square feet from the small shirts. Since each small shirt is 3 square feet, we multiply the number of small shirts (11) by 3. This gives us 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.

Next, we calculate the square feet from the medium shirts. Each medium shirt is 4 square feet, so we multiply the number of medium shirts (8) by 4. This gives us 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.

Finally, we calculate the square feet from the large shirts. Each large shirt is 6 square feet, so we multiply the number of large shirts (6) by 6. This gives us 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

Now, let's add up the square feet from all the shirts: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We have a small sunflower with 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is 12, we can calculate the total number of seeds in the small sunflower by multiplying 3 by 12, which gives us 36 seeds.

Now, let's consider the large sunflower. It has 50% more seeds than the small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which equals 18. So, the large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds, we simply add the seeds from the small and large sunflowers: 36 + 54 = 90.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

We know that George has 18 pens, and Timothy has three times as many pens as George. To find the number of pens Timothy has, we multiply the number of pens George has by 3. So, Timothy has 18 * 3 = 54 pens.

Now, we're told that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. To find the number of pens Sarah has, we divide the number of pens Timothy has by 2. So, Sarah has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars the company produces in two weeks. Since the company produces 5000 bars per day, we multiply this number by the number of days in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 14 days in two weeks.

5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70000 bars

Now that we know the company produces 70000 bars in two weeks, we can calculate the total amount of money it will receive by selling these bars. Each bar is sold for $2, so we multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar.

70000 bars * $2/bar = $140000

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down Jake's shopping trip to find the total amount he spent.

First, Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. He pays full price for the first T-shirt, which is $8. For the second T-shirt, he gets 50% off, so he pays 0.5 * $8 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, Jake buys a pair of shoes that's 40% off the original price of $40. To find the discount, we calculate 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spent: $12 + $24 = $36.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ryan gets $6 each week for completing his chores, and he did them for 3 weeks. So, his total allowance is $6 * 3 = $18.

He then bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. That's 4 cones in total, so the cost is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

After buying the ice cream cones, Ryan has $18 - $5 = $13 left.

Now, he wants to buy movie tickets that cost $6.50 each. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we'll divide the amount of money he has by the cost of a ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's calculate the total amount Ellen and Lani spent at the mall.

Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5, so her total is $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each, so her total is $30 + 2 * $100 = $30 + $200 = $230.

To find the total amount they spent, we add Ellen's total to Lani's total: $105 + $230 = $335.

"Hello there, I'm Yumi. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To make 1 jar of the honey and jam mix, Tim needs 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey. The costs are $6 per pound for passion fruit, $8 per pound for jackfruit, and $10 per pound for honey.

The total cost of making 1 jar is:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20
Total cost per jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, let's calculate the total cost of making 10 jars: $44 * 10 = $440

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is: $50 * 10 = $500

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $500 - $440 = $60

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's count the coins in Justin's jar.

We have 32 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25. So, the total value of the quarters is 32 * $0.25 = $8.

Next, we have 95 dimes, and each dime is worth $0.10. The total value of the dimes is 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.

Then, there are 120 nickels, and each nickel is worth $0.05. The total value of the nickels is 120 * $0.05 = $6.

Lastly, we have 750 pennies, and each penny is worth $0.01. The total value of the pennies is 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add up the values of all the coins: $8 + $9.50 = $17.50, $17.50 + $6 = $23.50, and $23.50 + $7.50 = $31.

Josh services 3 cars a day and is open 5 days a week, since he's closed on Sundays and Wednesdays. To find out his total earnings in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he works and the total number of cars he services.

In 2 weeks, Josh works 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days. Since he services 3 cars a day, the total number of cars he services in 10 days is 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks are 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

Then, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
- Sugar cookies: 4 (no change)

After that, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, and he wants to sell them for a fair price. The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for half of the collection and $7 per toy for the other half.

First, we need to find out how many toy soldiers are in each half of the collection. Since Matthew has 12 toy soldiers, half of the collection would be 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

Now, let's calculate the amount Matthew would get for each half. For the first half (6 toy soldiers), he would get $5 per toy, so the total amount for this half would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half (6 toy soldiers), he would get $7 per toy, so the total amount for this half would be 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the amounts for both halves: $30 + $42 = $72.

"Hi there, I'm Yumi. Let's solve this problem together.

Nate's dog can dig six holes a day, and he digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation. To find the total number of holes the dog digs, we multiply the number of holes the dog digs per day by the number of days Nate is on vacation.

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

When Nate gets home, the dog continues to dig 6 holes per day, and Nate fills in 9 holes per day. The net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes per day.

To find the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day.

84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the number of days by 7 to find the number of weeks.

28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. However, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

Igor gathered the correct number of beakers initially, but he lost some on the way to the lab bench. Let's call the number of beakers he lost x. Then, the number of beakers he gathered is 7 - x.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + 7 - x (beakers) = 29.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron. This means Aaron ran half the distance that Vanessa ran, which is 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

Now, we're told that Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can find out how long it would take Vanessa to run the same distance. If Aaron is twice as fast, then Vanessa is half as fast, so it would take her twice as long to run 2 miles. Therefore, Vanessa would take 16 * 2 = 32 minutes to run 2 miles.

To find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles, we can simply multiply the time it took her to run 2 miles by 2, since she ran twice the distance. So, Vanessa took 32 * 2 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

The vendor sold the watermelons at a 25% profit. To find the profit amount per watermelon, we'll calculate 25% of the cost price.

Profit amount per watermelon = 25% of $1.60 = 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40

Now, let's find the selling price per watermelon by adding the cost price and the profit amount.

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit amount per watermelon

We know that James is twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. To find Dora's current age, we subtract 3 from 12, which gives us 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

Now, we know that John was 19 years old when James was born. So, the age difference between John and James is 19 years.

To find John's current age, we add James' age to the age difference: 18 + 19 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the age difference between John and his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

We know that Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they are either chickens or cows. We also know that the total number of legs is 70. To start, let's use variables to represent the number of chickens and cows. Let's say 'c' is the number of chickens and 'w' is the number of cows.

Since there are 20 animals in total, we can write the equation:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so we can write another equation:

2c + 4w = 70

To make things easier, let's simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:

c + 2w = 35

Now, let's subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'w' into the first equation:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5
