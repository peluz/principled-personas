"Let's break down Janet's daily egg sales. Her ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 for breakfast and 4 for baking muffins, so that's a total of 7 eggs used. To find out how many eggs she sells, we subtract the used eggs from the total: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Since she sells each egg for $2, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, let's add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down Josh's house flipping venture. He bought the house for $80,000 and invested $50,000 in repairs, bringing the total cost to $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value. To calculate the new value, we multiply the original value by 2.5. 

New value = 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, this $200,000 is the value of the house before repairs. Since the repairs increased the value by 150%, the new value after repairs is indeed $200,000.

Now, let's calculate the profit. The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Let's break down James' running routine. He runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week. That's a total of 3 * 3 = 9 sprints per week. Since each sprint is 60 meters, we multiply the number of sprints by the distance per sprint to get the total meters run per week.

9 sprints * 60 meters per sprint = 540 meters

"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the day and subtract the amount already given.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"Let's break down the problem. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, and the price of the glasses alternates between $5 and 60% of $5, which is $3.

We can pair the glasses: the first glass costs $5, and the second glass costs $3. This pattern repeats. Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can divide them into 8 pairs.

The cost of each pair is $5 + $3 = $8. Now, we multiply the cost of one pair by the number of pairs: 8 * $8 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Seattle has 20 sheep. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can calculate Charleston's sheep by multiplying Seattle's sheep by 4. That gives us 4 * 20 = 80 sheep in Charleston.

Now, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. To find Toulouse's sheep, we multiply Charleston's sheep by 2. That's 2 * 80 = 160 sheep in Toulouse.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in each city: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carla is downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB per minute. However, 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.

First, let's calculate how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the 20-minute restart, Carla has to start the download again from the beginning. This time, she downloads the entire 200 GB file. The time it takes to download 200 GB is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the initial download time, the restart time, and the complete download time: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes.

"Let's break down John's journey to find out how far he is from home. Initially, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. To find the distance he traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Now, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move during this time.

After the traffic, he drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he travels in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

For the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), he drives at 80 mph. The distance he travels in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance he travels in the 4 hours after turning around is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Since he was trying to get back home, we subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the distance he traveled before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"Let's break down Eliza's earnings for the week. She earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours and 1.2 times her regular rate for overtime hours.

First, I'll calculate her regular pay: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

Next, I'll calculate her overtime pay. She worked 45 hours, so she has 5 hours of overtime. Her overtime rate is 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour. So, her overtime pay is 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

Now, I'll add her regular pay and overtime pay to find her total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. 

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. So, the downloads in the second month were 3 * 60 = 180.

Now, for the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"I'd be happy to help Carlos with his lemon tree investment. To determine how many years it will take for him to start earning money, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) plus the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree ($3 per year). The total revenue is the annual revenue from selling lemons (7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year).

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.5
Year 2: Total cost = $93 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $96, Total revenue = $10.5 * 2 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $99, Total revenue = $10.5 * 3 = $31.5
Year 4: Total cost = $99 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $102, Total revenue = $10.5 * 4 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $105, Total revenue = $10.5 * 5 = $52.5
Year 6: Total cost = $105 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $108, Total revenue = $10.5 * 6 = $63

Since the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108) in year 6, we need to calculate for more years.

Year 7: Total cost = $108 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $111, Total revenue = $10.5 * 7 = $73.5
Year 8: Total cost = $111 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $114, Total revenue = $10.5 * 8 = $84
Year 9: Total cost = $114 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $117, Total revenue = $10.5 * 9 = $94.5
Year 10: Total cost = $117 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $120, Total revenue = $10.5 * 10 = $105
Year 11: Total cost = $120 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $123, Total revenue = $10.5 * 11 = $115.5
Year 12: Total cost = $123 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $126, Total revenue = $10.5 * 12 = $126

However, in year 12, the total revenue ($126) is still not more than the total cost ($126). We need to calculate for year 13.

Year 13: Total cost = $126 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $129, Total revenue = $10.5 * 13 = $136.5

In year 13, the total revenue ($136.5) is more than the total cost ($129). Therefore, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Melanie starts with an unknown number of vacuum cleaners, which we'll call 'x'. She sells a third of them at the green house, which is x/3. Then, she sells 2 more to the red house. 

The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is x - x/3 = 2x/3. After selling 2 more to the red house, she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sells half of what's left at the orange house. This means she sells (2x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners. To simplify, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 2 to get (4x/3 - 4)/2, then divide the numerator by 2 to get 2x/3 - 2. Half of what's left is (2x/3 - 2)/2, so she sells (2x/3 - 2)/2 and has (2x/3 - 2)/2 left.

However, we can simplify this step by realizing that if she sells half of what's left, she's left with half of what was left after the red house. So, she has (2x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house.

We know Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:
(2x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:
2x/3 - 2 = 10

Then we add 2 to both sides:
2x/3 = 12

Then we multiply both sides by 3/2:
x = 18

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a dance class with 20 students. 

First, 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance. To find the number of students, we calculate 20% of 20, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

Now, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left. Then, 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. We calculate 25% of 16, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

So, the number of students left for hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100. This gives us (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the merchant's options to determine which one will yield the highest profit.

The merchant has two choices: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000. The expected increase in value for the jewelry is 2.5%, while the electronic gadgets are expected to rise by 1.2%.

To calculate the potential profit from each option, we'll multiply the initial value by the expected increase.

For the jewelry: $5,000 * 2.5% = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125
For the electronic gadgets: $8,000 * 1.2% = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96

It's clear that the jewelry will yield a higher profit. Therefore, the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize his profit.

Since we're looking for the total distance covered by each train, we simply need to add the distance covered on the first day to the distance covered on the second day.

So, the total distance covered by each train is: 80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Next, we'll calculate her earnings from coaching. She earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Her total annual salary is the sum of her earnings from teaching and coaching:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. She has 6 miles left to walk.

Time left = Total time - Time already taken
Time left = 3 hours - 2 hours
Time left = 1 hour

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink. Since we spilled one liter, we're left with 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink. Given that it's two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

Next, we'll calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink. We have 15 liters of pineapple drink, and it's three-fifths water. So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, let's add the amount of water in both drinks to find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

Adding these costs together, we get $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. This is the total cost of everything except the pizza.

Since Marie paid $50 in total, we subtract the cost of the other items from the total to find the cost of the pizza: $50 - $33 = $17.

Now, we know each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The first friend's guess is straightforward: 80 jelly beans.

The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first one. To find this, we calculate half of 80, which is 40, and then add 20 to get 60.

The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first one. To find 25% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.25, which gives us 20. Adding this to the first guess, we get 100.

Now, we have the three guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we add these numbers together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Then, we divide the sum by the number of guesses, which is 3.

First, let's calculate how much he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

We know he had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left is $160 + $5 = $165.

Now, let's calculate how much he made from selling his lego sets. Since he spent $165 and had $5 left, he must have made more than $165. We know he sold his lego sets for $15 each, and he had 13 lego sets initially. If he sold all 13, he would have made 13 * 15 = $195.

Since he made $195 and only spent $165, that means he didn't spend the money from all 13 lego sets. The amount he didn't spend is $195 - $165 = $30.

Since each lego set is $15, the number of lego sets he didn't sell is $30 / $15 = 2.

So, John still has 2 lego sets.

"Let's break down the information we have about John's running routine. He runs a total of 60 miles a week, spread across 3 days. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours, and on the other two days, he runs half that amount, which is 1.5 hours per day.

To find John's running speed, we need to calculate the total time he spends running. We can do this by adding up the time spent running on each day:
3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate John's running speed by dividing the total distance he runs (60 miles) by the total time he spends running (6 hours):
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. This means her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Now, we're told Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she can travel in 2 hours while running is 2 * 6 = 12 miles.
The distance she can travel in 4 hours while walking is 4 * 1.5 = 6 miles.

The total distance she can travel in 6 hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

"The legendary dragon Perg, a formidable foe indeed. To determine the safe distance from which Polly can vanquish the beast, we must first calculate the maximum distance she can throw the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone.

Polly's unaided throwing distance is 400 feet. However, with the gemstone, her range increases threefold. Thus, the total distance she can throw the javelin is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, to find the safe distance from the dragon's flames, we subtract the dragon's range (1000 feet) from Polly's throwing distance: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"Let's break this down step by step. We know you've got a daily calorie target of 2000, and you've already consumed 1800 calories. That means you've got 200 calories left to play with.

Now, the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, so we need to figure out how many servings you can have with those 200 calories. To do that, we'll divide 200 by 250, which gives us 0.8 servings.

The bag is 300g and has 5 servings, so we need to find out how many grams are in 0.8 servings. First, we'll find out how many grams are in one serving: 300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving. Then, we'll multiply that by 0.8: 60g * 0.8 = 48g.

The answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to determine how much it costs Charlie to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, he'll need 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Charlie will make from selling the 20 candles. He sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's find Charlie's net profit by subtracting his total cost from his total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down Meredith's writing schedule for the week.

Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find out how many more articles she wrote, we'll calculate 2/5 of 5, which is (2/5) * 5 = 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She then purchased a package of Post-it notes, which we'll call x. After buying the package, she had a total of 80 + x Post-it notes.

At work, she used 220 Post-it notes, leaving her with (80 + x) - 220 Post-it notes. We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, so we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

To solve for x, we can add 220 to both sides of the equation:

80 + x = 23 + 220
80 + x = 243

Next, we'll subtract 80 from both sides:

x = 243 - 80
x = 163

The final answer is: 163"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, so the number of blue ties he bought is 200 / 40 = 5.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he must have bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. To find the cost of a red tie, we calculate 1.5 * 40 = $60.

The total amount spent on red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

To find the total amount spent on ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties: 200 + 600 = $800.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, we can calculate the total number of units by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor.

Total number of units = 15 * 8
Total number of units = 120

Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we can multiply the total number of units by 3/4.

Number of occupied units = 120 * (3/4)
Number of occupied units = 90

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.

Number of unoccupied units = 120 - 90

Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. He decides to start by removing 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds, and each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can calculate the number of toys he needs to remove by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy. 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"Let's break down the problem. The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 

The revenue from truck tires on Thursday is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires on Thursday is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires. 
The revenue from car tires on Friday is 12 * $40 = $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

We know Sophia's car has a 12-gallon tank, and she recently drove 100 miles before needing to fill up with 4 gallons of gas. To determine how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg).

First, let's find out how many miles Sophia gets per gallon. We can do this by dividing the distance she traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used (4 gallons).

mpg = Total miles / Total gallons used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know Sophia's car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can multiply this by the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons) to find the total miles she can drive on a single tank.

10 (initial stickers) + 21 (bought stickers) + 23 (birthday stickers) = 54 stickers

Next, Charlie gives 9 stickers to his sister and uses 28 to decorate a greeting card. To find the total number of stickers he's given away or used, we add these numbers together:
9 (given to sister) + 28 (used for greeting card) = 37 stickers

Now, we subtract the number of stickers he's given away or used from the total number of stickers he had:
54 (total stickers) - 37 (given away and used) = 17 stickers

"To find their combined weights, we first need to determine Alex's weight. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Since Grace weighs 125 pounds, we can calculate Alex's weight as follows:

4 times Grace's weight is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. 
Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, we add their weights together to find their combined weight: 
125 (Grace's weight) + 498 (Alex's weight) = 623 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem. We know the football team played 22 games in total. They won 8 more games than they lost. To find out how many games they won, we can use a simple equation.

Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Then, the number of games they won is x + 8. Since the total number of games is 22, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

So, the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is:
7 + 8 = 15

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. 

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. So, he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of vacations is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.

"Let's break down the problem. The alarm rings three times a day, and we need to find the total number of times it rang today.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times. The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which is 3 * 4 = 12 times. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22

"Hi there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. After 5 years, the company increases her salary by 10% of the initial salary. To find the increase, we multiply the initial salary by 0.10.

$600 * 0.10 = $60

Now, we add the increase to the initial salary to find Sylvie's new monthly salary.

$600 + $60 = $660

Since we want to find her annual salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12.

$660 * 12 = $7920

This is Sylvie's annual salary after the increase, and it will remain the same for the next three years. Therefore, her annual salary after three more years of service is:

$7920"
"Let's break down the problem. We know Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x', then Marilyn sold 10x copies.

Since they sold 88,000 copies combined, we can set up the equation:
x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

The number of copies Harald sold is 8,000.

"To determine the total cost of gift bags for Christina's party, we need to calculate the number of gift bags required. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can find the number of guests that will show up by subtracting 1/4 of the total number of guests from the total.

Number of guests that will show up = Total number of guests - (1/4 * Total number of guests)
= 16 - (1/4 * 16)
= 16 - 4
= 12

Given that Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can find the total number of gift bags required by multiplying the number of guests that will show up by 0.75.

Total gift bags = 0.75 * Number of guests that will show up
= 0.75 * 12
= 9

Since each gift bag costs $2, the total cost will be the product of the total gift bags and the cost per gift bag.

Total cost = Total gift bags * Cost per gift bag
= 9 * 2
= 18

"Hey there, I'm Victor. Let's get down to business and figure out how much potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic.

First, we know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult. So, a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults and children. There are 20 adults, so they'll eat 20 * 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad. There are 5 children, so they'll eat 5 * 5 = 25 pounds of potato salad.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

"Let's break down the information we have about the kids' ages. We know James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. This means Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Now, we're told Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. To find Jackson's age, we subtract 5 from Amy's age: 9 - 5 = 4.

Jackson is 4 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he's 2 seconds faster than Gerald's original time. So, Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means his new time is 90% of his original time. To find 90% of 40 seconds, we multiply 40 by 0.9.

Gerald's new time: 40 * 0.9 = 36 seconds

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know there are 60 dogs in the neighborhood. Since there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2. So, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

Now, we need to find the combined number of pet dogs and cats, which is 60 + 120 = 180.

The problem states that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats: 168 + 60 + 120 = 348.

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the number of girls in the girl scout.

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

Now, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes are in 64 ounces. Each can is 16 ounces, so we divide 64 by 16 to get the number of cans: 64 / 16 = 4.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to get the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. Out of these, 5 cars took an exit to avoid the traffic jam. So, the number of cars that actually went through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. To find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, we subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that went through the traffic jam.

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

Now, Mary has decided to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. That's a total of 40 plants she'll be giving away.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of plants she's giving away from the total number of plants she has: 98 - 40 = 58.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. That's a straightforward one.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To calculate this, we need to find 1/4 of 20, which is 20 * 1/4 = 5. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

We know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. That's 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) = 175

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 
Total pages = 39 

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we subtract that from the total pages. 
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 
Remaining pages = 24 

Now, we need to find out how many pages Solo needs to read per day to finish the remaining pages in 4 days.

Now, we subtract the pieces Poppy placed from the total number of pieces to find the remaining pieces: 1000 - 250 = 750.

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces. To find a third of 750, we multiply 750 by 1/3, which equals 250 pieces.

The total number of pieces placed by Poppy and her mom is 250 + 250 = 500.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of each box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length and width, and 2 inches from the height.

Length (L) = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Width (W) = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Height (H) = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of each box by multiplying the inner dimensions.

Inner volume of each box = L * W * H = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume.

Total inner volume of all 3 boxes = 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches

"Let's break down Frankie's TV watching schedule. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode each night, totaling 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours.

Adding these up, we get 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, we subtract the hours watched on those days from the total: 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours of TV watched on Wednesday.

Now, we know each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes. To find out how many episodes he watched, we convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes.

Dividing the total minutes by the length of each episode, we get 90 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Henry wants to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. If we let x be the number of cookies he baked last year, then he wants to bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he ends up baking 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

Unfortunately, he drops 5 cookies while putting them out to cool, leaving him with a total of (2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

We're told that this number is equal to 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so we can calculate her rowing speed as follows:

Rowing speed = Distance / Time
Rowing speed = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Rowing speed = 1.25 feet per second

Since the shore is 64 seconds away, we can calculate the total distance she needs to row to reach the shore:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds
Distance = 80 feet

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. To find the total amount of water the boat takes on, we need to divide the total distance by 10 and multiply by 2:

Number of 10-foot intervals = Total distance / 10
Number of 10-foot intervals = 80 feet / 10
Number of 10-foot intervals = 8

Total water taken on = Number of 10-foot intervals * 2 liters/interval
Total water taken on = 8 intervals * 2 liters/interval
Total water taken on = 16 liters

Brittany's phone = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone = 300

Now, we are given that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds as x.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sasha has leftover lumber that she wants to sell, and she's looking to make a profit. She has two types of boards: 2 x 4 x 10 and 4 x 4 x 10.

First, let's calculate the total cost price of the lumber. Sasha bought 10 of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards for $10 each, so the total cost for those is 10 * $10 = $100. She also bought 5 of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards for $16 each, so the total cost for those is 5 * $16 = $80. The total cost price is $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the selling price. Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price. For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150. For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120. The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost price from the total selling price: $270 - $180 = $90.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary

"Let's break down Rosie's running into two parts. First, she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. To find the distance she covers in this time, we multiply her speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

After 3 hours, Rosie has 7 - 3 = 4 hours left. In these 4 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour. To find the distance she covers in this time, we multiply her speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the distances she covers in the two parts:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

"Let's tackle this problem step by step. Jennie starts with 60 letters that need stamps, and she puts stamps on one-third of them. To find out how many letters she stamps, we'll divide 60 by 3.

60 / 3 = 20

So, Jennie stamps 20 letters. Now, we know that after she's done, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many were in that pile initially, we'll subtract the number of letters she stamped from the total number of already-stamped letters.

30 - 20 = 10

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Julia had a total of 12 spoons when she went to set the table. We also know that her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to her.

To find out how many spoons Julia had before her husband gave her the 5 new spoons, we subtract 5 from the total number of spoons: 
12 - 5 = 7

However, we also know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, to find out how many spoons Julia had before she used those 3 spoons, we add 3 to the 7 spoons: 
7 + 3 = 10

Therefore, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

"I'd be happy to help you out. So, Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages and 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. To find the total number of sausages, we need to calculate the number of fish sausages first.

The number of fish sausages is 6 more than the number of chicken sausages, which is 38. So, the number of fish sausages is 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, let's add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages to find the total number of sausages. That's 38 + 44 = 82.

"I'd be happy to help you out. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the price of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we're told that an orange costs $5 less than a watermelon. So, the price of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dillon needs to buy:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we add up the costs: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the total time spent by the doctors in minutes. With 500 patients and an average of 24 minutes per patient, the total time is:
500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Now, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital pays the doctors $150 per hour, so the total cost of the doctors is:
200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

On the other hand, the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour. So, the total revenue from the patients is:
200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:
Profit = Revenue - Cost
Profit = $40,000 - $30,000
Profit = $10,000

Mark took two tests, one with 75 questions and the other with 100 questions. He completed the tests at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions. To find out how many questions he completed, we multiply the number of hours by the rate: 8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions. Again, we multiply the number of hours by the rate: 6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions.

Now, let's add up the total number of questions Mark completed: 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

The total number of questions in both tests is 75 + 100 = 175 questions.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a total of 20 cars available for rent, consisting of automatic, manual, and semi-automatic cars. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the sum of automatic and manual cars from the total.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4
Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, let's calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars. We do this by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and then multiplying by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's break down the problem. We know there are 700 bees in total, and we need to find the number of worker bees. We're given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and there are twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is 2Q. And since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2(2Q) = 4Q.

Now, we know the total number of bees is the sum of queens, baby bees, and worker bees. So, we can set up the equation:
Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700

Combine like terms:
7Q = 700

Divide by 7:
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of worker bees:

The non-food items are light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4. The total cost of these items is $3 + $3 + $4 = $10.

Now, we need to apply the 10% tax to the non-food items. To do this, we multiply the total cost of non-food items by 0.10, which gives us $10 * 0.10 = $1. Adding this tax to the total cost of non-food items, we get $10 + $1 = $11.

Now, since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many harvests he can have in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
12 months/year ÷ 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests/year

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours left the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees. Now, let's calculate the total number of bees that left the hive and hadn't returned yet: 30 (from the first 6 hours) - 15 (that returned) + 60 (that left in the next 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Finally, in the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before and hadn't already returned came back to the hive. Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 75.

First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time.

So, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total amount made is 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents.

Now, let's denote the original number of french fries as x. The number of fries remaining after Dave, the seagull, and the pigeons ate is x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 30.

A raccoon then stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, so the number of fries the raccoon stole is 2/3 * (x - 30). The remaining number of fries is 1/3 * (x - 30).

The ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, 1/3 * (x - 30) = 5 + 1 = 6.

Now, we can solve for x:
1/3 * (x - 30) = 6
x - 30 = 6 * 3
x - 30 = 18
x = 18 + 30
x = 48

After 26 months: $178.30 + 20% of $178.30 = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96
After 28 months: $213.96 + 20% of $213.96 = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75
After 30 months: $256.75 + 20% of $256.75 = $256.75 + $51.35 = $308.10
After 32 months: $308.10 + 20% of $308.10 = $308.10 + $61.62 = $369.72
After 34 months: $369.72 + 20% of $369.72 = $369.72 + $73.94 = $443.66
After 36 months: $443.66 + 20% of $443.66 = $443.66 + $88.73 = $532.39

The cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months will be $532.39."
"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 5 red cars, and each car costs $4. So, the total cost of the red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.

Next, we have 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5. Therefore, the total cost of the action figures is 3 x $5 = $15.

Now, the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which is $15.

To find the total cost of all the toys, we simply add up the cost of each type of toy: $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories. The computer costs €1090, the scanner is €157, the CD burner is €74, and the printer is €102. 

So, the total cost is: €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423.

Now, let's subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget of €1500. 

€1500 - €1423 = €77.

"To figure out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to calculate the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans and then divide that by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job.

Since each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs and she needs to make 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is 3 eggs/flan * 15 flans = 45 eggs.

Given that Sandra gets 9 eggs per babysitting job, we can determine the number of jobs needed by dividing the total eggs required by the eggs per job: 45 eggs / 9 eggs/job = 5 jobs.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so if Brooke's age is x, then Seth's age is 2x.

In 2 years, Brooke will be x + 2 years old, and Seth will be 2x + 2 years old. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as an equation: (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28.

Combine the x terms and the constants: 3x + 4 = 28.

Now, let's solve for x. Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 8.

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is 2x = 2 * 8 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"

Granny Red's age is two times Sally Four's age, which makes Granny Red 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all four birds: 
8 (Sally Four) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51

"Let's break down Jessica's monthly debt payments. She's got a few different debts with minimum payments: $300 for her student loans, $200 for her credit card, and $500 for her mortgage. To find the total minimum payment, we add those up: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000.

Now, Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To calculate that, we find 50% of $1000, which is 0.5 * $1000 = $500. Adding that to the minimum payment, we get $1000 + $500 = $1500 per month.

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

"I'd be happy to help Billy with his potato prep time. To calculate the total time, we need to find out how long it takes him to peel and cut one potato, then multiply that by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's convert the time it takes to peel a potato into just minutes: 1 minute 30 seconds is equal to 1.5 minutes. The time to cut a potato is 5 seconds, which is 5/60 = 0.0833 minutes.

Now, we add the time to peel and the time to cut: 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes = 1.5833 minutes per potato.

Since Billy has 60 potatoes, we multiply the time per potato by 60: 1.5833 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 95 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the cost per gallon of lemonade. The cost of lemons is $3 and the cost of sugar is $2, so the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Next, we need to calculate the revenue per gallon. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the profit per gallon. Profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon, which is $10 - $5 = $5.

We know that Juan and his brother made a total profit of $25. To find out the total number of gallons they made, we can divide the total profit by the profit per gallon: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Finally, we need to find out how much they spent on lemons. Since the cost of lemons per gallon is $3, the total cost of lemons is 5 gallons * $3 = $15.

"Let's break down Zaid's expenses and donations to find out how much he'll have left.

First, we need to calculate how much he spends on rent and car fuel. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = 1500. He spends 1/3 on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = 2000.

Total spent so far: 1500 + 2000 = 3500

Now, let's find out how much he has left after these expenses: 6000 - 3500 = 2500.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500 = 1250.

After the donation, he's left with: 2500 - 1250 = 1250.

Finally, he gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, which totals 200 + 700 = 900.

"Let's break down the problem. We have two teams competing in a 4 by 400 meter relay. One team is well-rounded, with each member running their 400 meter leg in 55 seconds. The other team is less well-rounded, with their first runner taking 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner being 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

To find the total time taken by the well-rounded team, we simply multiply the time taken by each member by 4:
55 * 4 = 220 seconds

Now, let's calculate the total time taken by the less well-rounded team. Their first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster). So, the total time taken by this team is:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's dive into the problem at hand. Jerry is rolling a six-sided die, and we want to find out how much more likely it is that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

First, let's consider the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die: 4, 5, and 6. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5. Since the die is rolled twice, we multiply the probabilities together: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

The difference between the two probabilities is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and the hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can find the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by subtracting the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and the hamsters. This is 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15. We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, so the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

Now, let's look at Brinley's scores on the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. To find the total score of these tests, we add them up: 
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

Since the lowest score (71) will be removed, we subtract it from the total score of the first 5 tests:
438 - 71 = 367.

Now, we add the total score required (465) and subtract the total score of the remaining 4 tests (367) to find the required score on the 6th test:
465 - 367 = 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"I'd be happy to help you out. Let's break down Micheal's bike riding into two parts: the first 4 weeks and the last 3 weeks.

For the first 4 weeks, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week, which is a total of 5 * 4 = 20 times. Since he rode 25 kilometers each time, he covered a total distance of 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

In the last 3 weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week, which is a total of 2 * 3 = 6 times. This time, he rode 60 kilometers each time, so he covered a total distance of 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Now, let's add the distances from both periods: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's get to the problem at hand. We need to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, which contains 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. So, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Now, we're told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. This means that each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar, which is 40g / 2 = 20g.

The total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we simply add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"Let's break down Rose's cake purchases day by day. On Monday, she bought 4 cakes. 

The next day, she bought three times that number, so 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

Then on Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she did on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add up the total number of cakes she bought: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since half a dozen is 6, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since 1 dozen is 12, twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34800 / 240 = $145.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sara wants to buy a jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes for $20 each, so the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

The total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, Sara still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4). 

$40 / $4 = 10

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Jerry has a certain number of red chickens and white chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day.

We are also given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r'. Then, the number of white chickens is 'r + 2'.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of eggs collected per day:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello there, I'm Victor. To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The park is a rectangle with a length of 6 miles and a width of 1.5 miles. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). Plugging in the values, we get:

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed of 3 miles/hour to find the time:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day. The next day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means there were 100 + 50 = 150 customers on the second day.

To find the total number of customers on the first two days, we add the customers from both days: 100 + 150 = 250.

Now, we know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day: 500 - 250 = 250.

"Let's dive into this problem. We have two pools, both leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. We're given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. We need to find out how much water the small pool has now.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water, it had 2x gallons at that time.

In 4 minutes, both pools lost 16 gallons of water (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes). So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

We know that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

So, the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

24 - 16 = 8

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we'll first calculate the total cost of the items. The shoes cost $320.00, and the belt costs $32.00. 

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we'll divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage of $8.00 to find out how many hours she needs to work.

$352.00 / $8.00 = 44 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. To find the total amount she needs to pay back, we calculate the additional 10%: 0.1 * $2000 = $200. So the total amount she needs to pay back is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months. She's going to pay $165 a month, so the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find Janeth's remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses. So, the number of dahlias is 4 (roses) + 7 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias. Total flowers = 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Harriet is 21 years old, and her age is half of Zack's age. So, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Now, we're told Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. Therefore, Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

To find their ages in three years, we add 3 years to each of their current ages:
- Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack's age in three years: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian's age in three years: 63 + 3 = 66

Now, let's calculate the average age in three years:
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that four students scored a total of 251 points in a board game. Naomi scored 68 of the points. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna first.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Adding 10 to that, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Celine started with 120 liters of water in the tank. She used 90 liters to water her garden, so we need to subtract that from the initial amount to find out how much water was left.

Water left = Initial water - Water used
Water left = 120 - 90
Water left = 30 liters

Now, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. To find the amount of rainwater collected, we multiply the water left by 2.

Rainwater collected = 2 * Water left
Rainwater collected = 2 * 30
Rainwater collected = 60 liters

Finally, we add the water left and the rainwater collected to find the total amount of water in the tank now.

Total water now = Water left + Rainwater collected
Total water now = 30 + 60

The bus ride takes 6 days, and driving takes half that time. To figure out the total travel time, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive back.

Since driving takes half as long as the bus ride, the return trip will take 6 / 2 = 3 days.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. James initially has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type Pokémon cards. He loses 8 water type cards, so he's left with 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. Then, he buys 14 grass type cards, bringing his total grass type cards to 20 + 14 = 34.

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards. We add the number of fire type cards (which remains the same), the updated number of grass type cards, and the updated number of water type cards. 
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100.
Percentage chance = (32 / 96) * 100 ≈ 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to calculate the number of students who went out through exits A and B first.

First, let's find the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as 0.3 * 1000, which equals 300.

Now, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total number of students to find the remaining students. This is 1000 - 300, which equals 700.

Next, we find the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we can calculate this as (3/5) * 700, which equals 420.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Mike initially had 5 pen pals, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he's now pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of these 3 pen pals sends him 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. This means he writes 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week. Since each letter is 5 pages long, Mike writes a total of 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.

Now, we know Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find the total time he spends writing a week, we multiply the total number of pages he writes by the time it takes him to write a page: 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes.

Finally, we convert the total minutes to hours by dividing by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.

"Let's dive into this problem. We have two aquariums with different numbers of snails: one with 4 snails and the other with 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

Now, we're told that this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can represent the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. The total number of fish in both aquariums would then be 2x.

We can set up an equation based on the given information: 2 * 2x = 28, since the difference in snails is twice the total number of fish.

Simplifying the equation, we get 4x = 28. To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides by 4, giving us x = 28 / 4 = 7.

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jean's makeup artist charges $250 an hour, and she needs 6 hours of makeup work done each day, 4 times a week. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

First, we need to calculate the total hours of makeup work per week: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week. Then, we multiply this by the number of weeks: 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total cost before the discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Since the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount: 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the amount Jean paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

Now, let's find the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's sister: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Initially, we have 10 stalls with 20 cows each, but the problem later mentions 20 stalls. Assuming the initial 10 stalls are part of the 20 stalls, we'll proceed with the calculation.

First, we find the total number of cows Mr. Sylas adds to the 20 stalls. He buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, we need to find the initial number of cows in the 20 stalls. Since 10 stalls have 20 cows each, the initial 10 stalls have 10 * 20 = 200 cows. To find the number of cows in the remaining 10 stalls, we'll assume they have 0 cows initially (as there's no information about them). The total initial number of cows in the 20 stalls is 200.

After adding 2 cows to each stall, the total number of cows in the 20 stalls becomes 200 + 40 = 240 cows. Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows in the first 10 stalls) + 2 (new cows) = 22 cows in the first 10 stalls, and 0 (initial cows) + 2 (new cows) = 2 cows in the remaining 10 stalls.

To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we need to consider the two cases: 8 stalls from the first 10 stalls and 8 stalls from the remaining 10 stalls, or a mix of both. 

If we consider 8 stalls from the first 10 stalls, the total number of cows is 8 * 22 = 176.

However, the termites ate 30% of the tree, so we need to subtract that from the total weight. To find 30% of 8000 pounds, we multiply by 0.3: 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds. Now, we subtract that from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Since a dozen is 12 cookies, we divide 66 by 12 to get the total number of dozens.
66 / 12 = 5.5 dozen cookies

Now, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies. To find the total amount of flour needed, we multiply 5.5 by 2.
5.5 * 2 = 11 cups

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's tackle this problem together. We have 9,300 pennies in a cup, and we want to find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies.

First, we need to calculate two thirds of 9,300. To do this, we multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3. This gives us (9,300 * 2) / 3 = 6,200 pennies.

Now, we need to convert 6,200 pennies to dollars. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 pennies, we can do this by dividing 6,200 by 100. This gives us 6,200 / 100 = 62 dollars.

The final answer is: $62"
"Let's calculate the total number of marbles Maddison has now. 

First, we need to find out how many marbles she had in the boxes. Since she has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles per box: 5 * 50 = 250 marbles.

Then, she received 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she has now, we add the marbles she received to the marbles she already had: 250 + 20 = 270.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Next, Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. To find the number of trees Harry has, we multiply Ferdinand's trees by 2 and add 5. So, Harry has (3 * 2) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

Now, to find the difference in the number of trees between Harry's and Ferdinand's yards, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard. That's 11 - 3 = 8.

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the additional fees associated with the purchase. 

First, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of $350,000. This is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

Next, we calculate the transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price. This is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

Now, we add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee to get the total price of the house: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Finally, we subtract Mrs. Cruz's budget from the total price to find the difference: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to determine the total amount he received and subtract the total amount he paid.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees and brokerage fee. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, which is $400,000. So, the transfer fees are 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

In addition to these fees, Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the total amount he paid, we add the transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount: $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

Now, we subtract the total amount Mr. Tan paid from the selling price to find his net proceeds: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees. To find 40% of 20 minutes, I'll multiply 20 by 0.4, which gives me 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

The total time to warm the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Therefore, it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook.

Now, let's add the time it took to warm the oil and the time it took to cook. The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step. The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad and bought 50 of them. To find the total cost of newspaper ads, we multiply the number of ads by the cost per ad: 50 * $5 = $250.

Next, the agent spent $75 on each television ad and bought 15 of them. We calculate the total cost of television ads in the same way: 15 * $75 = $1125.

Now, we add the cost of newspaper ads and television ads to find the total amount spent: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 2 houses, each with 3 bedrooms. Since each bedroom has 2 windows, the total number of windows in the bedrooms per house is 3 * 2 = 6.

In addition to the bedroom windows, each house has 4 more windows. So, the total number of windows per house is 6 (bedroom windows) + 4 (additional windows) = 10.

Now, since we have 2 houses, we multiply the total number of windows per house by 2. Therefore, the total number of windows is 10 * 2 = 20.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete. The collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so that's 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 
900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Sean has to memorize the lyrics to a solo song with 54 lines.

Next, we're told the first scene has twice the number of lines as the song. So, the first scene has 54 * 2 = 108 lines. However, Sean only needs to memorize a third of those lines, which is 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

Moving on to the second scene, it has six more lines than the song, giving it a total of 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Since four-fifths of those lines are his, Sean needs to memorize 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines for the second scene.

Now, let's add up the lines for the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Carly had 80 cards, and we need to find out how many of them had the letter D on them.

First, we know that 2/5 of the cards had the letter A on them. To find the number of cards with A, we multiply 80 by 2/5:
80 * 2/5 = 32

Now, we subtract the cards with A from the total to find the remaining cards:
80 - 32 = 48

Next, we're told that 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B. To find the number of cards with B, we multiply 48 by 1/2:
48 * 1/2 = 24

We subtract the cards with B from the remaining:
48 - 24 = 24

Then, we know that 5/8 of the rest had the letter C on them. To find the number of cards with C, we multiply 24 by 5/8:
24 * 5/8 = 15

Now, we subtract the cards with C from the remaining:
24 - 15 = 9

The remaining cards have the letter D, so the number of cards with D is 9.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and 10 minutes to dig a large hole. We need to find out how many hours it'll take him to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

First, I'll calculate the time it takes to dig the small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes. Then, I'll calculate the time for the large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes.

Now, I'll add the time for both types of holes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes. To convert this to hours, I'll divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can represent Ruby's age as 6S, where S is Sam's age.

Now, in 9 years, Ruby's age will be 6S + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This gives us the equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides gives us:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

S = 6

"Let's tackle this problem step by step. We know that a cobra has 70 spots and that it has twice as many spots as a mamba. To find the number of spots on a mamba, we can simply divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2.

Number of spots on a mamba = 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas.

Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70 = 2800
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35 = 2100
Total spots on all snakes = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Finally, we need to find half the number of spots they all have combined.

Given that each necklace is 25 inches long, the length taken up by the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Now, since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can find the number of beads by dividing the total length of the beads by the length of each bead: 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

Three rows of 8 stars is 3 * 8 = 24 stars. Two rows of 6 stars is 2 * 6 = 12 stars. So, the total number of stars in these rows is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Now, we subtract this from the total number of stars on the flag: 76 - 36 = 40 stars. These 40 stars are arranged in rows of 5. To find the number of rows, we divide the total number of stars by 5: 40 / 5 = 8.

Now, in the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Mike and Tony have over 20 points, so they each get 1 extra point. Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.

After the extra points have been distributed, Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points, Jim still has 18 points, and Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

To find the total points for all three players, we add their points together: 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 * 5 = 300 miles. He does this for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 300 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the miles driven. John gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost for miles driven per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

In addition to the cost per mile, John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

"The art of creating a simple folding newspaper or tabloid. It's quite fascinating, really. To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, let's break it down.

When you fold a piece of paper vertically and unfold it, you essentially create a front and back side. The pages are then arranged in a specific order, with page 1 on the left back, page 2 on the left front, and so on. This pattern continues until you reach page 32 on the right back and page 31 on the right front.

Now, let's think about how the pages are paired. Each piece of paper has a front and back side, which means that two pages are printed on each piece of paper. To find the total number of pieces of paper used, we can divide the total number of pages by 2.

However, this is where things get interesting. The way the pages are arranged implies that we need to consider the front and back sides as a single unit. In this case, we can think of the 32 pages as being divided into 8 sections, with 4 pages in each section (2 on the front and 2 on the back).

So, the correct calculation is:

Number of pieces of paper = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"I'd be happy to help you out. So, Annika brought $50 to the town fair and spent half of it on food and snacks. That's $50 / 2 = $25. On top of that, she spent $10 on rides, making the total amount spent $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's see how much she has left. We subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Elise started with 250 books and has 50 unsold books left, so she's sold a total of 250 - 50 = 200 books.

We're also told that she sold 45 books this year and twice as many in the first year, which means she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

Now, let's find out how many books she sold in the second year. We know the total number of books sold is 200, and we know the number of books sold in the first and current year. So, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Since each book sells for 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300$.

"Let's break down Watson's earnings for the month of April. He works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week, which translates to 50 hours per week. With an hourly wage of $10, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 50 * $10 = $500 per week.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. Assuming a 4-week month, his total earnings from his hourly wage are $500 * 4 = $2000. His total bonus for the month is $300 * 4 = $1200.

Combining these two amounts, Watson's total earnings for the month are $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

"Hey there, let's get to it. John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he lost to, we need to calculate the number of people that make up the remaining 20%.

Since 80% is the percentage of people he beats, that means 20% is the percentage of people he loses to. To find 20% of 20, we multiply 0.20 by 20.

0.20 * 20 = 4

So, John lost to 4 people.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. To find out how many loaves are sold in the morning, we need to calculate two-thirds of 60. 

Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total to find out how many are left: 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"Let's break this down step by step. We know Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so to find out how much he loses in a week, we divide 8 by 4. That's 2 pounds per week.

Now, we're told Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, that means Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

The question asks how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks, which is 8 pounds. To find this out, we need to figure out how many 4-week periods it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since she loses 2 pounds every 4 weeks, to lose 8 pounds, it will take her 8 / 2 * 4 = 16 weeks.

"Let's calculate the total savings when buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

First, I'll find the savings from the ice cream. The original price is $13, and the sale price is $11. So, the savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we're buying 2 tubs, the total savings from the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

Next, I'll calculate the savings from the milk. The discount is $0.5 per packet, and we're buying 4 packets. So, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Now, I'll add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings: $4 + $2 = $6.

"The Lots-of-Limbs Serum, a most intriguing concoction. To determine the total number of new limbs it will cause a person to grow, we must consider the growth patterns of both arms and legs.

Arms grow at a rate of one every three days. Over the course of 15 days, this translates to 15 / 3 = 5 new arms.

Legs, on the other hand, grow at a rate of one every five days. In 15 days, this results in 15 / 5 = 3 new legs.

Combining these two values, we find that the total number of new limbs is 5 + 3 = 8.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down Theo's expenses for his business trip to South Africa.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the business suits. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so that's 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, he buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, which comes out to 3 * $50 = $150.

The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that is $500, and adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket $1200.

Now, let's add up all of Theo's expenses: $600 for the suits, $150 for the suitcases, and $1200 for the flight ticket. That's a total of $1950.

Theo's total budget for the trip is $6000, and he wants to save $2000. To find out how much he has left to spend on gifts, we subtract his total expenses and the amount he wants to save from his budget: $6000 - $1950 - $2000 = $2050.

"Hello there, let's break down the problem. We have a family of 5, with 3 people eating 3 eggs each day and the remaining 2 people eating 2 eggs each day. To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the daily egg consumption and then multiply it by 7.

First, let's calculate the daily egg consumption. The 3 people eating 3 eggs each day consume a total of 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. The remaining 2 people eating 2 eggs each day consume a total of 2 * 2 = 4 eggs. So, the total daily egg consumption for the family is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Now, let's multiply the daily egg consumption by 7 to find the total number of eggs consumed in a week. 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Cera's current age, which is 46 years. To find her age six years ago, we subtract 6 from her current age: 46 - 6 = 40 years.

Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, we can find his age at that time by dividing Cera's age by 2: 40 / 2 = 20 years.

Now, we know the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. So, we multiply 3000 by 20 to find the population six years ago: 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Given that the population six years ago was half of the current population, we can find the current population by multiplying the population six years ago by 2: 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

Population of Chile now: 120,000"
"Let's tackle this problem step by step. We know the football team has 105 members, and we need to find out how many players are on the defense.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, so that's D/2.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of players:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify, let's multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"I'd be happy to help Martha figure out how many people will show up to her party. 

First, let's calculate the total number of people she invited. There were 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 people. Then, there were 3 families with 4 people each, which is 3 * 4 = 12 people. Adding those together, we get 12 + 12 = 24 people.

However, not everyone can make it. 8 people are out due to illness, and 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. To find 1/4 of 8, we multiply 8 by 1/4, which is 2. So, 8 + 2 = 10 people can't make it.

Now, let's subtract the people who can't make it from the total number of people invited. 24 - 10 = 14.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Solomon initially had 50 marbles in the store. He then bought 20 marbles from Johanna, bringing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.

In addition to the marbles he bought, Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find out how many marbles his father gave him, we multiply 20 by 2/5, which equals 8 marbles.

Now, we add the marbles his father gave him to the total: 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156."
"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet and then multiply it by the cost per cubic foot.

The pool's dimensions are given as 6 feet by 4 feet, with a depth of 5 feet. To find the volume, we multiply these dimensions together:
Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Now, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot, which is $0.1:
Cost = volume * cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * 0.1
Cost = 12

Next, we find the number of nongendered children: 1/10 the number of boys is 1/10 * 30 = 3 nongendered children.

Now, we add up the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children in the classroom: 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's tackle this problem together. We're given a ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Now, we know that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. To find the total number of electric poles required, we can set up a simple proportion. Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the proportion would be:

1 pole / 3 wires = x poles / 45 wires

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3x = 45

Now, divide both sides by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

Now, we're given that 22 men stayed at the party. This means 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party. Since a total of 10 people left, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

To find the number of women who stayed, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women. So, 15 - 7 = 8.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. To find out how many pencils are in the boxes, we subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total: 26 - 2 = 24 pencils.

Since there are 3 boxes, we divide the total number of pencils in the boxes by 3 to find out how many pencils each box can hold: 24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box.

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils, so together they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold: 72 / 8 = 9.

"Let's break down the two job offers to determine which one has a higher net pay rate.

First, let's analyze Job A. The job pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, which translates to a gross income of $15 * 2000 = $30,000 per year. With a 20% total tax rate, the taxes would be $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. Therefore, the net income for Job A would be $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Now, let's look at Job B. The job pays $42,000 a year, but there's a $6,000 property tax. So, the net income before tax would be $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. With a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax, the taxes would be $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. Therefore, the net income for Job B would be $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Comparing the two net incomes, it's clear that Job B has a higher net pay rate. To find the difference, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

First, we need to find the initial total value of the shares. Since Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, the initial total value is 8 * $8 = $64.

Now, the stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4. So, the new price per share after the first year is $8 + $4 = $12. The new total value after the first year is 8 * $12 = $96.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. We calculate 25% of $12, which is 0.25 * $12 = $3. The new price per share after the second year is $12 - $3 = $9. Therefore, the new total value after the second year is 8 * $9 = $72.

Let's say the number of cows is x. Since he's got twice as many chickens, that means he's got 2x chickens. We know the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 60. That simplifies to 3x = 60. Divide both sides by 3, and we get x = 20.

So, Farmer Brown's got 20 cows and 2x = 2(20) = 40 chickens. Now, let's count those legs. Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2. Total legs = (20 * 4) + (40 * 2) = 80 + 80 = 160.

"To find the total cost of the shirts before the discount, we need to multiply the cost of one shirt by 2. 
2 shirts * $30/shirt = $60

Next, we calculate the discount amount by multiplying the total cost by the discount percentage. Since the discount is 40%, we multiply by 0.40.
Discount = $60 * 0.40 = $24

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Davos paid.
$60 - $24 = $36

"Let's break down the problem. The factory used to make tractors, selling 10 a day at $100 each, which translates to $1000 per day. Now, they're making silos, selling 5 a day at $220 each, which comes out to $1100 per day.

To find the percentage increase, we need to calculate the difference in daily earnings and then divide it by the original daily earnings. The difference is $1100 - $1000 = $100. 

Now, let's calculate the percentage increase: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

"I'd be happy to help you out. Let's break down Madeline's monthly expenses for her dog. 

First, we have the cost of food, which is $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, that's $25 * 4 = $100 per month.

Next, we have the cost of treats, which is $20 per month.

Lastly, we have the cost of medicine, which is $100 per month.

Adding all these up, we get $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 per month.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12. So, $220 * 12 = $2640.

"Let's break down John's activities to find out how much time he spent sightseeing. 

First, we know he spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This was 30% of the time he spent, so we can set up the equation:
15 = 0.3x, where x is the total time spent.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:
x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

So, the total time spent is 50 hours.

He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so we can calculate the time spent sightseeing:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20

"Let's break down Annabelle's savings and earnings. She already has $80 in her savings. 

At her first job, Annabelle earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200. 

At her second job, Annabelle earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

Adding these amounts to her initial savings, Annabelle now has 80 + 200 + 75 = $355.

Since the phone costs $400, Annabelle still needs 400 - 355 = $45.

First, we know the shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Now, let's find the combined height of the shortest and second tree: 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two smaller trees. So, we multiply the combined height by 2: 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Dean's mother gave him $28 to go to the toy store. He bought 6 toy cars at $2 each, so the total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12. He also bought 5 teddy bears at $1 each, so the total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.

The total cost of the toys is $12 + $5 = $17. To find out how much money Dean has left, we subtract the total cost of the toys from the initial amount of money he had: $28 - $17 = $11.

But wait, his mother then gave him an extra $10. So, we add this to the amount he had left: $11 + $10 = $21.

"Hey there, let's break down Morgan's birthday party budget. She's got $90 to spend, and she wants to make sure everyone gets to play a round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice.

First, we need to calculate the total cost per person. A round of mini-golf is $5, the arcade tokens are $5, and the go-karts cost $10 per ride. Since they're riding twice, that's $20 for the go-karts. Adding it all up, the total cost per person is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Now, let's divide the total budget by the cost per person to see how many people Morgan can invite, including herself. $90 / $30 = 3. But wait, Morgan is one of those people, so we need to subtract 1 from the result. That leaves us with 2 friends Morgan can invite.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know Billy bought 40 gumballs at $.05 each. To find the total cost of the gumballs, we multiply the number of gumballs by the cost per gumball: 40 * .05 = $2.

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, the total change he had must have been 2 * 2 = $4.

Now, we know Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is 10 - 4 = $6.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so to find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the amount spent on candy by the cost per pound: 6 / 1.5 = 4.

"Let's break down the train's route. The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, and then 100 miles from the second city to the third city. To find the distance from the third city to the first city, we need to calculate 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs. 

The combined distance of the first two legs is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled by the train in one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To determine how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down John's road trip to determine the total time it took.

First, we need to calculate the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house. The original distance was 200 miles, but he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance 210 miles. Since he drove at a speed of 70 mph, we can calculate the time as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 210 miles / 70 mph
Time = 3 hours

Next, we'll calculate the time it took for John to drive back home. The distance for the return trip was 240 miles, and he drove at a speed of 80 mph. Using the same formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Now, we add the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house and the time it took for him to drive back home to find the total time:

Total time = Time to friend's house + Time back home
Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time = 6 hours

Number of boys = 96 - 43
Number of boys = 53

Now, we're told that 4 fourth-grade boys were absent on Friday. To find the number of boys present, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

Next, we're told that a number equal to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. So, we calculate that as 4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

Then, we find out that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. That's 3 * 7 = 21.

Now, we add up the number of people kicked out for these reasons: 3 (masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31.

We're given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the given reasons from the total: 50 - 31 = 19.

Erin's current points = 3 * 8
Erin's current points = 24

Now, we know that Erin scored 14 points. To find out how many points she had before, we can subtract 14 from her current points.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames. Since each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to add the cost of etching the logo on each frame, which is an additional 20% of the frame's cost. This comes out to be 0.2 * $880 = $176. So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is $880 + $176 = $1056.

Now, let's consider the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each, so the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

We also need to account for the cords that will be given to the officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 seniors. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find her profit, we subtract her total cost from her total revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Now, we know she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the total number of hours she spends running the stand, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups she sells per hour: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

"Let's break down the problem. Dasha needs to buy tickets for 9 rides, and each ride costs 2 tickets. So, she needs a total of 9 * 2 = 18 tickets. Since each ticket costs $2, the total cost of her tickets is 18 * $2 = $36.

On the other hand, David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

To find out how much money David saves, we need to subtract the cost of his ride bracelet from the cost of Dasha's tickets. So, the amount of money David saves is $36 - $30 = $6.

"I'd be happy to help Monica with her gift wrapping. To determine how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we need to calculate the total number of gifts and then divide the total amount of ribbon by that number.

Monica has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. So, the total number of gifts is 6 + 4 + 2 = 12.

Now, let's divide the total amount of ribbon, which is 144 inches, by the total number of gifts: 144 ÷ 12 = 12.

"Let's tackle this problem step by step. We know the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to determine the total number of popsicles each of them has.

The total parts in the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11. Now, we divide the total number of popsicles they have together (165) by the total parts (11) to find the value of 1 part: 
165 / 11 = 15.

Since Betty has 5 parts, she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.

Since Sam has 6 parts, he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

Now, let's find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty:
90 - 75 = 15.

"I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the costs here. Tim is getting Netflix for $10 a month, and he's also getting Hulu and Disney Plus, which normally cost $10 each. However, he's able to save 20% by bundling them.

First, let's calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount. The original cost is $20, and the discount is 20% of that, which is $4. So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix to get the total cost of the streaming services: $16 + $10 = $26.

Finally, to find out how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 - $26 = $34.

"Let's break down Carol's work time. She spent 4 hours writing a song, which is a significant chunk of her time. Recording the song took her half that time, so that's 4 / 2 = 2 hours. Lastly, she spent 90 minutes editing, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours.

To find the total time, I'll add these up: 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

Now, I'll calculate the percentage of time she spent editing. To do this, I'll divide the editing time by the total time and multiply by 100: (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%.

"To determine the number of books Wendy needs, we first calculate the total capacity of the shelving system. With 6 rows and 6 columns, the system can hold 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Since Wendy wants double the number of books that can fit in the system, we multiply the capacity by 2: 2 * 36 = 72 books.

However, Wendy also wants 20 more books than double the capacity. So, we add 20 to the result: 72 + 20 = 92 books.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Erica initially had 20 Valentine's cards that she made. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, the total number of cards she had from her dad is 2 * 15 = 30. Adding the cards she made, Erica had a total of 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She then passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards. Subtracting the cards she passed out from the total cards she had, we get 50 - 29 = 21.

Finally, Erica received 17 cards from family and friends. Adding these to the cards she had left, we get 21 + 17 = 38.

First, Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. To find out how many slices that is, we multiply 12 by 1/3, which equals 4 slices.

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We multiply 12 by 1/4, and that's 3 slices.

Now, Jenny eats 2 slices herself. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the slices given to Bill, Mark, and the slices Jenny ate from the total number of slices: 
12 - 4 - 3 - 2 = 3

The amount Mark needs to save is the cost of the bike minus the amount he already has: $300 - $50 = $250.

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can divide the amount he needs to save ($250) by his daily earnings ($10) to find out how many days he needs to save:

$250 ÷ $10 = 25 days

"Let's get down to business and figure out how many bugs Nancy found in her woodshed. 

First, we know she saw 90 spiders. Then, there were 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders. To find the number of millipedes, we multiply the number of spiders by 1/3. 

Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Now, let's calculate the number of stink bugs. It's equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. 

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

To find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together.

Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48
Total number of bugs = 168

"I'd be happy to help Mark with his brownie conundrum. To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs 4 times the amount of flour and milk. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

Now, let's calculate how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy. That's simply the difference between the two: 6 - 2 = 4.

"To calculate the energy saved, we need to determine the original energy usage and the new energy usage. 

Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner. Since he uses it for 8 hours a day, the original energy usage per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours. To convert this to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000 (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts), which equals 7.2 kilowatt-hours.

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new usage time is 8 - 5 = 3 hours. The new energy usage per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours, or 2.7 kilowatt-hours.

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new energy usage: 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours.

To find the energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30: 4.5 kilowatt-hours * 30 = 135 kilowatt-hours.

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps with his friend. So, before the jog, he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that before the jog, he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps taken.

The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

Now, let's move on to June. 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30. The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600. The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26. 

Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"Let's break this down step by step. Indras has 6 letters in her name. To find the number of letters in her sister's name, we need to calculate half of Indras' letters and add 4. Half of 6 is 6 / 2 = 3. Adding 4 to that gives us 3 + 4 = 7 letters in her sister's name.

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we simply add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). 

6 + 7 = 13"
"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order.

First, we need to find the total cost of the items before the discount. Charlotte wants a set of pot and pans for $120.00, a set of mixing bowls for $20.00, and 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each. The total cost of the utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00. Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. To do this, we'll calculate 20% of the total cost: 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00. Now, we'll subtract the discount from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

"Hi there, I'm Victor. Let's help Dora figure out how much more money she needs to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, the total cost is: 
$6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Dora has some money saved up from her allowance, which is $2, and her mother gave her $16. So, the total amount of money she has is: 
$2 + $16 = $18

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Dora has from the total cost of the items to find out how much more money she needs: 
$19 (total cost) - $18 (Dora's money) = $1

"The tale of the dragon-slaying princes. Let's break it down, shall we? 

Prince Thaddeus, the mighty sword-wielder, slew 100 dragons. Prince Arthur, with his trusty spear, took down three-quarters of that number. So, Prince Arthur's count is (3/4) * 100 = 75 dragons.

Now, Prince Walter, armed with a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. That's 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Lastly, we have Prince Bruce, who, in a rather...unconventional manner, used a nail file to slay one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. That's (1/5) * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To determine how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we'll break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many gallons were in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 different containers, we'll divide 15 gallons by 5 containers. 

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container.

Next, we'll find 1/4 of the amount in one container, as that's what Josey needed for her lawnmower. 

1/4 * 3 gallons = 0.75 gallons.

Now, we need to convert 0.75 gallons to pints. Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, we'll multiply 0.75 gallons by 8 pints/gallon.

0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of $5. To find 99% of $5, we multiply $5 by 0.99, which is $4.95. We convert this to cents: $4.95 x 100 = 495 cents.

We know George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x 40 = 120 cents on chips. Now, we subtract the amount spent on chips (120 cents) from the total amount spent (495 cents): 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we divide the remaining amount spent (375 cents) by the cost of a candy bar (75 cents): 375 / 75 = 5.

George bought 5 candy bars.

"Let's break down the problem. Ray started with 25 lollipops and decided to keep 5 for himself. To find out how many lollipops he shared, we subtract the number he kept from the total.

25 (total lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept) = 20 lollipops shared

Now, we know he shared these 20 lollipops equally among his 4 friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends.

20 (lollipops shared) / 4 (number of friends) = 5

"Let's get to the problem at hand. We have a cake that weighs 20 ounces, cut into 8 pieces. If Rory and her mom each have a piece, we need to find the weight of the remaining cake.

First, we find the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight by the number of pieces:

20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, they ate 2 pieces in total. The weight of the eaten cake is:

2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces

Now, we subtract the weight of the eaten cake from the total weight:

20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces

"Bonjour, let's get down to business. Antoine's French onion soup recipe is a classic, and I'm happy to help with the cost calculation.

First, we need to determine the total cost of the ingredients. Antoine requires 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

In addition to the onions, Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are also on sale for $2.00 a box. The total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the ingredients: $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's drive. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Now, let's find the difference in their travel times. Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes, and Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, so the difference is 16 - 4 = 12 minutes.

However, Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so we need to add this extra time to the difference in their travel times. Therefore, Bernadette should leave 12 + 5 = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's tackle this problem together. We're given that the area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet, and the length of his room is 3 yards. To find the perimeter of the room in feet, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, we can make the conversion as follows:

Length (in feet) = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length, we can use the area to find the width. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

Area = Length * Width

Rearranging this formula to solve for the width, we get:

Width = Area / Length
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

With the length and width in hand, we can now find the perimeter of the room. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's dive into the problem at hand. We have two sisters, Elizabeth and Margareth, who bought beads in different quantities. Elizabeth purchased 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, while Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. We're told that each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

To determine how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought. Elizabeth has a total of 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads, and Margareth has 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads.

Now, let's find the total number of beads each sister has by multiplying the number of packs by 20:
Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads.
Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

The difference in the number of beads between the two sisters is:
140 (Margareth's beads) - 60 (Elizabeth's beads) = 80 beads.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Marcus starts with a house temperature of 40 degrees. He then spends 3 hours baking, which increases the temperature by 5 degrees each hour. So, the total increase in temperature from baking is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees. Adding this to the initial temperature, we get 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, causing the temperature to drop. The temperature decreases by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equal to 3 intervals of 10 minutes, the total decrease in temperature is 2 * 3 = 6 degrees. Subtracting this from the temperature after baking, we get 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to calculate Jon's total time. 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Now, let's calculate James' time for the swim and bike ride. 
- James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. 
- 10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
- James' swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes
- James took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. 
- James' bike ride time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' time for the run:
- James' total time: 180 minutes
- James' swim and bike time: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes
- James' run time: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Movie C is 1.25 hours long, so we'll convert that to minutes by multiplying by 60.

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we're told Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to Movie C's length.

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

Finally, we know Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find Movie A's length, we divide Movie B's length by 4.

Movie A = Movie B / 4
Movie A = 80 minutes / 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we need to find out how far the horse runs. We know it runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. To calculate the distance, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is half an hour, so the horse runs for 0.5 hours. Now, we can calculate the distance: 

Distance = speed * time = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it will eat 16 * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay.

The cost of the hay is 8 bails * $3 per bail = $24.

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30. To find out how much change he has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money he has:

$30 - $24 = $6

First, we need to find out how much the salesman spent on the sneakers. He bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, we'll calculate the revenue from the sneakers sold on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from Monday's sale is 17 * $20 = $340.

Now, let's find out how many sneakers were left after Monday's sale. The salesman had 48 sneakers initially and sold 17, so the rest is 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers.

These 31 sneakers were sold for $25 each throughout the rest of the week. The revenue from the rest of the week is 31 * $25 = $775.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from Monday's sale and the rest of the week, which is $340 + $775 = $1115.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue. The profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.

"To determine how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to figure out the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with her 6 jars of sprinkles. Since each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes, we multiply the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate:
6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pan:
48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

"I'd be happy to help you out. So, let's break down the problem. Theo bought a pen for $2, and she also bought a piece of paper. The paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. To find the cost of the paper, we need to calculate three times the price of the pen, which is 3 * $2 = $6. Then, we subtract $1 from that, so the paper costs $6 - $1 = $5.

Now, let's find the total cost of the items. The pen costs $2, and the paper costs $5, so the total cost is $2 + $5 = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10, so to find the change she received, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount she gave the cashier. The change is $10 - $7 = $3.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, we can calculate the total number of pencils as follows:

Total pencils = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

Next, we know that after two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find the number of pencils used, we can multiply the total number of pencils by 1/5:

Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils

Now, we can find the number of pencils remaining after two months by subtracting the pencils used from the total pencils:

Remaining pencils = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

Finally, we know that at the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find the number of pencils left, we can multiply the remaining pencils by 1/3:

Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils

"Let's break down the problem. Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If he wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. The total number of cookies he gets is (x/2) + 2. Since he wants to eat 5 cookies, we can set up the equation:

(x/2) + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we first subtract 2 from both sides:

x/2 = 3

Then, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras is, we need to first convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. 

The shark is 10 feet long, which is equal to 10 * 12 = 120 inches. 

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we can calculate the percentage by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiplying by 100:

(12 / 120) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's tackle this problem. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, which means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. Given that 20 students fall into the latter category, we can set up an equation to find the total number of students.

Let's represent the total number of students as 'x'. Since one-fourth of the students do not have desktop computers, we can write the equation as:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"Hey there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem. Jason wants to break in his new shoes in three weeks, and he can walk 4 days a week. To find out how long he has to spend walking each day, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to break in the shoes and then divide the total walking time by that number.

First, let's find the total number of days Jason has to break in the shoes:
3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days

Now, we know it takes 240 minutes of walking to break in the new shoes. To find out how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we'll divide the total walking time by the total number of days:
240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sarah spent $300 on books, and each book costs $15. To find out how many books she bought, we need to divide the total amount she spent by the cost of each book.

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Now, since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 9 kids allergic to dairy and 6 kids allergic to peanuts. However, 3 kids are allergic to both, so we can't simply add 9 and 6. If we do, we'll be counting those 3 kids twice.

To avoid double-counting, we'll use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts, then subtract the number of kids allergic to both: 9 + 6 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know that 12 kids are allergic to at least one thing. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class: 32 - 12 = 20.

"I'd be happy to help you calculate the cost of Tom's anniversary getaway. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since Tom and his wife are traveling, they'll need two tickets. The cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the hotel. The normal price is $1500 per day, but it's 20% more expensive because it's a busy weekend. To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. So, the hotel price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800. For a 3-day stay, the hotel cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Now, let's add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

Now, let's look at the yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Since Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue tubes and yellow tubes: 2 + 9 = 11.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's get to the problem at hand. We have two pennies, one from 2010 and the other from 1959. The 2010 penny weighs three-quarters of the 1959 penny. Given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny.

To do this, we multiply the weight of the 1959 penny by three-quarters. This gives us:
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:
Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 + 48
Combined weight = 84

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much oats each horse consumes in a day. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and they are fed twice a day, the total amount of oats each horse consumes in a day is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

Now, since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all the horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find out the total amount of oats consumed in 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5. So, 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Finally, since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats consumed in 5 days by the weight of one bag to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs. Therefore, 200 / 50 = 4 bags.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3. To find the total cost of the strawberry gum, we subtract this amount from the total amount Suzie paid: $7 - $3 = $4.

Since Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost by 2 to find the cost of each pack: $4 / 2 = $2.

"I'd be happy to help Frederick with his popsicle stick conundrum. To maximize the number of sticks, we need to find the most cost-effective option. Let's calculate the sticks per dollar for each type of wood.

For 2 x 4 wood, we get 200 sticks for $4, which translates to 200 / 4 = 50 sticks per dollar. For 2 x 8 wood, we get 400 sticks for $6, which gives us 400 / 6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar. Clearly, the 2 x 8 wood is the better value.

Now, let's see how many 2 x 8 woods Frederick can buy with his $24 budget. We'll divide the total money by the cost of each 2 x 8 wood: 24 / 6 = 4. So, he can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

Since each 2 x 8 wood yields 400 sticks, we multiply the number of woods by the number of sticks per wood: 4 * 400 = 1600.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:
x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:
4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 30,000

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device. Her initial daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour, and the new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption after adding the new device will be:

12 kWh/hour + 2 kWh/hour = 14 kWh/hour

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh):

Daily consumption before: 12 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 288 kWh
Daily consumption after: 14 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 336 kWh

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption:

Weekly consumption before: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
Weekly consumption after: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour, so we multiply the weekly consumption by the cost:

Weekly cost before: 2016 kWh * $1.50 = $3024
Weekly cost after: 2352 kWh * $1.50 = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is:

Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can calculate the number of sofas she has: 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's find the total number of sofas and chairs:
Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84

Now, let's consider Jame's cousin. In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 2 * 30 = 60. So, the cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

To find the cousin's current age, we subtract 8 from 55: 55 - 8 = 47.

Finally, we calculate the difference in their current ages: 47 - 22 = 25.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400. We also know the computer cost $1,100 and that he paid $400 less for the printer than the computer.

First, I'll calculate the cost of the printer. Since the printer was $400 less than the computer, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's find the combined cost of the computer and printer. That's $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

To find the cost of the 2 monitors, I'll subtract the cost of the computer and printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 20 kids divided into two equal groups of boys and girls, so that's 10 boys and 10 girls. The boys went out and brought back 60 shells each, which means they brought a total of 10 x 60 = 600 shells.

Now, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. To calculate this, we first find four times the number of shells brought by the boys, which is 4 x 600 = 2400. Then, we add the number of shells brought by the boys, which is 600. So, the girls brought 2400 + 600 = 3000 shells.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of shells they brought by 10 to find out how many shells each girl brought. That's 3000 / 10 = 300.

Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6 years

Now, we're told that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. To find Anne's age, we add 2 to Alyana's age.

"Let's break down the problem. Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125. In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half in order to hit his target.

April has 30 days, so the first half is 15 days and the second half is also 15 days. Let's assume Elvis saves 'x' dollars per day in the first half. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2x dollars per day in the second half.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half. The total savings should be equal to his target of $1125.

Total savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
1125 = 15x + 15(2x)

Combine like terms:
1125 = 15x + 30x
1125 = 45x

Now, divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So, Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2x = 2 * 25 = 50 dollars per day in the second half.

Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We can set up the equation: x + 4x = 100. This simplifies to 5x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 20. This means Brad gets 20 dollars.

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

Total weight lost: 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we know Mark's final weight was 70 pounds. To find his initial weight, we simply add the total weight lost to his final weight.

"I'm happy to help you out. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that when the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. To find the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water, we need to calculate twice the time it takes in cold water and add 2 minutes. Twice 16 minutes is 32 minutes, and adding 2 minutes gives us 34 minutes.

Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim in hot water, we'll assume that the time for warm water is the same as the time for hot water, which is 34 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

Finally, we multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin to find the total amount of money Kate can make:
24 muffins * $1.50 per muffin = $36

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom.

First, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom. The room measures 18 feet by 12 feet, so the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal of the old carpet, and installation of the new carpet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so for 216 square feet, it will be $12 * 216 = $2592.
The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so for 216 square feet, it will be $2 * 216 = $432.
The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so for 216 square feet, it will be $4 * 216 = $864.
The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so for 216 square feet, it will be $34 * 216 = $7344.

Now, let's add up all these costs to find the total cost: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's get down to business and calculate the average number of birds Mack saw per day.

First, we need to find the total number of birds Mack saw over the week. On days one and two, he saw 50 birds. On day three, he didn't see any. On days four and five, he spotted 120 birds. Then, on day six, he saw 20 birds, and on day seven, he saw 90 birds.

Now, let's add up the total number of birds: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds.

Since Mack observed the birds over 7 days, we'll divide the total number of birds by 7 to find the average: 280 / 7 = 40.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We're given a starting value of 20. The first operation is to add half of this value to itself. Half of 20 is 10, so we add 10 to 20, resulting in 30. 

Next, we divide 30 by 5, which gives us 6. 

Then, we subtract 12 from the starting value of 20, which gives us 8. 

Finally, we multiply 6 by 8, which gives us the final value of the number train.

Final answer: 48"
"Let's break this down. The boy has 5 cards, and his brother has 3 fewer cards than he does. To find out how many cards the brother has, we subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has: 5 - 3 = 2.

"To determine the correct oven temperature, we need to find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. We can do this by calculating the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then dividing by the set temperature.

Set temperature: 450
Actual temperature: 468
Difference: 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage off: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the temperature that Maggie should set her oven to if her recipe calls for 520 degrees, given that it's off by 4%. Let's call this temperature x. The actual temperature will be x + (4% of x), which should equal 520.

x + 0.04x = 520

Combine like terms:
1.04x = 520

Divide both sides by 1.04:
x = 500

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

"Hey there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem. We've got two movies with different lengths, and we need to find the total time it'll take to watch them.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. I'll convert the hour to minutes: 1 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 60 minutes. Then, I'll add the 30 minutes: 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes. Adding the 5 minutes: 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, let's add the time for both movies: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value is $76,000. To find 30% of this value, we multiply it by 0.3. 
$76,000 * 0.3 = $22,800

Now, we subtract this value from Herb's house value to find Juan's house value.
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

The combined value of the two houses is the sum of their individual values.
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of utensils:

Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36
Her friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84
Total utensils: 36 + 84 = 120

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of one box of contacts after the 10% discount. The original price is $100.00, and the discount is 10% of that, which is $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00. So, the discounted price of one box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is $90.00 * 2 = $180.00.

Now, let's find the total number of contacts in 2 boxes. One box contains 90 contacts, so 2 boxes contain 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of contacts and then multiply by 2 (since a pair consists of 2 contacts). However, we can simplify this by dividing the total cost by the total number of pairs, which is 180 contacts / 2 = 90 pairs.

The cost of each pair of contacts is $180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00.

Since they are paid $10 an hour, Jill earned 3 * $10 = $30 and John earned 7 * $10 = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down Hannah's water needs. 

First, we need to calculate the total calories she burns. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics at 500 calories/hour, so that's 2 * 500 = 1000 calories. Then, she spends 1 hour running at 600 calories/hour, which is 1 * 600 = 600 calories. 

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Now, we know Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many 200-calorie increments she burned, we divide the total calories by 200. 1600 / 200 = 8.

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 = 800 ml of water.

"Let's tackle this problem step by step. We're given that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. To make things easier, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B.

This means the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B (1% fewer than blue) and the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B (1% more than blue). We're also told that the total number of jelly beans is 4500.

We can set up an equation to represent this:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The question asks for the difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans:

In the first scenario, Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

In the second scenario, Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

To find the difference in weight between the two options, we subtract the weight lost from the weight gained: 8.75 - (-6.25) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein. To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to calculate the protein content per gram of mushrooms and then multiply it by the amount he eats per day and the number of days in a week.

First, we calculate the protein content per gram of mushrooms: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms. Then, we multiply this by the amount John eats per day: 0.03 grams/gram * 200 grams = 6 grams of protein per day. Finally, we multiply this by the number of days in a week: 6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. If we denote Jerry's current age as 'x', we can set up an equation based on this information.

Five years ago, Jerry's age was 'x - 5'. Since he's twice as old now, we can write the equation as:
x = 2(x - 5)

Now, let's solve for 'x'. First, we expand the equation:
x = 2x - 10

Next, we subtract 'x' from both sides to isolate the variable:
0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:
10 = x

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find his age in 3 years, we simply add 3 to his current age:
10 + 3 = 13

"Let's break down George's dental work costs. He needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000, so that's 2 * $2000 = $4000. He also wants a porcelain crown for one of the implants, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours he needs to work to cover this amount, we'll divide the remaining cost by his hourly wage of $15. That's $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"Let's tackle this problem. We're given that the three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. One angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle. To find the measure of the largest angle, we'll start by denoting the smallest angle as x.

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x. Now, we can write an equation based on the fact that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many times the tires rotate per mile. Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can divide 725 by 2 to get the rotations per mile.

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we know Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. To find the total number of rotations per month, we multiply the rotations per mile by the miles driven per month.

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the rotations per month by 12 to get the rotations per year.

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we divide the total number of rotations by the rotations per year.

"I'd be happy to help you out. Let's break down Scarlett's expenses.

First, she found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale. Then, she headed to the pet store and bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each, which comes out to 2 * $2.50 = $5.00. She also picked up 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 apiece, so that's 3 * $2.00 = $6.00. Next, she bought 20 fish at $0.50 each, which is 20 * $0.50 = $10.00. Finally, she grabbed some fish food for $2.00.

Now, let's add up all her expenses: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00.

"Let's break down the growth of Jane's beanstalk. 

In the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall. Then, it doubled in height during the second week, so we multiply 3 by 2 to get 6 inches. In the third week, it grew an additional 4 inches. To find the total height, we add 6 inches (the height at the end of the second week) to 4 inches (the growth in the third week), which gives us 10 inches.

The final answer is: 10"
"I'd be happy to help you out. So, Prince is a butcher and he's got a pretty steady sales rate going on. He sells 15kg of meat every hour, and he works 10 hours a day. That's a total of 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat per day.

Now, his friend Bill gives him a bull that weighs 750kg. To figure out how many days it'll take Prince to sell the meat from that bull, we just need to divide the weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day.

750kg / 150kg per day = 5 days

"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to calculate the total number of seats and then subtract the seats occupied by administrators and parents.

First, let's find the total number of seats. The auditorium has 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row. So, the total number of seats is 4 * 18 = 72.

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, which is 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats.

The remaining seats are 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, which is 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats.

Now, let's find the number of seats occupied by the students. This is 54 - 18 = 36 seats.

Number of students: 36"
"Hello there, let's get down to business. We've got a road with 4 intersections, and each intersection has 6 poles. Now, each pole has 4 street lights, so we need to calculate the total number of street lights.

First, we find the total number of street lights at each intersection: 4 street lights per pole * 6 poles per intersection = 24 street lights per intersection.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

However, we're told that 20 of these street lights aren't working. So, we subtract those from the total: 96 - 20 = 76.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's get down to business and solve this problem.

We have two DVDs, each with a lifespan of 1000 plays. One DVD has been played 356 times, and the other has been played 135 times. To find out how many more times they can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining plays for each DVD.

For the first DVD, we subtract the number of times it's been played from its total lifespan: 1000 - 356 = 644 plays left.
For the second DVD, we do the same: 1000 - 135 = 865 plays left.

Now, we add the remaining plays for both DVDs: 644 + 865 = 1509.

"Let's break down Jim's gum-chewing habits for the day. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school, and the school day lasts 8 hours. That's 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

On top of that, he chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, adding up to 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum for the day.

Jim started with a 20-pack of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he's left with 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.

Before bed, he decides to share the love and gives half of his remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister and keeps the other 7 for himself.

The number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is 7."
"Let's figure out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now. 

First, we need to determine her current age. We know she'll be 16 in 12 years, so we subtract 12 from 16.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb per second. To convert this to Mb per hour, we need to perform a couple of conversions.

First, we know that 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb. So, we can convert 20 kb to Mb by dividing by 1000. This gives us 20 kb / 1000 = 0.02 Mb per second.

Next, we need to convert seconds to hours. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

Now, we can multiply the speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour to get the speed in Mb per hour. This gives us 0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds = 72 Mb per hour.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step. We know the tow truck pulled ten cars for each of the first three days. To find the total number of cars towed in those three days, we multiply the number of cars per day by the number of days:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

Now, for the remaining four days of the week, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars per day. So, we subtract 4 from the original 10 cars per day:
10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

To find the total number of cars towed that week, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

Now, let's subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 
48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to divide the remaining inches by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to be tall enough:
8 / 2 = 4 years.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, and the company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars. To find the cost price of each car, we'll calculate 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500.

Now, let's find the profit on each car by subtracting the cost price from the selling price: $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

As James gets a 10% commission on the profits, we'll calculate his commission by finding 10% of $175,000, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that 25% of the riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet, and 60% of those riders are women. We need to find the number of men who can stay upright.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25:
100 * 0.25 = 25

Now, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6:
25 * 0.6 = 15

Now, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to get the number of men:
25 - 15 = 10

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's get down to business and calculate the total price of those jewels.

First, we know the price of the diamond jewel is $2000. The price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel. To find the price of the gold jewel, I'll multiply the price of the diamond jewel by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000 = $1600

Now, the price of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. So, I'll subtract $400 from the price of the gold jewel.

Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Finally, I'll add up the prices of all three jewels to find the total price.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom and is driving at 55 miles per hour. Tom, on the other hand, is driving at 70 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to cover the 75-mile gap between them.

First, we need to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed. This gives us a relative speed of 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed. Plugging in the values, we get Time = 75 miles / 15 mph. Solving this, we find that it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

First, let's calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can attend without going over the $10 per class limit. We can do this by dividing the total cost by the maximum cost per class:
$60 ÷ $10 = 6 classes

This means Manny can attend up to 6 classes without exceeding the limit. Since there are 10 classes in total, he can miss:
10 (total classes) - 6 (maximum classes he can attend) = 4 classes

Now, we can calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges. The cost of 5 apples is 5 × $1.30 = $6.50, and the cost of 5 oranges is 5 × $1.10 = $5.50.

Finally, we add the cost of the apples and oranges together to get the total cost: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now that we know the volume of the hole, we can multiply it by the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot of earth, which is 3 seconds.

"I'm happy to help you with that. Let's break down the costs of Bill's new truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is an extra $7,500. The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs: 
$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $43,500.

First, we need to calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise. To do this, we'll find 5% of his current salary and add it to his current salary.

5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

The bonus is worth half a month's salary, so:
Bonus = $21,000 / 2 = $10,500

Now, let's calculate Tim's total income for the year. We'll multiply his new monthly salary by 12 and add the bonus.
$21,000 * 12 = $252,000

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. To find the sales from green hats, we can set up a simple equation:

Sales from green hats = 2 * Sales from red hats
Sales from green hats = 2 * 400
Sales from green hats = 800

Now, we can find the total sales for the first month by adding the sales from red and green hats:

Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales for the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales for the first month = 1200

In the second month, Ariadne's sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. We can calculate this as follows:

Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * Total sales for the first month
Total sales for the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales for the second month = 900

Finally, we can find the total amount Ariadne made in two months by adding the sales from both months:

Total amount she made in two months = Total sales for the first month + Total sales for the second month
Total amount she made in two months = 1200 + 900
Total amount she made in two months = 2100

To find the total cost for the first year, we need to calculate the total monthly expenses and multiply that by 12. The total monthly expenses are $5,000 (hangar) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000. Multiply this by 12 to get the total expenses for the year: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Now, add the initial cost of the plane to the total expenses for the year: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Now, let's find the combined cooking time for pork and rice, which is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. The problem states that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

To find the total cooking time, we simply add the cooking time for each item: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have two mixtures of nuts, and we need to find the cost difference between them.

The first mixture consists of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. To calculate the cost, we multiply the weight of each type of nut by its price per pound. Almonds cost $10 per pound, so 1/2 pound of almonds costs $5. Walnuts cost $15 per pound, so 1/3 pound of walnuts costs $5. The total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

The second mixture consists of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. Using the same calculation, 1/5 pound of almonds costs $2, and 1/3 pound of walnuts costs $5. The total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two mixtures. To do this, we subtract the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture: $10 - $7 = $3.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Lee has sheep and geese on his farm. Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20.

Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. We can set up two equations based on the given information. The total number of legs is 4S + 2G = 70, and the total number of heads is S + G = 20.

To solve for S, we can multiply the second equation by 2, which gives us 2S + 2G = 40. Now, we can subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate G. This gives us 2S = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that S = 15.

"I'd be happy to help you out with that. So, Roger's favorite coffee brand is sold out, and he has to opt for a more expensive one that costs 20% more. The original price of his favorite brand is $5 per pound. To find the price of the more expensive brand, I'll calculate 20% of $5, which is 0.2 * $5 = $1. Adding this to the original price, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 days, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Additionally, Roger buys a donut for $2. To find the total cost, I'll add the cost of the coffee and the donut: $42 + $2 = $44.

"Let's break down the problem. We know James delivers a total of 600 newspapers in a day. We also know he delivers 198 to District A and 209 to District C. To find out how many he delivers to District B, we need to subtract the sum of the newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total.

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

"Let's break down the problem step by step. John's cooking class meets 4 times a week, and each class is 2 hours long. To find the total number of hours he spends in class per week, we multiply the number of times the class meets per week by the number of hours per class.

Number of hours per week: 4 times/week * 2 hours/time = 8 hours/week

Since the class runs for 6 weeks, we multiply the number of hours per week by the number of weeks to find the total hours.

Total hours: 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours

Now, we know John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find the number of recipes he learns, we divide the total hours by 1.5.

Number of recipes: 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so we can calculate Kassidy's amount by multiplying Aurelia's amount by 3/4.

Kassidy's amount = 3/4 * $120 = $90

Now, we know Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount by adding $60 to Kassidy's amount.

Rayna's amount = $90 + $60 = $150

Now that we have the amounts for each person, let's add them together to find the total amount of money they have.

Total amount = $120 + $90 + $150 = $360

To find out how much each person would have if they decided to add their money together and share equally, we divide the total amount by 3.

Amount each person would have = $360 / 3 = $120

"Let's break down the information provided. Christina had 12 good days and 8 bad days in the first 30 days, with the rest being neutral. Since there are 30 days in total, the number of neutral days is 30 - 12 - 8 = 10.

We also know that her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. This pattern accounts for the first 24 days. The remaining 6 days are part of the 30 days, and we know that 4 of those days were good (since 12 - 8 = 4), and 2 were neutral (since 10 - 8 = 2).

Now, if the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good, we need to find the number of good days left in the month. Since we already know that 2 good days were left in the first 30 days (12 - 8 - 2 = 2), and 2 more good days were added, the total good days left in the month are 2.

Let's say Sally has 'x' books. Then, Janey has 2x + 3 books. Since Janey has 21 books, we can write the equation as 2x + 3 = 21.

Now, let's solve for 'x'. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 18.

Next, divide both sides by 2: x = 9.

So, Sally has 9 books.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's tackle this problem step by step. We're given that Mrs. Jameson's bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, and its current height is 20 feet. First, we need to convert the current height from feet to inches.

Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can calculate the current height in inches as follows:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we want to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches. To do this, we need to find the difference between the target height and the current height.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Given the bamboo's growth rate of 30 inches per day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to determine the number of days it will take to reach the target height.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

However, 3 dogs have left the shelter, so we subtract 3 from the total: 24 - 3 = 21.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs a total of 21 toys.

First, Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200 = $480.

Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount: $1200 - $480 = $720.

Next, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = $480.

Finally, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find Skyler's investment: $720 - $480 = $240.

Skyler's investment is $240."

Total weight = 720 kg

The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg. To find the excess weight, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Katarina has 68 cookies. Since she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can calculate Max's cookies by adding 5 to Katarina's total. So, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Now, we're told Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. To find the Cookie Monster's total, we subtract 12 from Max's total. The Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Lastly, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. We add 23 to Max's total to find Summer's cookies. Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Let's denote the original length as 'x'. The length after extension is 1.5x, and the final length is 1.5x + 20. Since the final length is 140cm, we can write the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, we need to find the age of one of the twins.

Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation:

T = t + 7

We know that there are two twins and three triplets, so the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages are 44, so we can write another equation:

2T + 3t = 44

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation:

2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

2t + 14 + 3t = 44

Combine like terms:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

t = 6

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin:

T = t + 7
T = 6 + 7
T = 13

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of 4 candies by 4: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. 
10 lollipops cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for x:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

Oranges are the most expensive, costing three times as much as a banana. So, the price of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5

"Let's break down Greta's expenses. She starts with a paycheck of $2400.00. First, she puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account. That's 0.5 * $2400.00 = $1200.00. Then, she uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment, which is 0.2 * $2400.00 = $480.00.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she's spent so far: $1200.00 (retirement) + $480.00 (car payment) = $1680.00. To find out how much she has left, we subtract this amount from her paycheck: $2400.00 - $1680.00 = $720.00.

"Hello there, let's solve this problem together. We have a box that can hold 20 pencils, but 4 of them are missing. To find out how many pencils are left, we subtract the missing ones from the total capacity.

Pencils in the box = Total capacity - Missing pencils
Pencils in the box = 20 - 4
Pencils in the box = 16

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of pencils. Since a pair consists of 2 pencils, we'll divide the total number of pencils by 2.

Pairs of pencils = Pencils in the box / 2
Pairs of pencils = 16 / 2
Pairs of pencils = 8

"Hey there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many fireworks the city is setting off. They have 15 boxes, each containing 20 fireworks. So, the total number of city fireworks is 15 * 20 = 300.

Since Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4, which gives us 120. So, Hannah will see 120 city fireworks.

In addition to the city fireworks, Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. This means she'll set off a total of 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

Now, let's add the number of city fireworks Hannah can see to the number of fireworks she'll set off in her backyard. 120 (city fireworks) + 15 (her own fireworks) = 135.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of people. Aiden and 12 of his friends are going to see a film, and they meet up with 7 more friends there. So the total number of people is 1 (Aiden) + 12 (his friends) + 7 (more friends) = 20.

Now, we know that each person has 2 drinks and 3 snacks. To find the total number of drinks, we multiply the number of people by 2: 20 * 2 = 40. Similarly, to find the total number of snacks, we multiply the number of people by 3: 20 * 3 = 60.

The total number of items (drinks and snacks) is 40 (drinks) + 60 (snacks) = 100.

Since each item costs $2, we can find the total amount spent by multiplying the total number of items by the cost per item: 100 * 2 = 200.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know the combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. To find Gary's truck capacity, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total. 

The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. Subtracting this from the total capacity gives us 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"Let's break down the problem. We know there are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. We're also told that each female ate 3 dumplings.

First, let's calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females. Since there are 6 females and each ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Now, let's calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we add the total number of dumplings eaten by males and females. So, the total number of dumplings is 18 + 32 = 50.

"Let's break this down step by step. We know Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, and the cat can run 15 feet/second. To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5.

Speed of turtle = Speed of cat / 5
Speed of turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of turtle = 3 feet/second

Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can find the distance it can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

"Hey there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem. The firefighters have a goal to raise $6300 and they've already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. To find out how much they raise per hour, we can divide the amount raised by the number of hours.

$2100 ÷ 3 hours = $700 per hour

Now, we need to find out how many hours it'll take them to reach their goal of $6300. We can do this by dividing the total amount they need to raise by the amount they raise per hour.

$6300 ÷ $700 per hour = 9 hours

First, let's calculate the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes. This is simply 80% of 40%, which is 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city. That's 40% - 32% = 8%.

First, let's calculate the production rate for each flavor. For chocolate ice cream, they make 100 quarts in 2 hours, which translates to 50 quarts per hour. For vanilla ice cream, they make 50 quarts in 4 hours, which is 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add these rates together to get the total production rate: 50 quarts/hour (chocolate) + 12.5 quarts/hour (vanilla) = 62.5 quarts/hour.

To find the total quarts made in 48 hours, we multiply the total production rate by the number of hours: 62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts.

First, we need to find the total cost of the items he purchased. 

Marcus ordered 5 croissants at $3.00 each, so that's 5 * $3.00 = $15.00. He also ordered 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, which is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00. Additionally, he bought 3 mini quiches for $4.00 apiece, totaling 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. Lastly, he purchased 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each, which comes out to 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of these items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10: $50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get Marcus' total bill: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

2 minutes * 200 taps/minute * 2 feet = 800 taps

When her arms are at her sides, she taps 300 times per minute with her right foot and 250 times per minute with her left foot. Since she does this for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps with arms at her sides is:
3 minutes * (300 taps/minute + 250 taps/minute) = 3 minutes * 550 taps/minute = 1650 taps

"Let's tackle this problem step by step. We're given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. To make the calculation easier, I'll convert this to just inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x. This gives us the equation:
9x + 10 = 100

To solve for x, I'll subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we need to find one-fourth of 256. To do this, we multiply 256 by 1/4 or divide by 4. So, 256 / 4 = 64 windows smashed for students' cars.

Now, let's move on to the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows for teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64. 

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows. To find 3/4ths of 64, we multiply 64 by 3/4. This is the same as multiplying 64 by 3 and then dividing by 4. So, 64 * 3 = 192, and 192 / 4 = 48 windows smashed for teachers' cars.

Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Finally, we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice by subtracting Alice's total from Clara's total.

Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

"I'd be happy to help you out. So, Cecelia's at the milk store, and she's looking to buy some jars. We know a gallon jar costs $5, and it's $2 more than a half-gallon jar. 

Let's figure out the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since it's $2 less than a gallon jar, we subtract $2 from $5. That gives us $3 for a half-gallon jar.

Now, Cecelia wants to buy 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. We can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of jars by their respective costs. 
For the gallon jars: 10 jars * $5 = $50
For the half-gallon jars: 16 jars * $3 = $48

Adding these two amounts together, we get the total amount Cecelia spent: $50 + $48 = $98

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a class of 50 students with various hobbies. 10 students like to bake, and 5 like to play basketball. The rest of the students either like to play video games or play music.

First, we'll find the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball. That's 10 + 5 = 15 students.

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games or play music. So, 50 - 15 = 35 students.

We're also told that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

Finally, we subtract the number of students who like to play music from the total number of students who like to play video games or play music. That's 35 - 10 = 25 students.

So, the number of birds left after Jeremy scared some away is 12 - 4 = 8. Later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. To find the total number of birds now, we simply add the new birds to the remaining ones: 8 + 20 = 28.

Now, we're told that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4.

40 * 0.4 = 16 girls per class

Since the remaining students are boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24 boys per class

8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals

Since Melissa wants to split the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, we'll divide the total number of animals by 7:

28 animals / 7 days = 4 animals per day

"Let's break down Mark's magic card venture. He buys 3 packs for $1800 each, so his total cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Now, let's calculate his total revenue. He gets 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, which adds up to $5000. He also gets 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so that's 30 * $50 = $1500. Adding these up, his total revenue is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

Jake's family has 2 adults and 2 children, and they want to know how much they can save by choosing the second park over the first.

First, let's calculate the total cost for each park. For the first park:
- 2 adults: 2 * $26 = $52
- 2 children: 2 * $12 = $24
Total cost for the first park: $52 + $24 = $76

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the second park:
- 2 adults: 2 * $14 = $28
- 2 children: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second park: $28 + $20 = $48

To find the cost difference, we subtract the cost of the second park from the cost of the first park:
Cost difference = $76 - $48

"Let's break down the problem. The tomato vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, and he's switching to a new vendor who offers a better price. To find out how much he saves, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day and then multiply it by 7.

First, let's calculate the original daily cost. The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $.5 each, so the original daily cost is 500 * $.5 = $250.

Next, let's calculate the new daily cost. The new vendor sells tomatoes for $.4 each, so the new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

Now, let's find the daily savings. The daily savings is $250 - $200 = $50.

Finally, let's calculate the weekly savings. Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly savings is $50 * 7 = $350.

Now, if the activity requires 12 groups, we can calculate the total number of students needed for 12 groups: 12 * 9 = 108. However, we only have 54 students. To find out how many groups we can form with 54 students, we divide 54 by 9: 54 / 9 = 6.

Since we can only form 6 groups with the given number of students, but the activity requires 12 groups, we need to find the difference: 12 - 6 = 6.

To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

In a week, there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. So, the total number of chairs rented in a week is:
- 60 chairs/day * 5 weekdays = 300 chairs
- 100 chairs/day * 2 weekend days = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week = 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Since there are 8 weeks in two 4-week months, the total number of chairs rented is:
- 500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

"I'd be happy to help you with that. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the initial number of glasses and plates. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 items, we can multiply the number of dozens by 12.

Initial number of glasses: 8 dozen * 12 = 96 glasses
Initial number of plates: 4 dozen * 12 = 48 plates

Now, let's add the initial number of glasses and plates to get the total initial items.
96 glasses + 48 plates = 144 items

Next, we need to subtract the number of broken items. We know that 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken.
Total broken items: 10 glasses + 6 plates = 16 items

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. To find 90% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.9, which equals 27. Since 3 small stickers are worth 1 large button, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Now, she has 3 small stickers left and 9 large buttons. She also has 40 large stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

Now, she has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons (9 + 20), and 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, she has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons, and 60 small buttons.

Since 1 large button is worth 3 small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons. 29 large buttons equal 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons. Adding these to the 60 small buttons she already has, she now has 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

She also has 3 small stickers left, which can be converted to small buttons. So, she has 147 + 3 = 150 small buttons.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. If we denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x, then the number of votes in favor is 2x.

Since there are 33 people on the council, the total number of votes is 33. We can set up an equation to represent this: x + 2x = 33. Combining like terms, we get 3x = 33.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 33 / 3 = 11. This means there were 11 votes against the new regulation.

Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, we multiply 11 by 2 to get the number of votes in favor: 11 * 2 = 22.

"I'd be happy to help Krissa figure out how many shirts she needs to order for her preschool students. Let's break it down by size.

First, we know 11 students need extra-small shirts. Since twice as many students need small shirts as extra-small, that's 2 * 11 = 22 students who need small shirts.

Next, we're told four less than the number of small students need medium shirts. So, that's 22 - 4 = 18 students who need medium shirts.

Now, half as many students need large shirts as medium, which means 18 / 2 = 9 students need large shirts.

Finally, six more students need extra-large shirts than large, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 students who need extra-large shirts.

To find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we add up the number of students for each size: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so if Emma jumps on 'x' enemies, Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies. For each enemy, they receive 10 points. Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so if Emma collects 'y' berries, Ava collects 'y + 3' berries. For each berry, they receive 5 points. However, Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so if Emma finishes with 'z' seconds left, Ava finishes with 'z - 4' seconds left. For each second left, they receive 30 points.

Now, let's calculate their scores. Emma's score is 10x + 5y + 30z. Ava's score is 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(z - 4). Simplifying Ava's score, we get 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30z - 120, which is 10x + 5y + 30z - 25.

The difference between their scores is Ava's score minus Emma's score, which is (10x + 5y + 30z - 25) - (10x + 5y + 30z). This simplifies to -25.

The final answer is: -25"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars. We also know that two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars in total. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas.

So, the cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 30 = 34 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 34 / 2 = 17 dollars.

"Let's break down the problem. Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which is a total of 5 * 3 = 15 rides. On the other two days, they ride twice the usual times, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 rides per day. For those two days, they have 2 * 6 = 12 rides.

To find the total number of rides in a week, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days: 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. He then bought 17 more fish, and after adding them to his pond, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, the total number of white fish is x + 4 (since he already had 4 white fish). The total number of orange fish is 3 + (17 - x), since he bought 17 fish in total.

We know that the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish, so we can set up the equation:

3 + (17 - x) = 2(x + 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 - x = 2x + 8

Combine like terms:

20 - 8 = 3x

12 = 3x

Divide by 3:

x = 4

However, this doesn't seem to work, as 3 + (17 - 4) is not twice 4 + 4. Let's try another approach.

Let's say the number of white fish Bob bought is x. Then, the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - x. The total number of white fish is x + 4, and the total number of orange fish is 3 + (17 - x).

Since the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + (17 - x) = 2(x + 4)

However, we can also try to find the correct value of x by testing different options.

If Bob bought 6 white fish, he would have 6 + 4 = 10 white fish in total. He would have 3 + (17 - 6) = 3 + 11 = 14 orange fish in total. Since 14 is not twice 10, this option doesn't work.

If Bob bought 5 white fish, he would have 5 + 4 = 9 white fish in total. He would have 3 + (17 - 5) = 3 + 12 = 15 orange fish in total. Since 15 is not twice 9, this option doesn't work.

If Bob bought 4 white fish, he would have 4 + 4 = 8 white fish in total. He would have 3 + (17 - 4) = 3 + 13 = 16 orange fish in total. Since 16 is twice 8, this option works.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total distance Andy drives in a week. Since he drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 2 x 5 = 10 miles per day.

Now, let's calculate the total distance he drives in a week: 10 miles/day x 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we need to find out how much gas his car consumes in a week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money his car is consuming per week. The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money his car is consuming per week is 5 gallons/week x $3/gallon = $15/week.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Carrie received 10 twenties and 140 quarters from her aunt. We need to find out how much she spent for lunch, given that she used all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties.

First, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount spent from the quarters is:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, we'll calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, and she spent 3/5 of the twenties, we can find the total amount spent from the twenties as follows:
3/5 * 10 * $20 = 3/5 * $200 = $120

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount spent:
$35 + $120 = $155

Now, let's add the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold: 10 + 5 = 15. This means that 15 out of the 40 TVs sold were either smart TVs or analog TVs.

To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. To prevent this, we need to raise the temperature by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we have 90 people who are divided into groups of 9. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Now, we know that 3/5 of the groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. To find the number of groups that brought seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

Number of groups that brought seashells = Total number of groups * 3/5
= 10 * 3/5
= 6

Since each group has 9 members, the total number of people who brought seashells is:

Number of people who brought seashells = Number of groups that brought seashells * Number of people per group
= 6 * 9
= 54

Each of these people brought 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells is:

Total number of seashells = Number of people who brought seashells * Number of seashells per person
= 54 * 2
= 108

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of employees after three months. The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after three months, the total number of employees will be:

200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3)
= 200 + 60

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month. Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, so the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month is:

260 (total employees) * 4000 (monthly salary per employee)
= 1,040,000

Since we want to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to multiply the monthly salary by 3:

Now, since each student plants 1 tree and each teacher plants 2 trees, we can calculate the total number of trees planted.

Total number of trees planted by students: 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees
Total number of trees planted by teachers: 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, Bubbles wants to buy some stuffed goats, and she wants them to make up 30% of her total collection. Let's call the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy ""x"". After buying x stuffed goats, her total collection will be 14 + x.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: the number of stuffed goats (x) divided by the total number of stuffed animals (14 + x) should equal 0.3 (which is the same as 30%).

x / (14 + x) = 0.3

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Then, she switches to playing 2 hours every day for a week. That's 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Adding those together, Kris has played a total of 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Now, to find the distance between the two cars, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car:

To find the pass rate of the fifth graders, we first need to find the pass rate of the fourth graders. The pass rate of the fourth graders is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. Since the pass rate of the fifth graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth graders, it is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%.

Now, we can find the number of fifth graders who passed. This is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

The total number of students who passed is 340 + 40 + 320 = 700. The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Now, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2, which gives us 8 cars sold.

Next, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that the charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 coming from organizations. To find out how much the students raised, we subtract the amount from organizations from the total amount.

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

This means the students collectively raised $125,000. Since there are 20 students and each earns the same amount, we can divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

"I'd be happy to help you with that. To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down John's weekly earnings.

First, we need to calculate how much John earns per cycle. Since each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20, we multiply the number of tasks by the pay per task:
5 tasks * $1.20 per task = $6 per cycle

Now, we know John does 30 cycles a day, so we multiply the earnings per cycle by the number of cycles:
$6 per cycle * 30 cycles = $180 per day

To find John's weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:
$180 per day * 7 days = $1260

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game, Julie's score in the first game was 14 - 4 = 10 points.

Now, let's move on to the second game. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. So, Sasha's score in the second game was 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

She also bought 6 packages of dog food, with each package containing 6 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is 6 * 6 = 36.

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x.

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We also know that the total number of cards is 341. So, we can set up the equation:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

And the number of cards Becca has:
Becca has 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards

Becca has 153 cards."
"Let's break down the information we have about Cindy's Easter eggs. 

She had 5 green eggs. The number of blue eggs is twice the number of green eggs, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs. The number of pink eggs is one fewer than the number of blue eggs, which is 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. Lastly, the number of yellow eggs is one-third the number of pink eggs, so that's 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color to find the total number of eggs: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"I'd be happy to help you out with that problem. So, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost per pound is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. They also charge $0.08 per mile, and the distribution center is 20 miles away, so the cost per mile is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. Adding these two costs together, we get a total shipping cost of $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which was $32. So, the refund amount is 0.75 * $32 = $24.00.

Now, let's calculate the total loss. The total loss is the book cost minus the refund amount, plus the shipping cost. So, the total loss is $32 - $24.00 + $3.00 = $11.00.

"Let's break down Boris's chocolate production for the month. He produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. 

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars. The second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. The third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down Britany's TikTok activities and calculate the total time she spends on them in a month.

First, we have the time spent recording videos. Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, that's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply 72 by 4 to get 288 minutes per month.

Next, we have the time spent writing songs. Britany spends 2 hours per week writing songs, which is equivalent to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes per week. For a month, that's 120 * 4 = 480 minutes.

Lastly, we have the time spent on makeup. Britany spends 15 minutes per day, 6 days a week, which is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes per week. For a month, that's 90 * 4 = 360 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity: 288 + 480 + 360 = 1128 minutes.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that need to be installed. To find the total cost, we'll calculate the cost of the additional items first. 

She has 2 extra mirrors (6 - 4 = 2), 1 extra chandelier (2 - 1 = 1), and 10 extra pictures (20 - 10 = 10). The cost of these additional items is 2 * $15.00 + 1 * $15.00 + 10 * $15.00 = $15.00 * 13 = $195.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We know Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).

For the first segment, the distance is 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles. For the second segment, the distance is 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles. Now, let's add those together: 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. To find the time it would take one kangaroo, we multiply the total time by the number of kangaroos, which gives us 18 * 3 = 54 hours for one kangaroo.

Now, since the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, they would take twice as long to cross the highway. So, one turtle would take 54 * 2 = 108 hours.

The question asks about four turtles, but the key point is that they're traveling at the same speed. The number of turtles doesn't affect the time it takes for them to cross the highway, as long as they're all moving at the same speed. Therefore, it would still take them 108 hours to cross the highway.

First, we calculate the total number of slices from the large apples: 3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices.

Next, we calculate the total number of slices from the small apples: 5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices.

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices: 15 slices (large) + 15 slices (small) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the slices eaten from the total: 30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step. The farmer currently has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day. To find the total milk produced, we multiply the number of cows by the liters per cow: 3 * 5 = 15 liters.

The farmer's goal is to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To determine how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we can find out how many more cows are needed by dividing the additional liters needed by the liters per cow: 10 / 5 = 2.

To do this, we'll first find the length of each glue stick that is used. For the first glue stick, 1/6 is left, so 5/6 is used. We can calculate this as 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm.

For the second glue stick, 2/3 is left, so 1/3 is used. This is 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm.

For the third glue stick, 1/2 is left, so 1/2 is used. This is 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add up the lengths of the glue sticks that are used: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

Now, let's calculate the number of dishes Peter has. We know Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the individual totals:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built. This means they will build 2 * 48 = 96 new homes in the third year.

To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to add the homes built in the first two years (48) to the homes built in the third year (96). So, the total is 48 + 96 = 144.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We know that I am three years younger than my brother, and I am 2 years older than my sister. Let's denote my brother's age as B, my sister's age as S, and my age as Y.

Since I am three years younger than my brother, we can write an equation:
Y = B - 3

Since I am 2 years older than my sister, we can write another equation:
Y = S + 2

We also know that my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. Let's denote my mom's age as M:
M = 3B - 1

When you add all our ages, you get 87. So, we can write the equation:
B + Y + S + M = 87

Substituting the expressions for Y and M from the previous equations, we get:
B + (B - 3) + (Y - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Since Y = B - 3, we can substitute this expression for Y in the equation above:
B + (B - 3) + ((B - 3) - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
B + B - 3 + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87

Combine like terms again:
5B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:
5B = 96

Divide by 5:
B = 19.2

Since B must be a whole number, we round it to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we will try both 19 and 20 to see which one works.

If B = 20:
Y = B - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17
S = Y - 2 = 17 - 2 = 15
M = 3B - 1 = 3(20) - 1 = 59

B + Y + S + M = 20 + 17 + 15 + 35 = 87 (this works)

So, I am 17 years old.

Now, on the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we simply add this increase to the amount we had after the first increase: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

"The plague scenario. Let's break it down step by step. 

On the first day, we have 10 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, that's 10 * 6 = 60 new infections. Adding these to the initial 10, we get a total of 70 infected people.

Moving on to the second day, we now have 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. That's 70 * 6 = 420 new infections. Adding these to the previous total, we get 70 + 420 = 490 infected people.

Finally, on the third day, we have 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. That's 490 * 6 = 2940 new infections. Adding these to the previous total, we get 490 + 2940 = 3430 infected people.

"Let's break down the problem. Rafaela received tips from 40 customers, each giving her $20. To find the total amount of money Rafaela received, we multiply the number of customers by the tip amount. 

40 customers * $20 per customer = $800

Now, let's calculate the amount Julieta received. We know she received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. 
10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80
So Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720

The total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is $800 + $720 = $1520

"Let's break down the problem. Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges. She then gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, which is a total of 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. Additionally, she gave her only boy 3 oranges. 

So, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges. To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total oranges given to children from the total oranges bought: 12 - 9 = 3.

"Let's break down the problem. Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year, she earns 12 badges.

Since Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, she earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges.

Wendy, on the other hand, earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year. That would be 36 (Wendy's badges) - 6 (Amber's badges) = 30.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Paige bakes 2 banana bread loaves per hour, and she bakes for 5 hours, from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. So, the total number of loaves she bakes is 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Since each slice is sold for 50 cents, or $0.50, the total amount raised is 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"Let's break down the problem. We know Gretchen has 70 gold coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. To find the number of silver coins, we can subtract 30 from the number of gold coins.

Number of silver coins = Number of gold coins - 30
= 70 - 30
= 40

Now, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins.

Total number of coins = Number of gold coins + Number of silver coins
= 70 + 40

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's get down to business and calculate the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic.

First, we need to figure out how many burritos were eaten. There were 50 students, and each student got 10 burritos, so that's 50 * 10 = 500 burritos eaten by the students. Mr. George also had 20 burritos, so we add those to the total: 500 + 20 = 520 burritos eaten in total.

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos ordered. There were 600 burritos ordered, so we subtract 520 from that: 600 - 520 = 80.

"Let's break down the information we have about the bumper car rink. They have 12 red cars, and 2 fewer green cars than red cars, which means they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

Now, the rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. So, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

To find the total number of red, green, and blue cars, we add them up: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have a total of 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has F - 12 books. And since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (F - 12) + 25 books.

We can now set up an equation to represent the total number of books:

F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85

Combine like terms:

3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3F = 84

Divide by 3:

F = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"Hey there, let's get down to business. We need to figure out how much Greg will spend on jello for his son's birthday party. 

First, we need to determine the total number of jello cups required. With 30 kids attending and each kid getting 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is:
30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Since one three-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups, we can calculate the number of boxes needed:
120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total cost. Jello is on sale for $1.25 per box, so:
12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first calculate the total amount he spends per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

We can find Keenan's monthly share by multiplying the total monthly cost by 0.4 (which is equivalent to 40%). 

Total monthly cost = $400
Keenan's monthly share = 0.4 * $400
Keenan's monthly share = $160

Now, we can find Keenan's weekly share by dividing his monthly share by the number of weeks in the month, which is 4.

Keenan's weekly share = $160 / 4
Keenan's weekly share = $40

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tobias started with 60 pieces of pizza. On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the pieces. To find out how many pieces that is, we multiply 60 by 2/5.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

So, after the first day, he has 60 - 24 = 36 pieces left. On the second day, he ate 10 more pieces, leaving him with 36 - 10 = 26 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To find out how many pieces that is, we multiply 26 by 7/13.

7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces he ate: 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.

"I'd be happy to help you out. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water. We know that 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 divided by 7, which is $3.00.

Similarly, we know that 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 divided by 4, which is $2.00.

Now that we have the cost of one bottle of each, we can find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 times $3.00, which is $9.00. The cost of 2 bottles of water is 2 times $2.00, which is $4.00.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she scores in each type of question and then add them up.

First, let's consider the multiple-choice questions. Amy correctly answers 80% of these questions. Since there are 10 multiple-choice questions, she gets 80% of 10, which is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correct. Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, so she scores 8 points.

Next, we have the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of these questions. With 20 true/false questions, she gets 90% of 20, which is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correct. Each true/false question is also worth 1 point, so she scores 18 points.

Finally, let's look at the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of these questions. Since there are 5 long-answer questions, she gets 60% of 5, which is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correct. Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, let's add up the points: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

He plans to sell the chickens at $50 per chicken and make a profit of $2000. 
The total amount he will make from selling the chickens is the cost price plus the profit. 
Let's call the cost price x. 
Then, the selling price is x + $2000.

The selling price per chicken is $50, so the total selling price is 180 * $50 = $9000.

We know that the total selling price is the cost price plus the profit, so we can set up the equation:
x + $2000 = $9000

Subtracting $2000 from both sides gives us:
x = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

"Let's break down Kelly's grocery shopping expenses. 

First, we know the 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total. To find the cost of one pack of bacon, we divide $10 by 5, which gives us $2 per pack.

Next, we're told the 6 packets of chicken each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, one packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4. The total cost of 6 packets of chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

Moving on to the fruits, we have 3 packs of strawberries priced at $4 each, so the total cost is $4 * 3 = $12.

Lastly, the 7 packs of apples are priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. The total cost of 7 packs of apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they'll eat 2 adult bowls. Their 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. We need to convert the adult bowls to child bowls to make the comparison easier. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total number of bowls eaten is 2*2 (for the adults) + 2 (for the children) = 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls. Since there are 2 children, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's get down to business and calculate the material Jo needs for her face masks.

First, we need to figure out how much material is required for the small masks. Since Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, we can calculate the material needed for 20 small masks as follows:
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 * 2 yards = 10 yards

Next, we'll determine the material needed for the large masks. Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. To make 8 large masks, she would need:
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 2.67 * 2.25 yards = 6 yards

Now, let's add the material needed for both the small and large masks:
10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

"Let's break down the problem. Deepa has seen each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies three times in the theatre, and she's spent a total of $216. To find the average price she paid per ticket, we need to calculate the total number of tickets she bought and then divide the total amount spent by that number.

Total number of movies = 9
Number of times each movie was seen = 3
Total number of tickets purchased = 9 * 3 = 27

Now, let's calculate the average price per ticket:
Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets purchased
= $216 / 27

"Let's break down Harold's daily activities to determine how much free time he has left. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, which means he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours. Additionally, he spends 1 hour walking his dog each day.

To find out his total hours spent on these activities, we add them up: 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walking the dog) = 19 hours.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we subtract the total hours spent on other activities from 24 to find his free time: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

"Let's tackle this problem step by step. 

We know Duncan's current age is 60. Eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old. We're also told that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. 

Let's represent Adam's current age as A. Four years ago, Adam was A - 4 years old. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can set up the equation:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

52 = 2A - 8

Adding 8 to both sides, we get:

60 = 2A

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

A = 30

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute intervals are there in 180 minutes. To do this, we divide the total time by 30 minutes:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. We know there were 20 red balloons, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, we subtract the bologna thrown at the red balloons from the total to find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons. That's 58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total bologna thrown at them by 3. That's 18 / 3 = 6.

"Let's break down the problem. Jon drives 100 miles a day for a 30-day month, so we need to calculate the total miles he drives in that time. 

Total miles driven in a month = miles driven per day * number of days in a month
Total miles driven in a month = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles driven in a month = 3000 miles

Now, we know Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find the number of tune-ups he needs, we'll divide the total miles driven by the miles required for a tune-up.

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven in a month / miles required for a tune-up
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000 miles
Number of tune-ups = 3

The cake costs $11, and 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, which is 12 / 2 * $0.5 = $3 for a dozen. They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, totaling 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total amount they spent: $11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since they combined their allowance, the total amount they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's dive into the problem at hand. Lana has 27 cups of tea, and she's dividing them into 3 rows. Each row will have an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups. The remaining cups are used to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

First, we need to find out how many cups are used for chamomile and mint tea. To do this, we subtract the number of cups used for cinnamon tea from the total number of cups. So, 27 - 15 = 12 cups are used for chamomile and mint tea.

Since Lana divides these 12 cups into 3 rows, each row will have 12 / 3 = 4 cups of tea. As each row has an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups, we can divide the number of cups in each row by 2 to find the number of mint tea cups. Therefore, each row has 4 / 2 = 2 cups of mint tea.

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Now, we need to find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. To do this, we'll divide the total number of berries (24) by the number of trips (2):

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

So, the sloth needs to pick up at least 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find the total amount of water emptied in 6 days, we multiply the rate by the number of days: 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

Now, we subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

Now, let's add up his expenses: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130. This means he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since he wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy tonight, he'll spend $8 + $2 = $10. This leaves him with $20 - $10 = $10.

As it's a Friday, the movie ticket costs $10, which is exactly what he has left. So, Colby can see 1 more movie.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's get down to business and calculate the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked.

First, we need to find out how many calories are in each mini pastry. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories, that's 600 / 3 = 200 calories per mini cinnamon roll. Andrew baked 200 of these, so the total calories from the cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

Next, we'll calculate the calories for the mini blueberry muffins. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini one has 1/3rd of that, which is 450 / 3 = 150 calories. Andrew baked 300 of these, so the total calories from the blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote Jean's age as J, Paul's age as P, and Peter's age as Pt. We can set up the following equations:

1. Pt + P + J = 100 (combined age is 100 years)
2. P = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than Jean)
3. Pt = P + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age)

Now, let's substitute P from equation 2 into equation 3:
Pt = (J + 10) + J
Pt = 2J + 10

Now, substitute Pt and P from the above equations into equation 1:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know J, we can find P:
P = J + 10
P = 20 + 10
P = 30

Now that we know P and J, we can find Pt:
Pt = P + J
Pt = 30 + 20
Pt = 50

The age of Peter is 50."

Each widget sells for $6. We need to find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000 if it runs 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a month. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours, it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so in 24 hours, it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money each machine can make in a month. The Widgeteer 3000 will make 43200 * 6 = $259200 in a month. The WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32400 * 6 = $194400 in a month.

First, we need to figure out how much hay each sheep needs. We know that each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Amount each sheep needs = 2 * 5 - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 10 - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 7 pounds

Now that we know how much each sheep needs, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep.

Total hay for goats = 15 goats * 5 pounds
Total hay for goats = 75 pounds

Total hay for sheep = 12 sheep * 7 pounds
Total hay for sheep = 84 pounds

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and sheep to get the overall amount of hay needed.

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159 pounds

First, we need to calculate the labor cost. The job took 2.25 hours, but since the labor charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up to the nearest hour. So, the labor cost is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

Next, we add the labor cost to the visit charge and the cost of parts. The total charge is $40 (visit) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. James gets 10 new CDs, each costing $15. So, the total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James gets them for 40% off, he pays 60% of the total cost. To find 60% of $150, we multiply $150 by 0.6, which gives us $90.

Now, James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40. To find out how much money he was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid: $90 - $40 = $50.

"I'd be happy to help Jen calculate her earnings. Let's break it down:

First, we have 6 yams that can be sold at $1.5 each. That's 6 * $1.5 = $9.

Next, we have 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each. That's 10 * $2 = $20.

Lastly, we have 4 carrots which cost $1.25 each. That's 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add up the total amount she'll earn: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

"Let's break down James' lake-crossing adventure. First, we need to find out how far he swims at his initial pace. Since he covers 60% of the 20-mile distance, that's 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. Given his speed of 2 miles per hour, it takes him 12 / 2 = 6 hours to cover this distance.

After that, James takes a break on an island, resting for half as long as his initial swim. So, his resting time is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance: 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, James swims this part at half his initial speed, which is 1 mile per hour. Therefore, it takes him 8 / 1 = 8 hours to cover the remaining distance.

To find the total time, we add up the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"I'd be happy to help you with that. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total sales for each newspaper. Cayley sold 6 copies of the New York Times at $5 per copy, so the total sales for the New York Times is 6 * $5 = $30. He also sold 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal at $15 per copy, so the total sales for the Wall Street Journal is 10 * $15 = $150.

Next, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper. Cayley earns a 10% commission on the New York Times, so his commission is $30 * 0.10 = $3. He earns an 8% commission on the Wall Street Journal, so his commission is $150 * 0.08 = $12.

Finally, we add the commissions together to find the total commission earned by Cayley: $3 + $12 = $15.

"Let's break down the problem. We know Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D.

We can set up two equations based on the given information: B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20, we can rewrite the total points equation as A + (A + 20) + D = 45. Also, since B = D + 10, we can rewrite D as B - 10. Substituting this into the equation, we get A + (A + 20) + (A + 20 - 10) = 45.

Simplifying the equation, we get 3A + 30 = 45. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 3A = 15. Dividing both sides by 3, we get A = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem. We're given that the book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Since each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side, we effectively have 2 pages per paper.

So, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch. Now, we need to find the total number of pages in the book, given that it's 1.5 inches thick.

To do this, we simply multiply the total number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book. 

Total number of pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches
Total number of pages = 300 pages

"Let's break down the problem. We need to find out how many reports Vince stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. 

First, we calculate the total minutes in the given time frame. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. 
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples reports in 15-minute intervals, we divide the total minutes by 15.
900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. 
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

"To find the total minutes Kim slept, we first need to determine her total sleep time. Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 8 hours is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so we subtract those 5 minutes: 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

She also sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. We subtract those 23 minutes from the total: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept 452 minutes on her bed that day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups, which is equivalent to 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons by multiplying the number of cups by 2/3. This gives us (2/3) * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of cups to the number of measuring spoons: 24 + 10 = 34.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's dive into the problem at hand. We have a hospital with a capacity of 1000 beds, and initially, 1/5 of those beds are occupied. To find the number of occupied beds, we'll multiply the total capacity by 1/5.

Number of occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds

Now, let's calculate the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the occupied beds from the total capacity.

Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, the hospital is admitting 50 patients each day. We need to find out how many patients are admitted in 2 weeks (14 days).

Number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Now, let's calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds and the new patients.

Total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Finally, we'll find the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks by subtracting the total occupied beds from the hospital's capacity.

Total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. To find the number of non-work emails, we subtract the work emails from the total.

Non-work emails = Total emails - Work emails
Non-work emails = 16 - 7
Non-work emails = 9

Now, we know that two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family. To find the number of emails to family, we multiply the non-work emails by 2/3.

Emails to family = 2/3 * 9
Emails to family = 6

The remaining emails are to others, including her boyfriend. To find the number of emails to others, we subtract the emails to family from the non-work emails.

Emails to others = Non-work emails - Emails to family
Emails to others = 9 - 6
Emails to others = 3

Finally, we know that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. To find the number of emails to her boyfriend, we multiply the emails to others by 1/3.

Emails to boyfriend = 1/3 * 3
Emails to boyfriend = 1

Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

Total number of balls: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

We're told that the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

To find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11.

Let's denote the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught as 'x'. Then, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is 4x - 13, and the number of Pokémon Alex has caught is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

We can set up an equation based on the total number of Pokémon caught:
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon Stan has caught:
Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 147

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each direction and then find the net distance.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled south in the first leg of the journey. The bird flew at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 10 hours, so the distance traveled is:

Distance = Speed * Time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

Next, the bird turned direction and flew towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The distance traveled north is:

Distance = Speed * Time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Finally, the bird changed direction again and flew towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled south in this leg is:

Distance = Speed * Time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled north in the second leg, we subtract this distance from the total distance traveled south:

Net distance = Distance traveled south in the first leg + Distance traveled south in the third leg - Distance traveled north in the second leg
Net distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

Now, let's add these up: 12 (Greta's brownies) + 6 (office brownies) + 48 (friends' brownies) = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 dozen is 12, 1 1/2 dozen is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies left, we subtract the brownies eaten from the total brownies: 66 - 18 = 48.

"I'd be happy to help Katherine with her hanging baskets. Let's break down the costs for her.

She has 5 hanging baskets to fill, and each basket will have 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines. The petunias cost $3.00 each, and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each.

For the petunias, she'll need 3 * 5 = 15 petunias in total. At $3.00 each, that's 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

For the sweet potato vines, she'll need 2 * 5 = 10 vines in total. At $2.50 each, that's 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

Adding the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines, we get $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Artemis and her father have a 30-pound bag of soil. They want to plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, and then use the remaining soil for roses.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, so 4 sunflowers will need:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, so 10 carnations will need:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

We subtract the soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month, and she sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. To find out how much she sets aside each month, we'll calculate 25% of $2,000.00.

25% of $2,000.00 is $2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00 per month.

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have saved:
$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of shoes she can buy in a year is:
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Emily's peeling speed is 6 shrimp per minute, and she needs to peel 90 shrimp. To find the time it takes her to peel the shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by her peeling speed: 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, we look at her sautéing speed. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp, we multiply the time it takes to sauté 30 shrimp by the ratio of 90 to 30: (90 / 30) * 10 = 30 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté the shrimp to get the total time: 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.

"Let's break down the situation step by step. The air conditioner cools the room at different rates depending on the setting. On low, it cools the room by 2 degrees per hour, and on high, it cools the room by 3 degrees per hour. Without the air conditioner, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour.

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, resulting in a temperature drop of 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees.

Next, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, resulting in a further temperature drop of 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect so far is 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up for 2 hours at a rate of 2 degrees per hour, resulting in a temperature increase of 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.

To find the net temperature change, we subtract the warming effect from the cooling effect: 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Now, we're told that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time, we multiply his dad's age by 3. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it for the second time. Therefore, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Buford writes a check for the electric bill once a month, which translates to 12 checks per year. He also writes a check for the gas bill every month, adding another 12 checks to the total. 

In addition to these, Buford writes two checks to the church every month. This means he writes 24 checks to the church in a year. 

Lastly, Buford writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which is four times a year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks: 
12 (electric bill) + 12 (gas bill) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know the second plane makes 44 trips, and that's half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

Now, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. To find the number of flights to Greece, we multiply 88 by 3/4, which gives us 66 flights. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

These 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we divide 22 by 2, which gives us 11 flights.

Now, let's add up the lengths of their howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total age of the four children is 20. We also know the ages of two of the children: Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.

First, let's find the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro:
Akbar's age + Alessandro's age = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can subtract their combined age from the total age to find the combined age of Helene and Wilfred:
Total age - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age) = 20 - 7 = 13

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. To find the average age, we divide the total age by the number of children:
Average age = Total age / Number of children
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can find her age by multiplying the average age by 2:
Helene's age = 2 * Average age
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting Helene's age from the combined age of Helene and Wilfred:
Wilfred's age = Combined age of Helene and Wilfred - Helene's age
Wilfred's age = 13 - 10
Wilfred's age = 3

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's dive into the problem at hand. We have a family of 6, consisting of 2 adults and 4 kids, who want to divide a watermelon in such a way that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. We need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets.

To approach this, let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices. We have 4 kids, each getting a slice of size x, and 2 adults, each getting a slice of size 2x. So, the total number of slices is 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Since each adult gets 2x, we can calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets by dividing 2x by the total number of slices (8x) and multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (2x / 8x) * 100
= (1/4) * 100
= 25%

First, we'll calculate the time spent on rounds. With 9 inpatients and 20 minutes per inpatient, that's 9 * 20 = 180 minutes. Then, we have 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes, so that's 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

Adding these together, we get 180 + 300 = 480 minutes spent on rounds and appointments. Converting this to hours, we divide by 60: 480 / 60 = 8 hours.

Now, let's subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now, let's convert the total time to hours and minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 180 by 60 to get 3 hours.

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we subtract the total time from the serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

The latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

Total boxes = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

Now, we can find the number of chocolate bars in a box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the total earnings per week would be $40 * 3 = $120.

To find the expected earnings in a month, we'll assume a 4-week month. Therefore, the total earnings per month would be $120 * 4 = $480.

To find out how many chocolate bars each of them has in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes. For Peter, that's 64 ÷ 4 = 16 chocolate bars per box. For Martha, that's 56 ÷ 7 = 8 chocolate bars per box.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we simply subtract the number of chocolate bars Martha has in each box from the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box. That's 16 - 8 = 8.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know the population of porcupines in the park is 50, and the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. 

To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5.

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Now, since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is:

Number of babies per month = 30 * 4 = 120

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

Number of babies per year = 120 * 12 = 1440

The total number of porcupines after a year is the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born in a year:

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's add up the total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days:

3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons (second day)
7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons (total)

3 peaches at $.5 each = 3 * .5 = $1.5
4 pears at $.5 each = 4 * .5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each = 2 * 1 = $2
5 apples at $.75 each = 5 * .75 = $3.75

We also know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. This means S = 2L.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is 12L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is 4S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation: 4S = 4(2L) = 8L.

The total earnings from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation: 12L + 8L = 120.

Combine like terms: 20L = 120.

Divide both sides by 20: L = 6.

Since S = 2L, S = 2 * 6 = 12.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a family consisting of a man, his wife, and their son. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

To find the total number of sandwiches they eat in a day, we simply add up the number of sandwiches each person eats. So, that's 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Since we want to know how many sandwiches they eat in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7 (the number of days in a week). Therefore, 11 sandwiches per day * 7 days per week = 77 sandwiches per week.

"Let's break down Suzanne's earnings and expenses. She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, which is a total of 80 * $1 = $80. She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, which is a total of 60 * $4 = $240. 

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320. However, she gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's get down to business and calculate the amount of ore those dwarves can mine.

First, we need to determine how much ore a single dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe. We know that with bare hands, a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

Now, a steel pickaxe allows him to mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. To find this amount, we calculate 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now that we know a single dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, we multiply this amount by the number of dwarves (40) and the number of days in a month (30):
36 pounds/day * 40 dwarves * 30 days = 43,200 pounds

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's get down to business and figure out the price of that package with 8 sandwiches.

We know the store offers three different package sizes, and the prices are proportional. The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second has 4 sandwiches for $6. To find the price per sandwich, I'll divide the cost by the number of sandwiches in each package.

For the first package, that's $3 ÷ 2 = $1.50 per sandwich. For the second package, it's $6 ÷ 4 = $1.50 per sandwich. Since the prices are proportional, we can assume the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.50.

Now, let's multiply the price per sandwich by 8 to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches: $1.50 × 8 = $12.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom set for $1000, which he uses to pay for part of the new set. To find out how much he still owes, we subtract the amount he received from the initial cost.

$3000 (initial cost) - $1000 (amount received) = $2000 (remaining amount owed)

Now, we need to calculate the monthly payment, which is 10% of the remaining amount owed.

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. To find 40% of 25, we multiply 25 by 0.4, which equals 10. So, she lost 10 red balloons, leaving her with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

The green balloons were unaffected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons. This left her with 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her collection. To find 75% of 8, we multiply 8 by 0.75, which equals 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she had: 
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"The age-old conundrum of homework avoidance. Let's break it down, shall we? We have three scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework:

1. The substitute teacher comes in, which has a 50% chance. No homework collection, no problem.
2. The normal teacher comes in, but gives everyone an extension. The probability of the normal teacher coming in is 50%, and the chance of an extension is 40%. So, the combined probability is 50% * 40% = 20%.
3. The normal teacher comes in, doesn't give an extension (60% chance), but Marcus convinces her that his dog ate his assignment (20% chance). The probability of this scenario is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus dodging his homework: 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%. This means there's a 76% chance he won't have to turn it in.

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we subtract 76% from 100%: 100% - 76% = 24%.

"To determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family. The Fine Arts Center has a capacity of 6000 people, with 950 seats reserved for graduates and 300 seats for faculty.

Total seats available for friends and family = Total capacity - (Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty)
Total seats available for friends and family = 6000 - (950 + 300)
Total seats available for friends and family = 6000 - 1250
Total seats available for friends and family = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we can divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Tickets per graduate = Total seats available for friends and family / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

She earns $15 per day for 3 days, which is a total of 15 * 3 = $45.

However, she also has to pay $3 for parking each day, so her total parking expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we need to subtract her expenses from her pay and then divide by the total hours worked. So, her pay after expenses is $45 - $9 = $36.

Now, let's calculate her hourly pay after expenses: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the number of bottles he'll be placing the candy in and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

First, let's find out how many bottles Richard will place the candy in. His driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. We can find the total number of bottles by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle.

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he'll need to move to 7 more bottles. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next, so we can find the total time by multiplying the number of bottles he needs to move to by the time it takes to move to each one.

7 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 35 seconds

Now, Uncle Franky wants to pack these apples in packs of 8. To find the number of packs, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in one pack.

"Let's break down Jim's situation. He's taking out $50,000 in loans each year for 4 years, so the total amount of loans is $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Before college, Jim had a $25,000 per year job. Since he's not working while in school, he's losing $25,000 per year for 4 years, which is a total of $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

To find the total amount Jim needs to earn, we add the total amount of loans and the total amount of lost income: $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

After college, Jim's income triples to $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year. To find out how long it'll take him to earn the total amount, we divide the total amount by his new income: $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed is 6 feet long, and the fabric needs to be 2 feet longer, so the length of the fabric is 6 + 2 = 8 feet. 

The bed is 8 feet wide, and the fabric needs to be 2 feet wider, so the width of the fabric is 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we calculate the area of one piece and then multiply by 2. 

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width = 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. To find one-fifth of 425, we divide 425 by 5, which gives us 85. Then, we add 17 to that result, so they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

Now, let's move on to Wednesday. They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. Adding 5 to that result, we get 204 + 5 = 209 letters delivered on Wednesday.

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we simply add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls in three sets. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x.

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

To simplify the equation, let's multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

This simplifies to:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"Let's break down the problem. James receives 80 emails a day, and 20% of those don't require a response. To find the number of emails that don't require a response, I'll calculate 20% of 80, which is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails.

Now, I'll subtract the number of emails that don't require a response from the total number of emails James receives in a day. That's 80 - 16 = 64 emails that James responds to in a day.

To find the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, I'll multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5. That's 64 * 5 = 320.

Now, let's add all those up: 32 + 64 = 96, 96 + 96 = 192, 192 + 30 = 222, and finally 222 + 25 = 247.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To calculate the number of pizzas eaten, we multiply 20 by 0.7, which gives us 14 pizzas. So, the glee club has 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.

Now, let's move on to the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. The football team ate 80% of their pizzas, so we multiply 40 by 0.8, which gives us 32 pizzas eaten. This means the football team has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

To find the total number of pizzas left, we add the number of pizzas left from both groups: 6 (glee club) + 8 (football team) = 14.

Now, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing the small coupons is:
700 * 0.05 = 35 dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing the big coupons is:
1400 * 0.15 = 210 dollars

Finally, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons to find the total cost of postage:

To find out how many trucks failed, we calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks:
1/4 * 20 trucks = 5 trucks

This means 5 trucks failed, and the remaining trucks were able to deliver the fertiliser. Let's find out how many trucks delivered:
20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we multiply the number of trucks that delivered by the tons each truck was carrying:
15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is 315 / 7 = 45 bananas.

Now, let's find out how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat in a day. 
The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a day. 
The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is 45 bananas, and the first and second monkeys eat 24 bananas in a day.

First, the initial train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes and will stay in the station for 20 minutes. This means it will leave the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

Next, the second train will arrive half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train will stay for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train will leave the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

Then, the third train will arrive an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it will leave at 125 minutes.

Finally, the fourth train, which is the one Paul needs to board, will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves. Therefore, the fourth train will arrive at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for her sculpture, and she's been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has so far, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks she's been saving them.

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks needed to find out how many more she needs.
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by her weekly savings rate to find out how many more weeks it'll take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Since he bought it at 75% of the original price, we can calculate it as follows:
Original price = $2000
Price Mr. Rogers bought it = $2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Next, we need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend. He sold it at 120% of the price he bought it, which is:
Price Mr. Rogers sold it = $1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, let's find the discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. The discount is the difference between the original price and the price the friend paid:
Discount = Original price - Price Mr. Rogers sold it
= $2000 - $1800
= $200

To find the percentage discount, we'll divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100
= 10%

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

"Let's tackle this problem. We know that Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. To find out how much is left over for Sam, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet. The total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

We also know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find the number of BMX bikes sold, we can multiply the total number of bikes by 0.15:
300 * 0.15 = 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, we can subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105

The prices of the bikes are as follows: MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB ($500 / 2 = $250), and a Trekking bike is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250

John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. To find the total weekly minutes, let's call the total weekly minutes 'x'. Then, the extra learning time is (1/16)x.

We know that the class time is 1600 minutes, and the extra learning time is (1/16)x. The total weekly minutes 'x' is the sum of class time and extra learning time:

x = 1600 + (1/16)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 16:

16x = 25600 + x

Subtract x from both sides:

15x = 25600

Divide both sides by 15:

x = 25600 / 15
x = 1706.67

Now, we can convert the total weekly minutes to hours:

Total hours per week = x / 60
Total hours per week = 1706.67 / 60

Now, Sheila buys a frying pan that's on sale for 20% off the original price of $20.00. To find the discount, we calculate 20% of $20.00.

20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

The discount is $4.00, so the price of the frying pan is:

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, Sheila buys a set of towels that's 10% off the original price of $30.00. To find the discount, we calculate 10% of $30.00.

10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

The discount is $3.00, so the price of the towels is:

$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

The total cost of the new purchases is:

$16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Finally, we add the total cost of the new purchases to the balance after the return.

$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

"Let's dive into this problem. We're given that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of these large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The rest of the jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

Since 6 jellyfish changed color, and they represent a third of the large jellyfish, we can find the total number of large jellyfish by multiplying 6 by 3. This gives us 18 large jellyfish.

Now, we know that these 18 large jellyfish make up a fifth of the total jellyfish population. To find the total number of jellyfish, we can multiply the number of large jellyfish by 5. This gives us 18 * 5 = 90.

Ben's age = 8

Now, we're told Caroline is three times older than Ben. To find Caroline's age, we multiply Ben's age by 3:

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how many years it will take her to reach that goal.

Lauren's retirement savings goal is to live on 40% of her current annual salary for 20 years. 40% of $100,000 is $40,000 per year. For 20 years, she will need:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000

Since Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck, and assuming she gets paid bi-weekly (26 pay periods per year), her annual savings is:

$100,000 per year * 0.20 = $20,000 per year

To calculate how many years it will take her to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the goal by her annual savings:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

However, Lauren wants to retire in 20 years. This means she has already worked for some years and has already saved some amount. Let's assume she has already saved some amount, and she needs to save the remaining amount in the next 20 years.

Since she needs to save a total of $800,000, and she will save $20,000 per year for the next 20 years, she will save a total of:

$20,000 per year * 20 years = $400,000

This means she has already saved:

$800,000 - $400,000 = $400,000

However, this is not the question. The question is how many more years she needs to work.

Since she has already saved $400,000, and she needs to save an additional $400,000, and she saves $20,000 per year, she needs to work for:

$400,000 / $20,000 per year = 20 years

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to determine the total number of cuts and then divide the total length of the ribbon by that number. 

Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Then, each of these 4 parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. So, the total number of final cuts will be 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of cuts:
100 cm / 20 = 5 cm per final cut

"Let's break down the problem. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. To find the total number of students in the school, we need to figure out what 100% of the population is.

Think of it this way: if 40% is 240, then 1% would be 240 divided by 40, which is 6. Now, to find 100% of the population, we multiply 6 by 100, giving us 600 students in total.

Since we're looking for the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys (240) from the total number of students (600). That leaves us with 360 girls.

"The average height of heels at the party can be calculated by adding up the total height of all the heels and dividing by the number of women. 

Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 4 = 12 inches. The other three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches. Since there are 6 women in total, the average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"I'd be happy to help Soledad with her hiking plans. To determine how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we first need to calculate the total number of days she has in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide 9,300 miles by 30 days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad plans to hike twice a day, we divide 310 miles by 2:

310 miles / 2 = 155 miles per hike

However, Soledad is currently planning to hike 125 miles per time. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we subtract 125 miles from 155 miles:

155 miles - 125 miles = 30 miles

Soledad needs to hike 30 more miles per hike to complete her journey on time.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of male and female fishes in Tate's garden pond. Initially, there are 4 male guppies and 3 male goldfishes, making a total of 7 male fishes. On the other hand, there are 7 female guppies and 5 female goldfishes, making a total of 12 female fishes.

Now, let's consider the fishes Tate bought. He bought 2 male guppies and 2 male goldfishes, adding 4 male fishes to the total. He also bought 1 female guppy and 3 female goldfishes, adding 4 female fishes to the total.

So, the new total number of male fishes is 7 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 11. The new total number of female fishes is 12 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 16.

To find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes, we subtract the number of male fishes from the number of female fishes:
16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

"To calculate the total miles driven per month when visiting his parents, we need to determine the distance of the round trip and multiply it by the number of visits per month.

First, let's find the distance of the round trip. Since it takes 2 hours to drive one way at a speed of 70 mph, the distance one way is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, we'll multiply the distance by 2:
Distance for round trip = 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total miles driven per month is:
280 miles * 2 = 560 miles

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 5 workers, and we know the production rates of 4 of them. Two workers produce 6 toys an hour, and the other two produce 4 toys an hour. They all work for 10 hours, and by the end of their shift, the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to fulfill the order of 400 toys.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours. The two workers producing 6 toys an hour will make 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys. The other two workers producing 4 toys an hour will make 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys. So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, let's find out how many toys the fifth worker produced. We subtract the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers from the total number of toys produced in 10 hours: 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. To find out how many eggs each of them painted, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation x + (x + 12) = 30.

Combine like terms: 2x + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2x = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 9.

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 

The difference is 21 - 13 = 8.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Grandma walks 3 miles every day, with 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.

First, let's find her speed on the beach. We know she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 2 miles / 40 minutes
Speed = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we know her speed on the beach is 1/20 miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

Speed = 2 * 1/20 miles per minute
Speed = 1/10 miles per minute

We know she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk. To find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute)
Time = 10 minutes

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk is the sum of the time she spends on the beach and the time she spends on the sidewalk:

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

Initial marbles = 60 - 24
Initial marbles = 36

"Let's dive into this problem. We know Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water, one at 33 degrees and the other at an unknown temperature. When he mixes 4 ounces of the 33-degree water with 1 ounce of the unknown water, the resulting mixture is drinkable, meaning its temperature is at least 40 degrees.

To find the minimum temperature of the second mug, we can use the concept of weighted averages. The total weight of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug). We can set up the following inequality:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:
4 * 33 + x ≥ 200
132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:
x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 68 degrees.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. To find the number of red jellybeans, we multiply the number of green jellybeans by 2, which gives us 2 * 17 = 34 red jellybeans.

Now, we add the number of green and red jellybeans to find their total: 17 + 34 = 51.

Since the total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from this to find the number of blue jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's get to the problem at hand. Tim grows 5 trees, and each year he collects 6 lemons from each tree. To find out how many lemons he gets in a decade, we need to do some simple math.

First, we calculate the number of lemons Tim gets per year. Since he has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons per tree.

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, we need to find out how many lemons he gets in a decade. A decade is 10 years, so we multiply the number of lemons per year by 10.

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"Let's tackle this problem step by step. We're given the ratio of men to women on a bus, which is 5:9. The total number of passengers is 84, and we need to find out how many women remain on the bus after 20 women get off at the next stop.

First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14. This will help us determine the number of women on the bus.

We can set up a proportion to find the number of women:

9/14 = x/84

Cross-multiplying, we get:
9 * 84 = 14x
756 = 14x
x = 756 / 14
x = 54

So, there are 54 women on the bus initially. If 20 women get off, the number of women who remain is:
54 - 20 = 34

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Faraday earns $26 from individual sunflowers and $56 from bouquets per day. We know that each sunflower costs $2 and each bouquet costs $8. 

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
$26 / $2 = 13 individual sunflowers per day

Since we want to find the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days, we multiply the number of individual sunflowers per day by 3:
13 * 3 = 39 individual sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets per day is:
7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers per day

For 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets is:
84 * 3 = 252 sunflowers

Now, we add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in bouquets:
39 + 252 = 291 sunflowers

"Let's break down Adam's rock stand venture. He's investing $100 to buy rocks at $5 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, I'll divide his total money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

So, Adam buys 20 rocks, and his total cost is $100. Now, he sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks:

20 rocks * 0.6 = 12 rocks

He sells each rock for $7, so his total revenue is:

12 rocks * $7 = $84

To determine how much money Adam loses, I'll subtract his total revenue from his total cost:

$100 (total cost) - $84 (total revenue) = $16

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes, 6 medium-sized picture scenes, or 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. She needs to create 45 large-sized picture scenes, 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 49 small-sized picture scenes.

First, let's calculate the number of days it would take her to complete each type of scene individually:
- Large-sized scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

However, Lauren can work on different scenes in a single day. A more efficient approach would be to work on the scenes in a way that minimizes the total number of days.

One possible combination is:
- 6 days for medium-sized scenes (completing all 36 medium-sized scenes)
- During these 6 days, she can also work on 6 * 5 = 30 large-sized scenes (leaving 15 large-sized scenes)
- During the 6 days for medium-sized scenes, she can also work on 6 * 7 = 42 small-sized scenes (leaving 7 small-sized scenes)
- Then, she can complete the remaining 15 large-sized scenes and 7 small-sized scenes in 3 days (since she can do 5 large-sized scenes and 7 small-sized scenes in one day, but she only needs 3 days to complete the remaining scenes)

So, the total number of days is 6 + 3 = 9 days.

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

Sid initially traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, and then he traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours. 

Total distance traveled = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time taken = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

"Let's break down the problem. We have two lottery tickets, and we want to find the probability that both of them are winners.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply their individual probabilities:
20% * 60% = 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.12 * 100 = 12%

We also know Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. To find out how many seashells Carrey collected, we can divide Carlos' total by 2. Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up the total number of seashells collected by the three friends: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we can find out how many each person got by dividing the total by 3. Each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

There are 5 weekdays, from Monday to Friday, and 2 weekend days. To find the total number of carrots he eats in a week, we'll calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends separately, then add them together.

On weekdays, Mason eats 4 carrots a day, so that's 4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots. On weekends, he eats 5 carrots a day, which is 5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots.

Now, let's add the carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends: 20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. John collects garbage from three apartment complexes. The first two have 200 apartments each, so the combined total is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we need to calculate 60% of 400, which is 0.6 * 400 = 240. Since the last complex is 60% bigger, it has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

Now, we're given that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We also know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Since the tree doesn't produce any fruits during the 9th year, we can simply add up the fruits produced in the other years:
50 (year 5) + 150 (year 6) + 350 (year 7) + 800 (year 8) + 0 (year 9) + 1000 (year 10) = 2350

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as y. This means the blue rope is y - 7, and the red rope is 4(y - 7).

We're also given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can set up an equation to represent this:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Now, let's simplify the equation:
y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
Combine like terms:
6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6y = 72

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get:

Yellow paint = 1/2 * 12 = 6 pints

Now, we subtract the yellow paint from the total to find the amount of paint used for the other three colors:

Non-yellow paint (red, white, purple) = 12 - 6 = 6 pints

Next, he loses 10 bills, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Then, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 left.

The value of the remaining 20 dollar bills is 20 * 20 = 400 dollars.

After that, Thomas triples his money, giving him 400 * 3 = 1200 dollars.

The teacher then goes back to using 20% of the original 5 inches per day, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch per day. Since the chalk is not full, we'll use the remaining length to calculate the number of days.

The teacher will use 1 inch of chalk per day until it's less than 2 inches. Let's calculate the number of days:
Day 1: 2.75 - 1 = 1.75 inches
Day 2: 1.75 - 1 = 0.75 inches

Since 0.75 inches is less than 1 inch, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after the second day of using 20% of the original chalk length per day.

However, the question asks for the number of days before he has to recycle the chalk. Therefore, the answer is 2 days before he has to recycle the chalk on the third day.

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
C = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step. Bob has a budget of $27000 to buy books for 3 schools. We know that 100 books cost $500. 

First, we need to find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy with his budget. We can do this by dividing the total budget by the cost of 100 books.

Number of sets = Total budget / Cost of 100 books
Number of sets = $27000 / $500
Number of sets = 54

Since each set contains 100 books, we multiply the number of sets by 100 to find the total number of books.

Total books = Number of sets * 100
Total books = 54 * 100
Total books = 5400

Now, to find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we divide the total number of books by the number of schools.

Books per school = Total books / Number of schools
Books per school = 5400 / 3
Books per school = 1800

"Let's break down the events to find out how many apples Newton brought home.

Initially, 2 apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up, put 1 in his pocket, and threw the other at the tree. This caused 5 more apples to fall. He picked them up, put 4 in his pocket, and threw 1 at the tree. This time, 6 more apples fell. Newton picked them up and went home.

To find the total number of apples Newton brought home, let's count the apples in his pocket: 
- 1 (initial apple) + 4 (from the second fall) + 6 (from the third fall) = 11

"To calculate the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to determine the number of 50 kg bags he ordered and then multiply that by the cost per bag.

First, let's find out how many bags Ali ordered. We can do this by dividing the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight per bag (50 kg).

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now that we know Ali ordered 17 bags, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18).

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 bags * $18 per bag
= $306

"Hey there, let's break down the pizza problem. We've got Kate's 6 friends, and each of them is going to eat 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices they'll eat. For cheese, that's 6 friends x 6 slices each = 36 slices. Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, Kate will need 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

Now, let's do the same for pepperoni. 6 friends x 4 slices each = 24 slices. The pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, so Kate will need 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. That's a total of 6 pizzas.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's dive into the problem at hand. Jay is making snowballs for a snowball fight, and we need to figure out how long it'll take him to have 60 snowballs.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute. However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate at which Jay gains snowballs, we subtract the rate at which they melt from the rate at which he builds them. To do this, we need a common denominator, which is 15 in this case. So, we convert 1/3 to 5/15 and then subtract 2/15: 
5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Now that we know Jay gains snowballs at a rate of 1/5 per minute, we can divide the total number of snowballs he needs (60) by this rate to find the time it'll take: 
60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

The final answer is: 300"
"Let's break this down step by step. We know that John is 28 years old now, and 20 years ago, he was twice as old as Jim. 

First, we need to find John's age 20 years ago. To do that, we subtract 20 from his current age.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Now, we know that 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim. So, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age 20 years ago.

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2 = 4

Now that we know Jim's age 20 years ago, we can find his current age by adding 20 years to that.

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"Let's break down the problem. Doxa started with 8 slices of apple. She ate 1 slice, leaving 7 slices. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 2 slices. Now, there are 7 - 2 = 5 slices left. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we add up the slices eaten by each person: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

We know that the nurses had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, at the end of the third day, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

Since they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, this means that they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the previous days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

Now, we know that they had 3 bandages left from the previous days at the end of the third day. This 3 bandages is the sum of the bandages left at the end of the first day (12) and the bandages left at the end of the second day. Since they used 28 bandages on the second day and only had 12 left from the first day, they must have had 28 - 12 = 16 more bandages at the start of the second day. This means they had 16 more bandages at the start of the first day.

So, the total bandages they had at the start of the first day is 50 (from the bulk pack) + 12 (left at the end of the first day) + 16 (extra bandages) = 78.

"I'd be happy to help you out. So, May's getting her hair cut and colored, and we need to figure out the total cost. The color costs $40, and the haircut costs $30 per inch. 

First, let's determine how many inches were cut off. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8, so that's a difference of 2 inches. 

Now, we multiply the number of inches cut off by the cost per inch: 2 * $30 = $60. That's the cost of the haircut.

Adding the cost of the color, we get $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

"Let's break down Jen's earnings for April. She works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, which translates to 7.5 * 6 = 45 hours per week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 45 * 4 = 180 hours.

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total earnings from hours worked would be 180 * $1.5 = $270. Additionally, she receives $10 for each week of complete attendance, which is $10 * 4 = $40.

Therefore, her total earnings for April would be $270 + $40 = $310.

Now, let's add up the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle.

Now, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which means he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac. The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch per bottle. To find the cost of cognac per bottle, we calculate 50% of $60, which is $30. So, the cost of cognac per bottle is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 × $90 = $1800. To find the total cost of everything, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many trees Mr. Julius planted on the first day. We know he planted 20 White Oak trees. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, he must have planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 + 40 = 60.

Now, let's move on to the second day. Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. For Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than he did on the first day. To find this, we calculate 1/4 * 40 = 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80.

To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days, we add the trees planted on both days: 60 + 80 = 140.

The next day, Barbie accidentally spilled 7 gallons, reducing the amount to 20 - 7 = 13 gallons. Then, Ronnie visited and helped himself to 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the day of the party, 3 guests arrived, and they, along with Fred, would be sharing the remaining root beer. To find out how much each person would get, we divide the remaining amount by the total number of people (3 guests + 1 host = 4 people):

To solve for 'x', we'll first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation, which gives us: 4x = 32

Next, we'll divide both sides by 4, yielding: x = 8

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

Next, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. To do this, we first find the number of remaining fish after subtracting the fish with red stripes: 66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we're told that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. We can calculate this as (5/11) * 44 = 20.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each set has 6 colors, she used 6 / 2 = 3 colors. This leaves her with 18 - 3 = 15 colors from the makeup sets.

Combining the remaining colors from the palettes and makeup sets, Amy has 4 + 15 = 19 colors.

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2, resulting in a total capacity of 30 students for John's school.

Now, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we simply add the capacity of Ali's school (120 students) to the capacity of John's school (30 students).

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed: 2 * 175 = 350 inches

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, I'll break it down into two parts. The first 16 minutes cost $0.25 per minute, and the remaining 20 minutes cost $0.20 per minute.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

Adding these two amounts together gives me the total cost of the 36-minute call:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

"Let's break down the problem. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we denote the number of cupcakes as 'c', then the number of brownies is 3c - 2.

Since each person in Carly's class gets 2 treats and there are 5 people, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. This total is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide by 4: c = 3

The number of cupcakes Carly made is 3."
"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the cost of Karen's salon visit. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. The total cost of these services is $35 + $40 = $75. To find the discount, we multiply $75 by 0.20, which gives us $15. So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we need to add the cost of the nail art. Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Now, let's add the cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art to find the total cost. $60 + $30 = $90.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we have the initial price of the toy in November, which is $40. Then, in December, the price increases by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40, which is 0.8 * $40 = $32. So, the price in December becomes $40 + $32 = $72.

Now, in January, the price decreases by 50%. We calculate 50% of $72, which is 0.5 * $72 = $36. To find the final price, we subtract $36 from $72, giving us $72 - $36 = $36.

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"I'd be happy to help you out. So, Charlie's got a pretty sweet gig going on as a tennis pro, and I'm here to calculate how much he's making today.

First, let's break it down. Charlie's standard rate is $80 per hour, and he's got 4 one-hour lessons lined up at that rate. That's a straightforward calculation:
4 x $80 = $320

Now, he's also got 2 one-hour lessons with a veteran, and he's giving them a 25% discount. To find the discounted rate, I'll multiply his standard rate by 0.75 (since 100% - 25% = 75%):
$80 x 0.75 = $60 per hour

For the 2 lessons with the veteran, Charlie will make:
2 x $60 = $120

Adding the two amounts together, we get Charlie's total earnings for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Walter initially bought 60 apples from the store. He then ate 2/5 of them, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples. So, he had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

Next, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples, which is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples. So, he had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Walter sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple: 27 * 3 = 81 dollars.

"Let's break it down. If Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and that's 3 quarters of the number of novels she's written this year, we can set up a simple equation. 

We know 3 quarters is the same as 3/4, so we can say 9 is equal to 3/4 of the total number of novels written this year. Let's call the total number of novels written this year ""x"". 

So, we have 9 = (3/4)x. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3. This gives us x = 9 * (4/3) = 12.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total hours Michael traveled. Since he traveled for 3 days, and there are 24 hours in a day, the total hours he traveled is:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the distance covered, we will divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100

Now, we know that their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. This means she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother. So, the total number of grapes is 6 (Madeline) + 30 (her brother) + 48 (their mother) = 84 grapes.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time per classroom:
80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

The custodian has 5 days to complete the task, so we divide the total time by 5:
1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes per day

Now, let's convert the custodian's 8-hour workday to minutes:
8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we divide the daily cleaning time by the total daily time and multiply by 100:

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so together they can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which means it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books one bookcase can hold: 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold to find out how many bookcases she needs: 110 / 55 = 2.

The cost of these eggs is 5 dozens times the cost per dozen, which is $2.40. So, the total cost is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will make by selling these eggs. She sells 3 eggs for $1, so she will sell 60 / 3 = 20 sets of eggs. Her total revenue will be 20 x $1 = $20.

To find Rose's profit, we subtract her total cost from her total revenue: $20 - $12 = $8.

Out of these 50 remaining hats, 3/5 are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply 50 by 3/5, which gives us 30 blue hats.

Now, we know that the rest of the hats are white. So, the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

Archie buys a bag of beef jerky that normally costs $18.00, but it's on sale for $3.00 off. To find the discounted price, we subtract the discount from the original price.
$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we need to convert the discounted price to cents, as the question asks for the cost per stick in cents. Since $1 is equal to 100 cents, we multiply the discounted price by 100.
$15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents

The bag contains 30 sticks of jerky. To find the cost per stick, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks.
1500 cents / 30 sticks = 50 cents

Now, let's find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. There are 70 questions on the first test and 40 questions on the second test, for a total of 110 questions. To pass, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct. 

0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Since Audrey already got 42 questions correct on the first test, we subtract this from the total number of questions she needs to get right. 

77 - 42 = 35 questions.

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"Let's break down the problem. Mary makes some strawberry cubes and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes total, we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We know that b = 5s - 4. We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so s + b = 116.

Substituting the expression for b into the second equation, we get:
s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:
6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:
6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:
s = 20

Now that we know s, we can find b:
b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

Now, let's move on to the candles. Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since there are 8 rooms, half of that is 4. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other 4 have 5 medium candles each. The total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16, and the total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20. The total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

First, we need to find out how much dog food is consumed daily. The 3 German Shepherds eat 5 kilograms each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms. The 2 Bulldogs eat 3 kilograms each, which is 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms. Adding these together, we get a total daily consumption of 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

Since we want to know the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. So, 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's get down to business and calculate the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm.

First, we need to find the total number of legs. The farm has 10 2-legged animals, which means they have a total of 10 * 2 = 20 legs. The 15 4-legged animals have a total of 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, let's add these two numbers together to get the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80.

Since each pair of legs consists of 2 legs, we can find the total number of pairs by dividing the total number of legs by 2. So, 80 / 2 = 40.

"Let's break down the problem. We know the tower has 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks. So, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, we add the number of blue and yellow blocks: 4 + 8 = 12. Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, we can find the number of red blocks by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total.

32 - 12 = 20

"Let's break down Elvis's journey. He travels west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph, so the distance he covers is:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance traveled west = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Then, he turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed, covering a distance of:

Distance traveled east = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, he is now 144 - 90 = 54 miles east of his house.

"Let's break down the depreciation of Gary's boat over the three years.

First, we need to calculate the depreciation for the first year, which is 30% of the initial price of $9000. That's 0.3 * $9000 = $2700. So, after the first year, the boat is worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

Next, we calculate the depreciation for the second year, which is another 30% of the current value. That's 0.3 * $6300 = $1890. So, after the second year, the boat is worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

Finally, we calculate the depreciation for the third year, which is 20% of the current value. That's 0.2 * $4410 = $882. So, after the third year, the boat is worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

"Let's break down the problem. We know the bag has 232 pieces of candy in total. We're given the number of red candies as 54. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so that's 54 * 2 = 108. The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, which is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract this total from the overall number of candies in the bag: 232 - 189 = 43.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down Helen's trip expenses. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of her hotel stay. She booked a hotel for 3 nights, and one night costs $80. So, the total cost of her hotel stay is 3 nights * $80 per night = $240.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of her bus rides. Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8. Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus rides is 7 * $8 = $56.

Now, let's add the cost of the hotel stay and the bus rides to find the total cost of Helen's trip. $240 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $296.

"To determine the force needed to push the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and the two children. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children weigh 75 pounds each. So, the total weight of the children is 2 * 75 = 150 pounds. 

Now, let's add up the weights: 1200 (car) + 250 (luggage) + 150 (children) = 1600 pounds.

The force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of the total weight, we multiply the total weight by 0.01. 

Force = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds.

"To determine the total length of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).

Given the length (L) is 20 feet and the width (W) is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2(35)
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how much feed each pig eats in a day. Since each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, the total amount of feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Now, we know Dexter has 5 pigs, so the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

To find out the total amount of feed consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. So, 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, and the pigs consumed 280 pounds in a week. To find out how much feed is left, we subtract the amount consumed from the total amount ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

John already has 4 hot dogs leftover from a previous party, which means he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of packs he needs to buy: 36 / 6 = 6 packs.

Now, let's talk about the cost. Each pack costs $2, so the total cost will be 6 * $2 = $12.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children. This means each of the 10 children becomes a group of 3, so we have 10 * 3 = 30 children.

However, the original 5 children then give up and leave the group. To find the final number of children following the truck, we subtract the original 5 from the total: 30 - 5 = 25.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron. This means Aaron ran half the distance that Vanessa ran, which is 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

Now, we're given that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran 2 miles, we can find out how long it would take Vanessa to run the same distance. If Aaron is twice as fast as Vanessa, then Vanessa would take twice as long to run 2 miles. So, Vanessa would take 16 * 2 = 32 minutes to run 2 miles.

To find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles, we can simply multiply the time it took her to run 2 miles by 2, since she ran twice the distance. Therefore, Vanessa took 32 * 2 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"I'm happy to help the caretaker with his line needs. To determine how much line he needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the docks. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract that from the total amount needed:

600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

"Let's break down the problem. Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, and each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, along with a $5 bottle of wine. To find the total amount spent per reservation, we calculate the cost of meals: 2 * $5 = $10. Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the total amount spent per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, the total amount made per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Given that the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total amount made per week is 2 * $90 = $180.

"Hello there, I'm Victor. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so to find the cost price of each watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons.

Cost price of 1 watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
= $80 / 50
= $1.60

Now, the vendor sold all the watermelons at a 25% profit. To find the profit amount per watermelon, we calculate 25% of the cost price.

Profit amount per watermelon = 25% of $1.60
= 0.25 * $1.60
= $0.40

Finally, we add the profit amount to the cost price to get the selling price per watermelon.

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit amount per watermelon
= $1.60 + $0.40
= $2.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Now, we know James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John was 19 years old when James was born. This means the age difference between John and James is 19 years.

Since James is 18 years old, John is 18 + 19 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the age difference between John and his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

The youngest son's current age is 5 years. In 3 years, he will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Ana and Jane start peeling oranges at the same time, and we want to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour.

First, we need to calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour. Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

On the other hand, Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane. To do this, we simply subtract the number of oranges peeled by Jane from the number peeled by Ana: 20 - 15 = 5.

"I'd be happy to help you out with that. So, Mark's car breaks down and he needs a new radiator. The original price of the radiator is $400, but he manages to snag it for 80% off at a junk shop. That's a great deal, if you ask me.

To calculate the cost of the radiator, we need to find 20% of the original price, since 80% is discounted. That's 0.20 * $400 = $80.

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator, and it takes 3 hours at $50 an hour. So, the labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

Now, let's add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to get the total amount Mark paid. That's $80 + $150 = $230.

"Let's tackle this problem step by step. We know that Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they're either chickens or cows. We also know that the total number of legs is 70.

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. Since there are 20 animals in total, we can write the equation:

c + w = 20

Now, let's think about the legs. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. So, the total number of legs can be represented by the equation:

2c + 4w = 70

To make things easier, let's simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:

c + 2w = 35

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'w' into the first equation:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"Hey there, let's break down the problem. Henry and his 3 friends are sharing 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. To find out how many slices they have in total, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza: 7 * 8 = 56 slices.

Now, since there are 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends) and they want to share the slices equally, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 / 4 = 14.

Answer: 14"
