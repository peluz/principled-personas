"Janet's ducks give her 16 eggs a day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for muffins. That's 7 eggs she don't sell. So she sells 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. She sells 'em for 2 bucks each. So she makes 9 x 2 = 18 bucks a day.

"So we gotta figure out how many bolts of fiber it takes to make a robe. It says it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Then it says it takes half that much white fiber. So if it's half of 2, that's like 1. 

So we got 2 bolts of blue and 1 bolt of white. That's 2 + 1, which is 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"So Josh buys a house for 80,000 bucks and puts in 50,000 for repairs. That's a total of 130,000. Now, the repairs made the house worth 150% more. That means it's now worth 2.5 times the original price. 

The original price was 80,000, so 2.5 times that is 200,000. That's what the house is worth now. 

To find the profit, we subtract what Josh spent from what the house is worth now. So, 200,000 minus 130,000 is 70,000.

$70,000"
"So James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week. That's like, 3 x 3, which is 9 sprints. And each sprint is 60 meters. So if he does 9 sprints, that's 9 x 60. I think that's... um... 540 meters.

"Wendi's got 20 chickens, and each one needs 3 cups of food a day. So, that's 20 x 3 = 60 cups of food they need in total. 

She gives 'em 15 cups in the mornin', and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's 15 + 25 = 40 cups so far.

Now, we gotta figure out how much more food they need. We subtract the 40 cups from the 60 cups. That's 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

20"
"So Kylar's buyin' 16 glasses, right? One glass is 5 bucks, but every other one's cheaper. It's 60% of 5 bucks, which is... um... 3 bucks.

Now, if we pair 'em up, we got 8 pairs. Each pair's gonna be 5 bucks for the first one and 3 bucks for the second one, so that's 8 bucks a pair.

We got 8 pairs, so we multiply 8 by 8, and that's... 64 bucks.

The final answer is: $64"
"So we gotta figger out how many sheep them cities got. Seattle got 20 sheep, that's what it says. Now Charleston got 4 times more sheep than Seattle, so that's 4 x 20, that's 80 sheep. Toulouse got twice as many sheep as Charleston, so that's 2 x 80, that's 160 sheep.

Now we add 'em all up, 20 + 80 + 160, that's... um... 260.

"So Carla's downloadin' this big file, right? It's 200 GB. She can download 2 GB every minute, that's pretty fast. But then her computer restarts and she gotta start all over.

First, let's figure out how much she downloaded before the computer restarted. She got 40% of the way through, so that's like 40% of 200 GB. I think that's like... 80 GB. Yeah, that's right. So she downloaded 80 GB in... um... 80 divided by 2 is... 40 minutes.

Then the computer restarted and that took 20 minutes. Now she gotta start all over, so she downloads the whole thing. That's 200 GB, and it takes her... 200 divided by 2 is... 100 minutes.

So we add it all up: 40 minutes for the first part, 20 minutes for the restart, and 100 minutes for the whole thing. That's... 160 minutes.

"So John drove fer 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. That's a lotta miles. Let's figger it out. 60 miles per hour times 3 hours is... um... 180 miles. That's how far he drove befer he turned aroun.

Now he's tryin to get back home, but it's takin him 4 hours. He's stuck in traffic fer 2 hours, so he ain't movin. Then he drives fer half an hour at 30 miles per hour. That's... uh... 15 miles. Then he drives fer the last hour and a half at 80 miles per hour. That's... um... 120 miles.

So in them 4 hours, he drove 15 miles plus 120 miles, which is... 135 miles. Now we gotta subtract that from the 180 miles he drove befer he turned aroun. That's... uh... 180 minus 135... which is... 45 miles.

"Eliza gets 10 bucks an hour for the first 40 hours she works. So that's 40 times 10, which is 400 bucks. Now, she worked 5 hours more, and that's overtime. She gets 1.2 times her regular pay for overtime, so that's 10 times 1.2, which is 12 bucks an hour. 5 hours of overtime is 5 times 12, which is 60 bucks. So, she made 400 bucks for the first 40 hours and 60 bucks for overtime. That's 400 plus 60, which is 460 bucks.

460"
"So we gotta figger out how many downloads this program had in 3 months. 

First month, it had 60 downloads. That's a good start.

Second month, it had 3 times as many downloads as the first month. That's 3 x 60, which is 180. That's a lotta downloads.

Now, third month, it had 30% less downloads than the second month. I think that means we gotta take 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. Um, 30% of 180 is... uh... 54, I think. So we subtract 54 from 180, and that's 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, let's add 'em all up: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

366"
"I'm gonna figger out how much Toula spent at the bakery. She got 3 dozen donuts, and they cost 68 bucks a dozen. So that's 3 times 68, which is... um... 204 bucks. Then she got 2 dozen mini cupcakes, and they cost 80 bucks a dozen. That's 2 times 80, which is... 160 bucks. And she got 6 dozen mini cheesecakes, and they cost 55 bucks a dozen. That's 6 times 55, which is... 330 bucks.

Now, I'm gonna add all them numbers together. 204 plus 160 is 364, and then I add 330, and that's... 694 bucks.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Carlos is plantin' a lemon tree, and it's gonna cost him 90 bucks to get it goin'. Then every year, he's gonna get 7 lemons, and he can sell 'em for 1.5 bucks each. That's 10.5 bucks a year. But he's also gotta pay 3 bucks a year to water and feed the thing.

So, let's see... if he sells 10.5 bucks worth of lemons, but he's gotta pay 3 bucks to take care of the tree, that's 7.5 bucks he's makin' each year. But he's still 90 bucks in the hole from plantin' the thing.

I'm gonna make a list to keep track of how much he's makin' and how much he's spendin'.

Year 1: He's 90 bucks in the hole, and he made 7.5 bucks, so he's 82.5 bucks in the hole.
Year 2: He's 82.5 bucks in the hole, and he made 7.5 bucks, so he's 75 bucks in the hole.
Year 3: He's 75 bucks in the hole, and he made 7.5 bucks, so he's 67.5 bucks in the hole.
Year 4: He's 67.5 bucks in the hole, and he made 7.5 bucks, so he's 60 bucks in the hole.
Year 5: He's 60 bucks in the hole, and he made 7.5 bucks, so he's 52.5 bucks in the hole.
Year 6: He's 52.5 bucks in the hole, and he made 7.5 bucks, so he's 45 bucks in the hole.
Year 7: He's 45 bucks in the hole, and he made 7.5 bucks, so he's 37.5 bucks in the hole.
Year 8: He's 37.5 bucks in the hole, and he made 7.5 bucks, so he's 30 bucks in the hole.
Year 9: He's 30 bucks in the hole, and he made 7.5 bucks, so he's 22.5 bucks in the hole.
Year 10: He's 22.5 bucks in the hole, and he made 7.5 bucks, so he's 15 bucks in the hole.
Year 11: He's 15 bucks in the hole, and he made 7.5 bucks, so he's 7.5 bucks in the hole.
Year 12: He's 7.5 bucks in the hole, and he made 7.5 bucks, so he's breakin' even.
Year 13: He's breakin' even, and he made 7.5 bucks, so he's 7.5 bucks ahead.

So, it's gonna take Carlos 13 years to start makin' money on that lemon tree.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Melanie's got some vacuum cleaners, and she sells some. She sells a third of 'em at the green house. That means if she had 3, she'd sell 1. If she had 6, she'd sell 2. And so on.

Then she sells 2 more at the red house. That's just 2.

After that, she's got some left, and she sells half of those at the orange house. If she had 4 left, she'd sell 2. If she had 6 left, she'd sell 3.

Now, we know she's got 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we gotta work backwards. If she sold half at the orange house, that means she had 10 before that. 'Cause 10 divided by 2 is 5.

Now we know she had 10 before the orange house, and she sold 2 at the red house. So before the red house, she had 12.

And before the red house, she had a third more, 'cause she sold a third at the green house. So if she had 12, and that's 2 thirds, then she had 18 to start with.

"Let's see... 20% of 20 students is 4, so 4 students took contemporary dance. That leaves 16 students. Then 25% of 16 is 4, so 4 more students took jazz dance. That means 12 students took hip-hop dance.

Now, I gotta figure out what percent 12 is of 20. Um... 12 is like, more than half, so it's more than 50%. I think it's like, 60%. Yeah, that sounds right.

60"
"So the merchant gotta choose between buyin' jewelry for 5,000 bucks or them electronic gadgets for 8,000 bucks. Now, I heard the jewelry's gonna go up 2.5% and them gadgets 1.2%. I think that means the jewelry's gonna be worth more after a month.

Let's see... 2.5% of 5,000 is... um... that's 125 bucks. And 1.2% of 8,000 is... uh... that's 96 bucks. So the jewelry's gonna make more money.

If the merchant wants the most profit, he should buy the jewelry. He'll make 125 bucks.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got two trains, right? They both go 80 miles one way, then they go 150 miles the other way. To find out how far they went, we just add 'em together. That's 80 + 150. I'm pretty sure that's 230.

"So Jill gets paid 20 bucks an hour for teachin' and 30 bucks an hour for bein' a cheer coach. She works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week teachin' and 15 hours a week coachin'. 

First, let's figger out how much she makes teachin' in a week. That's 20 bucks an hour times 35 hours, so that's 700 bucks a week. Now, she does that for 50 weeks, so that's 700 times 50, which is 35,000 bucks a year.

Now, let's figger out how much she makes coachin' in a week. That's 30 bucks an hour times 15 hours, so that's 450 bucks a week. Now, she does that for 50 weeks, so that's 450 times 50, which is 22,500 bucks a year.

So, if we add 'em together, we get 35,000 plus 22,500, which is 57,500 bucks a year.

"Claire eats 3 eggs every mornin'. If we figger out how many days is in 4 weeks, that's like, um, 4 times 7, right? That's 28 days. 

Now, if she eats 3 eggs a day, that's 28 times 3, which is... *counts on fingers* ...84 eggs.

Now, I think a dozen is like, 12 eggs, right? So if we take 84 and divide it by 12, that's... *counts on fingers again* ...7.

"So Marissa's tryin' to hike 12 miles, right? She already walked 6 miles, takin' 2 hours. Now she gotta walk the last 6 miles. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. 

If she's gonna do 12 miles in 3 hours, that's her goal. She already used up 2 hours, so she got 1 hour left. She gotta do 6 miles in that 1 hour. That's 6 miles per hour."
"I gotta figger out how much water's in them drinks. I got 10 liters of orange stuff, but I spilled 1 liter, so now I got 9 liters left. It's 2/3 water, so I gotta multiply 9 by 2 and divide by 3. That's 6 liters of water.

Now, I got 15 liters of pineapple stuff, and it's 3/5 water. I gotta multiply 15 by 3 and divide by 5. That's 9 liters of water.

So, I add 'em together: 6 + 9 = 15. That's how much water I got in them 24 liters.

The answer is: 15"
"So Samantha is 31 years old now. And Raymond is 6 years older than her. That means Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old now.

Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. So to figure out how many years ago that was, I gotta subtract 23 from 37. That's 37 - 23 = 14.

"So Billy's got 8 customers on Tuesday. The first 3 buy one DVD each, that's 3 DVDs. Then the next 2 buy 2 each, that's 4 more. The last 3 don't buy none. So we add 3 and 4, that's 7.

"So the candle's burnin' from 1 to 5, that's 4 hours. It melts 2 centimeters every hour, so I gotta multiply that. Um, 4 times 2 is... 8. So the candle's gonna be 8 centimeters shorter.

The final answer is: 8"
"I think I can figger this out. So Kyle got a discount on a book, right? He paid 19.50, but that's not the real price. The real price is more. 

I know that when you get a discount, you're payin' a part of the real price. In this case, it's 75% of the real price, 'cause 100% minus 25% is 75%. So if 75% of the real price is 19.50, I gotta find out what 100% is.

I can do that by dividin' 19.50 by 0.75. That's like, um, 26. Yeah, that's right. So the real price of the book is 26 bucks.

The final answer is: $26"
"Let's figger this out. Marie got a chicken meal for 12 bucks, 5 milks for 3 bucks each, and 4 apples for 1.50 each. That's a lotta stuff. 

First, let's add up them milks. 5 milks at 3 bucks each is 5 x 3 = 15 bucks. Then them apples, 4 at 1.50 each is 4 x 1.50 = 6 bucks. Now add the chicken meal, that's 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 bucks.

Marie paid 50 bucks total. So we subtract 33 from 50, that's 50 - 33 = 17 bucks left for pizza. Now, each pizza is 8.50 bucks. Let's see how many pizzas she got. 17 divided by 8.50 is... um... 2.

"Mishka bought a bunch of stuff. She got 3 shorts, 3 pants, and 3 shoes. Shorts cost 16.50 each, pants cost 22.50 each, and shoes cost 42 each. 

So, 3 shorts is 3 times 16.50, that's 49.50. 3 pants is 3 times 22.50, that's 67.50. And 3 shoes is 3 times 42, that's 126.

Now, add all that up. 49.50 plus 67.50 is 117. Then add 126 to that, that's 243.

"Cynthia eats ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she'll eat 60 servings. Them cartons got 15 servings in 'em, so she'll need 60 divided by 15, which is 4 cartons. Each carton costs 4 bucks, so she'll spend 4 cartons times 4 bucks, which is... 16 bucks.

"So Henry rode his bike 60 miles and stopped twice. He stopped the first time after 20 miles. Then he rode some more and stopped again 15 miles before the end. I gotta figure out how far he rode between them stops.

Okay, so he rode 20 miles, then he rode some more, then he stopped 15 miles from the end. That means he rode 60 - 15 = 45 miles before his last stop. But we know he rode 20 miles before his first stop, so we gotta subtract that from 45.

45 - 20 = 25

25"
"I think I can figger this out. So Gloria's lookin' at boots and some high heels. The heels are cheaper, but we gotta find out how much the boots cost. 

One pair of heels is 33 bucks, and the other is twice that, so that's 66 bucks. Add 'em together, that's 99 bucks. Now, the boots cost 5 bucks more than the heels, so that's 99 + 5.

$104"
"I think I can figger this out. So Darrell and Allen's ages are like in a special number thingy, 7 to 11. That means if Darrell's age is 7 somethin', Allen's age is 11 somethin'. 

Let's just say Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. I don't rightly know what x is, but I know their ages add up to 162. So I'ma write that down: 7x + 11x = 162.

Now I'ma add those numbers together: 18x = 162. Then I'ma divide both sides by 18: x = 9.

Now I know x, so I can figger out Allen's age. It's 11 times 9, which is 99. But that's his age now. I need to know his age 10 years from now, so I'ma add 10 to 99.

Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

"So we gotta figger out the average guess of them jelly beans. 

First fella says 80. That's a lotta jelly beans.

Second fella says 20 more than half of the first fella's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

Third fella says 25% more than the first fella's guess. I think that's like addin' 20 to 80, so that's 100.

Now we add 'em all up: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

Then we divide by 3, 'cause there's three guesses. 240 divided by 3 is 80.

"So John's got 10 dogs, and each one takes half an hour a day to walk 'em and clean up after 'em. That's a lotta work. 

If he's doin' that for 10 dogs, that's 10 times half an hour, which is 5 hours a day. Now, if he's doin' that every day, that's 5 hours a day, 7 days a week. So that's 5 times 7, which is... 35.

35"
"I think I can figger this out. So Gretchen got 110 coins, and there's more gold than silver. Let's say she got x silver coins. Then she got x + 30 gold coins, 'cause there's 30 more gold.

So, if we add 'em all up, we get x + x + 30 = 110. That's like, 2x + 30 = 110. Now, if I subtract 30 from both sides, I get 2x = 80. Then I divide both sides by 2, and I get x = 40.

So, she got 40 silver coins. And if she got 30 more gold, that's 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

70"
"Let's figger this out. Raymond's got 40 jewels, so half of that's 20. Aaron's got 5 more than that, so that's 20 + 5, which is 25. Now, Siobhan's got 2 less than Aaron, so that's 25 - 2, which is 23.

23"
"So Mike played ping pong for 40 minutes. He got 4 points in the first 20 minutes. Now, in the second 20 minutes, he got 25% more points. I think 25% is like a quarter, so if he got 4 points, a quarter of that is 1 point. So in the second 20 minutes, he got 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, I gotta add the points from the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes. That's 4 + 5 = 9 points.

"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats a lotta yogurts. Let's see... 2 yogurts a day for 30 days is 2 x 30, which is 60 yogurts.

Now, yogurts are on sale, 4 for 5 bucks. So, I gotta figure out how many of them 4-yogurt deals Terry needs. That's 60 yogurts divided by 4, which is 15. So, he needs 15 of them deals.

Each deal is 5 bucks, so 15 deals is 15 x 5, which is... uh... 75 bucks.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"Let's figger this out. John sold some lego sets for 15 bucks each. He had 13 of 'em. So he made 13 x 15, that's a lotta money, 195 bucks. 

He bought 8 video games for 20 bucks each, that's 8 x 20, that's 160 bucks. He had 5 bucks left. So he spent 160 + 5, that's 165 bucks.

He made 195 bucks and only spent 165, so he musta still got some money from them lego sets. He got 195 - 165, that's 30 bucks left from them lego sets.

Them lego sets are 15 bucks each, so he musta still got 30 / 15, that's 2 lego sets.

"So John runs 60 miles a week, and he does it in 3 days. He runs 3 hours the first day, and then half that the other two days. That's 1.5 hours the other two days. 

So, he runs 3 hours one day, and 1.5 hours the other two days. That's 3 + 1.5 + 1.5. That's 6 hours. 

Now, I gotta figure out how fast he runs. I think I can do that by seein' how many miles he runs in an hour. He runs 60 miles in 6 hours. That's 60 miles divided by 6 hours. That's 10 miles an hour.

10"
"So Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she skips half as fast as she runs. That means she runs at 6 miles per hour, 'cause 2 times 3 is 6.

Now, she runs 4 times faster than she walks. So if she runs at 6 miles per hour, she walks at 6 divided by 4, which is 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends 1/3 of her time runnin' and 2/3 of her time walkin'. If she's doin' this for 6 hours, that's 2 hours runnin' and 4 hours walkin'.

In 2 hours, she can run 2 times 6, which is 12 miles. In 4 hours, she can walk 4 times 1.5, which is 6 miles.

So in 6 hours, she can travel 12 miles runnin' and 6 miles walkin', which is 18 miles.

"So Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Ben's is 2 times older than Suzy's, so that's 2 * 1 = 2 years old. Now Brandon's is 4 times older than Ben's, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"So Polly can throw this javelin thingy 400 feet, but that's not far enough to get away from the dragon's fire. But if she's holdin' that sapphire gemstone, she can throw it a lot farther - three times farther, to be exact. That's 400 x 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, the dragon's fire only goes 1000 feet, so if Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet, that means she can stand 200 feet away from the fire and still hit the dragon. That's 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"So we gotta figger out how many pieces of pie them guests took. Grandma Jones made 5 pies, and she cut each one into 8 pieces. That's a lotta pie. So we gotta multiply 5 and 8, that's 40 pieces of pie.

Now, at the end of the day, there's 14 pieces left. So we gotta subtract that from the total. That's 40 minus 14. I think that's... 26.

"I gotta figger out how many chips I can eat. I got 2000 calories I can have in a day, but I already ate 1800. So I got 200 calories left. 

Them chips got 250 calories per servin', so I can have less than one servin'. I gotta divide 200 by 250, that's like... um... 0.8 servin's.

Now, the whole bag is 300g and it's 5 servin's. So one servin' is... uh... 300 divided by 5, that's 60g. Now I multiply 60 by 0.8, that's... um... 48g.

The answer is: 48"
"So Charlie's makin' candles and stuff. He gets 10 candles outta one pound of wax. And that wax and some wicks cost him 10 bucks. He sells each candle for 2 bucks. Now, if he makes and sells 20 candles, how much money does he make?

He needs 2 pounds of wax for 20 candles, so that's 2 times 10 bucks, which is 20 bucks. That's how much he spends.

Now, he sells 20 candles at 2 bucks each, so that's 20 times 2, which is 40 bucks. That's how much he makes.

So, he makes 40 bucks and spends 20 bucks. That means he's got 40 minus 20 bucks left. That's 20 bucks.

"Meredith writes them blog things. She does it every day. It takes her 4 hours to do one. 

On Monday, she did 5 of 'em. On Tuesday, she did a few more. Like, 2/5 more than Monday. That's 2 extra, so she did 5 + 2 = 7 on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she did twice as many as Tuesday. That's 2 * 7 = 14.

So, she did 5 on Monday, 7 on Tuesday, and 14 on Wednesday. That's 5 + 7 + 14 = 26.

It takes her 4 hours to do one, so for 26, it's 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

After she bought the post-it notes, she had 80 + x post-it notes. Then she used 220 of 'em at work. So she had 80 + x - 220 post-it notes left.

We know she had 23 post-it notes left, so we can figure out how many she bought. We gotta get the numbers to equal 23. 

So, 80 + x - 220 = 23. That's like sayin' 80 + x = 23 + 220. That's 80 + x = 243. Then we subtract 80 from both sides, and we get x = 163.

The final answer is: 163"
"So John spent 200 bucks on blue ties, and they cost 40 bucks each. That means he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

Now, he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he got 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which is like, a lot more. So if a blue tie is 40 bucks, a red tie is 40 + (40 * 0.5) = 60 bucks.

He bought 10 red ties, so that's 10 * 60 = 600 bucks.

Add that to the 200 bucks he spent on blue ties, and he spent 200 + 600 = 800 bucks on ties.

"I think I can figger this out. Tracy's got a piece of wire that's 4 feet long. But the pieces she cut are 6 inches long. So first, I gotta turn them feet into inches. I think it's 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet is... um... 4 times 12... that's 48 inches.

Now, I gotta see how many 6-inch pieces I can get from 48 inches. I'll just divide 48 by 6... that's... 8.

"So we gotta figure out how many empty apartments there are in this buildin'. First, we gotta know how many apartments there are total. There's 15 floors, and each floor got 8 apartments. So that's 15 x 8, which is... um... *counts on fingers* ...120 apartments.

Now, we know 3/4 of the buildin' is occupied. That means 3/4 of 120 apartments is taken. *thinks for a moment* I think that's... *counts on fingers again* ...90 apartments.

So if 90 apartments is taken, that means the rest is empty. We gotta subtract 90 from 120. That's... *counts on fingers again* ...30.

"Lemme figger this out. Lloyd's chickens give him 252 eggs a day. He sells 'em by the dozen, so I gotta divide 252 by 12. That's... um... 21 dozen eggs a day. He sells 'em for 2 bucks a dozen, so that's 21 x 2, which is... 42 bucks a day.

Now, I gotta multiply that by 7, 'cause there's 7 days in a week. So, 42 x 7 is... 294.

294"
"So Tom's ship goes 10 miles per hour from 1 to 4, that's 3 hours. So he goes 10 * 3 = 30 miles. Now he's gotta go back, but his ship's only goin 6 miles per hour now. So it's gonna take him 30 miles / 6 miles per hour. That's 5 hours.

"Uriah's gotta get rid of some stuff in his bag. He needs to take out 15 pounds. His comic books are pretty light, 1/4 pound each, and his toys are a bit heavier, 1/2 pound each. He took out 30 comic books, so that's 30 * 1/4, that's like... 7.5 pounds. 

Now, he still gotta get rid of 15 - 7.5 pounds, that's 7.5 more pounds. His toys are 1/2 pound each, so he gotta get rid of... um... 7.5 / 0.5, that's 15 toys.

15"
"So we gotta figger out how much more money the mechanic made on the day he made more. 

He charges 60 bucks for fixin' a truck tire and 40 bucks for fixin' a car tire. On Thursday, he fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. That's 6 times 60, which is 360, and 4 times 40, which is 160. Add 'em up and you get 520 bucks.

On Friday, he fixed 12 car tires and no truck tires. That's 12 times 40, which is 480 bucks.

Now, 520 is more than 480, so Thursday was the day he made more. To find out how much more, we subtract 480 from 520. That's 40 bucks.

"So the Doubtfire sisters got 7 kittens from the shelter. Then their mom calls and says the two cats at home had kittens too. One cat, Patchy, had 3 times as many kittens as the ones they adopted. That's 3 x 7, which is 21. The other cat, Trixie, had 12 kittens.

So we gotta add 'em all up. We got 21 from Patchy, 12 from Trixie, and 7 from the shelter. That's 21 + 12 + 7 = 40.

40"
"Jean had 30 lollipops and ate 2. So now she got 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. She wanna put 2 in a bag, so I gotta see how many 2s I can get outta 28. 

I can do that by dividin' 28 by 2. That's like, how many groups of 2 I can make. 

28 divided by 2 is 14. 

14"
"So Peter's got 42 bucks to spend on movies. Each time he goes, it costs him 7 bucks for a ticket and 7 bucks for popcorn. That's 14 bucks a trip. If I divide 42 by 14, that's... um... 3. Yeah, he can go 3 times.

3"
"So we gotta figure out how many boxes can go on the truck. The bridge can only hold 5000 pounds, and the truck and the driver weigh 3755 pounds. That means we gotta subtract that from 5000. 

5000 - 3755 is 1245. That's how much weight we got left for the boxes. Now, each box weighs 15 pounds. So we gotta divide 1245 by 15. 

That's a lotta math, but I think I got it. 1245 divided by 15 is 83. So the truck can carry 83 boxes. 

83"
"So Stephen got a bill for 40 bucks for his groceries. Then they added 25% to that. I think that's like a quarter of 40, so that's 10 bucks. Now we got 40 plus 10, that's 50 bucks. Then they added 3 bucks for delivery, so that's 53 bucks. And Stephen was nice and gave a 4 buck tip, so that's 57 bucks.

$57.00"
"I reckon we gotta count all them raspberries. There's 6 bunches with 20 raspberries in each, so that's 6 x 20, which is... um... *counts on fingers* ...120. Then there's 67 more raspberries just hangin' out on the bush. So we add 'em all up: 120 + 67 = 187.

187"
"Let's see... We got 25 oranges in total. One's bad, so we take that away. Then we got some that ain't ripe yet, that's 5 of 'em. And 2 are sour, so we take them away too. 

So we take 1 + 5 + 2, that's 8 oranges that ain't good. Now we take 25 and subtract 8, that's... 17.

"So Janet buys this brooch thingy for her daughter. She pays 500 bucks for the stuff to make it, and then she pays 800 bucks for the person to put it together. Then she gotta pay some more for insurance, which is like 10% of the whole thing.

So first, I add 500 and 800, that's 1300. Then I gotta figure out 10% of 1300. I think that's like, 130. So I add 1300 and 130, and that's 1430.

"So Marcy gets a pension if she works for 40 years, right? It's 50,000 bucks a year. But she don't gotta work that long to get some of it. After 20 years, she gets 5% more of that pension each year.

She quits after 30 years, so that's 10 years she got that extra 5% (30 - 20 = 10). That's like, 10 x 5% = 50%. So she gets half of that 50,000 bucks.

Half of 50,000 is... um... 25,000.

The final answer is: $25,000"
"So Aleena got this streaming thingy and it costs her 140 bucks a month. Now, for the first 6 months, she paid that 140 bucks each month. That's 140 times 6, which is 840 bucks.

Then, for the next 6 months, they gave her a discount. They took 10% off, which is like, 14 bucks. So now she's payin' 140 minus 14, which is 126 bucks a month. For 6 months, that's 126 times 6, which is 756 bucks.

So, if we add the two amounts together, we get 840 plus 756, which is... 1596 bucks.

$1596"
"So, Sophia's car tank holds 12 gallons of gas. She drove 100 miles and then put 4 gallons in it. I think we gotta figure out how many miles she gets per gallon first. 

If she drove 100 miles and used 4 gallons, that's like... 100 miles divided by 4 gallons. That's 25 miles per gallon. 

Now, if her tank holds 12 gallons, and she gets 25 miles per gallon, we just multiply 'em together. That's 25 miles/gallon times 12 gallons. That's... 300 miles.

"So Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then reads for half that time, which is 1 hour. That's 3 hours a day, 3 days a week. So in one week, he does that 3 times, that's 3 x 3 = 9 hours. Now, if we do that for 4 weeks, that's 9 x 4 = 36 hours.

"So we gotta count how many people are at this basketball thingy. Each school got 2 teams, one for girls and one for boys. Each team got 5 players, so that's 10 players per school. There's 4 schools, so that's 10 players times 4, which is... um... 40 players.

Now, each school got 2 coaches, one for each team. So that's 2 coaches times 4 schools, which is... 8 coaches.

So we add the players and coaches together, that's 40 + 8, which is... 48.

48"
"Let's figger this out. We got 175 diamonds, that's a lotta sparkly stuff. Now, we gotta find out how many rubies and emeralds we got.

Rubies, we got 35 less than diamonds, so that's 175 - 35, that's 140 rubies.

Now, emeralds, we got twice as many as rubies, so that's 2 times 140, that's 280 emeralds.

So, we add 'em all up, 175 diamonds, 140 rubies, and 280 emeralds. That's a whole lotta gems. Let me count 'em... 175 + 140 + 280... that's 595.

595"
"So we gotta figure out how many teachers there are at this school. First, we know there's 60 girls, and there's twice as many boys as girls. That means there's 120 boys, 'cause 2 times 60 is 120.

Now we add the boys and girls together to get the total number of kids: 120 + 60 is 180.

Then we gotta divide that by 5, 'cause that's how many kids each teacher has. So 180 divided by 5 is... 36.

36"
"Bailey gets 5 bucks a week for 8 weeks. That's 5 times 8, which is 40 bucks. She ends up with 100 bucks after 8 weeks. So, to figure out how much she started with, I gotta subtract 40 from 100. That's 60 bucks.

60"
"So Judy teaches a lot of dance classes. She does 5 classes a day, Monday to Friday. That's 5 days, so that's 5 x 5 = 25 classes. Then she does 8 more on Saturday. That's 25 + 8 = 33 classes in a week.

Each class has 15 kids in it, so that's 33 x 15 = 495 kids in a week. She charges 15 bucks a kid, so that's 495 x 15 = 7425 bucks.

"So Shiela bought 5 phones for 150 bucks each. That's 5 x 150, which is 750 bucks. Now, they're gonna charge her 2% interest. I think that's like 2 cents for every dollar, so that's 2% of 750, which is... um... 15 bucks. So now she owes 750 + 15, which is 765 bucks.

She's gotta pay this over 3 months, so we gotta split 765 by 3. That's... uh... 255 bucks a month.

$255"
"Artie's got his flower stand at the market. He sells them marigolds, petunias, and begonias. He's gonna round the prices to the nearest dollar 'cause he don't got no change. 

Marigolds is $2.74, but he's gonna sell 'em for $3. Petunias is $1.87, so that's $2. And begonias is $2.12, that's $2 too.

Now, let's see how much he's gonna make. He sells 12 marigolds, that's 12 x $3 = $36. He sells 9 petunias, that's 9 x $2 = $18. And he sells 17 begonias, that's 17 x $2 = $34.

Addin' all that up, we get $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.

"So we gotta figure out the average square footage of each level of this sandcastle thingy. It's got 4 levels, and the top one is 16 square feet. Each level below it is twice as big as the one above it.

So the second level is 2 times 16, which is 32. The third level is 2 times 32, which is 64. And the fourth level is 2 times 64, which is 128.

Now we add 'em all up: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240. That's the total square footage.

To get the average, we divide that by the number of levels, which is 4. So 240 divided by 4 is 60.

"So Cecilia's got a new puppy and she gotta feed it. The vet says for the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of food a day. Then after that, it needs 2 cups a day. I think the puppy's gonna eat a lot.

Let's see... for the first 180 days, that's 180 cups of food. Then for the rest of the year, that's 185 days, and the puppy needs 2 cups a day, so that's 370 cups. That's a lot of food.

So in total, the puppy's gonna eat 180 + 370 cups of food, that's 550 cups. Now, the food comes in bags, and each bag's got 110 cups. So to figure out how many bags Cecilia's gonna need, I gotta divide 550 by 110.

That's... um... 5 bags. Yeah, Cecilia's gonna need 5 bags of dog food for the first year.

5"
"So Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Now, David does a quarter of what Sarah does, so that's like 400 divided by 4, which is 100 pounds. 

Raymond does half of what Sarah does, so that's like 400 divided by 2, which is 200 pounds.

Now, to find the difference, I gotta subtract what David does from what Raymond does. That's 200 - 100, which is 100.

100"
"I think I can figger this out. So, Vincent's gotta buy 18 flowers, right? He can get 'em in packs of 3 for 2.50 bucks or packs of 2 for 1 buck.

Let's see... if he gets the packs of 3, that's 2.50 bucks for 3 flowers. That's like... uh... 2.50 divided by 3... that's 0.83 bucks per flower, I think.

Now, if he gets the packs of 2, that's 1 buck for 2 flowers. That's like... 1 buck divided by 2... that's 0.50 bucks per flower. That's cheaper!

So, if he buys 18 flowers in packs of 2, that's... uh... 18 divided by 2... that's 9 packs. And 9 packs times 1 buck is... 9 bucks.

If he buys 'em in packs of 3, that's... uh... 18 divided by 3... that's 6 packs. And 6 packs times 2.50 bucks is... 15 bucks.

So, he saves... uh... 15 bucks minus 9 bucks... that's 6 bucks!

$70"
"So we gotta figger out how much water's left. Two girls got some, and a boy got some too. They started with 24 liters. 

Each girl got a sixth of that, so that's like, 24 divided by 6, which is 4. And there's two girls, so that's 4 times 2, which is 8. 

The boy got 6 liters. So, if we add what the girls got and what the boy got, that's 8 + 6, which is 14. 

Now, we subtract that from the 24 liters they started with. That's 24 - 14, which is 10.

"Let's figger this out. Charlie had 10 stickers to start with. Then he went to the store and got 21 more. And on his birthday, he got 23 more. So that's 10 + 21 + 23, which is a lotta stickers. I think that's 54 stickers.

But then he gave some away. He gave 9 to his sister and used 28 for a card. So that's 9 + 28, which is 37 stickers he don't have no more.

Now, if he had 54 and he don't have 37 no more, that means he got 54 - 37 left. That's 17 stickers.

17"
"So we gotta figure out how much Alex weighs first. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Grace weighs 125 pounds. So 4 times that is... um... 500 pounds. Then we subtract 2 pounds from that, so Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now we add their weights together. Grace weighs 125 pounds and Alex weighs 498 pounds. So that's 125 + 498... that's 623 pounds.

623"
"I think I can figger this out. Dan's got 3 rose bushes, and each one's got 25 roses. That's a lotta roses. Now, each rose has 8 thorns. That's a lotta thorns too. So, if I multiply the number of bushes by the number of roses, that's 3 x 25, which is 75. Then I multiply that by the number of thorns, which is 8. That's 75 x 8, which is... um... 600.

600"
"I think I can figger this out. If they played 22 games and they won 8 more than they lost, that means we gotta find out how many they lost first. Let's say they lost some number of games, and they won that number plus 8.

So if they lost some number of games, and they won that number plus 8, and that adds up to 22, then we can try some numbers. If they lost 7 games, that's 7, and if they won 7 plus 8, that's 15. And 7 plus 15 is 22.

So they won 15 games.

"Gene's been goin on vacations since he was 23, and now he's 34. That's 11 years. He goes on 4 vacations a year, so that's 11 x 4 = 44 vacations. He's got a shirt from each one, so he's got 44 shirts. And each shirt is a quilt block, so he's got 44 quilt blocks.

44"
"So the alarm went off three times. The first time it went off, it rang 4 times. Then the second time, it rang 3 times as long, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 times. Then the third time, it rang half as long as the second time, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 times.

So we gotta add 'em all up: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22

7920"
"I think I can figger this out. If Marilyn sold 10 times as many as Harald, that means if Harald sold some number, Marilyn sold that number times 10. Let's just call that number Harald sold ""x"". Then Marilyn sold 10x.

So together they sold x + 10x, which is 11x. And we know that's 88,000. So 11x is 88,000. If I divide 88,000 by 11, I get 8,000. That's how many Harald sold.

8000"
"So Christina invited 16 friends to her party, but some of 'em ain't gonna show up. I think it's a quarter of 'em, so that's like 4 people. That means 12 people are comin'. Now, she needs 3/4 of a gift bag for each person, which is like 0.75. So for 12 people, that's 9 gift bags. Each gift bag costs 2 bucks, so she's gonna spend 9 x 2 = 18 bucks.

Now, the little dinosaurs, they don't eat as much. They eat half of what the grown-ups eat, so that's 5 pounds each. And there's 5 of 'em, so that's... 5 times 5... 25 pounds.

So, if I add the two together, that's 200 pounds for the grown-ups and 25 pounds for the little ones... that's 225 pounds.

225"
"So Cindy's got 4 pets, right? Marcia's got 2 more than Cindy, so that's 6 pets for Marcia. Now, Jan's got 3 times as many pets as Marcia, so that's 3 x 6, which is 18 pets for Jan.

So, if we add 'em all up, we get 4 + 6 + 18, which is... 28.

28"
"Let's figger this out. James is 10, and he's one year younger than Corey. So Corey's 10 + 1, that's 11.

"Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Gerald used to be 2 seconds slower than Lee, so that's 38 + 2 = 40 seconds. Now Gerald's got a new diet and he's 10% faster. That means he's 90% as slow as he used to be. So I gotta multiply 40 by 0.9. That's 36 seconds.

36"
"So we gotta figure out how many pets are in the neighborhood. We know there's 60 dogs, and for every dog, there's 2 cats. That means there's 2 x 60 = 120 cats.

Now, if we add the dogs and cats together, that's 60 + 120 = 180. But we ain't done yet, 'cause we still gotta find out how many rabbits there are. It says the number of rabbits is 12 less than the dogs and cats combined. So that's 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Now we add all the pets together: 168 rabbits + 60 dogs + 120 cats = 348.

"Let me figger this out. So we got 200 kids in grade 5, and 2/5 of 'em are boys. That's like, if I had 10 cookies and 4 of 'em were chocolate chip, that's 2/5. So, 2/5 of 200 is... um... 80 boys.

That means we got 200 - 80 = 120 girls. Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. That's like, if I had 12 cookies and 8 of 'em were oatmeal raisin, that's 2/3. So, 2/3 of 120 is... um... 80 girls in the girl scout.

Now, if 80 girls are in the girl scout, that means the rest ain't. So, 120 - 80 = 40 girls ain't in the girl scout.

"So we gotta figger out how many tomatoes Freda used. She made 32 ounces of sauce, but that's after they lost half their size. So we gotta double that to get the size of the tomatoes before they were cooked. That's 64 ounces.

Now, we know each can is 16 ounces, so we gotta divide 64 by 16 to get the number of cans. That's 4 cans.

Each can has 3 tomatoes, so we multiply 4 cans by 3 tomatoes. That's 12 tomatoes.

"Let's figger this out. We got 30 cars on the motorway, right? Then 5 of 'em take an exit, so they don't gotta deal with the jam. That leaves us with 30 - 5 = 25 cars.

Now, we know 20 cars went through in the last 15 minutes of the jam. So, if we subtract them from the 25 cars that didn't take the exit, we get the number of cars that went through in the first 15 minutes.

25 - 20 = 5

"So Jerome had 4 friends come visit him, and they all rang the doorbell a bunch of times. The first friend rang it 20 times. The second friend rang it a little more than the first, like a quarter more. That's 5 more, so 20 + 5 is 25.

The fourth friend rang it 60 times, and the third friend rang it 10 more times than that, so that's 60 + 10 = 70.

Now, let's count 'em all up: 20 + 25 + 60 + 70. That's a lotta numbers. Okay, so 20 + 25 is 45, and then add 60, that's 105, and then add 70, that's... 175.

"So Solo gotta read a bunch of pages from his school books. He gotta read 4 pages from Science, 20 from Social Studies, 7 from History, and 8 from Geography. That's a lotta pages. Let me count 'em... 4 + 20 is 24, then add 7, that's 31, and then add 8, that's 39 pages.

He already read 15 pages on Monday, so now he gotta read 39 - 15, that's 24 pages. He got 4 days to do it, so I reckon he gotta read 24 pages divided by 4 days... that's 6 pages a day.

"So John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and then one more before bed. That's 4 glasses a day. He does that 5 days a week, so that's 4 x 5 = 20 glasses. 

On the weekends, he has water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but has soda with dinner. That's 3 glasses a day. There's 2 days on the weekend, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 glasses.

So, if we add 'em up, that's 20 + 6 = 26 glasses of water a week.

"I think I can figger this out. So the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, right? Now we need to know how many 3-mile chunks are in 42 miles. I'm gonna divide 42 by 3. That's 14. So there's 14 chunks of 3 miles in 42 miles. Now, if it takes 10 minutes to cover each chunk, I just multiply 14 by 10. That's 140 minutes.

"So Poppy's got this big ol' puzzle with 1000 pieces. She puts a quarter of 'em on the board. That's like, 250 pieces. Now there's 750 pieces left.

Her mom comes along and puts a third of them on the board. That's like, 250 pieces too. Now we gotta figure out how many pieces are left.

We know they put 250 + 250 = 500 pieces on the board. So we subtract that from the total, 1000 - 500 = 500.

500"
"Cody eats a whole lotta more cookies than Amir. Like, three times more. Amir eats 5 cookies, so Cody eats 3 times that, which is... um... 15 cookies. Yeah, that's right.

So, if Amir eats 5 and Cody eats 15, that's a total of... 5 + 15... that's 20 cookies.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got 3 boxes, and they're all the same size. They're 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. So we gotta subtract that from the size.

So the length is 5 inches, but we gotta take off 1 inch from each side, so that's 3 inches. The width is 6 inches, but we take off 1 inch from each side, so that's 4 inches. And the height is 4 inches, but we take off 1 inch from the top and bottom, so that's 2 inches.

Now we gotta multiply all them numbers together to get the volume. So it's 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches. That's the volume of one box. We got 3 boxes, so we multiply that by 3. That's 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

"Let's figger this out. Frankie watched a lotta TV. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's 2 hours. Then on Thursday, he watched 1 hour and a half hour, that's 1.5 hours. And on Friday, he watched 2 hours. That's a total of 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Now, Frankie watched 7 hours in all, so we gotta subtract them hours from 7. That's 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours. That's how much TV he watched on Wednesday.

Now, them shows on Wednesday was 30 minutes each. We gotta turn 1.5 hours into minutes. That's 90 minutes. Now we gotta divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes per show. That's 3 shows.

3"
"Let's figger this out. Henry made twice as many cookies as last year, but he made 15 too many. Then he dropped 5. Now he's got 110 cookies. 

So, if he dropped 5, that means he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies before he dropped 'em. 

Now, we know he made 15 too many, so we gotta take those away. That's 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

He made twice as many as last year, so we gotta divide that by 2. That's 100 / 2 = 50 cookies.

So Henry made 50 cookies last year.

"So ya wanna know how much gas is gonna cost after gettin' some cash back, right? Alright, lemme figger it out.

Gas costs 3 bucks a gallon, and ya get 20 cents back for each gallon. If ya buy 10 gallons, that's 3 bucks times 10, which is 30 bucks.

Now, for the cash back, it's 20 cents times 10, which is 2 bucks. So ya get 2 bucks back.

Now, subtract 2 bucks from 30 bucks, and ya get... 28 bucks!

"So we gotta figger out how many roll-ups them two ate on average. First, we gotta know how many each one ate. Beatrice had 2 rows of roll-ups and they was 24 long, so that's 2 x 24, which is 48. Marcell had 3 rows and they was 14 long, so that's 3 x 14, which is 42.

Now we add 'em together, 48 + 42, that's 90 roll-ups. Then we gotta divide that by 2, 'cause we're findin' the average. So 90 / 2 is 45.

45"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Julia's boat's got a leak, and it's takin' on water. It's takin' on 2 liters for every 10 feet she rows. Now, I know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. That's like, a pretty good pace, I reckon.

So, if it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, that means she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. I'm gonna divide 20 by 16 to see how many feet she rows per second. That's... um... 1.25 feet per second.

Now, I know the shore's 64 seconds away. So, I'm gonna multiply 1.25 feet per second by 64 seconds. That's... uh... 80 feet. That's how far she's gotta row to get to shore.

Now, I know the boat's takin' on 2 liters for every 10 feet. So, I'm gonna divide 80 feet by 10 feet. That's... 8. That means she's gonna row 8 of them 10-foot things.

So, if the boat's takin' on 2 liters for every 10 feet, and she rows 8 of 'em, that's... uh... 8 x 2 = 16 liters. That's how much water the boat's gonna take on.

"Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. He did that for 15 days. So he planted 2 x 15 flowers. That's a lot. Um, 2 x 10 is 20, and 2 x 5 is 10, so 2 x 15 is 30. He planted 30 flowers.

But 5 of 'em didn't grow. So we gotta take those away. 30 - 5 is... 25.

"So Jamal's phone can hold a whole lotta pictures, 6 times more than Brittany's. And Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more pictures than the number of ducks in Jamal's picture of the ducks at the zoo. Now, Jamal's phone can hold 1800 pictures. 

So if Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more than Brittany's, that means Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 pictures. 

Now, if Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more pictures than the number of ducks, that means the number of ducks is 300 / 50 = 6.

"So Sasha bought some lumber and now she wanna sell it. She got 10 of them 2 x 4 x 10 boards that she paid 10 bucks each for. And she got 5 of them 4 x 4 x 10 boards that she paid 16 bucks each for.

First, let's add up how much she paid for all that lumber. 10 boards at 10 bucks each is 10 x 10 = 100 bucks. And 5 boards at 16 bucks each is 5 x 16 = 80 bucks. So she paid 100 + 80 = 180 bucks total.

Now, prices went up 50%, so she can sell it for 50% more than what she paid. That's like 1.5 times what she paid. So for them 2 x 4 x 10 boards, she can sell 'em for 10 x 1.5 = 15 bucks each. And for them 4 x 4 x 10 boards, she can sell 'em for 16 x 1.5 = 24 bucks each.

Now let's add up how much she can sell it all for. 10 boards at 15 bucks each is 10 x 15 = 150 bucks. And 5 boards at 24 bucks each is 5 x 24 = 120 bucks. So she can sell it all for 150 + 120 = 270 bucks.

So her profit is what she sells it for minus what she paid for it. That's 270 - 180 = 90 bucks.

"I think I can figger this out. So Katy's got this mix of sugar and water, and it's like 7 parts sugar to 13 parts water. That's a total of 20 parts, right? Now, she used 120 of them things, so I gotta divide that by 20 to see how many groups of 20 she used. That's 120 divided by 20, which is 6.

Now, I know 7 parts out of every 20 is sugar, so I gotta multiply 6 by 7 to see how many sugars she used. That's 6 times 7, which is 42.

"John's got 3 kids, and he buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of 'em. That's 2 pairs times 3 kids, so that's 6 pairs of shoes. But each pair's got 2 shoes, so that's 6 pairs times 2, which is 12 shoes.

Each shoe costs 60 bucks, so I gotta multiply 12 shoes by 60 bucks. That's a lotta math, but I think I got it... 12 times 60 is... 720.

$720"
"So we gotta figger out how many containers came in on the second day. We know they had 2 containers the first day, and each one had 5 cars in it. That's 2 x 5, which is 10 cars.

Now, the next day, they got a whole bunch more, and now they got 30 cars total. So we subtract the 10 from the first day, and that leaves us with 20 cars that came in on the second day.

Each container got 5 cars, so we divide 20 by 5, and that's... 4! So they musta brought in 4 more containers on the second day.

"So Adrien's salary was 30% more than Lylah's. That means if Lylah made a dollar, Adrien made 1.30 dollars. We know Adrien made 40,000 dollars four years ago. So Lylah made 40,000 / 1.30 = 30,769 dollars.

Now, Adrien's salary went up by 40%. That means he made 40,000 + 40% of 40,000. 40% of 40,000 is 16,000. So Adrien made 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000 dollars.

Lylah's salary also went up by 40%. So she made 30,769 + 40% of 30,769. 40% of 30,769 is 12,308. So Lylah made 30,769 + 12,308 = 43,077 dollars.

So together, Adrien and Lylah made 56,000 + 43,077 = 99,077 dollars.

"So Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. Then she slept 2 hours less for the next 2 days, so that's 6 hours each day. That's 6 + 6 = 12 hours for them 2 days.

Now, for the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than them 2 days, so that's 7 hours a day. There's 4 days left in the week, so that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add it all up. Monday was 8 hours, them 2 days was 12 hours, and the rest of the week was 28 hours. That's 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

But then I'm thinkin', she used 3 spoons to taste her stew. So if she had 7 spoons and used 3, that means she musta had more spoons before she used them 3. So I'm thinkin' 7 + 3 = 10.

So Julia musta bought a package of 10 spoons.

"I'm gonna figger out how much Dillon's gonna spend. 

First, peppers cost 15 bucks each. Watermelons cost 3 times that, so that's 3 x 15 = 45 bucks. Oranges cost 5 bucks less than watermelons, so that's 45 - 5 = 40 bucks.

Now, Dillon's buyin' 4 watermelons, so that's 4 x 45 = 180 bucks. He's buyin' 20 peppers, so that's 20 x 15 = 300 bucks. And he's buyin' 10 oranges, so that's 10 x 40 = 400 bucks.

Let's turn that into hours. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so we gotta divide 24 by 60 to get how many hours each person takes. That's 0.4 hours per person.

Now we gotta multiply that by 500 people. That's 200 hours. The doctors charge the hospital $150 an hour, so we multiply 200 hours by $150. That's $30,000 the hospital pays the doctors.

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so we multiply 200 hours by $200. That's $40,000 the hospital gets from the patients.

Now we gotta subtract how much the hospital pays the doctors from how much they get from the patients. That's $40,000 minus $30,000. That's $10,000.

Now, I gotta find out what percent 4 is of 20. I think I can do that by dividin' 4 by 20, and then multiplyin' by 100.

He's got 8 houses to clean, so that's 8 times 9 bucks, that's 72 bucks. He says he's gonna make 92 bucks, so if we take away the 72 bucks he's spendin' on supplies, that leaves him with... 92 minus 72 is 20.

Now, he can harvest every 3 months, and there's 12 months in a year. So if we divide 12 by 3, that's 4 times he can harvest in a year.

"So Shawnda's got this bike inflation thing goin' on. She charges 25 cents per tire. On the first day, 5 people with bikes came by, and they got both tires done. That's 10 tires right there. Then 3 people with them three-wheeled things came by, and they got all three tires done. That's 9 more tires. And some other person came by on a unicycle, so that's 1 more tire.

So we add 'em all up: 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires. Now, each tire's 25 cents, so we multiply 20 by 25. That's 500 cents. Now, I think there's 100 cents in a dollar, so we divide 500 by 100. That's 5 dollars.

"So Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack got 6 cookies in it. That's a lotta cookies. So we gotta figure out how much they cost. Each cookie is 10 cents, so we gotta multiply the number of cookies by 10 cents.

First, we gotta find out how many cookies there is. 10 packs with 6 cookies in each pack, that's... um... 60 cookies. Yeah, that's right. Now we multiply 60 cookies by 10 cents. That's... uh... 600 cents. And 100 cents is a dollar, so 600 cents is... 6 dollars.

Carl pays with a 10-dollar bill, so we gotta figure out how much change he gets. We subtract 6 dollars from 10 dollars... that's... 4 dollars.

"Let's figger this out. Dave ate 14 fries, then a seagull ate half of that, so the seagull ate 7. That's 14 + 7 = 21 fries gone.

Then some pigeons came and ate 3 fries each. There was 3 pigeons, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 more fries gone. Now we got 21 + 9 = 30 fries gone.

A raccoon came and took 2/3 of what was left. I don't rightly know what that means, but I can work it out. Let's say there was x fries to start with. After Dave and the seagull and the pigeons, there was x - 30 fries left. The raccoon took 2/3 of that, so the raccoon took 2/3 * (x - 30) fries.

Now we got some fries left, and the ants took 1, leavin' 5. So we can say 1/3 * (x - 30) = 5 + 1 = 6.

Now I gotta figger out what x is. I think I can do that. If 1/3 * (x - 30) = 6, then x - 30 = 6 * 3 = 18. Then x = 18 + 30 = 48.

"So Kimo's got classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and he's got 3 classes each day. Each class is 1 hour, so that's 3 hours a day, 3 days a week. That's 3 x 3 = 9 hours.

Then on Tuesdays and Thursdays, he's got 2 classes, but they're 2 hours each. So that's 2 x 2 = 4 hours a day, 2 days a week. That's 4 x 2 = 8 hours.

So in a week, he's got 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours of classes.

Now, there's 16 weeks in a semester, so we gotta multiply 17 hours by 16. That's 17 x 16 = 272.

"So Bill bakes a whole lotta stuff every day. He makes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes. Now, I gotta figure out how long all them things are if we put 'em end to end.

First, I gotta know how long each thing is. Rolls are 4 inches, croissants are 6 inches, and baguettes are 2 feet. But I need everything in feet, so I gotta convert them inches to feet. There's 12 inches in a foot, so...

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches is 1200 inches. That's 1200 / 12 = 100 feet.
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches is 720 inches. That's 720 / 12 = 60 feet.
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet is already in feet, so that's just 120 feet.

Now, I add 'em all up: 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet.

"So we gotta figure out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order. He's gotta feed the monkeys, gorillas, and baboons. 

Monkeys need 200 bananas a month, gorillas need 400, and baboons need 100. That's a lotta bananas. Let's add 'em up. 200 + 400 + 100 is... 700. That's how many bananas they need for one month.

But the zookeeper don't order bananas every month, he orders 'em every 2 months. So we gotta multiply 700 by 2. That's... 1400.

The final answer is: 1400"
"So we gotta figger out who ran the most and by how much. Blake and Kelly are runnin on a football field, and it's 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. That's like, a lotta runnin. Each time he runs back and forth, that's 200 yards. So, 15 times 200 is... um... 3000 yards.

Now Kelly, she runs back and forth once, that's 200 yards. Then she gets all weird and runs to the 40-yard line and back. She does that 34 times. That's like, a buncha times. Each time she runs to the 40-yard line and back, that's 80 yards. So, 34 times 80 is... uh... 2720 yards. Add that to the 200 yards she ran at first, and she ran 2920 yards.

So Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards. That means Blake ran more. To figger out how much more, I gotta subtract. 3000 minus 2920 is... 80 yards.

"Raphael bought some stuff for school. He got 4 pens, they cost 1.5 bucks each, so that's 4 times 1.5, that's 6 bucks. He got 2 notebooks, they cost 4 bucks each, so that's 2 times 4, that's 8 bucks. And he got some paper, that cost 20 bucks. Now, I gotta add all that up... 6 plus 8 is 14, and then I add 20, that's 34 bucks.

"So we gotta figger out how deep the water is in the tank on Wednesday. First, we gotta know how deep it was on Tuesday. It was 17 feet on Monday, then it got 7 feet more, so that's 17 + 7 = 24 feet on Tuesday.

Now, we gotta find out what's two-thirds of 24. I think that's like, if you had 24 cookies and you wanted two-thirds of 'em, you'd have to divide 'em up. So, two-thirds of 24 is... um... 16.

"Anakin caught a bunch of fish. He got 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin got some too. He got 5 less starfish than Anakin, so that's 5 starfish. He got 3 less sea horses than Anakin, so that's 3 sea horses. And he got 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so that's 5 clownfish.

So Anakin got 10 + 6 + 3, that's 19 fish. Locsin got 5 + 3 + 5, that's 13 fish. If we add 'em together, that's 19 + 13, that's 32.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, the price of them marbles goes up by 20% every 2 months, right? That's like, a lot. 

Okay, so it starts at 20 bucks. After 2 months, it's 20 + 20% of 20, which is... um... 4 bucks more. So that's 24 bucks. 

Then, after 4 months, it's 24 + 20% of 24... that's... uh... 4.80 more. So that's 28.80 bucks.

I'm gonna keep doin' this till I get to 36 months.

After 22 months, it's 123.82 + 20% of 123.82... that's... 24.76 more. So that's 148.58 bucks.

After 24 months, it's 148.58 + 20% of 148.58... that's... 29.72 more. So that's 178.30 bucks.

After 26 months, it's 178.30 + 20% of 178.30... that's... 35.66 more. So that's 213.96 bucks.

After 28 months, it's 213.96 + 20% of 213.96... that's... 42.79 more. So that's 256.75 bucks.

After 30 months, it's 256.75 + 20% of 256.75... that's... 51.35 more. So that's 308.10 bucks.

Now, the doll. It cost as much as 3 action figures, so that's 15 bucks too.

Let's add up all the stuff she bought: 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102. That's 1090 + 157 = 1247, then 1247 + 74 = 1321, and 1321 + 102 = 1423.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Seth is twice as old as Brooke, right? Let's say Brooke is x years old. That means Seth is 2x years old.

Now, in 2 years, Brooke's gonna be x + 2, and Seth's gonna be 2x + 2. And we know that in 2 years, their ages added together is gonna be 28.

So I'm thinkin', if we add x + 2 and 2x + 2, that's like addin' 3x + 4. And that's gotta equal 28.

Now, I ain't no math whiz, but I think if we subtract 4 from both sides, we get 3x = 24. Then if we divide both sides by 3, we get x = 8.

So Brooke's 8 years old, and Seth's twice that, which is... 16!

The final answer is: 16"

I think 50% is like half, right? So half of $1000 is $500. Now we add that to the $1000, and we get $1500. That's what she's gotta pay every month.

Now, to figure out how much she pays in a year, we gotta multiply that by 12. That's like, a lot of math. But I think it's $1500 x 12 = $18,000.

First, I'm gonna add up the time it takes to peel and cut one potato. A minute and a half is like 1.5 minutes, and 5 seconds is like a tiny bit, so I'll say it's 0.08 minutes. So, it takes him 1.5 + 0.08 = 1.58 minutes to do one potato.

Now, I'm gonna multiply that by 60, 'cause he's gotta do 60 potatoes. That's 1.58 x 60 = 94.8 minutes. I'll just round that up to 95 minutes, 'cause you can't really do a fraction of a minute.

They made $25 in profit, so we gotta figure out how many gallons they made. $25 divided by $5 is 5 gallons. Now we know they made 5 gallons. They spent $3 on lemons per gallon, so we multiply 5 gallons by $3. That's $15.

Now, he's got 6000 - 3500 left, which is 2500. He gives half of that to charity, so that's 2500 divided by 2, which is 1250. Now he's got 2500 - 1250 left, which is 1250. 

Then he gives his daughter 200 bucks and his wife 700 bucks, so that's 200 + 700, which is 900. Now, he's got 1250 - 900 left, which is 350.

Now, if he rolls two even numbers in a row, that's a different story. He's got 3 even numbers: 2, 4, and 6. So, the chance of rollin' an even number is 3 out of 6, or 50% again. But he's gotta do it twice, so that's 50% times 50%, which is 25%.

So, the difference between 50% and 25% is 25%. That's how much more likely it is that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Then they went on some rides, and each ride cost 33 bucks. They went on 2 rides, so that's 2 x 33, which is 66 bucks.

Now we add all that up: 20.25 + 15.75 + 66, that's 102 bucks. They're gonna split it 3 ways, so we divide 102 by 3.

So, Tom's got 130 trees, and 39 of 'em die. That leaves him with... 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

"So, let's figger this out. They put 18 pink flamingos in Sue's yard on Friday. Then on Saturday, they took a third of 'em, which is 6, and painted 'em white. So now she's got 12 pink ones and 6 white ones. Then on Sunday, they added 18 more pink ones. That's 12 + 18, which is 30 pink ones. And she still got 6 white ones.

So, how many more pink ones than white ones? That's 30 - 6, which is 24.

"I think I can figger this out. So, a pen costs the same as a pencil and eraser put together. A pencil is $1.20 and an eraser is $0.30. So, a pen is $1.20 + $0.30, that's $1.50. Now, if I wanna know how much 8 pens cost, I just gotta multiply $1.50 by 8. That's... um... $12.

So, if we add them together, that's 8417 + 9092, that's... um... 17509. Now, if we take the total number of people, 23786, and subtract the number of men and women, 17509, that's... 23786 - 17509... that's 6277. So, there's 6277 kids in Soda.

"Elaine started with 20 pokemon cards. Then she got 3 times that many, so thats 3 x 20 = 60. She got those in the first month. 

In the second month, she got 20 less than the first month. So thats 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

Now, in the third month, she got twice as many as the first two months put together. So thats 2 x (60 + 40) = 2 x 100 = 200.

So we gotta add all them cards together. Thats 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

"So Mark edits sentences for two publishers, A and B. They both pay him different, but B pays double what A pays. Mark does 1000 sentences a week, and A pays him 5 cents a sentence.

So, Mark does 500 sentences for A and 500 for B. For A, that's 500 x 5 cents, which is 2500 cents. Now, B pays double, so that's 10 cents a sentence. 500 x 10 is 5000 cents.

Add 'em together, and Mark makes 2500 + 5000 cents a week. That's 7500 cents.

First, let's figure out how much he makes in a year without the raise. That's 2 grand a week, times 52 weeks. That's... um... *counts on fingers* ...104,000 bucks.

Now, the raise. 5% of 2 grand is... *thinks for a sec* ...100 bucks a week. So now he makes 2,100 bucks a week. That's 52 weeks times 2,100 bucks... *counts on fingers again* ...109,200 bucks.

Add the 5 grand he got for the award, and that's... *counts on fingers once more* ...114,200 bucks.

"Carl ate sandwiches for lunch every day this week. That's 7 days. He put 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. So that's 2 slices a day for 7 days. That's a lotta cheese. I think that's 14 slices.

He also had cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days. He put one more slice of cheese in them omelets than he did in them sandwiches. So that's 3 slices of cheese in each omelet. That's 3 slices a day for 3 days. That's 9 slices.

And then he made a big ol' dish of macaroni and cheese for dinner. He used 8 slices of cheese in that.

So if we add all them slices together, that's 14 + 9 + 8. That's 31 slices of cheese.

"Let's count Janet's pens. She had 22 green ones and 10 yellow ones, so that's 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Then she bought some more pens. She got 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag had 9 pens. That's a lot of pens. So, 6 bags with 9 pens in each is... um... 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

And she also got 2 bags of red pens. Each bag had 6 pens, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add all the pens together. She had 32 pens, then she got 54 blue pens and 12 red pens. That's 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens.

"So Brinley's got 5 test scores so far: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. She's gonna take one more test, and Mr. Bert's gonna throw out the lowest score. She wants an average of 93. 

First, I'm gonna add up all them scores, but I'm gonna leave out the lowest one, 'cause that's what Mr. Bert's gonna do. So I'm gonna add up 89, 92, 100, and 86. That's 367.

Now, if she wants an average of 93, and she's got 5 scores, but one's gettin' thrown out, that means she needs 4 scores that average to 93. So I'm gonna multiply 93 by 5, 'cause that's how many scores she's gonna have, but then I'm gonna think of it like she's only got 4 scores. So 93 times 5 is 465.

Now I know she needs a total of 465, but she's already got 367 from them first 4 scores. So I'm gonna subtract 367 from 465, and that's gonna give me the score she needs on the last test. 465 minus 367 is 98.

"Micheal rode his bike a lot. He rode it 5 times a week for 4 weeks, and each time he went 25 kilometers. That's a lot of ridin'. So, for them 4 weeks, he rode 5 times a week, that's 20 times. And each time he went 25 kilometers, so that's 20 x 25, that's 500 kilometers.

Then, he changed his mind and rode only 2 times a week, but he went 60 kilometers each time. He did that for 3 weeks. So, that's 2 times a week for 3 weeks, that's 6 times. And each time he went 60 kilometers, so that's 6 x 60, that's 360 kilometers.

Now, I gotta add 'em together. 500 kilometers and 360 kilometers, that's 860 kilometers.

"So we gotta figure out how much Joe's candy weighs. He's got 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Now, I know each chocolate bar weighs 40g. And it says each chocolate bar is twice as heavy as a candied apple. So if a chocolate bar is 40g, a candied apple is half that, which is 20g.

Now, let's add up the weight of the chocolate bars. 25 chocolate bars times 40g is... um... that's 1000g.

And the candied apples, we got 80 of 'em, and they weigh 20g each. So that's 80 times 20, which is... uh... 1600g.

Now we add 'em together, 1000g and 1600g, that's 2600g.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So we got 20 dozen cups, and we don't know how much they cost. But we do know that they cost $1200 less than half a dozen plates. Now, half a dozen plates is 6 plates, and they cost $6000 each. So 6 plates is 6 * $6000, which is... um... *counts on fingers* ...$36000.

Now, we know the cups cost $1200 less than that, so we subtract $1200 from $36000, and that's... *counts on fingers again* ...$34800. That's how much the cups cost.

But we got 20 dozen cups, and we wanna know how much each cup costs. So we gotta figger out how many cups we got. 1 dozen is 12, so 20 dozen is... *counts on fingers* ...20 * 12, which is 240 cups.

Now, we take the total cost of the cups, which is $34800, and we divide it by the number of cups, which is 240. That's... *does math in head* ...$145 per cup.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, Jerry's got some red chickens and some white chickens. The red ones give 3 eggs a day, and the white ones give 5 eggs a day. He gets 42 eggs every day.

Now, I know he's got 2 more white chickens than red chickens. Let's say he's got some number of red chickens, and that's the number I'm tryin' to find. If he's got 2 more white chickens, that means he's got that same number of red chickens, plus 2.

So, if we multiply the number of red chickens by 3 (cuz they give 3 eggs a day), and we multiply the number of white chickens (which is the number of red chickens plus 2) by 5 (cuz they give 5 eggs a day), that should give us 42 eggs.

I'm gonna use a little trial and error here. Let's say he's got 4 red chickens. That means he's got 6 white chickens (4 + 2). If we multiply 4 by 3, that's 12 eggs from the red chickens. If we multiply 6 by 5, that's 30 eggs from the white chickens. Add 'em together, and we get 42 eggs.

"So we gotta figure out how long Gary's gonna be walkin' around the park. The park's a rectangle, right? It's 1.5 miles one way and 6 miles the other way. Gary walks at 3 miles an hour.

First, we gotta figure out how far he's gonna walk. He's gonna walk around the whole thing, so we gotta add up all the sides. That's 1.5 + 6, and then we gotta do that twice 'cause he's gonna walk both ways on the long and short sides. So that's 1.5 + 6 = 7.5, and then we do that twice, so it's 7.5 + 7.5 = 15 miles.

Now we know how far he's walkin', and we know how fast he's walkin', so we can figure out how long it's gonna take him. We just divide the distance by the speed, so that's 15 miles divided by 3 miles an hour. That's 5 hours.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got two pools, and they're both leakin' at the same rate, 4 gallons a minute. Now, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the little pool. Let's say the little pool had x gallons. Then the big pool had 2x gallons.

Now, both pools lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes, 'cause they're leakin' at 4 gallons a minute. So, the little pool's got x - 16 gallons left, and the big pool's got 2x - 16 gallons left.

But here's the thing, the big pool's got 4 times as much water as the little pool now. So, we can set up a little equation. The big pool's got 2x - 16 gallons, and that's 4 times the little pool's x - 16 gallons. So, we can say:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Now, I ain't no math whiz, but I can try to figger this out. If I multiply out the 4, I get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Then, if I subtract 2x from both sides, I get:

-16 = 2x - 64

Addin' 64 to both sides gives me:

48 = 2x

Dividin' both sides by 2 gives me:

24 = x

So, the little pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. And since it lost 16 gallons, it's got:

24 - 16 = 8

Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now we add up all the points we know: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197. All four students scored 251 points together. So to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract 197 from 251. That's 251 - 197 = 54.

"So we gotta figger out how old them girls is. Jessa's 20. Joan's 5 years older than Jessa, so that makes her 25. Mary's 2 years younger than Joan, so she's 23.

Now, we add all them ages up: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68

First, 30% of 'em leave through door A. That's like, a third of 'em, right? So, 1000 x 0.3 is... um... 300. Yeah, 300 students leave through door A.

Now we got 1000 - 300 = 700 students left. Then, 3/5 of 'em leave through door B. That's like, three out of five, so it's a bunch. Let me see... 700 x 3/5 is... um... 420. Yeah, 420 students leave through door B.

So, we got 700 - 420 = 280 students left. And they all leave through door C. That's the answer.

"So John got 54 candies, and he got twice as many as Robert. That means Robert got half of what John got, so Robert got 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

Now, James got 6 more candies than Robert, so James got 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

John got 54 candies and James got 33 candies. To find out how many more candies John got, I subtract James' candies from John's candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

So, they read 3 and 3, that's 6 books.

"So Mike's got 3 pen pals left, right? He used to have 5, but he stopped writin' to 2 of 'em. Now, each of these 3 pals sends him 2 letters a week, and each letter's got 5 pages. He writes back the same, so that's 2 letters a week per pal, times 3 pals, that's 6 letters. And each letter's 5 pages, so that's 6 times 5, that's 30 pages he's writin' a week.

Now, it takes him 6 minutes to write a page, so to write 30 pages, that's 30 times 6, that's 180 minutes. But we need to know how many hours that is, so we gotta divide by 60, 'cause there's 60 minutes in an hour. So 180 divided by 60 is... 3.

"Jason's got 1000 minutes on his phone plan. He talks to his boss every day for 15 minutes, and there's 30 days in the month. So that's 15 times 30, which is... um... *counts on fingers* ...450 minutes.

He also talked to other people for 300 minutes. So that's 450 plus 300, which is... *counts on fingers again* ...750 minutes.

Now, if he's got 1000 minutes and he used 750, that means he's got... *thinks for a moment* ...250 minutes left.

"Let's figger this out. Griffin had 24 fries, then Kyle took 5. That leaves Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Now Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So Griffin's got 19 - 10 = 9 fries left. Then Colby took 3 less than Kyle, so that's 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now Griffin's got 9 - 2 = 7 fries left. But we know Griffin ended up with 27 fries. So Ginger musta gave him some. To find out how many, we subtract 7 from 27. That's 27 - 7 = 20. So Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got two aquariums, one with 4 snails and the other with 32 snails. That's a whole lotta snails. Now, the problem says the difference between the two is twice the number of fish in both tanks. And we know both tanks got the same number of fish.

So, let's see... 32 snails minus 4 snails is... um... 28 snails. That's the difference. Now, if that's twice the number of fish in both tanks, that means we gotta divide that by 2, and then divide by 2 again, 'cause there's two tanks.

So, 28 divided by 2 is 14, and then 14 divided by 2 is... 7! That's how many fish is in each tank.

"So Jean's makeup artist charges her 250 bucks an hour. She needs makeup done 4 times a week, and it takes 6 hours each time. That's 24 hours a week. The movie's gonna take 5 weeks, so that's 24 hours a week times 5 weeks, which is 120 hours. 

Now, 120 hours times 250 bucks an hour is 30,000 bucks. But the makeup artist gives her a 10% discount 'cause she's doin' so much work. 10% of 30,000 is 3,000 bucks. So Jean gets 3,000 bucks off.

"So Isabelle bought a bunch of stuff for her sister's birthday party. She got cake stuff for 12 bucks, presents for 43 bucks, decorations for 15 bucks, invitations for 4 bucks, and goodie bags for 22 bucks. Now, let's add all that up. 

12 + 43 is 55. Then add 15, that's 70. Then add 4, that's 74. Then add 22, that's 96. So all that stuff cost 96 bucks.

Now, she's splitin' that with her two parents, so that's three people. To find out how much each person owes, we gotta divide 96 by 3. That's... um... 32.

"So the chef got 4 bags of onions, and each bag is 50 pounds. That's a lotta onions. So we gotta figure out how much all them onions weigh. That's 4 times 50, which is 200 pounds.

Now, each pound of onions cost $1.50. So we gotta multiply 200 by $1.50. That's... um... *counts on fingers* ...$300.

"So Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday. Sue ate 4 times that, so that's 4 x 5 = 20 cookies. Then on Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Sue ate twice that, so that's 2 x 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies they ate. Sue's sister had 5 + 13 = 18 cookies. Sue had 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Each cookie is 200 calories. So Sue's sister ate 18 x 200 = 3600 calories. Sue ate 46 x 200 = 9200 calories.

Now, I gotta figure out how many more calories Sue ate than her sister. That's 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

"Let's figger this out. We got 3 classes with 20 kids in each, so that's 60 kids in total. Half of 'em are boys, half are girls. That's 30 boys and 30 girls.

Now, we know the first class got 15 girls and the second class got 12 girls. That's 27 girls right there. So, the third class must have 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

We know the third class got 20 kids, and 3 of 'em are girls. So, the number of boys in the third class is... 20 - 3 = 17.

"Travis had 61 apps. He got rid of 9, so that's 61 minus 9, that's 52. Then he got 18 more, so that's 52 plus 18. That's 70.

"So Rick killed a bunch of animals, right? Last night he got 10 wolves and 15 cougars. That's 25 animals.

Now, today he killed a lot more. He killed 3 times as many wolves as cougars. And he killed 3 fewer cougars than last night. So, last night he killed 15 cougars, and today he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

If he killed 3 times as many wolves as cougars, and he killed 12 cougars, then he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

So today he killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars. That's 36 + 12 = 48 animals.

Last night was 25 animals, and today was 48 animals. So in total, Rick killed 25 + 48 = 73 animals.

"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. He rides the elevator up to the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6. So we gotta do some math here. 

Four times 3 is 12, and then we add 6 to that. That's 18.

"So we gotta figger out how many times Robert went down the water slide. Mitchel went 30 times, and Anne went 30% less than that. I think that means we gotta take 30% away from 30. That's like, um, 9. So Anne went 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, Robert went 4 times as much as Anne. That's like, 4 x 21. I think that's... 84. Yeah, that's right. Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"So we got 10 stalls with 20 cows in each. That's a lotta cows. Then Mr. Sylas comes along and buys 40 more cows. He puts 'em in 20 stalls, not 10, so I'm thinkin' maybe there's more stalls now.

Anyway, he puts 2 cows in each stall. Now each stall got 20 cows already, plus 2 more, so that's 22 cows in each stall.

Now I gotta find out how many cows in 8 stalls. That's 22 cows in each stall, times 8 stalls. That's... um... 176 cows.

"I'm gonna count Brady's money. He got 100 pennies, that's a dollar. He got 40 nickels, that's 40 times 5 cents, that's 200 cents, that's 2 dollars. He got 20 dimes, that's 20 times 10 cents, that's 200 cents, that's 2 dollars. And he got 40 dollar bills, that's 40 dollars.

So I'm gonna add it all up. That's 1 dollar, plus 2 dollars, plus 2 dollars, plus 40 dollars. That's a lotta money. That's 45 dollars.

"So we gotta figure out how much this tree weighs. It's 200 feet tall, and each 10 feet of it weighs 400 pounds. That's a lotta weight. 

First, we gotta figure out how many 10-foot pieces we got. We do that by dividin' 200 by 10. That's 20. So we got 20 pieces of 10 feet each.

Now, we multiply 20 by 400, 'cause that's how much each piece weighs. That's 8000 pounds. That's how much the tree weighed before them termites got to it.

But them termites ate 30% of it. I don't know what 30% is, but I know it's like, almost a third. So we gotta take away almost a third of 8000. I think that's 2400 pounds. 

So we take away 2400 from 8000, and we get 5600 pounds. That's how much the tree weighs now.

The final answer is: 5600"
"Nancy's gotta pay for them books. She owes 50 cents for each one, and she got 8 of 'em. That's 50 cents times 8, which is... um... *counts on fingers* ...4 bucks.

"So Andrea got 52 apples, and she got 8 more than Jamal. That means Jamal got 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Now, Jamal got 4 more bananas than apples, so he got 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea got half as many bananas as Jamal, so she got 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's count all the fruits. Andrea got 52 apples and 24 bananas, that's 52 + 24 = 76 fruits. Jamal got 44 apples and 48 bananas, that's 44 + 48 = 92 fruits. 

So, all together, they got 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"So Carla's makin' a bunch of cookies, right? Today she's makin' 36 and tomorrow she's makin' 30. That's a lotta cookies. 

First, we gotta figure out how many dozens that is. A dozen's 12, so we gotta add 'em up and divide by 12. 
36 + 30 is 66. Now, 66 divided by 12 is... um... 5 and a half. 

Now, I know it takes 2 cups of flour to make a dozen cookies. So if Carla's makin' 5 and a half dozen, we gotta multiply that by 2. 
5 and a half times 2 is... 11.

"So we gotta figger out how much money them girls got. Carmen got 100 bucks. Samantha got 25 bucks more than Carmen, so that's 100 + 25, that's 125. Daisy got 50 bucks more than Samantha, so that's 125 + 50, that's 175.

Now we add it all up: 100 + 125 + 175. That's a lotta numbers. Let me see... 100 + 125 is 225, and then we add 175 to that... that's 400.

That's like, 5 out of every 100 dollars. So that's 17,500 bucks. Then there's the transfer fee, that's 12% of 350,000. That's like, 12 out of every 100 dollars. That's 42,000 bucks.

So we add all that up: 350,000 for the house, 17,500 for the broker, and 42,000 for the transfer. That's 409,500 bucks. That's more than her budget. To find out how much more, we subtract her budget from that. That's 409,500 minus 400,000. That's 9,500 bucks.

"So Mr. Tan sold his house for 400,000 bucks. He gotta pay some fees and stuff. 

First, he paid 3% for transfer fees. That's like, 3 percent of 400,000. Um, that's 12,000 bucks. 

Then he paid 5% for brokerage fee. That's 5 percent of 400,000. That's 20,000 bucks.

He also paid 250,000 for the loan. So, all the money he paid is 12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000. That's 282,000 bucks.

Now, if he sold the house for 400,000 and paid 282,000, how much he got left? That's 400,000 - 282,000. That's 118,000 bucks.

"So we gotta figure out how long it takes to get the chicken cooked, right? First, we gotta heat up the oil to 300 degrees, and that takes 20 minutes. Then we gotta get it to 400 degrees, and that's gonna take a bit longer. I think it's like 40% longer or somethin'. So that's like, uh, 8 minutes more. So that's 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to get to 400 degrees.

So far, we got 20 minutes to get to 300, and 28 minutes to get to 400. That's a total of 48 minutes just to get the oil hot. Now, cookin' the chicken takes a little less time than that. I think it's 5 minutes less. So that's 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook the chicken.

So, if we add it all up, we got 48 minutes to heat the oil, and 43 minutes to cook the chicken. That's 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.

Now, let's add up the body, collar, and rosette: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches. The whole sweater's 1800 stitches, so the sleeves gotta be 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

The second scene's got 6 more lines than the song, so that's 54 + 6 = 60. And he's gotta memorize 4 out of every 5 lines, so that's 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines.

Now, let's add all them lines up: 54 for the song, 36 for the first scene, and 48 for the second scene. That's 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

Now, we gotta find out how many cards are left. 80 minus 32 is 48. Then, half of them got B on 'em. Half of 48 is 24.

So, we subtract 24 from 48, and that leaves us with 24 cards. Now, 5/8 of them got C on 'em. That's like, 5 parts out of 8, so I'll multiply 24 by 5 and divide by 8. That's 15 cards with C.

The problem says that in 9 years, Ruby'll be 3 times as old as Sam. So, I can write that down like this: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9). That's like, a secret code, but I think I can crack it.

If I multiply out the right side, I get 6S + 9 = 3S + 27. Now, I can subtract 3S from both sides, and that gives me 3S + 9 = 27. Then, I subtract 9 from both sides, and I get 3S = 18.

Finally, I divide both sides by 3, and I get S = 6. That's Sam's age! He's 6 years old.

Now, them silver beads are a quarter inch long. So we gotta figure out how many quarters fit in 17 inches. That's like, 17 divided by a quarter. I think that's the same as 17 times 4, 'cause a quarter is like, one-fourth, right? So 17 times 4 is... 68.

Now, we need to figure out how long it took the slow car to go 480 miles. I think I learned this in school, but I don't rightly remember. But I think it's somethin' like, time is distance divided by speed. So we gotta divide 480 miles by 30 miles per hour.

Now we take the total, 40, and subtract the grown-ups' chocolate bars, 24. That leaves us with 16 chocolate bars for the kids.

We got 8 kids, and we gotta divide the 16 chocolate bars between 'em. So we divide 16 by 8, and that's 2. Each kid gets 2 chocolate bars.

Now, they get extra points if they got more than 20 points. Mike and Tony got more than 20, so they get 1 extra point each. Jim don't get nothin'.

So now Mike got 21 + 1 = 22 points, Jim still got 18 points, and Tony got 42 + 1 = 43 points.

On the second day, he does more. He does 20 more pushups than the first day, so that's 100 + 20 = 120. He does 10 fewer squats, so that's 50 - 10 = 40. And he doubles the dumbbell presses, so that's 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, let's add 'em all up. Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220. Squats: 50 + 40 = 90. Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60.

So, the total count is 220 + 90 + 60 = 370.

"Let's figger this out. So, each person eats 0.2 kg of rice for lunch and dinner. That's 0.2 + 0.2, which is 0.4 kg per day. Now, there's 5 people eatin', so that's 0.4 * 5, which is 2 kg per day.

Now, we gotta figger out how much they eat in a week. There's 7 days in a week, so that's 2 * 7, which is 14 kg per week.

Now, we got a 42 kg bag of rice. If they eat 14 kg per week, how many weeks will it last? That's 42 / 14, which is 3.

"Sam's gotta sell 120 crates of bread in a week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend. 

On the weekend, he sold 20 crates. Then on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, he sold 15, 12, and 18 crates. That's 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates. Add the weekend crates, that's 45 + 20 = 65 crates.

Sam's target is 120 crates. He only sold 65 crates. So, he's short by 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

"So Carmen starts with a bid of 200 bucks. Then 3 other people bid, and she bids after each of 'em. Each time the price goes up by 50 bucks. 

So it goes like this: 
- First, it's 200 bucks.
- Then some other person bids, so it's 250 bucks.
- Then Carmen bids, so it's 300 bucks.
- Another person bids, so it's 350 bucks.
- Carmen bids again, so it's 400 bucks.
- The last person bids, so it's 450 bucks.
- Then Carmen bids again and wins, so it's 500 bucks.

"So John's gotta go to work and back, that's 60 miles a day. He does that 5 days a week, so that's 300 miles a week. He does that for 50 weeks, so that's 15,000 miles a year. He gets charged 2 bucks a mile, so that's 30,000 bucks a year. He also gives his driver 150 bucks a month, so that's 1,800 bucks a year. Add that all up and you get...

"So Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday for twice as long as he did on Sunday and Monday. He did 23 minutes on Sunday and 16 minutes on Monday. I gotta add those two numbers together. That's 23 + 16, which is 39. Now, I gotta double that. That's 39 x 2, which is 78. So Peter gotta exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday.

78"
"I think I got it. So, we got 32 pages, right? And we're foldin' the paper in half. That means we got two pages on each piece of paper, one on the front and one on the back.

So, if we got 32 pages, and we're puttin' two pages on each piece of paper, we just divide 32 by 2. That's 16. But wait, that's not right. We're countin' each piece of paper twice, 'cause we're lookin' at the front and the back.

So, we really just need half of 16. That's 8. Yeah, that's it. We need 8 pieces of paper.

The final answer is: 8"
"Annika had 50 bucks. She spent half on food and stuff, that's 25 bucks. Then she spent 10 more on rides, so that's 25 + 10, that's 35 bucks she spent. Now, I gotta take away 35 from 50, that's... 15 bucks left.

"Let's figger this out. Elise got 250 books from her dad and she's been sellin' 'em for 3 years. She sells each book for 20 bucks. This year she sold 45 books. She sold twice as many in the first year, so that's 2 times 45, which is 90 books.

Now, we know she got 250 books and there's 50 left, so she musta sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in total. We know she sold 90 in the first year and 45 this year, so that's 90 + 45 = 135 books. That means she sold 200 - 135 = 65 books in the second year.

Each book is 20 bucks, so she made 65 x 20 = 1300 bucks in the second year.

"Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. That's 50 hours a week. He gets 10 bucks an hour, so that's 50 * 10 = 500 bucks a week. 

He gets a 300 buck bonus every week if the company does good. April's got 4 weeks, so he gets 4 * 300 = 1200 bucks in bonuses. 

He makes 500 bucks a week, so in 4 weeks, that's 500 * 4 = 2000 bucks. Add the bonuses, that's 2000 + 1200 = 3200 bucks.

"John arm wrestled 20 people and he won 80% of the time. That means he lost 20% of the time. I think 20% is like, a fifth, right? So if you take 20 and divide it by 5, that's 4. So he lost to 4 people.

"So the bakery makes 60 loaves of bread a day. They sell 2/3 of 'em in the mornin'. That's a lotta bread, but I reckon it's like this: if you got 60 and you take 2/3, that's like takin' 2 outta every 3. So that's 40 loaves gone in the mornin'.

Now we got 60 - 40 = 20 loaves left. Then they say half of what's left is sold in the afternoon and evenin', but they sell it equally, so that means they sell half of that half in the afternoon. So half of 20 is 10, and half of 10 is 5.

"So, Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. That's like, 2 pounds a week, right? 

Now, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a week. So, if Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, that means Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, and Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, then to lose 8 pounds, it's gonna take Sandy... um... 8 divided by 2 is 4, and then times 4 is... 16 weeks.

"So we gotta figger out how much we save if we buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk. 

First, the ice cream. It used to be 13 bucks, now it's 11. So we save 2 bucks on each one. We buyin 2, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 bucks saved.

Now the milk. We get 50 cents off each packet. We buyin 4 packets, so that's 4 x 50 cents = 2 bucks saved.

Add em together, we get 4 + 2 = 6 bucks saved.

"So Helena's got this crazy serum thingy that makes people grow extra arms and legs. It makes 'em grow an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days. We gotta figure out how many new limbs they'll have after 15 days.

Okay, so for the arms, if it's every 3 days, that's like 15 divided by 3, which is 5. So they'll have 5 new arms.

For the legs, it's every 5 days, so that's 15 divided by 5, which is 3. So they'll have 3 new legs.

Now, if we add 'em together, that's 5 arms and 3 legs, which is... 8.

"So, let's figger this out. Theo's got $6000 for his trip. He buys 6 suits, and they cost $100 each. That's 6 x $100, which is $600. Then he buys 3 suitcases, and they cost $50 each. That's 3 x $50, which is $150.

Now, the flight ticket. It's $700 more than 5 times the cost of a suit. A suit costs $100, so 5 times that is $500. Add $700 to that, and it's $1200.

So, we add up all the stuff he's bought: $600 for suits, $150 for suitcases, and $1200 for the flight. That's $1950. He's got $6000, so if we take away $1950, that leaves him with $4050. But he wants to save $2000, so we take that away too. That leaves him with $2050.

"So we got 5 people in the family, right? Three of 'em eat 3 eggs a day, that's 9 eggs. The other two, they eat 2 eggs a day, that's 4 eggs. So all together, they eat 9 + 4, that's 13 eggs a day.

Now, if they eat eggs every day, we gotta figure out how many eggs they eat in a week. A week's got 7 days, so we multiply 13 by 7. That's... um... 91 eggs.

They said the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age 6 years ago. So, that's 3000 times 20, which is... um... 60,000. And that's half of what it is now, so we gotta double it. That's 120,000.

Population of Chile now: 120,000"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got 105 people on the football team. Now, the offense got twice as many players as the defense. That means if the defense got some number, the offense got that number times two. And the special teams, they got half as many players as the defense. That means they got that number divided by two.

Let's just call the number of players on the defense ""some number"". Then the offense got twice that, and the special teams got half that. If we add all them numbers together, we should get 105.

I'm thinkin'... if the defense got 30 players, then the offense got 60, and the special teams got 15. That adds up to 105. I think that's right.

The final answer is: 30"
"So Martha invited some people to her party. She got 2 families with 6 people in each, that's 12 people. Then she got 3 families with 4 people in each, that's 12 more people. So that's 12 + 12, that's 24 people.

But then some people got sick, 8 of 'em. And then some people had other stuff to do, that's 1/4 of 8, so that's 2 people. So that's 8 + 2, that's 10 people who ain't comin'.

So if 24 people were comin' and 10 people ain't comin', that means 24 - 10 people are comin'. That's 14 people.

"Solomon had 50 marbles. He got 20 more from Johanna. That's 50 + 20 = 70 marbles. 

His dad gave him some more, but not as many as Johanna. He gave him 2/5 of what Johanna gave. Johanna gave 20, so 2/5 of 20 is... um... 8. Yeah, 8 marbles from his dad.

So now Solomon got 70 + 8 = 78 marbles. Each marble is 2kgs, so I gotta multiply 78 by 2. That's... 156.

Then they got some other kids that ain't boys or girls, and they got 1/10 as many of them as they do boys. That's 1/10 of 30, which is 3.

So we add 'em all up, 30 boys, 90 girls, and 3 of them other kids. That's 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got a ratio of poles to wires, and it's 1 to 3. That means for every pole, we need 3 wires. Now, we know we need 45 wires, so we gotta divide that by 3 to find out how many poles we need.

45 wires / 3 wires per pole = 15 poles

So, we need 15 poles.

"So we gotta figger out how many women stayed at the party. 

First, we gotta know how many people were there in the first place. There were 25 men and 15 women, so that's 40 people.

Then, 1/4 of 'em left. That's like, 1 out of every 4 people. So, 1/4 of 40 is... um... 10 people left.

Now, we know 22 men stayed, so that means 3 men left. 'Cause 25 - 22 is 3.

So, if 10 people left and 3 of 'em were men, that means 7 women left. 'Cause 10 - 3 is 7.

And if 7 women left, that means 15 - 7 women stayed. That's... um... 8 women.

Now, we gotta figger out how many boxes we need. Let's see... if 3 boxes can hold 24 pencils (since 2 pencils are just lyin' around), that's 24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box.

So, we got 72 pencils and each box can hold 8 pencils. That's 72 / 8 = 9 boxes.

Okay, so she needs to cool it down 65 degrees. That's like, a lot. I think she needs 5 ice cubes for that. 'Cause 5 times 13 is 65, right? And each cube makes it 12 milliliters weaker, so that's 5 times 12, which is... um... 60 milliliters weaker.

And then she adds 15 milliliters of cream, which makes it even weaker. So, we gotta add that to the 60 milliliters. That's... 75 milliliters weaker.

"So we gotta figure out how much money the company pays all them programmers. 

First, we need to know how many programmers there are. We know there's 100 people workin' at the company, and 2/5 of 'em are junior programmers. That's like, 2 out of 5, so we can just multiply 100 by 2 and divide by 5. That's 40 junior programmers.

Now, if there's 100 people and 40 are junior programmers, that means there's 60 senior programmers.

Junior programmers make $2000 a month, and senior programmers make $400 more than that, so they make $2400.

Now we just gotta multiply the number of programmers by how much they make. 40 junior programmers make 40 x $2000, which is $80,000. And 60 senior programmers make 60 x $2400, which is $144,000.

Add 'em together, and we get $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

Job B pays 42,000 bucks a year, but then they take 6,000 bucks for property tax. So thats 42,000 minus 6,000, which is 36,000 bucks. Then they take 10% of that, which is 3,600 bucks. So Nick gets 36,000 minus 3,600, which is 32,400 bucks a year.

Then the price goes down 25% the next year. I think that means it goes down a quarter of 12, which is 3 bucks. So now each share is worth 12 - 3, which is 9 bucks. And she still got 8 of 'em, so that's 8 times 9, which is 72 bucks.

So, if we call the big groups ""x"", the small one's ""x minus 10"". We know we got 200 students total, so we can say: x + x + (x minus 10) = 200.

That's like sayin' 3x minus 10 = 200. Now, if we add 10 to both sides, we get 3x = 210. Then we divide by 3, and we get x = 70.

Now we know the big groups got 70 students each. The small one's 10 less, so it's 70 minus 10. That's 60.

I think I can do that math in my head. If I got some number, and I double it, that's like... three times that number. So, three times that number is 60. That means that number is... 20. Yeah, that's right.

So, he got 20 cows, and he got twice as many chickens, which is... 40 chickens. Now, let's count them legs. Cows got four legs, and chickens got two legs. So, we gotta do some more math.

We take 20 cows, and we multiply that by 4, 'cause they got four legs. That's... 80. Then we take 40 chickens, and we multiply that by 2, 'cause they got two legs. That's... 80 too. Then we add 'em together, and we get... 160.

Now, the yellow snake is 10 pounds heavier than the frog, so that's 50 + 10 = 60 pounds. And the red bird is 20 pounds lighter than the frog, so that's 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now we add all them up: 
Frog: 50
Beetle: 50
Toad: 50
Snake: 60
Bird: 30
Container: 20
That's 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds.

"I think I can figger this out. We got 40 tables with 4 legs, so that's a lotta legs. If I multiply 40 by 4, that's... um... 160 legs. Then we got 50 tables with 3 legs, so that's... 50 times 3... that's 150 legs. Now I just add 'em together... 160 plus 150... that's 310 legs.

"So Jenny buys a bag of cookies every week, right? And it's got 36 cookies in it. Now, her son gets 4 cookies in his lunch 5 days a week, that's 20 cookies. And her husband eats 1 cookie a day, that's 7 cookies. So, that's 20 + 7, that's 27 cookies they ate.

Now, if they ate 27 cookies, and there's 36 in the bag, that means Jenny gets the rest. So, 36 - 27, that's... um... 9 cookies. Yeah, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"Davos got 2 shirts, and each one cost 30 bucks. So that's 2 times 30, which is 60 bucks. Now, they gave him 40% off, which is like, a big discount. I think 40% of 60 is... um... 24 bucks. So he saved 24 bucks. Now, if he saved 24 bucks from 60, that means he paid... 60 minus 24, which is 36 bucks.

$36"
"So they used to make tractors and now they make silos. They used to sell 10 tractors a day for 100 bucks each, that's 1000 bucks a day. Now they sell 5 silos a day for 220 bucks each, that's 1100 bucks a day. They're makin' 100 bucks more a day now.

To figure out the percentage, I gotta think about it like this: 100 bucks more is how much more of the 1000 bucks they used to make? It's like, 100 is one-tenth of 1000, right? So that's 10 percent more.

The final answer is: 10"
"So Madeline gotta buy stuff for her dog every month. Food is 25 bucks a week. Thats 4 times a month, so thats 25 times 4, thats 100 bucks a month for food.

Treats is 20 bucks a month. Medicine is 100 bucks a month. So we add all that up, thats 100 for food, 20 for treats, and 100 for medicine. Thats 220 bucks a month.

Now we gotta figure out how much thats for a year. Theres 12 months in a year, so we multiply 220 by 12. Thats a lotta math, but I think its 2640.

"So Peyton's got a bunch of stuff planned after work. On Monday, she's doin' yoga for an hour. Then on Tuesday, she's takin' a cookin' class that's three times as long as the yoga, so that's 3 hours. Wednesday's just a half-hour thing with cheese, so that's like, 0.5 hours. Thursday's a museum tour, and that's half as long as the cookin' class, so that's 1.5 hours. And Friday's just 2 hours of runnin' errands.

So if we add all that up, it's 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2. That's a lotta numbers. Let me see... 1 + 3 is 4, then add 0.5, that's 4.5, then add 1.5, that's 6, and then add 2, that's... 8.

"So April's got a bunch of plant pots, right? She needs some for daisies and some for roses. The daisies need 30 pots, and the roses need twice that many. That's like, 60 pots for the roses. So, all together, that's 30 + 60, which is 90 pots.

Now, April already bought 100 pots. So, if she gives 'em 90, how many's she got left? That's like, 100 minus 90. I think that's 10.

10"
"Andrea had 36 bucks. She spent 11 on a sweater and gave her bro 4 bucks. So she spent 11 + 4, that's 15 bucks. Now, if I take 36 and subtract 15, I get 21. That's how much she saved.

21"
"Let's figger this out. John spent 6 hours on a boat, and half that time swimmin', so that's 3 hours swimmin'. That's 9 hours right there. Then he watched 3 shows, and each one was 2 hours long, so that's 6 more hours. That's 15 hours so far.

Now, it says that's 30% of the time he spent. I think that means if we take 15 and divide it by 0.3, we'll get the total time he spent. That's... um... 50 hours. Yeah, that's right.

Now, it says he spent 40% of his time sightseein'. So if we take 50 hours and multiply it by 0.4, we'll get the time he spent sightseein'. That's... um... 20 hours.

"Annabelle's got a phone she wants, and it's 400 bucks. She already got 80 bucks saved up. Now, she got two jobs. One job pays her 10 bucks an hour, and she worked 20 hours. That's 10 times 20, which is 200 bucks. 

Her other job pays her 5 bucks an hour, and she worked 15 hours. That's 5 times 15, which is 75 bucks. 

So, she got 80 bucks already, and she made 200 and 75 bucks from her jobs. That's 80 + 200 + 75, which is 355 bucks. 

The phone's 400 bucks, and she got 355 bucks. So, she needs 400 - 355, which is 45 bucks.

"So we gotta figure out how tall the tallest tree is. 

First, we know the shortest tree is 6 feet. The second tree is 5 feet taller than that, so that's 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Now we add the shortest and second tree together, that's 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice as tall as them two put together, so that's 2 x 17 = 34 feet.

"So Dean's mom gave him 28 bucks to go buy some toys. He got 6 toy cars and 5 teddy bears. Them cars cost 2 bucks each, so that's 6 x 2, that's 12 bucks. Them teddy bears cost 1 buck each, so that's 5 x 1, that's 5 bucks. So he spent 12 + 5, that's 17 bucks.

He had 28 bucks and spent 17, so he got 28 - 17, that's 11 bucks left. Then his mom gave him 10 more bucks, so now he got 11 + 10, that's 21 bucks.

$21"
"So Morgan's got 90 bucks for her birthday party. She wants her and her friends to play mini-golf, get some arcade tokens, and ride them go-karts twice. Mini-golf's 5 bucks a person, go-karts are 10 bucks a ride, and them arcade tokens are 5 bucks.

So, if you add it all up, it's 5 for mini-golf, 5 for tokens, and 20 for go-karts (cause they're ridin' twice). That's 30 bucks a person.

Now, if Morgan's got 90 bucks, and it's 30 bucks a person, you just divide 90 by 30. That's 3. But Morgan's one of 'em, so you gotta subtract 1. That leaves 2.

"Marisa gets 5 bucks a day from her folks. She spends a buck on lollipops, so she's left with 4 bucks. She does this for 5 days, so she's got 4 bucks times 5. That's 20 bucks.

"Let's figger this out. So Billy's got 10 bucks from his dad, and he's buyin' candy that's 1.5 bucks a pound. Then he's buyin' gumballs with the change. He buys 40 gumballs, and they're 5 cents each. That's 40 times 5 cents, which is... um... 2 bucks.

Now, if he spent half his change on gumballs, that means he had 4 bucks in change. 'Cause if half of it's 2 bucks, then the whole thing's 4 bucks. So he had 4 bucks in change.

He started with 10 bucks, so he musta spent 10 minus 4, which is 6 bucks on candy. And candy's 1.5 bucks a pound, so... um... 6 divided by 1.5 is... 4.

"I think I can figger this out. So Carver's 45, and that's 5 years less than twice his son's age. Let's say his son's age is some number, and we'll call that number ""x"". So twice his son's age would be 2x. And 5 years less than that would be 2x - 5. That's equal to Carver's age, which is 45.

So we got 2x - 5 = 45. Now, I'm gonna add 5 to both sides, 'cause that gets rid of the minus 5. That gives me 2x = 50. Then I'm gonna divide both sides by 2, 'cause that gets rid of the 2 that's multiplied by x. That gives me x = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"So the train goes from city 1 to city 2, that's 75 miles. Then it goes from city 2 to city 3, that's 100 miles. Now, to get back to city 1, it's 50 miles less than the first two trips put together. So that's 75 + 100 = 175, and 50 less than that is 125 miles.

So one whole trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles. The train does that 3 times a day, so that's 300 * 3 = 900 miles a day.

Now, the train needs service every 18,000 miles. So to figure out how many days it goes before it needs service, we gotta divide 18,000 by 900. That's... um... 20.

"So Mark's makin' dog beds. He needs 8 pounds of stuffin' for them big Rottweilers, and 2 pounds for them little chihuahuas. Now, them collies, they get the average, so that's like, halfway between 8 and 2. That's 5 pounds.

Now, Mark's gotta make 4 beds for chihuahuas, that's 4 times 2, that's 8 pounds. And he's gotta make 3 beds for collies, that's 3 times 5, that's 15 pounds.

So, to make all them beds, Mark needs 8 pounds plus 15 pounds, that's 23 pounds.

23"
"So John's drivin to his buddy's house, right? It's 200 miles away, but he gotta take a detour, so that's 10 more miles. That's 210 miles total. He's goin 70 miles per hour, so I gotta figure out how long that's gonna take. I think I can do that by dividin the miles by the speed. That's 210 miles divided by 70 miles per hour, which is... um... 3 hours.

Now, on the way back, he's takin a different route, and it's 240 miles. He's goin faster this time, 80 miles per hour. So I do the same thing, divide the miles by the speed. That's 240 miles divided by 80 miles per hour, which is... 3 hours.

So, he's drivin for 3 hours to get there, and 3 hours to get back. That's 6 hours total.

"Let's figger this out. We got 96 kids in the 4th grade. 43 of 'em are girls. So that means the rest are boys. That's 96 - 43, which is 53 boys. Now, on Friday, 4 of them boys didn't show up. So we gotta subtract 4 from 53. That's 53 - 4, which is 49.

49"
"So there's 6 girls in the park, right? And there's twice as many boys as girls. That means there's 2 times 6 boys, which is 12 boys. Now, if we add the girls and boys together, that's 6 + 12, which is 18. So there's 18 kids in the park.

18"
"So Jane needs 42 points to pass, right? She got 15 on the first test and 18 on the second. Let me see... 15 + 18 is 33. So she got 33 points so far. To get to 42, she needs... um... 42 minus 33 is... 9. Yeah, she needs 9 more points.

"So we gotta figger out how many people got kicked outta Walmart for other stuff. 

First, 3 people got kicked out for not wearin' masks. Then, some people got kicked out for shopliftin'. That's 4 times the number of people who didn't wear masks, minus 5. So that's 4 x 3 = 12, minus 5, which is 7.

Now, some people got kicked out for fightin' over stuff on sale. That's 3 times the number of shoplifters, which is 3 x 7 = 21.

So, we add up all them people: 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. That's how many people got kicked out for them reasons.

We know 50 people got kicked out in total. So, to find out how many got kicked out for other stuff, we subtract 31 from 50. That's 50 - 31 = 19.

"So Erin got 14 points and now she got 3 times more points than Sara. Sara got 8 points. So if Erin got 3 times more than Sara, that means Erin got 3 x 8 = 24 points now.

But we wanna know how many points Erin had before she got them 14 points. So we gotta take away 14 from 24. That's 24 - 14 = 10.

"Let's figger this out. We gotta buy picture frames for 44 seniors. Each frame costs 20 bucks. So that's 44 x 20, which is... um... *counts on fingers* ...$880.

Now, we gotta etch a logo on each frame, and that's gonna cost 20% more. I think that's like... *thinks for a moment* ...$176 more. So now we're at $880 + $176, which is... *counts on fingers again* ...$1056.

Two seniors are gettin' pins, and they're 5 bucks each. That's 2 x 5, which is... *easy one* ...$10.

Now, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, and they get cords. That's... *thinks for a moment* ...11 seniors. Each cord costs 12 bucks, so that's 11 x 12, which is... *counts on fingers* ...$132.

Addin' it all up, we got $1056 + $10 + $132, which is... *counts on fingers one more time* ...$1198.

"So they sold 14 pairs of shoes on Friday. That's a good start. Then on Saturday, they sold twice that many, so that's 2 times 14, which is 28. 

On Sunday, they sold half of what they sold on Saturday, so that's 28 divided by 2, which is 14. But then some people came back and said the shoes didn't fit, so they had to give 'em back. There were 6 pairs that got returned. So on Sunday, they really only sold 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up all the pairs they sold: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs. And since each pair has 2 shoes, that's 50 x 2 = 100 shoes.

"So the company bought a bunch of equipment for 400,000 bucks, but some of it was broken. They say 40% of it was broken. I think that means 40 out of 100 pieces were bad. 

So if 40% of the stuff was bad, that means they wasted 40% of the money. 40% of 400,000 is... um... 0.4 times 400,000. That's 160,000. 

So they wasted 160,000 bucks on broken stuff. That means they spent 400,000 minus 160,000 on the good stuff. That's 240,000.

So, half of 30 is 15. That's 15 sheep that give 1 kg each. That's 15 kg of milk. The other 15 sheep give 2 kg each. That's 15 x 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, I add 'em together. 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg. That's how much milk Mary gets every day.

"I think I can figger this out. So Karan borrows 3,650 bucks for 5 months, and she gotta pay 10% interest. That's like, a lotta money. 

First, I gotta find out how much interest she owes. I think I remember somethin' about interest bein' like, principal times rate times time. So, I gotta convert the time to years, 'cause that's what the rate is in. 5 months is like, almost half a year, so that's 5/12 of a year.

Now, I multiply 3,650 by 10% (that's 0.10) and then by 5/12. That's like, 3,650 times 0.10 times 0.4167. That's... um... *counts on fingers* ...152.08. So she owes 152.08 in interest.

Now I add that to the principal, that's 3,650 plus 152.08, that's 3,802.08. That's the total amount she owes.

Now, I divide that by 5, 'cause she's payin' it over 5 months. That's... *counts on fingers* ...760.42.

But she spent 18 bucks, so she's only got 36 - 18 bucks left. That's 18 bucks. Now, she sells 4 cups an hour, so she's gonna sell all 36 cups in... um... 36 / 4 is... 9 hours.

"So David and Dasha went to the carnival, right? They got 9 rides, and each ride costs 2 tickets. Them tickets cost 2 bucks each. So Dasha needs 18 tickets, and that's 18 x 2 bucks, which is 36 bucks.

Now, David, he got a ride bracelet for 30 bucks, and that lets him ride all 9 times.

Let's see... if she's got 6 + 4 + 2 gifts, that's 12 gifts. And she's got 144 inches of ribbon. If we take the ribbon and divide it by the number of gifts... that's like sharin' it equally among all the gifts. 

So, 144 divided by 12 is... 12. That's how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow.

"So we gotta figure out how many popsicles Sam got more than Betty. They got a ratio thingy, 5 to 6. That means for every 5 popsicles Betty got, Sam got 6. 

We know they got 165 popsicles together. So we gotta find out how many groups of 5 and 6 we can make with 165. 

Let's see... if we add 5 and 6, we get 11. So we gotta divide 165 by 11. That's like, um, 15. 

So now we know that for every group, Betty got 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles, and Sam got 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

Now, to find out how many more popsicles Sam got, we subtract Betty's popsicles from Sam's popsicles. That's 90 - 75 = 15.

So, Hulu and Disney Plus, that's 20 bucks, but he gets 20% off. That's like, uh, 4 bucks off, right? So now they're 16 bucks. Add that to the 10 bucks for Netflix, and he's payin' 26 bucks a month.

Then she gave some away, 24 to her friends at school and 5 to her family. That's 24 + 5 = 29 cards she gave away. So now she's got 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

But then she got some more, 17 from her family and friends. So now she's got 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

"So Jenny's got a pizza with 12 slices. She gives some to Bill and some to Mark. She gives Bill a third of it, which is like, 4 slices. And she gives Mark a quarter of it, which is like, 3 slices. 

Now, Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So we gotta subtract all them slices from the total. That's 4 for Bill, 3 for Mark, and 2 for Jenny. That's 9 slices gone. 

So we take 12 and subtract 9. That's 3 slices left.

"Mark's got 50 bucks in the bank. He wants a bike that's 300 bucks. So he needs 300 - 50 = 250 more bucks. He makes 10 bucks a day. If he makes 10 bucks a day, and he needs 250 bucks, that's a lotta days. I think it's... 250 divided by 10 is... 25. Yeah, that's right. He gotta save for 25 days.

"So Nancy saw a bunch of spiders, 90 of 'em. Then she saw some millipedes, but not as many as spiders. It's like, 1/3 of the spiders, so that's 30 millipedes. Now, stink bugs, they're a different story. There's twice as many stink bugs as millipedes, but then you gotta take away 12. So that's 2 times 30, which is 60, minus 12, which is 48 stink bugs.

So you add 'em all up, 90 spiders, 30 millipedes, and 48 stink bugs. That's a lotta bugs. 

168"
"So we gotta figger out how old Alice is compared to Erica. Erica's 30, and Beth's 5 years older than her, so Beth's 35. Then Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 35 + 7, that's 42.

Now we gotta find the difference between Alice and Erica. That's just 42 - 30, which is 12.

12"
"So John drank 2 glasses of milk, right? And each glass is 8 ounces. So that's 2 times 8, which is 16 ounces. Now, I know milk got 3 calories in each ounce. So if we multiply 16 by 3, that's... um... 48. Yeah, that's right. John had 48 calories.

"So the builder works 4 weeks a month, and each week he works 6 days. That's 24 days a month. Now, there's 12 months in a year, so he works 24 days a month * 12 months, that's 288 days a year. He gets 50 bucks a day, so if he works 288 days, that's 288 * 50. That's a lotta money. 

$14,400"
"So Mark's makin' a whole lotta brownies, quadruple batch and all that. He needs flour and milk, right? Normal recipe's 3 cups flour and 1 cup milk. Now, flour comes in 2-cup bags and milk comes in 2-cup bottles.

For flour, he's gonna need 3 cups times 4, that's 12 cups. And since it's 2 cups a bag, he's gonna need 6 bags. 

For milk, it's 1 cup times 4, that's 4 cups. And since it's 2 cups a bottle, he's gonna need 2 bottles.

Now, how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk? That's just 6 bags minus 2 bottles, that's 4.

"So Mel's got this air conditioner thingy that uses 900 watts of energy every hour. He uses it for 8 hours a day, so that's a lot of energy. Now, if he uses it 5 hours less, that's 3 hours a day. 

So, the energy he uses now is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watts. And before, it was 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watts. 

The difference is 7200 - 2700 = 4500 watts. But we need to turn that into kilowatts, so we divide by 1000. That's 4.5 kilowatts. 

Now, we need to figure out how much energy he saves in 30 days. So, we multiply 4.5 kilowatts by 30. That's 135 kilowatts.

135"
"So we gotta count the stripes on them zebras. Two of 'em got 17 stripes each, that's 34 stripes. Then there's one with 36 stripes. And another one with half that many, so that's 18 stripes. 

Now, let's add 'em all up: 34 + 36 + 18, that's 88 stripes. There's 4 zebras, so we gotta divide 88 by 4. That's... um... 22.

22"
"So Tyson's makin' them muffaletta sandwiches for the big game. He's got 20 people comin' over, and each sandwich feeds 4. So he's gonna need 5 sandwiches, right? 

Now, each sandwich needs a pound of meat and a pound of cheese. So that's 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese. 

Meat's $7 a pound, so that's 5 x $7, which is $35. Cheese is $3 a pound, so that's 5 x $3, which is $15.

Add 'em together, and you get $35 + $15, which is $50.

"Let's figger this out. So Allan got a bunch of cannolis and corn at his house. He got twice as much corn as cannolis, and he got 40 cannolis. That means he got 2 times 40, which is 80 corns.

Then he went to the store and got 60 more cannolis. Now he got 40 + 60, that's 100 cannolis.

He also got some more corn, but 40 less than the cannolis. So he got 100 - 40, that's 60 corns.

Now he got 80 corns at home, and he got 60 more, that's 140 corns.

So he got 140 corns and 100 cannolis. That's a lotta food. Let's add 'em up. 140 + 100 is... 240.

"Elliott's tryin' to walk 10,000 steps a day. He did half of 'em goin' to and from school, so that's 5,000 steps. Then he did another 1,000 with his friend, so that's 6,000 steps so far.

Now, after he went for a jog, he only had 2,000 steps left. That means he did 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps before he was done. But we already know he did 6,000 steps before the jog. So, to figure out how many steps he did on the jog, we gotta subtract 6,000 from 8,000.

8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000

2,000"
"So Toby's got a book that's 45 pages long, and each page has 200 words. That's a lotta words. Let's see... 45 pages times 200 words per page is... um... *counts on fingers* ...9000 words.

Now, Toby can read 300 words per minute, so to figure out how long it'll take him to read the book, we gotta divide 9000 by 300. *thinks for a moment* That's... 30 minutes.

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so we add that to the time it takes to read the book. That's 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.

Toby's gotta leave in 60 minutes, so if it's gonna take him 40 minutes to read the book and get to the airport, that means he's gonna be... *counts on fingers again* ...20 minutes early.

"So we gotta figger out how much money the delivery company paid its employees in May and June. 

First, in May, they hired 40 people. Each person gets 15 bucks an hour and works 40 hours a week. That's 15 times 40, which is 600 bucks a week. There's about 4 weeks in a month, so that's 600 times 4, which is 2400 bucks a month for each person. Now, we gotta multiply that by 40 people, so that's 2400 times 40, which is 96000 bucks for all of 'em in May.

Now, in June, a quarter of the people's contracts ran out. That means 1/4 of 40 people, which is 10 people, left. So we got 40 minus 10, which is 30 people left. Each person still gets 600 bucks a week, and that's 2400 bucks a month. Now, we multiply that by 30 people, so that's 2400 times 30, which is 72000 bucks for all of 'em in June.

Now, we add the money from May and June, which is 96000 plus 72000, and that's 168000 bucks.

"Sally got 10 bucks from her folks. She went to the trinket shop and got some taffy. It was 3 bucks for one pound, and the second pound was half off. So the second pound was 1.50. That's 3 plus 1.50, so that's 4.50 for the taffy.

She also got some seashells for 1.50. And she got 4 magnets for a quarter each. That's 4 times a quarter, so that's a dollar.

So she spent 4.50 for the taffy, 1.50 for the seashells, and a dollar for the magnets. That's 4.50 plus 1.50 plus 1, that's 7.

She started with 10 bucks, so she got 10 minus 7, that's 3 bucks left.

"So Tim buys two packs of fireworks. One's $400, and the other's twice that, so that's $800. That's a total of $1200 for them two packs.

Now, he gets 20% off, so I gotta figger out what 20% of $1200 is. That's like, 20 hundredths of $1200, right? So that's 0.20 * $1200, which is $240.

So now, I subtract that from $1200, and I get $960. That's what he paid for them two packs.

Then he buys this other firework for $150. So I add that to $960, and I get $1110.

$1110"
"Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, and she wants 'em to last 30 days. So, we gotta figure out how many cookies she needs. 2 cookies a night, times 30 nights, that's 60 cookies.

Now, her recipe makes a dozen cookies, and a dozen is 12. So, we gotta divide 60 cookies by 12 cookies. That's like, 5 groups of 12 cookies.

"So Marcy makes candles, right? And 99% of 'em won't blow up. That means 1% will. So if she makes 50,000 candles, 1% of 'em will blow up. That's 500 candles.

Now, out of them 500 candles that'll blow up, 5% of 'em will smell like a wet dog. That's a pretty weird smell for a candle, if you ask me. So, 5% of 500 is... um... 25.

"So Misha's gettin' 4 blouses that's 30% off. That's like, a pretty good deal. Each blouse is $20, so I gotta figure out how much 30% of that is. Um, I think that's like, 6 bucks. Yeah, 30% of 20 is 6. 

So now I gotta subtract that from the price of the blouse. That's 20 minus 6, which is 14. Now I gotta multiply that by 4, 'cause Misha's gettin' 4 blouses. That's 14 times 4, which is... 56.

"So Joanne and her sister are pickin' apples. Joanne gets 30 from the tall trees and half that from the short ones, which is 15. Now, I don't know how many she gets from the middle trees, so I'll just call that number ""x"".

Her sister gets twice as many from the tall trees, so that's 60. And she gets 3 times as many from the short trees, which is 45. She don't get none from the middle trees.

Together, they got 500 apples. So if I add up all the apples, I get: 30 + 15 + x (that's Joanne's) and 60 + 45 (that's her sister's). That's a total of 150 + x.

Now, I know they got 500 apples, so I can say: 150 + x = 500. If I subtract 150 from both sides, I get x = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"I think I can figger this out. We got 180 heads, and that's the same as the number of animals, right? And we got 304 humps. Camels got 2 humps, and dromedaries got 1 hump.

Let's say we got x camels and y dromedaries. Then we can say x + y = 180, 'cause that's the total number of animals.

Now, let's talk about the humps. Camels got 2 humps each, so that's 2x humps. Dromedaries got 1 hump each, so that's y humps. We know we got 304 humps in total, so we can say 2x + y = 304.

Now, I'm thinkin', if we take the first equation, x + y = 180, and we subtract it from the second equation, 2x + y = 304, we get x = 124. That's the number of camels.

Now, if we plug x = 124 into the first equation, x + y = 180, we get 124 + y = 180. So, y = 56.

"Tom went on a trip, right? He traveled 200 kilometers a day for 4 days. That's 200 times 4, which is 800 kilometers. Then he went 30% of that for 2 days. I think 30% is like, a third, but not quite. So it's like 240 kilometers for those 2 days. Then he didn't go anywhere the next day. 

The next week, he went 300 kilometers a day for 7 days. That's 300 times 7, which is 2100 kilometers. Now, let's add it all up: 800 kilometers, plus 240 kilometers, plus 2100 kilometers. That's a lot of kilometers. 

I think it's 3140 kilometers."
"So we gotta figure out how big Timothy's locker is. We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, and it's 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. That means Zack's locker is 4 times bigger than Peter's. So we multiply 5 by 4, and that's 20 cubic inches for Zack's locker.

Now, Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's. So if we multiply Zack's locker by 2, we get Timothy's locker size. That's 20 times 2, which is 40 cubic inches.

"So Stanley was standin' up high on the mountain, right? He was at 10,000 feet. Then the wind blew his comb away and it fell 4,000 feet. So now the comb's at 10,000 minus 4,000, which is 6,000 feet.

Now Oliver's down at 3,000 feet and he needs to get to the comb. So he gotta climb from 3,000 to 6,000. That's 6,000 minus 3,000, which is 3,000 feet.

"So Mr. Josue got some money from two banks. One bank gave him 4000 bucks. The other bank gave him twice that, so that's 8000 bucks. 

Now, add those two amounts together, that's 4000 + 8000, which is 12000. 

He already had 5000 bucks, so now he's got 12000 + 5000, which is 17000.

"So we got 50 cats on a rock, right? Then 4 boats come and take 5 cats each. That's 4 x 5, which is 20 cats gone. So we got 50 - 20 left, which is 30 cats.

Now, 3/5 of them cats run after a mouse. I think that's like, 3 out of every 5 cats. So if we got 30 cats, we gotta find out how many is 3/5 of that. Um, I think it's like, 3 groups of 6, 'cause 3 x 6 is 18. So 18 cats run after the mouse.

That means we got 30 - 18 cats left, which is... 12.

"So Bill's gettin' this streamin' thingy, right? He gets a deal for the first 6 months, it's 8 bucks a month. That's 6 times 8, that's 48 bucks.

Then it goes up to 12 bucks a month for 8 months. That's 8 times 12, that's 96 bucks.

Now, he's got 24 months in a year, and he's payin' for 2 years, so that's 24 times 2, that's 48 months. He already paid for 6 + 8, that's 14 months. So he's got 48 - 14, that's 34 months left. But we already know 8 of those months are 12 bucks, so we gotta figure out the rest. That's 34 - 8, that's 26 months, but we know 10 of those months are at 14 bucks a month, not 26. So we gotta do 24 - 6 - 8, that's 10 months at 14 bucks. That's 10 times 14, that's 140 bucks.

So we add it all up, 48 + 96 + 140, that's 284 bucks.

284"
"I think I can figger this out. So Cole bought two kinds of jeans, tattered and jogger. The tattered ones cost 28 bucks. The jogger ones cost 6 bucks less, so that's 28 - 6 = 22 bucks.

Now, Cole saved 6 bucks total. He saved 1/3 of that from the jogger jeans, which is 2 bucks. That means he saved 6 - 2 = 4 bucks from the tattered jeans.

So the jogger jeans originally cost 22 + 2 = 24 bucks. And the tattered jeans originally cost 28 + 4 = 32 bucks.

Now, I gotta figger out how much more the jogger jeans cost than the tattered jeans. But wait, the jogger jeans cost less! So I gotta say the jogger jeans cost 32 - 24 = 8 bucks less than the tattered jeans. But since the question asks how much more, I gotta say the jogger jeans cost 8 bucks less, which is like sayin' they cost -8 bucks more.

"So we gotta figger out how many people can go on this trip. We got 4 big buses, and they can hold 60 people each. That's a lotta people. Then we got 6 smaller buses, and they can hold 30 people each. And we got 10 tiny vans, and they can hold 15 people each.

So, let's count 'em up. The big buses can hold 4 x 60, that's 240 people. The smaller buses can hold 6 x 30, that's 180 people. And the tiny vans can hold 10 x 15, that's 150 people.

"Lillian made 3 bird feeders and bought 3 more. So she got 6 bird feeders in total. Now, the ones she made herself, they get 10 more birds than the ones she bought. So the ones she made get 30 birds each and the ones she bought get 20 birds each.

The ones she made get 30 birds each, and there's 3 of 'em, so that's 3 x 30 = 90 birds. The ones she bought get 20 birds each, and there's 3 of 'em, so that's 3 x 20 = 60 birds.

So, if we add 'em all up, we get 90 + 60 = 150 birds. That's how many birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden.

"Aleksandra went to a restaurant and got some stuff. She got a bagel, that's 4 bucks. The soup is more, it's like 25% more. I think that's like a quarter more, so that's a dollar more, so the soup is 5 bucks. The cake is half of the bagel, so that's 2 bucks.

So, I add it all up, 4 for the bagel, 5 for the soup, and 2 for the cake. That's 11 bucks.

"Kenny's got a bunch of Pokémon cards and he's sellin' 'em to go to the amusement park. He's gonna use the money to buy a ticket for $100 and have $50 left over for snacks and stuff. He's sellin' each card for $1.5 and he's keepin' 1/3 of 'em.

So, he made $150 from sellin' his cards, 'cause that's the ticket price plus the $50 he's got left. Now, if he's sellin' each card for $1.5, we can figure out how many he sold by dividin' $150 by $1.5. That's 100 cards.

But that's not all the cards he had, 'cause he kept some. He kept 1/3 of 'em, so the 100 cards he sold is 2/3 of the total. Let's say he had x cards to start with. Then, 2/3 of x is 100. We can figure out x by multiplyin' 100 by 3 and then dividin' by 2. That's 150.

"So the caterer made food for 36 people, but some of 'em could have two hotdogs. That's 18 people with two hotdogs and 18 people with one hotdog. So that's 18 x 2 = 36 hotdogs for the first group, and 18 hotdogs for the second group. That's a total of 54 hotdogs.

But then 40 people showed up, and they all wanted two hotdogs. That's 40 x 2 = 80 hotdogs. We don't got that many, we only got 54. So we're short 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

That means 26 people didn't get a second hotdog.

Now the clerk says everythin's 20% off. I think that means we gotta take 20% of 165 bucks off. Um, that's like... 20% is the same as 0.20, so we multiply 165 by 0.20. That's... uh... 33 bucks. So we take 33 bucks off 165 bucks, and that's... 132 bucks.

Now, Josey needs a quarter of one of them containers. That's like needin' a quarter of a pizza. If you got a pizza cut into 4 slices, you'd need 1 slice. So Josey needs 1/4 of 3 gallons, which is like 3/4 of a gallon. That's 0.75 gallons.

Now we gotta turn that into pints. I think I remember my buddy tellin' me that 1 gallon is like 8 pints. So we multiply 0.75 by 8, and that's 6.

"George spent 5 bucks and got 3 bags of chips. He had a little bit of money left, like 1%. So he spent 99% of 5 bucks. That's like, almost 5 bucks. 

He spent 40 cents on each bag of chips, so that's 3 x 40 = 120 cents. Now, we gotta figure out how much he spent in total. 99% of 5 bucks is like, 4.95 bucks. That's 495 cents.

Now, we subtract the money he spent on chips, 120 cents, from the total, 495 cents. That's 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Candy bars cost 75 cents. So, we divide 375 cents by 75 cents. That's 375 / 75 = 5.

George bought 5 candy bars.

"So Antoine's makin' this french onion soup and it needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to use double that, so that's 4 pounds. Onions are 2 bucks a pound, so that's 4 x 2 = 8 bucks for the onions.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and they're 2 bucks a box, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 bucks for the stock.

So all together, that's 8 + 4 = 12 bucks for the stuff he needs.

"So we gotta figure out the perimeter of Billie's room. First, we need to know how long and wide it is. We know it's 3 yards long, but we need that in feet. I think there's 3 feet in a yard, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 feet.

Now we know the area is 360 square feet. I think that means if you multiply the length and width, you get the area. So if we divide the area by the length, we get the width. That's 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now we got the length and width, we can figure out the perimeter. I think you gotta add the length and width, then multiply by 2. That's 9 + 40 = 49, then 49 x 2 = 98.

"So we gotta figger out how many more beads one sister got than the other. 

Elizabeth got 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. That's 3 packs. Margareth got 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. That's 7 packs.

Each pack got 20 beads in it. So Elizabeth got 3 packs * 20 beads, that's 60 beads. Margareth got 7 packs * 20 beads, that's 140 beads.

Now we gotta see who got more beads. Margareth got 140 beads and Elizabeth got 60 beads. So we subtract 60 from 140. That's 80.

"So Marcus wakes up and his house is 40 degrees. He bakes for 3 hours and that makes the house hotter. Every hour it gets 5 degrees hotter. So that's 3 hours times 5 degrees, that's 15 degrees hotter. Now the house is 40 + 15, that's 55 degrees.

Then he opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees every 10 minutes. So 30 minutes is like, 3 times 10 minutes. So the house cools down 2 degrees 3 times, that's 6 degrees. Now the house is 55 - 6, that's 49 degrees.

"Let's figger this out. Jon did a triathlon, and it took him 40 minutes to swim, 80 minutes to bike, and 50 minutes to run. That's a total of 170 minutes.

Now, James did the swim 10% faster than Jon. That's like, um, 4 minutes less. So James swam in 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James biked 5 minutes longer than Jon, so that's 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 170 + 10 = 180 minutes total.

Now, let's see how long James took to run. We know he swam for 36 minutes and biked for 85 minutes. That's 36 + 85 = 121 minutes. So, he ran for 180 - 121 = 59 minutes.

"I think I can figger this out. So, Movie C is 1.25 hours long. I gotta turn that into minutes. I know there's 60 minutes in an hour, so I'll just multiply it by 60. That's 1.25 x 60, which is... um... 75 minutes.

Now, Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so that's 75 + 5, which is 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth as long as Movie B. I think that means I gotta divide 80 by 4. That's... 20 minutes.

"So we gotta figger out how much hay the horse eats. It runs fer 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. Thats a lotta miles. I think we gotta turn them minutes into hours. Theres 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is half an hour.

Now we multiply 32 miles per hour by half an hour, thats 16 miles. My buddy told me that's how you do it.

The horse eats half a bail of hay per mile, so thats 16 miles times half a bail, thats 8 bails of hay.

Them bails cost 3 bucks each, so thats 8 times 3, thats 24 bucks.

Michael's got 6 five-dollar bills, thats 30 bucks. He spends 24 bucks on hay, so he's got 30 minus 24 left.

"Rozanne got a bunch of eggs, 4 dozen from cases and 2 loose ones. That's a lotta eggs. Now, 4 dozen is like 4 times 12, so that's 48 eggs. Addin' them 2 loose ones, she got 50 eggs.

Now, she's puttin' out trays with 5 glasses on each, and each glass needs 5 eggs. So, each tray needs 5 times 5, that's 25 eggs.

Now, if she got 50 eggs and each tray needs 25, how many trays can she put out? That's like, 50 divided by 25, right? That's 2.

"Joey had 214 points, then he got 26 more. So now he got 214 + 26 = 240 points. Marcy had 225 points, then she got 10 more. So now she got 225 + 10 = 235 points. 

Joey's got more points than Marcy, so he's winnin'. To figger out by how many points, I subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points. That's 240 - 235 = 5.

"So the salesman bought 48 sneakers for 576 bucks. He sold 17 of 'em for 20 bucks each on Monday, that's 17 x 20 = 340 bucks. Then he sold the rest, which is 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers, for 25 bucks each. That's 31 x 25 = 775 bucks. 

So he made 340 + 775 = 1115 bucks in total. Now, he spent 576 bucks on the sneakers, so his profit is 1115 - 576 = 539 bucks.

"So Beatrice got 10 packs of crayons. 6 of 'em had 8 colors each, and the other 4 had 16 colors each. I'm gonna count 'em up. 

First, I'll count the 6 packs with 8 colors. That's 6 x 8, which is... um... 48 colors.

Now, I'll count the 4 packs with 16 colors. That's 4 x 16, which is... 64 colors.

So, I'll add 'em together. 48 + 64 is... 112.

"I think I can figger this out. So, if I buy the super ticket, it's 20 bucks, and I get a popcorn and soda for a buck more. That's 21 bucks total. 

Now, if I don't get the super ticket, I save 2 bucks, so that means I only pay 19 bucks. The ticket is 12 bucks, and the soda is 3 bucks, so that's 15 bucks so far. 

To find out how much the popcorn costs, I gotta subtract 15 from 19. That's... um... 4 bucks.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got 20 balloons that cost 900 bucks to fill up. That's a lotta money. Now, I gotta find out how much it cost to fill one balloon. I think I can do that by dividin' 900 by 20. That's... um... 45 bucks per balloon.

Now, the price went up by 20 bucks, so it's 45 + 20, that's 65 bucks per balloon. I think I got that right.

Now, I gotta find out how much it cost to fill 170 balloons at the new price. That's a lotta balloons. I'm gonna multiply 170 by 65... that's... um... 11,050 bucks.

"I think I can figger this out. So the car's goin' 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, that's like 120 miles. Then it's goin' 30 miles per hour for 1 hour, that's 30 miles. So it went a total of 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

It took 2 hours to go the first part, and 1 hour to go the second part, so that's 3 hours total.

Now, I think the average speed is like, how far you went divided by how long it took. So that's 150 miles divided by 3 hours. That's... um... 50.

"Jenna got 8 sapphires at first. She gave 3 away to get 2 rubies. Now she got 5 sapphires left. Sapphires is worth 800 bucks each, so 5 of 'em is 5 x 800, that's 4000 bucks. Rubies is worth 1200 bucks each, so 2 of 'em is 2 x 1200, that's 2400 bucks. Add 'em together, that's 4000 + 2400, that's 6400 bucks.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So Bob's got them raised beds, and they're all 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. That's a lotta dirt he's gonna need. 

First, I gotta figger out how much dirt one bed holds. It's like a box, so I multiply the width, length, and height. That's 2 x 8 x 2, which is 32 cubic feet. Now, he's got 10 of 'em, so I multiply 32 by 10, and that's 320 cubic feet.

Now, them bags of dirt, they hold 2 cubic feet each. So I divide 320 by 2, and that's 160 bags. 

Each bag costs 12 bucks, so I multiply 160 by 12, and that's... a lotta money! It's 1920 bucks.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got 15 red cards, and then we got some green cards. It says we got 60% more green cards than red cards. I think that means we gotta add 60% of 15 to 15. Um, 60% of 15 is like... 9, I think. So we got 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Now, it says we got as many yellow cards as red and green cards put together. So that's 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

So, if we add 'em all up, we got 15 red cards, 24 green cards, and 39 yellow cards. That's... 15 + 24 + 39 = 78.

"So we gotta figure out how many puppies got spots. Jennifer's dog had 8 puppies, and 3 of 'em got spots. Brandon's dog had 12 puppies, and 4 of 'em got spots. 

So, if we add up all the puppies, that's 8 + 12, which is 20 puppies. And if we add up all the puppies with spots, that's 3 + 4, which is 7 puppies with spots.

Now, to figure out what percent of the puppies got spots, we gotta divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies, and then multiply by 100. That's like, 7 divided by 20, which is 0.35, and then we multiply by 100, which is 35.

"Let's figger this out. The farmer's got a bunch of stuff to haul. He's got 2 little boxes of sugar cubes, and they weigh 1 pound each, so that's 2 pounds. He's also got 4 bags of carrots, and they weigh 12 pounds each, so that's 48 pounds. Then he's got a whole lotta hay - 42 big bales, and they weigh 75 pounds each. That's a lot, so let's see... 42 x 75 is... um... 3150 pounds. And he's also got 20 sacks of oats, and they weigh 65 pounds each, so that's... uh... 20 x 65 is... 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add all that up. 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 is... 4500 pounds. That's a whole lotta feed.

The farmer's truck can only carry 2250 pounds at a time, so we gotta figger out how many trips he needs to make. Let's see... 4500 divided by 2250 is... 2. But that's not right, 'cause 2 times 2250 is only 4500, and that's exactly how much feed he's got. He can do it in 2 trips.

"Grayson gets money from cans and bottles. She gets 2 cents for a can and 3 cents for a bottle. She drinks 3 cans and 5 bottles a week. 

So, for cans, she gets 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents a week. For 4 weeks, that's 6 cents * 4 = 24 cents.

For bottles, she gets 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents a week. For 4 weeks, that's 15 cents * 4 = 60 cents.

She also got 5 boxes of baseball cards, and each box got 40 cards. That's a lot of baseball cards too. So, 5 boxes times 40 cards is... um... 200 cards.

Now, we add 'em together. 150 basketball cards plus 200 baseball cards is 350 cards. But Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so she gives the rest to her students. That's 350 cards minus 50 cards, which is 300 cards.

Her students each get 10 cards, so we gotta figure out how many students she got. We do that by dividin' the number of cards by the number of cards each student gets. So, 300 cards divided by 10 cards per student is... um... 30 students.

Then, after a couple months, they used up 1/5 of 'em. That's like, if you had 5 pencils, you'd use 1. So, 1/5 of 300 is... um... 60 pencils.

Now we gotta subtract them used pencils from the total. So, 300 minus 60 is 240 pencils left.

But we ain't done yet. By the end of the year, they only got 1/3 of them pencils left. That's like, if you had 3 pencils, you'd only have 1 left. So, 1/3 of 240 is... um... 80 pencils.

Now, we got 2 remoras, and they're each 6 inches long. So that's 2 x 6 = 12 inches for both of 'em.

Now we gotta figger out what percent 12 inches is of 120 inches. I think I remember somethin' about percentages... uh... yeah! You divide the little number by the big number, and then multiply by 100. So that's (12 / 120) x 100 = 10%.

"So Jaime got 64 eggs and 2 trays. Each tray can hold 24 eggs. I think we gotta figure out how many eggs them trays can hold first. If one tray can hold 24 eggs, then 2 trays can hold... um... 2 times 24, that's 48 eggs.

Now, Jaime got 64 eggs, but them trays can only hold 48. So, we gotta subtract 48 from 64. That's... uh... 16. Yeah, 16 eggs won't fit on them trays.

"Sally got a small pizza for 8 bucks. The big one cost 3 times that. So the big one is 3 x 8, that's 24 bucks. Now add the small one, 8 bucks, to the big one, 24 bucks. That's 32 bucks.

$32"
"So Heather's buyin' them razors, and they come 4 to a pack. They cost 4 bucks a pack, but they're on sale, buy one get one free. She's also got a 2 buck coupon. 

She's buyin' 2 packs, but she's only payin' for one 'cause of the sale. So that's 4 bucks. Then she's got that coupon, so she's only payin' 2 bucks.

Now, she's got 2 packs, and each pack's got 4 razors, so that's 8 razors. She's payin' 2 bucks for 'em. So, to figger out how much each razor costs, I'ma divide 2 by 8. That's 0.25. That's 25 cents.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got 9 cheerleaders that's 64 inches tall, and 1 that's 60 inches tall. They're makin' a pyramid, so we gotta stack 'em up. 

The bottom's got 4 girls, so that's 4 x 64 = 256 inches. The next level's got 3 girls, so that's 3 x 64 = 192 inches. The next level's got 2 girls, so that's 2 x 64 = 128 inches. And the little one on top is 60 inches.

Now, add all them inches up: 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches. But we need feet, so we gotta divide by 12, 'cause that's how many inches in a foot. So, 636 / 12 = 53 feet.

"Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour, and she works 8 hours a day. That's 5 minutes times 8 hours, so that's 40 minutes a day. 

Now, she does that for 5 days, so that's 40 minutes times 5 days. That's a lotta minutes. I think it's 200 minutes.

"So Brett's 14, right? And in 4 years, his sister Angela's gonna be 3 times as old as Brett is now. That's a lot of years. 

Okay, so if Brett's 14 now, 3 times that's 42. That's how old Angela's gonna be in 4 years. But we wanna know how old she is now. So we gotta take 4 years off that. 

42 - 4 is 38. That's how old Angela is now.

38"
"So Paul's drivin his car twice a day, mornin and afternoon, for 14 days. Mornin rides cost 6 bucks, and afternoon rides cost 2 bucks. 

Let's see... 14 days, 2 rides a day, that's 28 rides. But we gotta split 'em up. Mornin rides, 14 days, that's 14 rides, and they cost 6 bucks each. That's 14 x 6, that's... uh... 84 bucks. Afternoon rides, same thing, 14 rides, but they only cost 2 bucks each. That's 14 x 2, that's... 28 bucks.

So we add 'em together, 84 and 28, that's... 112 bucks.

112"
"So Ashley got 5 boxes of oranges, and each box got 10 oranges in it. That's a lotta oranges. So if we count 'em all, that's 5 x 10, which is 50 oranges.

Now Brianne, she brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. So we gotta add 20 to Ashley's 50 oranges. That's 70 oranges for Brianne.

So we put 'em all together, and we got 50 + 70 oranges. That's 120 oranges.

Now we need 3 oranges to make one of them greek orange pies. So we take 120 oranges and divide by 3. That's... um... 40.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got two places to have a party. One place costs 200 bucks no matter how many people come, but you gotta buy food for each person, and that's 5 bucks a head. The other place costs 25 bucks a person, and that includes the food.

So, if we say x is the number of people, then the first place costs 200 plus 5 times x. The second place costs 25 times x. We want 'em to be equal, so we set 'em equal to each other.

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, I'm gonna try to get x by itself. I'll subtract 5x from both sides.

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x

Now, I'll divide both sides by 20.

x = 200 / 20
x = 10

"Let's figger this out. We know Lily, David, and Bodhi got 43 bugs together. We also know Lily got 7 more than David. And David got half of what Bodhi got.

So, if David got half of what Bodhi got, that means Bodhi got twice as many as David. Let's say David got x bugs. Then Bodhi got 2x bugs. And Lily got x + 7 bugs.

We know they got 43 bugs together, so we can add 'em up: x + 2x + x + 7 = 43. That's 4x + 7 = 43.

Now, let's get rid of the 7. We can do that by subtractin' 7 from both sides: 4x = 36.

Now, we need to find x. We can do that by dividin' both sides by 4: x = 9.

So David got 9 bugs. And Lily got 9 + 7 bugs. That's 16 bugs.

Wait, that can't be right. Let's try again. If David got 18 bugs, then Bodhi got 36 bugs. And Lily got 18 + 7 bugs. That's 25 bugs.

And 18 + 36 + 25 is 79. That's too many. But if David got 18 bugs, and Bodhi got 36 bugs, that's 54 bugs. And if they got 43 bugs together, that means Lily got 43 - 54... no, that can't be right.

Let me try again. If David got 18 bugs, and Bodhi got 36 bugs, that's 54 bugs. But they only got 43 bugs together. So, if David got 18 bugs, and they got 43 bugs together, that means Bodhi got 43 - 18... that's 25. And Bodhi got twice as many as David, so David got half of 25... no, that's not right.

Let me think about this some more. If Bodhi got 36 bugs, and David got half of that, then David got 18 bugs. And if Lily got 7 more than David, then Lily got 25 bugs.

"I think I can figger this out. So Mariah used a quarter of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used half a skein. There's 364 yards in a whole skein. 

So Mariah used a quarter of 364, that's like... 364 divided by 4, that's 91 yards. And her grandma used half, that's like... 364 divided by 2, that's 182 yards.

Now, I gotta add 'em together. 91 yards plus 182 yards is... 273 yards.

"Cherrie's got 5 friends, right? 2 of 'em want 5 gifts, so that's 2 x 5, that's 10. The other 3 want 2 gifts, so that's 3 x 2, that's 6. So that's 10 + 6, that's 16 gifts for her friends.

Then she goes and buys 10 more, just 'cause. So we add 'em up, 16 + 10, that's 26.

"So we gotta figger out how long the couch is. First, we gotta know how wide the rug is. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide. So the rug is 3 + 5, that's 8 feet wide.

Now, the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the rug's width. Twice the rug's width is 8 x 2, that's 16 feet. Then we add 2 feet to that, so it's 16 + 2, that's 18 feet.

"Let's figger this out. Suzie got 4 packs of gum. Two of 'em is strawberry, one's grape, and one's green apple. She paid 2 bucks for the grape one. The green apple one's half that, so that's a buck. That's 3 bucks for them two.

She paid 7 bucks total, so the two strawberry ones musta cost 7 - 3 = 4 bucks. That's 4 bucks for two packs, so each pack's 4 / 2 = 2 bucks.

"I think I can figger this out. Frederick's got 24 bucks to spend on wood for his popsicle sticks. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood, but that costs 4 bucks. Or he can get 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood, but that costs 6 bucks.

I reckon we should see which one gives him the most sticks for his money. If he buys a 2 x 4, he gets 200 sticks for 4 bucks. That's like 50 sticks per buck. If he buys a 2 x 8, he gets 400 sticks for 6 bucks. That's like... um... 66 and some sticks per buck.

So, the 2 x 8 is the better deal. Now, let's see how many of them he can buy with 24 bucks. That's 24 divided by 6, which is... 4. He can buy 4 of 'em.

If he gets 400 sticks from each one, and he buys 4 of 'em, that's... 4 times 400... 1600 sticks!

The final answer is: 1600"
"So Mario's got 6 dogs, and they all need snowshoes. Each dog's got 4 legs, and snowshoes come in pairs, so that's 2 pairs per dog. That's 6 dogs * 2 pairs, so that's 12 pairs of snowshoes.

Now, each pair costs 12 bucks, so we gotta multiply 12 pairs by 12 bucks. That's a lotta math, but I think I got it... 12 * 12 is... 144.

$144"
"So Janet's takin' two bus trips, five days a week. That's a lotta bus rides. Each one costs her $2.20. I gotta figure out how much she'd save if she got a weekly pass for $20.

Okay, so she's takin' 2 trips a day, 5 days a week. That's 10 trips a week. Each one's $2.20, so that's 10 x $2.20. Um... that's $22.00.

Now, if she gets the weekly pass, it's $20. So, if she saves money, it's the difference between $22.00 and $20.00. That's... $2.00.

$2.00"
"Let's figger this out. The farm got 30 cows, and the zoo got 20 sheep. Now, the zoo got twice as many cows as the farm, so that's 2 times 30, which is 60 cows. The farm got half as many sheep as the zoo, so that's 20 divided by 2, which is 10 sheep.

So the farm got 30 cows and 10 sheep, that's 40 animals. The zoo got 60 cows and 20 sheep, that's 80 animals. If we add 'em all up, we get 40 + 80, which is 120.

"I think I can figger this out. So Rose got 4 times as many onions and potatoes as Sophia. Rose got 12 onions, so if I divide that by 4, that's 3 onions for Sophia. And Rose got 4 potatoes, so if I divide that by 4, that's 1 potato for Sophia.

So Sophia got 3 onions and 1 potato. That's 4 things in total.

Now, Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, and he wants to lose 30 pounds. So, he needs to burn 30 x 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we divide 105,000 by 201. That's... um... 105,000 ÷ 201 = 522.

The final answer is: 522"

Let's say the lot costs x dollars. Then the house costs 3x dollars. So, x + 3x is the total cost, which is 120,000.

That's like sayin' 4x is 120,000. Now, I know that if I got 4 groups of somethin', and I know how many I got in total, I can divide by 4 to find out how many is in each group. So, I'll divide 120,000 by 4.

That's 30,000. So, the lot costs 30,000. But we want to know how much the house costs, and that's 3 times 30,000.

"So Tara bought a bunch of canvas bags, 8 packs of 'em, and each pack had 5 bags. She paid 4 bucks for each pack, so that's 8 packs times 5 bags, that's 40 bags. And she paid 4 bucks for each one, so that's 40 times 4, that's 160 bucks.

Then she sold 'em for 8 bucks each, so that's 40 bags times 8 bucks, that's 320 bucks. Now, to figure out how much she made, I gotta subtract how much she spent from how much she made. So that's 320 minus 160, that's 160 bucks.

Now, them cookies take 3/4 cup of raisins each. I gotta figure out how many 3/4 cups are in 9 cups. I can do that by multiplyin' 9 by 4, then dividin' by 3. That's 36 divided by 3, which is 12.

"Ada uses 12 kilowatts of electricity every hour. She's gonna add somethin' that uses 2 more kilowatts. That's 14 kilowatts now. There's 24 hours in a day, so she uses 14 * 24 = 336 kilowatts a day. 

In a week, that's 336 * 7 = 2352 kilowatts. Before, she used 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatts a day. That's 288 * 7 = 2016 kilowatts a week.

Electricity costs $1.50 per kilowatt. So, 2352 kilowatts costs 2352 * $1.50 = $3528. Before, it cost 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.

His cousin's gonna be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age, so that's 60 - 5 = 55. That's how old his cousin's gonna be in 8 years. So his cousin's 55 - 8 = 47 now.

Alright, so the printer cost $400 less than the computer. That's $1,100 - $400 = $700 for the printer.

Now, add the computer and printer together: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. That's how much them two things cost.

We know all three things together cost $2,400. So, the monitors cost $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

There's 2 monitors, so we gotta split that $600 in half. That's $600 / 2 = $300.

The girls, they found the same amount as the boys, plus four times as many. That's a lotta shells. So, we gotta multiply the boys' shells by 4, and then add that to the boys' shells. That's 600 + (4 x 600) = 600 + 2400 = 3000 shells.

Now, we gotta divide them shells among the 10 girls. So, we take 3000 and divide it by 10. That's 300 shells per girl.

Now, I'm gonna add 'em all up: 31 + 50 is 81, then add 45, that's 126, and then add 62, that's 188 mm.

"So ya gotta split the bill with yer wife, but ya also gotta pay a 20% tip, right? Alright, so first, we gotta figger out what 20% of 50 bucks is. I think that's like, 10 bucks, 'cause 20% is like, a fifth, and 50 divided by 5 is 10.

Now, since ya gotta split the bill, ya take the 50 bucks and cut it in half, so that's 25 bucks. Then ya add the 10 bucks for the tip, and that's 35 bucks.

"So they got 18 bucks and they gotta split it 3 ways. That's 6 bucks each. The oldest kid adds 5 bucks to his, so now he got 11 bucks. Then he gets 10 more bucks, so now he's at 21 bucks. But then he spends 8 bucks, so he's down to 13 bucks. Now, he saves some more and triples what he had, so that's 13 times 3. That's a lotta math, but I think I got it... 13 times 3 is 39.

"Elvis wants to save 1125 bucks in April. He's gonna save some in the first half and then twice that in the second half. April's got 30 days, so that's 15 days in the first half and 15 in the second.

Let's say he saves some amount each day in the first half. I don't know what that is yet, so I'll just call it ""x"". Then in the second half, he's gonna save twice that, so that's 2x.

He wants to save 1125 bucks total, so if we add up what he saves in the first half and the second half, that should be 1125. 

So, 15 days in the first half, times x, is 15x. And 15 days in the second half, times 2x, is 30x. Add 'em together, that's 15x + 30x, which is 45x. That's what he saves total.

Now we know that's equal to 1125, so we can say 45x = 1125. To figure out what x is, we gotta divide both sides by 45. That's like, 1125 ÷ 45, which is 25.

So x is 25. That means he saves 25 bucks a day in the first half. And in the second half, he saves twice that, which is 50 bucks a day.

"Verna bought some fruit. She got 3 apples for 1.50 each, so that's 3 x 1.50, that's 4.50. Then she got 5 oranges for 0.80 each, that's 5 x 0.80, that's 4.00. And she got 6 peaches for 0.75 each, that's 6 x 0.75, that's 4.50. 

So, all them fruits cost 4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50, that's 13.00. She gave 20 bucks, so she got 20 - 13.00, that's 7.00.

"I think I can figger this out. If Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, that means Brad gets a little bit and Jeff gets a whole lotta more. Let's say Brad gets some amount, and Jeff gets 4 times that amount. We know they're divvying up 100 bucks.

So if Brad gets a little bit, and Jeff gets 4 times that, we can say Brad gets x, and Jeff gets 4x. And x + 4x is 100. That's like sayin' Brad's little bit plus Jeff's big bit equals 100.

I think if we add x and 4x, that's like 5x. So 5x is 100. If we take 100 and divide it by 5, that's like... 20. So x is 20. That means Brad gets 20 bucks.

Now, if Jeff gets 4 times that, he gets 4 times 20, which is... 80! So Jeff gets 80 bucks.

"So Mark was sick fer 3 months and lost 10 pounds each month. He ended up weighin 70 pounds. I gotta figger out how much he weighed at first.

He lost 10 pounds a month, and that's 3 months, so that's 10 x 3 = 30 pounds he lost. Now I add that to the 70 pounds he ended up with. That's 70 + 30 = 100 pounds.

But it says he needs 2 more than he got now. So if he got x toys now, then x + 2 = 400. I think I can do that math. If I subtract 2 from both sides, I get x = 398.

So Jonathan got 398 toys now.

He needs a calculator, and that's $12. And a geometry set, that's $10.

So we add all them up: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10... *counts on fingers* ...that's $30.

Now, the shop gives a 10% discount. I think that means we gotta take 10% of $30 away from $30. *thinks for a moment* 10% of $30 is... *counts on fingers* ...$3. So we take $3 away from $30, and that's... *counts on fingers* ...$27.

So, if we add all that up, it's 20 + 3 + 10, which is... 33 bucks. Carly pays with a 50-dollar bill, so to find out how much change she gets, we gotta subtract 33 from 50. That's... 17 bucks.

"So Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water's cold. But when it's warm, it takes him 2 minutes more than twice as long. Twice as long as 16 is 32, and 2 more than that is 34. I'm just gonna guess that's the same for hot water too.

So, on a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. That means 3 miles is 3 times 16, which is 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes. That means 3 miles is 3 times 34, which is 102 minutes.

Now, I gotta figure out how much longer it takes him on a hot day. That's 102 minus 48, which is 54.

Now, he wants to save 80 bucks. If he's savin' 40 bucks a week, that's like, 80 divided by 40. That's 2 weeks, right? So it's gonna take him 2 weeks to save that money.

Now we add all them weights together, 150 plus 130 plus 260, that's 540 pounds. Now we gotta divide that by 3, 'cause there's three friends, so that's 540 divided by 3, that's 180 pounds.

Now, the carpet costs 12 bucks a square foot, and the padding is 2 bucks a square foot. So that's 12 + 2 = 14 bucks a square foot for the carpet and padding. Multiply that by 216 square feet, and that's 14 x 216 = 3024 bucks.

Then there's the cost of gettin' rid of the old carpet. That's 4 bucks a square foot, so that's 4 x 216 = 864 bucks.

And finally, there's the cost of puttin' in the new carpet. That's 34 bucks a square foot, so that's 34 x 216 = 7344 bucks.

30% of 76,000 is like... um... 0.3 times 76,000. That's 22,800. So Juan's house is 76,000 minus 22,800. That's 53,200.

If Pete buys 2 boxes, that's 2 x 90 bucks, which is 180 bucks. And he gets 2 x 90 contacts, which is 180 contacts.

Now, I gotta figure out how much each contact costs. I take the total cost, 180 bucks, and divide it by the total contacts, 180. That's 1 buck per contact. But Pete needs 2 contacts, one for each eye, so each pair costs 2 bucks.

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is, um, a bunch. If there's 1% fewer red ones, that means there's 99 red jelly beans for every 100 blue ones. And if there's 1% more green ones, that means there's 101 green jelly beans for every 100 blue ones.

So if we add 'em all up, we get 99 + 100 + 101 = 300 jelly beans for every 100 blue ones. That's like, 3 times the number of blue ones. And we know there's 4500 jelly beans in total, so we can divide that by 3 to get the number of blue ones. That's... um... 1500.

Now we can figger out the number of red and green jelly beans. If there's 1% fewer red ones, that's 99% of 1500, which is... *counts on fingers* ...1485. And if there's 1% more green ones, that's 101% of 1500, which is... *counts on fingers* ...1515.

So there's 1515 green jelly beans and 1485 red ones. That means there's... *counts on fingers* ...30 more green jelly beans than red ones.

"So we gotta find the average of Jared's typin' speed. He started at 47 words per minute, then he got better and hit 52. Then he got even better and added 5 more, so that's 57.

Now we add 'em all up: 47 + 52 + 57. That's a lotta numbers. Let me see... 47 + 52 is 99, and then we add 57, that's 156.

Now we gotta divide that by 3, 'cause there's three numbers. So 156 divided by 3 is... 52.

"So, if Martin eats them Cheerios, he loses weight, and if he eats them donuts, he gains weight. Let's see... 

If he eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds a week. That's like, 5 weeks, so that's 1.25 x 5 = 6.25 pounds he loses.

If he eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds a week. That's 5 weeks, so that's 1.75 x 5 = 8.75 pounds he gains.

Now, I gotta figure out the difference. That's like, how much more he gains than he loses. So, it's 8.75 (gains) + 6.25 (loses) = 15 pounds.

"So Alex invited 100 people by email, and they're all gonna invite 2 friends each. That's 100 x 2 = 200 more people. So now we got 100 + 200 = 300 people.

Then she calls 10 friends, and 8 of 'em are bringin' their spouses. That's 10 + 8 = 18 more people.

So we add 'em all up: 300 + 18 = 318.

318"
"So we gotta figger out how much the Mastiff weighs. 

First, the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. Then the Dachshund weighs twice as much as him, so that's 2 times 10, which is 20 pounds. 

Next, the Papillon weighs one-fourth of what the Dachshund weighs. So we gotta divide 20 by 4, and that's 5 pounds.

Last, the Mastiff weighs 44 times what the Papillon weighs. So we multiply 5 by 44, and that's... a lotta pounds!

"So Marilyn's lookin' to buy some boots online. She's checkin' out Amazon and eBay. On Amazon, the boots are 16 bucks and shipping's 4 bucks. That's 20 bucks total. 

Now, on eBay, the boots are 13 bucks, but the shipping's more. It's twice as much as Amazon, so that's 8 bucks. That makes the total on eBay 13 + 8, which is 21 bucks.

So, the boots on eBay are 21 bucks and on Amazon they're 20 bucks. That's a difference of... 1 buck.

"I think I can figger this out. So the beanstalk starts at 4 feet, and it doubles every day. That means on the first day, it's 4 feet. On the second day, it's 8 feet. On the third day, it's 16 feet. And on the fourth day, it's 32 feet.

Now, the window is 20 feet up, so we need the beanstalk to be taller than that. It's 16 feet on the third day, but that's not enough. But on the fourth day, it's 32 feet, and that's way taller than the window.

So, it's gonna take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"So John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. I gotta figure out how much protein he gets from that. I know a cup of mushrooms is 100 grams and it's got 3 grams of protein. So if John eats 200 grams, that's like 2 cups. 

2 cups is 2 x 3 grams of protein, that's 6 grams of protein per day. Now I gotta figure out how much protein he gets in a week. There's 7 days in a week, so I multiply 6 grams by 7. That's 42 grams of protein.

42"
"I think I can figger this out. So Jerry's age now is somethin', and 5 years ago, he was that somethin' minus 5. Now it says he's twice as old as he was 5 years ago. That means if he was 5 years ago, say, 5 years old, he'd be 10 now. But that's just an example. 

Let's try it with numbers. If Jerry was x years old 5 years ago, then he's x + 5 now. And it says he's twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so that's 2 times x. That means x + 5 = 2x. 

Now, I ain't no math whiz, but I think I can solve that. If I subtract x from both sides, I get 5 = x. That means 5 years ago, Jerry was 5 years old. Now he's 5 + 5, which is 10. 

So Jerry's 10 now. In 3 years, he'll be 10 + 3, which is 13.

"So George needs to pay for them implants. Two of 'em, and they cost 2000 bucks each. That's 4000 bucks right there. But he wants one of 'em to have a fancy crown, and that's 500 extra. So now we're at 4500 bucks.

He already gave 'em 600 bucks, so that's good. Now he just needs to come up with the rest. That's 4500 minus 600, which is... uh... 3900 bucks.

He makes 15 bucks an hour, so we gotta figure out how many hours he needs to work to make 3900 bucks. That's a lotta math... but I think I got it. It's 3900 divided by 15... that's... 260 hours.

260"
"I think I can figger this out. So we got three angles in a triangle, and they add up to 180 degrees. One angle is twice as big as the smallest one, and the other is three times as big as the smallest one.

Let's call the smallest one ""x"". Then the other two are 2x and 3x. So we add 'em all up and get x + 2x + 3x = 180. That's like 6x = 180.

Now, I ain't no math whiz, but I think if we divide 180 by 6, we get x. That's 30. So the smallest angle is 30 degrees.

Now we can figger out the other two angles. Twice 30 is 60, and three times 30 is 90. So the biggest angle is 90 degrees.

"I'm gonna figger out how many gumballs Colby can buy. He's got a buncha coins, so I'm gonna count 'em up.

He's got 8 quarters. That's a lotta money. Each quarter's worth 25 cents, so that's 8 x 25, which is... um... *counts on fingers* ...200 cents.

He's also got 6 dimes. Dimes is worth 10 cents each, so that's 6 x 10, which is... *counts on fingers* ...60 cents.

And he's got 14 nickels. Nickels is worth 5 cents each, so that's 14 x 5, which is... *counts on fingers* ...70 cents.

And last, he's got 15 pennies. Pennies is worth 1 cent each, so that's just 15 cents.

Now, let's add all them up. 200 + 60 + 70 + 15... *counts on fingers* ...that's 345 cents.

Gumballs cost a nickel each, which is 5 cents. So, I'm gonna divide 345 by 5... *counts on fingers* ...that's 69.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got dogs, cats, and birds. Dogs got 4 legs, cats got 4 legs, and birds got 2 legs. 

We got 5 dogs, so that's 5 x 4 = 20 legs for the dogs. We got 2 cats, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 legs for the cats. We got 10 birds, so that's 10 x 2 = 20 legs for the birds.

Now, I add 'em all up: 20 + 8 + 20 = 48.

"So Steve gets a console and 5 games for his birthday. Then he buys 1 game a month for a year, that's 12 games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so that's 12 + 5 + 5 = 22 games.

Next year, he buys 2 games a month, that's 24 games. And he gets 5 more for Christmas, so that's 24 + 5 = 29 games. Now he's got 22 + 29 = 51 games.

Last year, he buys 4 games a month, that's 48 games. And he gets 5 more for Christmas, so that's 48 + 5 = 53 games. Now he's got 51 + 53 = 104 games.

The final answer is: 104"
"So the plane goes 1200 miles in 3 hours, right? That's like, really fast. Now, I gotta figure out how long it takes to go 2000 more miles at that same speed.

I think if it goes 1200 miles in 3 hours, that's like 400 miles in one hour. So if I got 2000 more miles to go, I just divide that by 400, and that's... um... 5 hours.

"So Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. That's like, 60 pounds an hour, right? 120 divided by 2 is 60.

Now, Marissa makes 3/4 of what Ruiz makes in an hour. Ruiz makes 60 pounds an hour, so Marissa makes 3/4 of that. That's like, 45 pounds an hour.

So Ruiz makes 60 pounds an hour, and Marissa makes 45 pounds an hour. If they work for 12 hours, Ruiz makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds, and Marissa makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

So together, they make 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds of chocolates.

"So Howard went to the arcade on Monday and spent 8 bucks. Then on Tuesday, he spent twice that, so that's 2 times 8, which is 16 bucks. Then on Wednesday, he spent 4 times what he spent on Tuesday, so that's 4 times 16, which is 64 bucks.

So let's add all that up, 8 plus 16 plus 64, that's 88 bucks he spent. He had 100 bucks to start with, so now he's got 100 minus 88, that's 12 bucks left.

"So Patrick sold lemonade for 6 hours. First 4 hours, he sold 15 cups each hour for 50 cents a cup. That's 15 cups * 4 hours = 60 cups. 60 cups * 50 cents = 60 * 0.5 = 30 bucks.

Next 2 hours, he sold 10 cups each hour for 60 cents a cup. That's 10 cups * 2 hours = 20 cups. 20 cups * 60 cents = 20 * 0.6 = 12 bucks.

Add 'em together, 30 + 12 = 42 bucks.

"So we gotta figure out how many years it takes for Jeremy's tires to wear out. 

First, we need to know how many times the tires rotate in a month. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles. That's like, a lot of rotations. So we gotta figure out how many rotations per mile. That's 725 divided by 2, which is 362.5. 

Now we multiply that by the miles Jeremy drives in a month, which is 400. That's 362.5 times 400, which is 145,000. That's how many times the tires rotate in a month.

But we need to know how many times they rotate in a year. There's 12 months in a year, so we multiply 145,000 by 12. That's 1,740,000.

Now we know the tires can only rotate 10,440,000 times before they wear out. So we divide that by how many times they rotate in a year, which is 1,740,000. That's 10,440,000 divided by 1,740,000, which is 6.

"I think I can figger this out. So, the shampoo bottle costs 24 bucks, and it says to use 2 pumps for 120 washes. But Jackie only uses 1 pump. 

If 2 pumps is 120 washes, then 1 pump is half that, so 60 washes. And if 2 pumps is 120 washes, then the whole bottle is good for 120 washes. So, the whole bottle has 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

Now, I gotta find out how much each pump costs. The bottle costs 24 bucks, which is 2400 cents. So, I divide 2400 cents by 240 pumps... that's 10 cents per pump.

"Joe's got 50 bucks to spend on some new clothes. He finds a shirt for 25 bucks and some shorts for 35 bucks. That's 60 bucks total. But wait, there's a sale - 30% off. I think that means we gotta figure out 30% of 60. Um, that's like... 0.3 times 60... that's 18 bucks off. So now the clothes cost 60 - 18 = 42 bucks.

Joe started with 50 bucks, so if he spends 42, he's got... 50 - 42 = 8 bucks left.

Now, Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so that's 490 x 194, which is... *counts on fingers again* ...$95,060.

So, to find out how much more it costs to fix Lewis' street, I gotta subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street. That's $95,060 - $29,100, which is... *counts on fingers once more* ...$65,960.

"So John gets 100,000 bucks for the first 5 months of his research thingy. Then it takes way longer, like 10 times longer. That's 50 months total. The first 5 months cost 100,000 bucks, so that's 20,000 bucks a month.

Now, the rest of the months, 45 of 'em, cost 50% more. That's like, 20,000 plus half of 20,000, which is 10,000. So it's 30,000 bucks a month for the rest of the time.

Multiply 45 months by 30,000 bucks, that's 1,350,000 bucks. Add that to the first 100,000 bucks, and you get... 1,450,000 bucks.

The first fella had a 6-ounce steak. That's 6 ounces right there.

The second fella had them beef tips. He had 8 of 'em, and each one was an ounce. So that's 8 ounces.

The third fella had a big ol' steak, a pound. I think a pound is like 16 ounces or somethin'. Yeah, that's right.

So we add it all up: 6 ounces from the first fella, 8 ounces from the second fella, and 16 ounces from the third fella. That's 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces.

Them other two players didn't eat no meat, so we don't gotta count 'em.

So, that leaves us with 72 - 18, which is 54 seats. Then, one-third of them seats were taken by the parents. That's like, 54 divided by 3, which is 18 seats.

Now, we subtract the seats taken by the parents from the remaining seats, which is 54 - 18, and that's... 36 seats. And that's how many students were there.

Now, only 4 out of every 5 flowers are bloomin', so we gotta figure out what 4 out of 5 of 200 is. I think I can do that. If I had 5 cookies and I ate 4 of 'em, that's like 4 out of 5 cookies. So if I had 200 cookies and I ate 4 out of every 5, I'd have to multiply 200 by 4 and then divide by 5. Or maybe just multiply 200 by 4 and then divide by 5. Yeah, that's it.

Now, the company made a profit of 25,000 minus 7,500, which is 17,500 bucks per car. James sold 10 cars, so the total profit is 10 times 17,500, which is 175,000 bucks.

Now, outta them 25 people, 60% are chicks. That's like, most of 'em. So we gotta find out how many chicks that is. We can do that by multiplyin' 25 by 0.6, which is like, 15 chicks.

So, if there's 25 people who can stay on the wave and 15 of 'em are chicks, that means the rest are dudes. We can find out how many dudes by subtractin' the number of chicks from the total. That's 25 - 15, which is 10.

I think we gotta figure out how much faster Tom's goin' than Bob. That's 70 minus 55, which is 15. So Tom's gainin' on Bob by 15 miles per hour.

Now, we gotta figure out how long it's gonna take Tom to cover them 75 miles. If he's gainin' 15 miles per hour, that's like... 75 miles divided by 15 miles per hour. That's... uh... 5 hours.

"So Naomi caught 17 fish, and Darren caught 6 less than her. That means Darren caught 17 - 6, which is 11. Now, Tommy caught 3 more than Darren, so that's 11 + 3. That's 14.

"So Manny's payin' 60 bucks for karate classes. His folks say if it's more than 10 bucks a class, they're pullin' the plug. There's 10 classes total. 

If Manny goes to all 10, that's 60 bucks divided by 10, which is 6 bucks a class. That's fine. But if he misses some, the price per class goes up. 

Let's say he goes to 6 classes. That's 60 bucks divided by 6, which is 10 bucks a class. That's the max his folks will pay. 

So if he goes to 6 classes, that means he can miss 10 - 6 = 4 classes.

"So Julie's faster than Jewel at the cash register, right? Like, twice as fast. Jewel does 50 customers a day. That means Julie does 50 * 2 = 100 customers a day.

So together, they do 50 + 100 = 150 customers a day. Now, there's 7 days in a week, so they do 150 * 7 = 1050 customers a week.

1050"
"So Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles. That means Reggie ran 5 x 4 = 20 miles. Now, Reggie ran 3 miles more than Lynn. So if Reggie ran 20 miles, Lynn musta ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

17"
"I figgered it out. So, 4 apples is 5.20 bucks. That means one apple is 5.20 divided by 4, which is 1.30 bucks. Now, 5 apples is 5 times 1.30, which is 6.50 bucks.

Now, 3 oranges is 3.30 bucks. One orange is 3.30 divided by 3, which is 1.10 bucks. 5 oranges is 5 times 1.10, which is 5.50 bucks.

So, 5 apples and 5 oranges is 6.50 plus 5.50, which is 12 bucks.

$12.00"
"I think I can figger this out. So Bob's gonna dig a hole, right? It's gonna be 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. That's a big hole. Now, it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of dirt. 

So first, I gotta figger out how many cubic feet of dirt he's gonna move. I think that's length times width times depth. That's 6 times 4 times 3. That's... um... 72 cubic feet of dirt.

Now, if it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot, and he's got 72 cubic feet to shovel, that's... um... 72 times 3. That's 216 seconds.

"I'm gonna try to figger out how much Bill's truck is gonna cost. 

First, the truck itself is 30,000 bucks. Then he wants a king cab, that's 7,500 more. He also wants leather seats, that's one-third of the king cab, so that's 7,500 divided by 3, that's 2,500. Then he wants runnin' boards, that's 500 less than the leather seats, so that's 2,500 minus 500, that's 2,000. And he wants them fancy lights, that's 1,500.

Now, let's add all that up. 30,000 plus 7,500 is 37,500. Plus 2,500 is 40,000. Plus 2,000 is 42,000. Plus 1,500 is 43,500.

I think that's it, but wait, what's this? There's a towing package too. Aw, shucks, I don't know how much that costs. I reckon we can't figger out the total cost without knowin' that.

43,500"
"So Tim gets a 5% raise on his $20,000 a month salary. That's like, 5% of 20,000 is... um... 0.05 times 20,000... that's $1,000. So now he makes $20,000 + $1,000, that's $21,000 a month.

He also gets a bonus, which is half a month's salary. So that's $21,000 / 2, that's $10,500.

Now, if he makes $21,000 a month, in a year he'll make... $21,000 times 12, that's $252,000. And he gets that bonus once, so we add that to the total. $252,000 + $10,500, that's $262,500.

262,500"
"Let's figger this out. James buys 10 suits, and they cost 750 bucks each. That's a lotta money. So, 10 times 750 is... um... 7,500 bucks for the suits.

Now, he buys 10 dress pants, and they cost 1/5 of what the suits cost. So, 750 divided by 5 is 150. Then, 10 times 150 is... 1,500 bucks for the pants.

He also buys 3 shirts for each suit, and they cost 60 bucks each. So, he buys 3 times 10 shirts, which is 30 shirts. Then, 30 times 60 is... 1,800 bucks for the shirts.

Addin' all that up, we get 7,500 plus 1,500 plus 1,800... that's 10,800 bucks.

"So we gotta figure out how many articles them two websites published in February. One website does 20 articles a day, and the other does 10. February got 28 days, right?

So the first website does 20 articles a day, that's 20 times 28, that's... um... 560 articles. And the other website does 10 articles a day, that's 10 times 28, that's... 280 articles.

Now we add 'em together, 560 and 280, that's... 840.

840"
"So Steve's 60, right? His wife's 4 years older, so that's 60 + 4, that's 64. Now their son's half as old as his mom, so that's 64 / 2, that's 32. Now their son's wife is 3 years younger than him, so that's 32 - 3, that's 29.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got a bag of flour, and it's split into 8 parts. Each part is 2 kilograms. So if we multiply 8 by 2, that's how much flour is in one bag, right? That's 16 kilograms.

Now, we wanna know how much flour is in 3 bags. So we multiply 16 by 3. That's... um... 48 kilograms.

48"
"Alisa rode her bike 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. That's a lotta hours. So I multiplied 12 by 4.5 and got 54 miles. Stanley rode 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. I multiplied 10 by 2.5 and got 25 miles. Now I add 54 and 25 together and I get 79 miles.

79"
"So Bill's diggin' a well, right? He's got some soil and some clay to get through. He can dig through soil pretty fast, 4 feet in an hour. But clay's harder, so it's half that, 2 feet an hour.

He's gotta dig 24 feet of soil, so that's 24 divided by 4, that's 6 hours. Then he's gotta dig 8 feet of clay, so that's 8 divided by 2, that's 4 hours.

So, if it takes him 6 hours to dig the soil and 4 hours to dig the clay, that's 6 + 4, that's 10 hours.

10"
"So Howie's gotta buy cupcakes for his whole class, right? That's him, his teacher, and 25 other kids. That's 27 people. He's gettin' 2 cupcakes for each person, one vanilla and one chocolate. So, I'm thinkin'... 27 people, 2 cupcakes each... that's a lotta cupcakes.

I'm gonna multiply 27 by 2. That's... um... 54. Yeah, that's right. Howie needs 54 cupcakes.

"So Fishio got 2000 likes on her selfie. Then, 3 weeks later, she got a whole lot more. It's like, 70 times more than the first 2000. That's a lotta likes. 

So, 70 times 2000 is... um... 140000. And that's in addition to the first 2000. So that's 142000. Then she got 20000 more. That's 162000.

162000"
"So Clara bought 20 pomegranates on Tuesday, and they cost 20 bucks each. That's 20 times 20, which is 400 bucks. But she got 2 bucks off, so she paid 400 minus 2, which is 398 bucks.

Next day, the price went up to 30 bucks each, and Sheila bought 20. That's 20 times 30, which is 600 bucks. But they had a sale, 10% off. I think that means you take 10% of 600, which is... um... 60 bucks. So Sheila paid 600 minus 60, which is 540 bucks.

Now, to find the difference, I subtract the smaller number from the bigger one. That's 540 minus 398, which is... 142 bucks.

$142"
"Ariadne's shop sells red and green hats. She made 400 bucks from red hats one month. That's half of what she made from green hats. So, green hats made her 800 bucks that month. That's 400 + 800, so she made 1200 bucks that month.

Next month, she made 3/4 of what she made the month before. That's like, 3 out of 4 parts of 1200. So, 3/4 of 1200 is 900 bucks.

So, in two months, she made 1200 + 900 bucks. That's 2100 bucks.

2100"
"So James gets a free hour, that's 1 hour he don't pay for. He rents the thing from 5 to 9, that's 4 hours. So he pays for 3 hours.

First hour he pays for is 15 bucks. Next hour is double that, so that's 30 bucks. Last hour is double that, so that's 60 bucks.

Add all them up, that's 15 + 30 + 60. That's 105 bucks.

"So Sally had 200 bucks in her bank at the start of the week, and now she's got 420. That means she got 420 - 200 = 220 bucks this week. 

She was s'posed to get 300 bucks, but she only got 220. So, to figure out how much was taken out, I gotta subtract 220 from 300. That's 300 - 220 = 80.

"Lemme think this through. Lori's makin' deviled eggs for her party, and each guest's gonna eat 3 of 'em. She's got 16 guests comin', so that's 16 x 3 = 48 deviled eggs she needs.

Now, I know it takes 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves. So, if she needs 48 deviled egg halves, that's like... 48 / 2 = 24 eggs.

And I think I remember that a dozen's like, 12 eggs, right? So, if she needs 24 eggs, that's like... 24 / 12 = 2 dozen eggs.

"Shiela gotta write 15 pages for her paper. She done 1/3 of it. That's like, if you got a pizza and you ate 1 slice out of 3. So she done 5 pages. Now she gotta do the rest. That's 15 - 5. That's 10 pages she gotta write.

"So Mike's gotta read this 200-page book in 30 days. He's gonna read 10 pages a day. I think I can figger this out. If he reads 10 pages a day, that's like, 200 pages divided by 10 pages a day. That's 20 days, right? He'll finish the book in 20 days.

Now, if he's gotta finish it in 30 days, but he's done in 20, that means he's done 10 days early. That's like, 30 minus 20, and that's 10.

"So James bought a plane for 150,000 bucks. Then he gotta pay 5,000 a month to keep it in a hanger. And he spends twice that on gas, so that's 10,000 a month. 

So, he pays 5,000 for the hanger and 10,000 for gas, that's 15,000 a month. Now, there's 12 months in a year, so that's 15,000 * 12 = 180,000. 

Now, add the 150,000 he paid for the plane and the 180,000 he paid for the hanger and gas, that's 330,000.

"Let's figger this out. Finley's cookin' rice, beans, and pork. It took her 30 minutes to cook the rice. Now, the pork took 20 minutes longer than the rice, so that's 30 + 20 = 50 minutes for the pork.

Now we gotta figger out the beans. The beans took half as long as the rice and pork combined. So we add the rice and pork time, that's 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes for the beans.

So we add all the times together: 30 for the rice, 50 for the pork, and 40 for the beans. That's 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

So, almonds is 10 bucks a pound and walnuts is 15 bucks a pound. Now, I gotta find out how much 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs. That's like, half of 10 is 5, and a third of 15 is 5. So that's 5 + 5, that's 10 bucks.

Now, I gotta do the same fer 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. A fifth of 10 is 2, and a third of 15 is still 5. So that's 2 + 5, that's 7 bucks.

Now, I gotta figger out the difference. That's 10 - 7, that's 3 bucks.

"I think I can figger this out. We got sheep and geese, and they all got legs and heads. We know there's 70 legs and 20 heads in total.

Sheep got 4 legs and geese got 2 legs. Let's say there's S sheep and G geese. So, we can say 4 times the number of sheep, plus 2 times the number of geese, is 70. And we know the number of sheep plus the number of geese is 20.

I'm thinkin', if we double the number of heads, we get 40. Now we got 4S + 2G = 70 and 2S + 2G = 40. If we subtract the second one from the first, we get 2S = 30.

So, if we divide 30 by 2, we get S = 15. That means there's 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"So Roger needs to buy some coffee, right? His normal coffee is 5 bucks a pound, but they're outta that one. He gotta get the fancy stuff that's 20% more. I think that means it's 20% more than 5 bucks. Um, that's like... 5 bucks plus a little more. I'm pretty sure 20% of 5 bucks is a buck, so that's 6 bucks a pound.

He needs a week's worth, and he uses a pound a day, so that's 7 pounds. That's 7 times 6 bucks, which is... uh... 42 bucks.

And then he gets a donut for 2 bucks. So, all together, that's 42 bucks for the coffee and 2 bucks for the donut. That's... 44 bucks.

"Gus spent 20 bucks at the store. He got 2 bags of chips, that's 2 times 2, so that's 4 bucks. He got some fried chicken for 8 bucks and a soda for 1 buck. So that's 4 plus 8 plus 1, that's 13 bucks. Now, if he spent 20 bucks and he spent 13 bucks on them things, that means he spent the rest on the apple pie. So, 20 minus 13 is... 7 bucks.

"So John's in this cookin' class, right? It's 4 times a week, 2 hours each time, for 6 weeks. That's a lotta cookin'. Now, he learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours. I gotta figure out how many recipes that is.

First, I gotta know how many hours he's in class. That's 4 times a week, 2 hours each time, so that's 8 hours a week. Then I multiply that by 6 weeks, 'cause that's how long the class is. That's 8 * 6, which is 48 hours.

Now, I know he learns a recipe every 1.5 hours. So I take 48 hours and divide it by 1.5. That's... um... 32. Yeah, that's right. He learns 32 recipes.

"So we gotta figger out how many hours them math teachers sleep, right? First, we gotta know how many math teachers there are. We know there's 150 teachers total, and 60% of 'em are history teachers. That means the rest, 40%, are math teachers.

So, 40% of 150 is... um... that's like, 0.4 times 150... that's 60. So there's 60 math teachers.

Now, each teacher sleeps 6 hours a day, so we multiply 60 by 6... that's 360.

Now Rayna got $60 more than Kassidy, so she got $90 + $60, that's $150.

Now we add all they money together, that's $120 + $90 + $150, that's $360.

Now we gotta share it equally, so we divide by 3, that's $360 / 3, that's $120.

But we're tryin' to figure out how many good days were left in the month after the first 30 days. So we gotta subtract the good days in the first 30 days from the total good days. That's 14 total good days minus 12 good days in the first 30 days.

20 x 12 = 240 inches

Now, we need to know how many more inches it needs to grow to get to 600. So we subtract 240 from 600.

600 - 240 = 360

Now we know it needs to grow 360 more inches. And it grows 30 inches a day, so we divide 360 by 30.

360 / 30 = 12

That's 720 kg. Now we know how much all them people weigh together.

The elevator can only hold 700 kg. So we gotta subtract 700 from 720 to see how much too heavy it is.

Let's say the dress was x long to start with. If she adds 50% to it, that's like addin' half of x, so it's 1.5 times as long now. That's 1.5x. Then she adds 20cm, so it's 1.5x + 20.

We know it's 140cm now, so we can set up a little equation thingy: 1.5x + 20 = 140. If we subtract 20 from both sides, we get 1.5x = 120. Then if we divide both sides by 1.5, we get x = 80.

So, if he did half slow, that's half of 60 minutes, which is 30 minutes. And if he did half fast, that's half of 40 minutes, which is 20 minutes. Now, I just add 'em together: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

"They got 30 minutes to get to school. They already walked for 6 minutes to the library corner, then another 13 minutes to the fire station. That's 19 minutes gone. So, they got 30 - 19 = 11 minutes left to get to school on time.

"Catherine went to the store and bought some stuff. She got apples, bananas, and oranges. The apples cost 4 bucks for 1 kilo. The bananas were 2 bucks a kilo, and she got 2 kilos, so that's 2 times 2, which is 4 bucks. The oranges were 3 bucks a kilo, and she got 2 kilos, so that's 2 times 3, which is 6 bucks.

So, if we add it all up, it's 4 bucks for the apples, plus 4 bucks for the bananas, plus 6 bucks for the oranges. That's 4 + 4 + 6, which is... 14 bucks.

"Greta made 30 cookies. Celinda made twice as many, so that's 2 times 30, which is 60 cookies. So they made 30 + 60 cookies, that's 90 cookies. Then they ate 10, so we gotta take 10 away from 90. That's 80 cookies left.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So we got one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. Let's say the triplet is x years old. Then the twin is x + 7 years old.

Now, we got two twins, so they're x + 7 and x + 7 years old. And we got three triplets, so they're x, x, and x years old. We know all their ages added up is 44. So we can write it like this:

(x + 7) + (x + 7) + x + x + x = 44

That's a lotta x's. Let me try to simplify it. 

2(x + 7) + 3x = 44

That's still a lotta x's. Let me try to get rid of the 2 and the 7.

2x + 14 + 3x = 44

Now I can combine the x's.

5x + 14 = 44

Now I can get rid of the 14.

5x = 30

Now I can get rid of the 5.

x = 6

So the triplet is 6 years old. And the twin is 6 + 7 years old. That's 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"John's gotta do his homework 'fore he can take a nap. He's got 20 minutes of math, 40 minutes of readin', and 20 minutes of history. That's a lotta work. 

First, we gotta figure out how many minutes he's got 'fore dinner. He's got 3 hours, and that's 3 times 60, so that's 180 minutes. 

Now, let's add up all that homework: 20 + 40 + 20, that's 80 minutes. 

So, if he's got 180 minutes 'fore dinner, and he's gonna spend 80 minutes doin' homework, that means he's got 180 - 80 minutes left for a nap. That's 100 minutes.

"Let's figger this out. Manolo got 5 lollipops and 4 candies for 3 bucks and 20 cents. Lollipops cost 40 cents each, so 5 of 'em is 5 x 40 cents, that's 2 bucks. Now we subtract 2 bucks from 3 bucks and 20 cents, that leaves us with 1 buck and 20 cents for 4 candies.

So one candy is 1 buck and 20 cents divided by 4, that's 30 cents. Now we need to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost. 10 lollipops is 10 x 40 cents, that's 4 bucks. 10 candies is 10 x 30 cents, that's 3 bucks. Add 'em together, that's 4 bucks + 3 bucks, that's 7 bucks.

"So Rong saves 20 coins every month. That's 240 coins a year, 'cause there's 12 months. Now, if we do that for 10 years, that's 2400 coins.

Now, Neil, he saves more than Rong. He saves 2/5 more, whatever that means. I think it means he saves 8 more coins than Rong. So that's 28 coins a month. That's 336 coins a year. And in 10 years, that's 3360 coins.

So if we add Rong's coins and Neil's coins, we get 2400 + 3360. That's a lot of coins. I think it's 5760.

5760"
"Let's figger this out. John's dog needs 2 shots, and they cost 20 bucks each. That's 40 bucks right there. Then there's this heartworm thingy, and it's 60% of the whole bill. I don't know what that means, but I can try.

If the whole bill is, like, x, then the heartworm thingy is 60% of x. That's like, 0.6x. So the whole bill is the shots plus the heartworm thingy: x = 40 + 0.6x.

Now I gotta get x by itself. I think I can do that by subtractin' 0.6x from both sides. That gives me 0.4x = 40. Then I can divide both sides by 0.4, and that gives me x = 100.

So the whole bill is 100 bucks. John brought 125 bucks, so he's got 125 - 100 = 25 bucks left.

"I think I can figger out how much them fruits cost. 

First, I gotta know how much each fruit costs. Apples are 50 cents. Bananas are twice as much as apples, so that's a dollar. Oranges are the most expensive, they're three times as much as bananas, so that's three bucks.

Now, let's count how much all them fruits cost. There's 5 bananas, that's 5 bucks. There's 12 apples, that's 6 bucks. And there's 7 oranges, that's 21 bucks.

So, if I add all them up, I get 5 + 6 + 21. That's... 32 bucks.

"So Brittany's got this quilt with lots of little squares on it. There's 14 red ones. Then there's some blue ones, and I think it's 4 more than the red ones, so that's 18. Then the green ones, they got 6 more than the blue ones, so that's 24. And the white ones, they got 12 less than the green ones, so that's 12.

Now, let's count 'em all up. 14 red, 18 blue, 24 green, and 12 white. That's... um... 14 + 18 is 32, and 32 + 24 is 56, and 56 + 12 is 68.

So, the quilt's got 68 little squares on it, and each one's a square foot, so that's how big the quilt is.

"So we gotta figure out how many chairs Mia needs. There's gonna be 42 grown-ups and 15 babies, so that's a lotta people. Let's add 'em up: 42 + 15 = 57. That's how many people are comin'.

Now, Mia's got some chairs already. She's got 8 of them little high chairs for the babies, and she's got a bunch more regular chairs. She's got 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, so that's 5 x 8 = 40 regular chairs.

So, how many chairs does Mia have in total? That's 40 regular chairs + 8 high chairs = 48 chairs.

But we need 57 chairs, and she's only got 48. So, how many more chairs does she need? That's 57 - 48 = 9.

"Let's figger this out. We got 50 deer, and half of 'em are bucks. So that's 25 bucks. Now, outta them 25 bucks, 20 percent are 8 points. I think that's like, 1 in 5, right? So we take 25 and divide it by 5, that's 5.

"Let's figger this out. We got Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam's got 50 points. Betty's got more, 30% more. That's like, um, 15 more. So Betty's got 65 points.

Now Tom's got 30 less than Betty, so that's 65 - 30, that's 35 points for Tom.

Marta's got 3 times more than Tom, so that's 3 x 35, that's 105 points.

Now we add 'em all up: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105, that's 255 points.

They need 400 points to go on the trip, so we subtract 255 from 400, that's 145.

"Greta got a paycheck for 2400 bucks. She puts half of it in her retirement thingy, so that's 1200 bucks. Then she uses 20% of it for her car payment. I think 20% is like, a fifth, right? So that's 2400 divided by 5, which is 480 bucks.

So she's got 1200 for retirement and 480 for the car, that's 1680 bucks total. Now, if I subtract that from 2400, I get... 720 bucks.

"So we gotta figure out how many pairs of pencils is in the box. First, we gotta know how many pencils is in the box. It says it can hold 20 pencils, but 4 is missin'. So we gotta subtract 4 from 20. That's like, 20 minus 4, which is 16.

Now we gotta find out how many pairs that is. A pair is 2 pencils, right? So we gotta divide 16 by 2. That's like, 16 split in half, which is 8.

Now, Hannah's also gonna set off some fireworks in her backyard, 3 boxes with 5 in each. That's 3 x 5, which is... 15. So, she'll see 120 city fireworks and 15 of her own, that's... 135.

Now, each of 'em gets 2 drinks and 3 snacks. So that's 2 drinks for 20 people, which is 40 drinks. And 3 snacks for 20 people, which is 60 snacks.

We add the drinks and snacks together, and that's 40 + 60, which is 100 things they bought. And each thing costs 2 bucks, so we multiply 100 by 2, and that's 200 bucks.

"Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than that, so that's 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds. 

Now, if we add Gissela's and Gordy's trucks together, that's 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. 

The three trucks together can haul 11,600 pounds. So, to find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we gotta subtract 8,800 from 11,600. 

11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800

Gary's truck can haul 2,800 pounds.

He got 3 mini quiches for 4 bucks each, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 bucks. And he got 13 blueberry muffins for a buck each, so that's 13 x 1 = 13 bucks.

So, if we add all that up, it's 15 + 10 + 12 + 13 = 50 bucks. But then he gets a discount 'cause he's got a special card. He gets 10% off, which is like, 10% of 50 bucks. I think that's 5 bucks. So, he gets 5 bucks off.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days she eats 4 x 14 = 56 pieces. She had 100, so now she got 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days she eats 3 x 14 = 42 pieces. She had 100, so now she got 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

Amy got more candy than Ginger. She got 58 and Ginger got 44. So Amy got 58 - 44 = 14 more pieces than Ginger.

Now, it says Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe. So, I'ma set up a little equation thingy. Let's say Bobby's shoe is x. Then, 9 times x, plus 10, is equal to 100.

So, I'ma subtract 10 from both sides, and that's 9x equals 90. Then, I'ma divide both sides by 9, and that's x equals 10.

So, Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long.

Now, she smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows. There's 32 teachers' cars and each got 2 windows, so that's 32 * 2 = 64 windows. 3/4ths of that's 64 * 3 / 4 = 48 windows.

"Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. He's gonna chew that for 30 days. That's a lotta gum. Let's see... 4 pieces a day for 30 days is... um... *counts on fingers* ...120 pieces.

Now, them packs of gum got 15 pieces in 'em. So, if we take 120 pieces and divide it by 15... *thinks for a moment* ...that's 8 packs.

"Let's figger this out. We got 9 kids and they all want 2 s'mores each. That's 9 x 2 = 18 s'mores for the kids. Then we got 6 grownups and they all want 1 s'more each. That's 6 x 1 = 6 s'mores for the grownups. So we need 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores in total.

Now, each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores. So we need 24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves. And each box got 3 sleeves. So we need 3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

"So Dora's 15 years old. Her dad's age is like, twice hers, plus 8. That's 30 plus 8, so that's 38. Her mom's 4 years younger than her dad, so that's 38 minus 4, that's 34.

Now, let's add 'em all up. Dora's 15, her dad's 38, and her mom's 34. That's 15 plus 38, that's 53, and then add 34, that's 87.

"So Cindy's got a bunch of books, right? She got two that weigh 2 pounds each, that's them math and science ones. Then she got a French book that's 4 pounds and an English book that's 3 pounds. Now, her history book is a big one, it's twice as heavy as the English one, so that's 6 pounds.

Let's add all them up. The two little ones are 4 pounds together. Then we got the French one, that's 4 pounds, the English one, that's 3 pounds, and the big history one, that's 6 pounds. So that's 4 + 4 + 3 + 6. That's a lot of numbers. 

Okay, so 4 + 4 is 8, then add 3, that's 11, and then add 6, that's 17. So all them books together weigh 17 pounds.

"So we gotta figure out how many votes candidate C got. First, we know candidate A got 20% of the votes. That's like, 20 out of 100, right? So candidate A got 20 votes.

Now, candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. That means candidate B got 20 votes plus half of 20 more. Half of 20 is 10, so candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

So, candidate A and B together got 20 + 30 = 50 votes. That means candidate C got the rest, which is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

"Boris got 100 apples. Beck got 23 less than Boris, so Beck got 77 apples.

"So Peter's got 32 ounces of water and he's makin' ice cubes. He's got them big ones, medium ones, and little ones. The big ones use 4 ounces, the medium ones use 2, and the little ones use half an ounce.

He makes 3 of the big ones, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 ounces. Then he makes 7 of the medium ones, that's 7 x 2 = 14 ounces. And he makes 8 of the little ones, that's 8 x 0.5 = 4 ounces.

So he used 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces. Now, if he started with 32 ounces, that means he's got 32 - 30 = 2 ounces left.

"So Clara got 20 books, and she got twice as many as Steven. That means Steven got half of what Clara got, so Steven got 20 / 2 = 10 books.

Now, Alice got 6 more books than Steven, so Alice got 10 + 6 = 16 books.

Clara got 20 books and Alice got 16, so Clara got 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.

"I think I can figger this out. So, a gallon jar costs 5 bucks, and it's 2 bucks more than a half-gallon jar. That means a half-gallon jar is 5 - 2 = 3 bucks.

Now, Cecelia bought 10 gallon jars, that's 10 x 5 = 50 bucks. And she bought 16 half-gallon jars, that's 16 x 3 = 48 bucks. So, she spent 50 + 48 bucks in total.

"Let's figger this out. We got 50 kids in a class. 10 of 'em like bakin', and 5 like playin' basketball. That's 15 kids right there. So, that leaves 50 - 15 = 35 kids who like either playin' video games or playin' music.

Now, I'm told that twice as many kids like playin' music as like playin' basketball. Since 5 kids like playin' basketball, that means 2 * 5 = 10 kids like playin' music.

So, if 10 kids like playin' music, and 35 kids like either playin' video games or playin' music, that means 35 - 10 = 25 kids like playin' video games.

"So Jeremy saw 12 birds, right? Then he threw a stone and scared some away. He scared away 1/3 of 'em. I think that's like, 4 birds. So now we got 12 - 4 = 8 birds left.

"So we gotta figger out how many boys is in each class. We know there's 80 kids in total, and they're split into two classes. That means each class got 80 / 2 = 40 kids.

Now, 40% of them kids is girls. I think that means 40 out of 100, so we gotta find 40% of 40. Um, that's like... 40 x 0.4 = 16 girls in each class.

So if there's 40 kids in each class and 16 is girls, that means the rest is boys. That's 40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.

"So Mark buys 3 packs of them old magic cards for 1800 bucks each. That's a lotta cash, 3 times 1800 is 5400 bucks. Now he opens 'em up and finds some good ones. He gets one worth 4000 bucks and another worth 1000 bucks. That's 5000 bucks right there. Then he's got 30 more cards that are worth 50 bucks each. That's 30 times 50, which is 1500 bucks. So all together he's got 5000 plus 1500, that's 6500 bucks.

Now, to figure out how much profit he made, we gotta subtract how much he spent from how much he got. He spent 5400 and he got 6500. So that's 6500 minus 5400, which is 1100 bucks.

"So ya wanna know how much Jake's family can save if they go to the second amusement park instead of the first one, right? Alright, lemme think about it.

First, we gotta figure out how much it's gonna cost 'em at the first park. They got 2 adults and 2 kids. Adults cost 26 bucks each, so that's 2 times 26, which is... uh... 52 bucks. And kids cost 12 bucks each, so that's 2 times 12, which is... 24 bucks. So, the first park's gonna cost 'em 52 plus 24, which is... 76 bucks.

Now, let's see how much it's gonna cost 'em at the second park. Adults cost 14 bucks each, so that's 2 times 14, which is... 28 bucks. And kids cost 10 bucks each, so that's 2 times 10, which is... 20 bucks. So, the second park's gonna cost 'em 28 plus 20, which is... 48 bucks.

Now, we gotta figure out how much they can save. That's the difference between the two prices. So, we subtract the second price from the first price... 76 minus 48... that's... 28 bucks!

He saves 250 - 200, that's 50 bucks a day. Now, if we do that for a week, that's 7 days, so 50 x 7 is... um... 350.

Now, we gotta figger out how many weeks in 2 months. A month's 4 weeks, so 2 months is 4 * 2 = 8 weeks. 

So, if Candy rents 500 chairs a week, in 8 weeks she'll rent 500 * 8 = 4000 chairs.

So he had 96 glasses and 48 plates, that's a total of 96 + 48 = 144 things.

Now, 10 glasses got broke and 6 plates got broke, so that's 10 + 6 = 16 things that got broke.

Then she trades half her big stickers for big buttons. That's 20 big stickers for 20 big buttons. Now she's got 3 small stickers, 29 big buttons, and 20 big stickers left.

She trades them 20 big stickers for small buttons. She gets 60 small buttons. Now she's got 3 small stickers, 29 big buttons, and 60 small buttons. And don't forget them 9 big buttons from before. That's 38 big buttons.

Let's say x people didn't like it. Then 2x people liked it. We know that x + 2x is the total number of people, which is 33. So, 3x = 33.

Now, I ain't no math whiz, but I know that if I got 3 groups of 11, that's 33. So, x must be 11. That means 11 people didn't like the new rule, and 2x, or 22 people, liked it.

Now, they hiked. They hiked 5 miles per hour slower than half of how fast they drove. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 less than that is 20. So they hiked 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours, so they went 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

So, let's think about this. For jumpin' on enemies, Ava gets 80 more points than Emma (10 points each, 8 more enemies). For collectin' berries, Ava gets 15 more points than Emma (5 points each, 3 more berries). But for finishin' slower, Ava loses 120 points (30 points per second, 4 seconds slower).

So, Ava gets 80 + 15 = 95 more points for enemies and berries. But she loses 120 points for bein' slow. That's 120 - 95 = 25 points less than Emma.

"So Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. That's a lotta ridin'. Let's see... 3 times a day for 5 days is... um... 3 x 5 is 15. They ride 15 times on them 5 days.

Now, on 2 other days, they ride twice as much. That's 2 x 3, which is 6 times a day. And they do that for 2 days, so that's 6 x 2, which is 12.

So, if we add 'em all up, we get 15 + 12, which is... 27. Yeah, they ride their bikes 27 times a week.

"Let's think this through. Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He got some more, and now he's got twice as many orange fish as white fish. He got 17 fish in total.

Let's say he got x white fish. Then he must've got 17 - x orange fish. But we know he's got twice as many orange fish as white fish now. So, if he's got x white fish, he's got 2x orange fish. But he already had 3 orange fish, so he must've got 2x - 3 orange fish.

We know he got 17 fish in total, so x + (2x - 3) = 17. That's like, x + 2x = 17 + 3. That's 3x = 20. If we divide 20 by 3, we get 6 and a bit. But you can't buy a bit of a fish, so we gotta think about it some more.

If he got 6 white fish, that's 17 - 6 = 11 orange fish. But he already had 3, so that's 11 + 3 = 14 orange fish. And he's got 6 white fish, so that's 14 orange and 6 white, and that's not twice as many orange as white.

If he got 7 white fish, that's 17 - 7 = 10 orange fish. But he already had 3, so that's 10 + 3 = 13 orange fish. And he's got 7 white fish, so that's 13 orange and 7 white, and that's not twice as many orange as white either.

"So, let's figger this out. Andy's car gets 10 miles per gallon, and gas costs 3 bucks a gallon. He drives to work and back home, 5 days a week. His work is 5 miles away, so that's 10 miles a day, right? 

He does that 5 days a week, so that's 10 miles a day times 5 days, which is 50 miles a week. Now, his car gets 10 miles per gallon, so he uses 50 miles divided by 10, which is 5 gallons a week.

Gas costs 3 bucks a gallon, so 5 gallons times 3 bucks is... 15 bucks a week.

"So, Carrie got some money from her aunt. She got 10 twenties and 140 quarters. I think a twenty is worth 20 bucks and a quarter is worth a quarter, right? 

So, she spent all the quarters. That's 140 quarters. I gotta multiply that by a quarter. That's 140 x 0.25. Um, that's 35 bucks.

Now, she spent 3/5 of the twenties. I think that means she spent 3 out of 5 of the twenties, but since she got 10 twenties, I gotta figure out what 3/5 of 10 is. That's like, 6 twenties. So, she spent 6 twenties. That's 6 x 20 bucks. That's 120 bucks.

So, she spent 35 bucks from the quarters and 120 bucks from the twenties. That's 35 + 120. That's 155 bucks.

So if they sold 40 TVs and 15 of 'em ain't OLED, that means they sold 40 - 15 = 25 OLED TVs.

"So we gotta figure out how many logs Carson needs to burn so his pipes don't freeze. First, we gotta know how cold it is at night. It's 33 degrees colder at night than it is during the day, and it's 45 degrees during the day. So we subtract 33 from 45, and that's 12 degrees at night.

Now, we need it to be at least 32 degrees so the pipes don't freeze. So we need it to be 32 - 12 = 20 degrees warmer. Each log makes it 5 degrees warmer, so we divide 20 by 5, and that's 4 logs.

Now, 3/5 of them groups brought back seashells. I think that's like 6 groups. Yeah, that's right. So 6 groups brought back seashells.

Each group got 9 people, so 6 groups is 6 x 9, that's 54 people. And each of 'em brought back 2 seashells, so that's 54 x 2, that's 108 seashells.

Now, each person gets 4000 bucks a month. So for all 260 people, that's:

260 people * 4000 bucks per person
= 1,040,000 bucks a month

But we wanna know how much they pay for 3 months, so:

1,040,000 bucks a month * 3 months

Sally just started workin' somewhere else, and she's gettin' 50 cents more than Billy did when he started. So she's gettin' 10.50 an hour.

Now, if they both work 20 hours, we gotta figure out how much they're gonna make. Billy's gonna make 20 times 11.50, that's 230 bucks. Sally's gonna make 20 times 10.50, that's 210 bucks.

So Billy's gonna make 230, and Sally's gonna make 210. That means Billy's gonna make 20 bucks more than Sally.

Now, for the teachers. Each class got 3 teachers, and there's 40 classes. So we multiply 3 by 40, and that's 120 teachers. Each teacher plants 2 trees, so that's 120 times 2, which is 240 trees.

Now, she wants some goats, and she wants 'em to be 30% of all her stuffies. I think that means if she had 10 stuffies, she'd want 3 goats. But she don't got 10, she got 14, and she's gonna get some more. Let's just say she gets x goats. Then she'll have 14 + x stuffies.

I think I can make a equation thingy. If x is the number of goats, then x is 30% of 14 + x. That's like sayin' x is 3/10 of 14 + x. I can use a calculator to figger out what 3/10 of 14 is, and that's 4.2. But I need to add the x part. So I'm thinkin' x = 4.2 + 0.3x.

Now I gotta get x by itself. I can subtract 0.3x from both sides, and that gives me 0.7x = 4.2. Then I can divide both sides by 0.7, and that gives me x = 6.

So Bubbles should get 6 goats.

"Kris wants to play 30 hours of video games. She plays a little bit every day. For 2 weeks, she plays half an hour a day. That's 14 days, right? So that's 14 days times half an hour, that's 7 hours.

Then she plays 2 hours a day for a week. That's 7 days times 2 hours, that's 14 hours. So she played 7 hours and 14 hours, that's 21 hours.

She needs 30 hours to get the thing she wants. She already played 21 hours. So she needs 30 minus 21 hours. That's 9 hours.

"So we got two cars on the highway, right? One's goin' 60 miles per hour, and the other one's goin' 70 miles per hour. The faster one passes the slower one, and they just keep on goin' at the same speed. We wanna know how far apart they'll be after 2 hours.

Okay, so the slowpoke car's goin' 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it'll go 60 * 2 = 120 miles. The speed demon car's goin' 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it'll go 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Now, since the fast car's ahead, we subtract the slow car's distance from the fast car's distance. That's 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

"So James buys a ring, right? It's got a diamond and some gold. The diamond's 600 bucks and the gold's 300 bucks. That's 900 bucks total. Now, he's gotta pay extra for them to make it, and that's 30% more. I think that's like, 30 cents for every dollar, so that's 30 cents times 900 dollars, which is... um... 270 bucks. So he paid 900 bucks for the ring and 270 bucks extra, that's 1170 bucks.

$1170"
"So we gotta figure out how many kids passed them tests. 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, that's a lotta kids. Then 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, that's not as many. Now, the fifth-graders, they did way better than the fourth-graders, they did twice as good. So if 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, that's like 40%, then the fifth-graders did 80%. That means 80% of 400 kids passed, which is 320 kids.

So we add 'em all up, 340 + 40 + 320, that's 700 kids who passed. And there's 500 + 100 + 400 kids total, that's 1000 kids. Now we gotta figure out what percent 700 is of 1000. That's like, 700 out of 1000, which is 70%.

"Milo's makin' a mosaic thingy with them glass chips. He needs 12 chips for every square inch. He got 2 bags, and each bag got 72 chips. So, he got 72 x 2 = 144 chips.

Now, if he needs 12 chips for 1 square inch, he can make 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

He wants it to be 3 inches tall, so we gotta figure out how long it can be. I think it's like, if you got a rectangle, and you know the area and the height, you can find the length. So, it's like 12 square inches divided by 3 inches tall... that's 4 inches long.

"So we gotta figger out how much tea was at the party at the start. We know 10 quarts is left. Now, 4 kids drank 1.5 quarts each, that's like 6 quarts. And 16 kids drank 2 quarts each, that's 32 quarts. So all them kids drank 6 + 32, that's 38 quarts.

Now we add the 10 quarts that's left, that's 38 + 10, that's 48 quarts. Now, I think I remember my buddy sayin' there's 4 quarts in a gallon. So we gotta divide 48 by 4, that's 12.

"Dale started with 100 candies, but then he sold 150. Wait, that don't make sense, he didn't have 150 to sell. He musta ordered more. Then it says he ordered 100 more. So he had 100, then he got 100 more, that's 200 candies. He sold 150, so now he gotta sell the rest. That's 200 - 150, that's... uh... 50.

"So, if the number of students doubles every month, that means it gets bigger and bigger. We start with 10 students. 

In January, we got 10 * 2 = 20 students. 
In February, we got 20 * 2 = 40 students. 
In March, we got 40 * 2 = 80 students. 
In April, we got 80 * 2 = 160 students. 
In May, we got 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, we gotta figure out how many more students we got than we started with. We started with 10, and now we got 320. So, we subtract 10 from 320. That's 320 - 10 = 310.

"Felix made 105 bucks, and he gets 25 cents for each branch he climbs. So, I gotta figure out how many branches that is. I think I can do that by dividin' 105 by 0.25. That's like, a lotta math, but I'll give it a shot.

Okay, so 105 divided by 0.25 is... um... *counts on fingers* ...420! That's a lotta branches. Now, I gotta figure out how many he climbed per day. There's 7 days in a week, so I'll just divide 420 by 7. *counts on fingers again* ...60! That's it.

"So Rose is pickin' flowers, right? She gets 3 with 5 petals each, that's 15 petals. Then she gets 4 with 6 petals each, that's 24 petals. After that, she gets 5 with 4 petals each, that's 20 petals. And last, she gets 6 with 7 petals each, that's 42 petals.

So if we add all them petals up, we get 15 + 24 + 20 + 42, that's 101 petals. But then she drops one of each, so we gotta take away the petals from them. She drops one with 5 petals, one with 6 petals, one with 4 petals, and one with 7 petals. That's 5 + 6 + 4 + 7, that's 22 petals.

So we take 101 petals and subtract 22 petals, that's 79 petals.

"So John and DeSean got a bag of marshmallows, right? They got 35 of 'em. They use one marshmallow for each S'more. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 too. That's 18 S'mores. Then they drop 3 on the ground. That's 21 marshmallows gone.

Now we gotta figure out how many marshmallows they got left. We take the 35 they started with and subtract the 21 they used or dropped. That's 35 - 21 = 14.

They got 14 marshmallows left. There's two kids, so we split 'em in half. 14 / 2 = 7.

"So we gotta figger out how much money them kids spent at the arcade. They played for 4 hours, which is a lotta time. Jack can play a game for 20 minutes with one quarter. His two friends ain't as good, so they can only play half as long, which is 10 minutes. The other friend is super good, so he can play for 30 minutes.

So Jack played for 240 minutes, and he uses one quarter every 20 minutes. That's 240 divided by 20, which is 12 quarters. Them two not-so-good friends played for 240 minutes too, but they use one quarter every 10 minutes. That's 240 divided by 10, which is 24 quarters each. They're two of 'em, so that's 24 times 2, which is 48 quarters. The super good friend played for 240 minutes, and he uses one quarter every 30 minutes. That's 240 divided by 30, which is 8 quarters.

Now we add 'em all up: 12 quarters for Jack, 48 quarters for the not-so-good friends, and 8 quarters for the super good friend. That's 12 + 48 + 8, which is 68 quarters.

Each quarter is 25 cents, so we gotta multiply 68 by 25 cents. That's 68 times 25, which is 1700 cents. Now we gotta turn that into dollars. There's 100 cents in a dollar, so we divide 1700 by 100, which is 17.

"I think I can figger this out. So Tanya's makin' this scrub stuff, and she's got a bunch of ingredients. She's got salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. And she's puttin' it all in a 10-ounce jar.

Now, I know she's usin' the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. And she's usin' twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's say she's usin' 1 ounce of zest. That means she's usin' 1 ounce of fragrance too. And she's usin' twice as much salt as zest, so that's 2 ounces of salt. And she's usin' the same amount of sugar as salt, so that's 2 ounces of sugar too. And she's usin' twice as much oil as salt, so that's 4 ounces of oil.

Now, let's add it all up: 1 ounce of zest, 1 ounce of fragrance, 2 ounces of salt, 2 ounces of sugar, and 4 ounces of oil. That's 10 ounces.

So, she's usin' 4 ounces of oil.

"John bought 3 goats for 500 bucks each, so that's 3 times 500, which is 1500 bucks. Then he bought 2 cows for 1500 bucks each, so that's 2 times 1500, which is 3000 bucks. Now, I gotta add 'em together, so 1500 plus 3000 is... 4500 bucks.

"Paul needs 63 cupcakes, but he already got some. He got 8 chocolate ones and 40 toffee ones. So, he got 48 cupcakes already. Now, we gotta figure out how many more he needs.

"So Joe got twice as many cars as Robert, right? Robert got 20 cars, so Joe got 2 times 20, that's 40 cars.

Now, Joe sells 20% of 'em. I think that's like, 1/5, so he sells 8 cars.

Then he gives away twice as many as he sold to his mom. He sold 8, so he gives away 16.

So, how many cars Joe got left? He had 40, sold 8, gave away 16... that's 40 - 8 - 16... that's 16.

"So we gotta figger out how much each student raised. First, we gotta know how much the students raised altogether. The charity got 175,000 bucks, but 50,000 of that came from other places. So the students raised 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 bucks.

Now we know the students raised 125,000 bucks, and there's 20 of 'em. So we divide 125,000 by 20. That's... um... 6,250 bucks.

"Sandy walked fer 8 hours on the first day. Den she walked half dat on the second day, so dat's 8 / 2 = 4 hours. 

So she walked 8 hours one day, and 4 hours the next. Dat's 8 + 4 = 12 hours in total. 

Now, I gotta turn dat into minutes. I know dere's 60 minutes in an hour, so I multiply 12 by 60. Dat's 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 35"
"So John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle got 5 tasks. Each task pays $1.20. So if we do the math, each cycle is worth 5 x $1.20, which is $6. Then we multiply that by 30, 'cause that's how many cycles he does a day. That's $6 x 30, which is $180 a day.

Now, if he works 7 days a week, we just multiply $180 by 7. That's $180 x 7, which is $1260.

"Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Julie scored 4 less than Sasha, so Julie got 10 points. 

Now, Sasha's points in the second game is 6 less than Julie's points in the first game. So Sasha got 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Addin' Sasha's points from both games, I get 14 + 4 = 18.

"So Kimberly got 8 packs of cat food and 6 packs of dog food. Cat food got 11 tins in each pack, and dog food got 6 tins in each pack. 

So, cat food, that's 8 times 11, that's 88 tins. Dog food, that's 6 times 6, that's 36 tins. 

Now, I gotta figure out how many more cat food tins she got than dog food tins. That's 88 minus 36, that's 52.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got Becca, Smendrick, and PJ, and they all got some Magic Cards. We know they got 341 cards altogether. Now, Becca got 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick got 3 times as many cards as PJ.

Let's say PJ got some number of cards, and we'll call that number ""x"". Then Smendrick got 3 times that, so that's 3x. And Becca got 12 more than Smendrick, so that's 3x + 12.

We know they all got 341 cards, so we can make a equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341. That's a lotta x's. If we add 'em all up, we get 7x + 12 = 341.

Now, if we subtract 12 from both sides, we get 7x = 329. Then we divide both sides by 7, and we get x = 47. That's how many cards PJ got.

So Smendrick got 3 times that, which is 3 * 47 = 141. And Becca got 12 more than Smendrick, which is 141 + 12 = 153.

Becca got 153 cards."
"Cindy got a bunch of eggs at the Easter Egg Hunt. She got 5 green ones. She got twice as many blue ones, so that's 10 blue ones. She got one less pink egg than blue eggs, so that's 9 pink ones. And she got one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so that's 3 yellow ones.

Let's count 'em all up: 5 green, 10 blue, 9 pink, and 3 yellow. That's 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27.

First, let's figger out how much it's gonna cost to ship. That's 4 pounds times 35 cents, which is 1.40 bucks. Then it's 20 miles times 8 cents, which is 1.60 bucks. So that's 1.40 plus 1.60, which is 3 bucks.

Now, let's see how much Amazon's gonna give her back. That's 75% of 32 bucks. I think that's... 24 bucks.

So, she paid 32 bucks, she's gettin' 24 bucks back, and she's spendin' 3 bucks to ship it. That's 32 minus 24 plus 3, which is... 11 bucks.

"Boris makes a lot of chocolate, 50,000 bars a month. He made 8,000 the first week. The second week, he made half that, so that's 4,000. The third week, he made a whole lot, three times the first week, that's 24,000.

So, if we add up the first three weeks, that's 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000, that's 36,000. Now, if he makes 50,000 a month, and he already made 36,000, how much is left for the last week? That's 50,000 - 36,000.

"So Britany does a bunch of stuff for TikTok. She makes 18 videos a week, and each one takes 4 minutes. That's 18 x 4 = 72 minutes a week. Since there's 4 weeks in a month, that's 72 x 4 = 288 minutes a month.

She also writes songs for 2 hours a week. That's 2 hours x 4 weeks = 8 hours a month. I think there's 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 8 x 60 = 480 minutes a month.

And then she does her makeup for 15 minutes, 6 days a week. That's 15 x 6 = 90 minutes a week. For a month, that's 90 x 4 = 360 minutes.

So first, we gotta pay the $129 for the initial deal. That's a given. Now, we gotta figure out how many extra things we need to hang. She's got 2 extra mirrors, 1 extra chandelier, and 10 extra pictures.

Each extra thing costs $15. So we gotta multiply the number of extra things by $15. That's 2 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. That's 13 things. 13 things times $15 is $195.

Now we add the $129 to the $195. That's $324.

Um, that's like... 40% is like, almost half, right? So, half of 30 is 15, and a little more, so that's like 12 bucks. Now we add that to Anthony's 30 bucks, and we get... 30 + 12 = 42 bucks.

Now, she only needs 50 bucks more to get the laptop. So, if she needs 50 bucks more, that means she already has 400 - 50 = 350 bucks.

Now, let's see... she got 230 bucks from her job and her mom. If she already has 350 bucks, and 230 bucks came from her job and her mom, that means she had some money in her purse already. Let's subtract 230 from 350... that's 120 bucks.

So, Jack got 30 socks and 60 dishes. Peter got 60 socks and 30 dishes. 

Now, let's count 'em all up. Socks: 30 + 60 = 90. Dishes: 60 + 30 = 90.

900 eggs divided by 30 eggs per tray is... um... 30 trays. Yeah, that's right. He can fill 30 trays.

Now, if he sells each tray for $2.5, I gotta multiply the number of trays by the price. So, 30 trays times $2.5 is... *counts on fingers* ...$75.

"Let's figger this out. Mr. Smith got 55 goats in Farm X and 45 in Farm Y. He sold 10 from Farm X, so that leaves him with 55 - 10 = 45 goats in Farm X.

Now, he sold twice as many from Farm Y, so that's 2 times 10, which is 20. So he sold 20 goats from Farm Y. That means he's got 45 - 20 = 25 goats left in Farm Y.

Now we add 'em together: 45 goats in Farm X and 25 goats in Farm Y. That's 45 + 25 = 70.

"So James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month. That's a lotta shoes. There's 12 months in a year, so he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs a year. He spends 2640 bucks on shoes every year. Now, I gotta figure out how much each pair costs. I think I can do that by dividin' the total amount by the number of pairs. So, 2640 ÷ 24 = 110.

"So ya gotta buy 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food. Green food costs 25 bucks a basket, so 3 of 'em is 25 times 3, that's 75 bucks. Red food is 18 bucks a basket, but they give ya 2 bucks off each one, so that's 16 bucks a basket. 3 of 'em is 16 times 3, that's 48 bucks. Now add 'em together, 75 and 48, that's 123 bucks.

$123"
"So we gotta clean half the rooms at the KozyInn Motel. They got 90 rooms, so half is... um... 45 rooms. 

It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so for 45 rooms, that's... *counts on fingers* ...45 x 20 = 900 minutes. 

Now, I know there's 60 minutes in an hour, so... *thinks for a moment* ...900 minutes is... *divides on fingers* ...15 hours.

"So the town is gonna build some homes. In the first year, they're gonna build 12 homes. That's a good start.

Then, in the next year, they're gonna build three times that many. So that's 3 times 12, which is 36 homes. That's a lot more.

Now, in the third year, they're gonna count how many homes they built so far, and then they're gonna build that many more. So they built 12 in the first year and 36 in the second year, that's 48 homes. Then they're gonna build 48 more, no wait, that's not right. They're gonna double that, so they're gonna build 96 more homes.

So, let's count 'em all up. They built 12 in the first year, 36 in the second year, and 96 in the third year. That's 12 + 36 + 96.

The final answer is: 144"
"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, I'm three years younger than my brother, and I'm two years older than my sister. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. When you add all our ages, you get 87.

Let's say my brother's age is B. Then my age is B - 3, 'cause I'm three years younger. My sister's age is B - 3 - 2, 'cause she's two years younger than me. That's B - 5.

My mom's age is 3B - 1, 'cause it's one less than three times my brother's age.

Now, let's add all our ages: B + (B - 3) + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87. That's a lotta B's.

Let me try to simplify it. I'll combine like terms: 5B - 9 = 87.

Now, I'll add 9 to both sides: 5B = 96.

Then, I'll divide by 5: B = 19.2. But my brother's age gotta be a whole number, so I'll try 19 and 20.

If my brother's 19, then I'm 16, my sister's 14, and my mom's 56. But that adds up to 105, not 87.

If my brother's 20, then I'm 17, my sister's 15, and my mom's 59. That adds up to 111, no, wait, 20 + 17 + 15 + 35 = 87. Yeah, that's it.

So, I'm 17.

"So Mr. Jackson got 27 kids in his class and he wanna give each one 2 glue sticks. That's a lotta glue sticks. I think we gotta figure out how many he needs first. If he gives 2 glue sticks to each kid, that's 27 x 2 = 54 glue sticks.

Now, glue sticks come in packs of 8. So we gotta see how many packs he needs. I think we divide 54 by 8. That's... um... 6 point somethin'. But you can't buy a point somethin' pack of glue sticks, right? So he's gonna need 7 packs. That way, he'll have some extras, just in case.

"So we gotta figger out how much water's passin' through the river. It starts with 4000 gallons, then it doubles after a day of heavy rain. That means it's 4000 times 2, which is 8000 gallons. Then on the third day, it goes up by 6000 more gallons. So we add 8000 and 6000, and that's 14000 gallons.

14000"
"So, we got 10 people with the plague. Each one of 'em infects 6 more people every day. 

On the first day, them 10 people infect 60 more, so that's 70 people total.

Next day, them 70 people infect 6 more each, that's 420 more people. Now we got 490 people.

Last day, them 490 people infect 6 more each, that's 2940 more people. Now we got 3430 people.

3430"
"So we gotta figger out how much money them two got in tips. Rafaela got 40 customers and each one gave her 20 bucks. That's a lotta cash. So we multiply 40 by 20 and that's 800 bucks.

Now Julieta, she got a little less. She got 10% less than Rafaela. I think that means we gotta take 10% of 800 and subtract it from 800. Um, 10% of 800 is... uh... 80 bucks. So we subtract 80 from 800 and that's 720 bucks for Julieta.

So we add 800 and 720 and that's... 1520 bucks. That's how much them two got in tips.

$1520"
"Jennifer got 12 oranges. She gave her 3 girls 2 oranges each, that's 6 oranges. Then she gave her boy 3 oranges. So she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges. Now, if she had 12 and gave away 9, that means she got 12 - 9 = 3 oranges left.

"So Claire gets 1 badge every month, that's 12 badges in a year. Amber gets 1 badge every 2 months, so that's 6 badges in a year. Now, Wendy gets 3 times more badges than Claire, so that's 3 times 12, which is 36 badges in a year.

Now, I gotta figure out how many more badges Wendy gets than Amber. That's 36 minus 6, which is... 30.

"Paige bakes 2 loaves of banana bread every hour. She did this for 5 hours, from 1 to 6. So she made 2 x 5 = 10 loaves. 

Each loaf gets cut into 8 slices. So she got 10 x 8 = 80 slices. 

She sells each slice for 50 cents. I think that's like half a dollar. So she made 80 x 0.50 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"Gretchen got a bunch of coins. She got 30 more gold coins than them silver ones. If she got 70 gold coins, I reckon we can figger out how many silver coins she got. 

If she got 30 more gold coins than silver coins, that means we subtract 30 from 70. That's 40 silver coins. Now we add the gold and silver coins together. That's 70 gold coins plus 40 silver coins. That's 110 coins.

"So we gotta figger out how many burritos is left. Mr. George got 600 burritos for the picnic. There's 50 kids and they each got 10 burritos. That's a lotta burritos. So 50 kids times 10 burritos is... um... 500 burritos. Then Mr. George ate 20 more. So that's 500 + 20 = 520 burritos eaten.

Now we gotta subtract that from the 600 burritos. So 600 - 520 is... 80. Yeah, that's right. There's 80 burritos left.

80"
"Let's figger this out. They got 12 red cars. They got 2 less green cars than red, so that's 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

Now, they got 3 times as many blue cars as green cars. That's a lotta cars. So, 3 x 10 = 30 blue cars.

Alright, so we got 12 red, 10 green, and 30 blue. That's 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars.

They say they got 75 cars total. So, to find out how many yellow cars they got, we gotta subtract the other cars from 75. That's 75 - 52 = 23.

23"
"Let's figger this out. Sofie, Anne, and Fawn got a bunch of books together, 85 to be exact. Now, Sofie got 25 more books than Anne, and Anne got 12 fewer books than Fawn. 

So, if Anne got some books, and Fawn got 12 more than her, that means Fawn got the most. Let's say Anne got x books. Then Sofie got x + 25 books, and Fawn got x + 12 books.

Now, we add 'em all up: x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85. That's like, 3x + 37 = 85. 

Now, I ain't no math whiz, but I can subtract 37 from 85, and that's 48. So, 3x = 48. If I divide 48 by 3, I get 16. That's x, the number of books Anne got.

Now, Fawn got x + 12, so Fawn got 16 + 12 = 28 books.

"So we gotta figger out how much jello Greg's gonna need for them kids. He's got 30 kids comin' over and he wants each one to have 4 jello cups. That's a lotta jello. 

So we multiply 30 kids by 4 jello cups, that's 120 jello cups. Now we know how many cups he needs, but we don't know how many boxes he needs to buy. 

One box makes 10 cups, so we gotta divide 120 cups by 10 cups. That's 12 boxes. Now we know he needs 12 boxes.

Jello's on sale for $1.25 a box. So we multiply 12 boxes by $1.25. That's $15.

"So Madeline and Keenan, they're roommates, right? They split the grocery bill. It's like, $400 a month. Now, Madeline pays 60% of that. That means Keenan pays the rest, which is 40%. 

So, 40% of $400 is... um... that's like, 0.4 times $400. That's $160. That's what Keenan pays each month. Now, we gotta figure out how much that is per week. There's 4 weeks in a month, so we divide $160 by 4. That's... $40.

"Tobias had 60 pieces of pizza. He ate 2/5 of 'em the first day. I think that's like, 2 parts out of 5. So if I take 60 and divide it by 5, that's 12. Then I multiply 12 by 2, that's 24 pieces.

Next day, he ate 10 more. So now we gotta subtract 24 and 10 from 60. That's 60 - 24 - 10 = 26.

Now, he ate 7/13 of what's left. I think that's like, 7 parts out of 13. So if I take 26 and divide it by 13, that's 2. Then I multiply 2 by 7, that's 14 pieces.

So, he ate 24, then 10, then 14. That's 24 + 10 + 14 = 48.

Now, David wants 3 sodas and 2 waters. So 3 sodas is 3 times 3, that's 9 bucks. And 2 waters is 2 times 2, that's 4 bucks. Add 'em together, that's 9 plus 4, that's 13 bucks.

He's gonna sell 'em for 50 bucks each, so he's gonna make 180 x 50 = 9000 bucks. But he only wants to make a profit of 2000 bucks, so that means he spent some money on them chickens.

Let's say he spent x bucks on the chickens. Then he sold 'em for x + 2000 bucks. We know he sold 'em for 9000 bucks, so we can say x + 2000 = 9000.

Now, if we subtract 2000 from both sides, we get x = 7000. That's how much he spent on them chickens.

"So Kelly's got some stuff in her cart, and we gotta figger out how much it's all gonna cost. 

First, she's got 5 packs of bacon, and that's 10 bucks. Then she's got 6 packs of chicken, and them's twice as much as the bacon. So if 5 packs of bacon is 10 bucks, that's 2 bucks a pack. And if chicken's twice as much, that's 4 bucks a pack. So 6 packs of chicken is 24 bucks.

She's also got 3 packs of strawberries, and them's 4 bucks each. That's 12 bucks. And she's got 7 packs of apples, and them's half the price of strawberries. So that's 2 bucks a pack, and 7 packs is 14 bucks.

Now, let's add it all up: 10 bucks for bacon, 24 bucks for chicken, 12 bucks for strawberries, and 14 bucks for apples. That's 60 bucks.

Kelly's got 65 bucks, so she's got 65 minus 60 bucks left. That's 5 bucks.

"So the singer got 50 microphones and he wanna put 'em in pairs on stage. But then he finds out 20% of 'em won't fit. I think 20% means like, if you got 100 things, 20 of 'em. So for 50 things, it's like, half of 20, which is 10. 

So 10 microphones won't fit. That leaves 50 - 10 = 40 microphones. Now, he's puttin' 'em in pairs, so I gotta divide 40 by 2. That's like, 40 cookies and I'm puttin' 'em in bags of 2. I'd have 20 bags.

"So Jerry sees some birds, right? He sees 6 birds in the bushes. Then he sees some more birds flyin' overhead. That's 2/3 of 6, which is like, if you had 6 cookies and you gave 2 of 'em to your friend, and then you gave another cookie to your other friend, that's like 4 cookies. So there's 4 birds flyin' overhead.

Then there's birds eatin' on the ground. There's 3 groups of 'em, and each group has 8 birds. That's like 3 baskets with 8 apples in each basket. So that's 3 x 8, which is 24 birds.

Now, let's count all the birds together. We got 6 in the bushes, 4 flyin' overhead, and 24 eatin' on the ground. That's 6 + 4 + 24, which is... 34.

"Lani had 55 cookies. She ate 5. So she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left. She put 'em in 5 jars. So I gotta divide 50 by 5. That's 10 cookies in each jar.

"Let's count the petals. Joelle got 5 orchids and they each got 5 petals. So that's 5 x 5, that's 25 petals for the orchids. Now, she got 4 daisies and they each got 10 petals. That's 4 x 10, that's 40 petals for the daisies. Now I gotta figure out how many more petals the daisies got than the orchids. That's 40 - 25, that's 15.

"Let's see... Mrs. Smith got 100 plants. One-fourth of 'em are indoors, so that's like 25 plants. That leaves 75 plants outside. Now, two-thirds of them outside plants are just regular outdoor plants, so that's like 50 plants. That means the rest, 25 plants, are them flowering plants.

So, if 25 out of 100 plants are flowering plants, that's like... 25 percent.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got this whatchamacallit thingy that spins at 121 meters per second. Now, it says it spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. So if we take 121 and divide it by 11, we get the speed of the thingamabob. That's 11 meters per second.

Now, the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob. So we take 11 and multiply it by 5. That's 55 meters per second.

"Ellen buys a salad for 6 bucks and a yogurt for half that, so the yogurt's 3 bucks. That's 9 bucks for them two things. She pays 11 bucks total, so the carrots must be 2 bucks. She eats 2 carrots, so that's 1 buck a carrot.

"So Mark works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. That's a lotta hours. He used to make 10 bucks an hour, but now he makes 2 bucks more, so that's 12 bucks an hour. 

Now, let's see... 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, that's 8 x 5, um... that's 40 hours a week. And he makes 12 bucks an hour, so that's 40 x 12... that's a lotta math... um... that's 480 bucks a week.

"So Tasha made 80 bucks last month from sellin' lemonade and mowin' lawns. She mowed Kamala's lawn a bunch more times than Joe's. Like, three times more. And then she mowed Alba's lawn a whole lotta times more than Joe's, like five times more. Joe paid her 6 bucks for mowin' his lawn.

So if she mowed Kamala's lawn three times more than Joe's, that's 3 times 6 bucks, which is 18 bucks. And if she mowed Alba's lawn five times more than Joe's, that's 5 times 6 bucks, which is 30 bucks.

Addin' all that up, she made 6 bucks from Joe, 18 bucks from Kamala, and 30 bucks from Alba. That's 54 bucks from mowin' lawns. Now, if she made 80 bucks total, and 54 bucks was from mowin' lawns, then she made the rest from sellin' lemonade. That's 80 minus 54, which is...

"So we gotta figger out Harry's weight. Martin weighs 55 kg. Carl weighs 16 kg more than Martin, so that's 55 + 16, that's 71 kg. Christian weighs 8 kg more than Carl, so that's 71 + 8, that's 79 kg. Now Harry weighs 5 kg less than Christian, so that's 79 - 5, that's 74 kg.

"So John rents out his car 10 times a month, and each time it's for 3 hours. That's a lot of hours. Let me see... 10 times 3 is... um... 30 hours. Yeah, that's right.

He gets 25 bucks an hour, so if he works 30 hours, that's... uh... 25 times 30... that's a lot of math... *counts on fingers* ...that's 750 bucks.

Now, his car payment is 500 bucks, so if he makes 750 and has to pay 500, that means he's got... *counts on fingers again* ...250 bucks left over. That's his profit, right?

$250"
"So Martha got 5 more notebooks and now she got 7. That means she had 2 before. Joseph had 3 times as many as her, so he had 3 times 2, that's 6.

Now Martha got 7 and Joseph got 6. So she got 1 more than him.

"Dijana went rowin' 50 miles. Anis went a bit more, 1/5 more than Dijana. That's like, 10 more miles. So Anis went 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, I add 'em together. Dijana went 50, Anis went 60. That's 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

"So Susan made 100 cookies and her husband took 4. That means there's 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left. Now she gotta give 'em to her 6 nephews. I think if you take 96 cookies and divide 'em by 6, that's like... 16 cookies for each nephew.

"Denise read 10 pages yesterday. Daniel read 13 pages yesterday. Today, Denise read 5 more than Daniel read yesterday. So Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. That's 10 + 18 = 28 pages for Denise.

Daniel didn't read nothin' today. He only read 13 pages yesterday. So Daniel read 13 pages total.

Denise read 28 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. That's 28 - 13 = 15 more pages Denise read than Daniel.

"So Calvin's got a big pot of soup, and it's enough for 4 grown-ups or 8 kids. He's a grown-up, and he's eatin' with his wife, who's also a grown-up, and they got 2 kids. They all eat one bowl, so that's 2 grown-up bowls and 2 kid bowls.

Now, I know 1 grown-up bowl is like 2 kid bowls, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 kid bowls for the grown-ups, and 2 kid bowls for the kids. That's 6 kid bowls in total.

The pot's got 8 kid bowls, so we subtract 6 from 8, and that's 2 kid bowls left. There's 2 kids, so they can each have 1 bowl of soup from the leftover.

"I think I can figger this out. So William bought 5 notebooks for $1.50 each, that's a lotta notebooks. So 5 times $1.50 is... um... $7.50. And he also got a ballpen for $0.50. So I add $7.50 and $0.50... that's $8.00.

"So Jo's makin' face masks. She can make 4 little ones with 2 yards of stuff, and 3 big ones with 2.25 yards. Now, she wants to make 20 little ones and 8 big ones. 

For them little ones, she needs 2 yards for every 4 masks. So for 20 masks, that's 20 divided by 4, which is 5. And she needs 2 yards for each of them 5, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 yards.

For them big ones, she needs 2.25 yards for every 3 masks. So for 8 masks, that's 8 divided by 3, which is 2 and 2/3. And she needs 2.25 yards for each of them 2 and 2/3, so that's 2.25 times 2 and 2/3, which is 6 yards.

Now, add 'em together: 10 yards for the little ones, and 6 yards for the big ones. That's 16 yards.

"So Deepa saw them Fast and Furious movies a whole lotta times. She saw each one 3 times, and there's 9 of 'em. That's a lotta movie watchin'. So she saw 9 x 3 = 27 movies in the theatre. Now, she spent $216 on all them movies. To figger out how much she paid per ticket, I gotta divide the total amount by the number of movies she saw. That's $216 ÷ 27. That's... um... $8.

"Harold sleeps a lot, 10 hours a night. He works a bit less than that, 2 hours less, so that's 8 hours. Then he walks his dog for 1 hour. That's a lot of stuff he's doin'.

A third of 9 red ones is like, 3. So he's got 9 - 3 = 6 red ones left. And he's got 7 - 3 = 4 blue ones left.

So, in total, he's got 4 blue ones and 6 red ones left. That's 10 shoe boxes.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, Duncan's 60 now, and we wanna know how old Adam's gonna be in 8 years. 

Okay, so 8 years ago, Duncan was 52. And that's s'posed to be twice as old as Adam was 4 years ago. So, if we take Adam's age 4 years ago and multiply it by 2, we should get 52. 

Let's call Adam's age 4 years ago ""x"". Then, 2 times x is 52. So, x is 52 divided by 2, which is 26. That's Adam's age 4 years ago. 

Now, if Adam was 26, 4 years ago, that means he's 26 + 4 = 30 now. And in 8 years, he'll be 30 + 8 = 38.

"Farmer Brown's got 200 acres. Farmer Smith's got a lot more, 100 acres more than twice what Farmer Brown's got. So, Farmer Smith's got 2 times 200, that's 400, plus 100 more, that's 500 acres.

Now, if we add 'em together, we get 200 for Farmer Brown and 500 for Farmer Smith. That's 700 acres.

So, them red balloons got 2 pieces each, that's 20 x 2 = 40 pieces. That means the yellow ones got 58 - 40 = 18 pieces. 

Now, them yellow ones got 3 pieces each, so we gotta divide 18 by 3. That's 6.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, so that's 10 minus 2, which is 8 hours. Now, I gotta add 'em all up: 5 hours on Tuesday, 10 hours on Wednesday, and 8 hours on Thursday. That's 5 + 10 + 8, which is... 23.

Addin' all that up, we get 11 plus 3 plus 14, which is 28 bucks. Now, they both got the same amount, so we gotta split that in half. 28 divided by 2 is 14.

"Kira got a bunch of fruit from the store. She got 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. That's a lotta fruit. If we count 'em all up, that's 3 + 5 + 6. Um, that's 14.

Now, Lola ate some. She ate 2. So we gotta take 2 away from 14. That's 14 - 2. That's 12.

12"
"So we gotta count all the kids playin' sports. There's 6 kids playin' tennis. Then there's twice that many playin' volleyball, so that's 12. And for soccer, we got 16 boys and 22 girls, so that's 38 kids playin' soccer. Now, we just add 'em all up: 6 + 12 + 38. That's a lotta kids.

56"
"So we gotta figger out how much money them kids made from sellin' them lollipops. They got 30 kids in the class, and each kid sold 10 lollipops. That's a lotta lollipops. 

First, we gotta know how much they made from sellin' 'em. Each lollipop was 80 cents, so we multiply 300 lollipops by 80 cents. That's 300 x 0.8 = $240.

Now we gotta know how much they paid for 'em. They paid 50 cents each, so we multiply 300 lollipops by 50 cents. That's 300 x 0.5 = $150.

Now we subtract how much they paid from how much they made. That's $240 - $150 = $90.

$90"
"So, Larry's got a bunch of pets. He's got 3 cats, that's a good start. Then he's got 3 times as many dogs as cats, so that's 3 x 3, that's 9 dogs. Now, he's got 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so that's 9 - 2, that's 7 rabbits. 

Now we're gettin' to the fish, he's got a tank with 3 times as many fish as rabbits, so that's 3 x 7, that's 21 fish. And then he's got some gerbils, 1/3 the number of fish, so that's 21 / 3, that's 7 gerbils.

Alright, so let's count 'em all up: 3 cats, 9 dogs, 7 rabbits, 21 fish, and 7 gerbils. That's 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7... that's 47.

47"
"So we got a loaf of bread with 24 slices. Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much as her. That means Josh eats 4 slices a day. 

So together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day. Now, we gotta figure out how many days the bread's gonna last. We do that by dividin' the total slices, 24, by how many they eat in a day, 6.

24 divided by 6 is 4.

"Martha's been collectin' shells since she was 5. She gets one shell every month. Now she's gonna be 10. Let's see... from 5 to 10, that's 5 years. There's 12 months in a year, so that's 5 x 12 = 60 months. She gets one shell a month, so she'll have 60 shells.

"Lemme think this through. Lana's got 27 cups, and she's makin' rows with 'em. She's got 3 rows, and she's puttin' the same amount of chamomile and mint tea in each one. Then she's got some cups left over, and she's makin' 15 cups of cinnamon tea with 'em.

So, if she's got 27 cups and she's makin' 15 cups of cinnamon tea, that means she's got 27 - 15 = 12 cups left for the chamomile and mint tea.

Now, she's puttin' these 12 cups into 3 rows, so each row's gotta have 12 / 3 = 4 cups. And since she's puttin' the same amount of chamomile and mint tea in each row, that means there's 4 / 2 = 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

"So the sloth wants 24 berries in 8 hours. It takes him 4 hours to go down, get berries, and come back up. That means he can only go down and come back up 2 times in 8 hours. 

If he wants 24 berries and he can only go down 2 times, then he needs to get 24 berries divided by 2 trips. That's 12 berries each time he goes down.

The final answer is: 12"
"So we gotta figger out how much water's left in the tank after 6 days. First, we gotta know how much water's in the tank to start with. The pool's got 10000 gallons, and they fill the tank with half that. So that's 10000 divided by 2, which is 5000 gallons.

Now, they use 500 gallons a day from the tank. So after 6 days, that's 500 times 6, which is 3000 gallons they used. 

So we gotta subtract that from the 5000 gallons they started with. That's 5000 minus 3000, which is 2000 gallons.

"Let's figger this out. Colby gets 150 bucks a month for movies. He's already seen some movies and had some snacks. He saw 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays, them's 10 bucks each, so that's 50 bucks. He saw 8 movies on other days, them's 7 bucks each, so that's 56 bucks. He had 2 big ol' tubs of popcorn, them's 8 bucks each, so that's 16 bucks. And he had 4 boxes of candy, them's 2 bucks each, so that's 8 bucks.

So he spent 50 + 56 + 16 + 8, that's 130 bucks. He got 150 - 130, that's 20 bucks left. He wants popcorn and candy tonight, that's 8 + 2, that's 10 bucks. He'll have 20 - 10, that's 10 bucks left.

It's Friday, so the movie ticket's 10 bucks. He can see one more movie.

Answer: 1"
"So Andrew made a bunch of mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins. He made 200 of the cinnamon rolls and 300 of the blueberry muffins. Now, I know a normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. But these are mini, so they got less calories. They got 1/3rd of the calories of the normal ones.

So, a mini cinnamon roll got 600 / 3 = 200 calories. And Andrew made 200 of 'em, so that's 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories. A mini blueberry muffin got 450 / 3 = 150 calories. And Andrew made 300 of 'em, so that's 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Now, I add 'em together, 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories. That's a lot of calories.

"So Rita's pickin' Junebugs off her plants. She got 39 on Monday. Then on Tuesday and Wednesday, she got twice as many as Monday, so that's 78 each day. Thursday was 48 and Friday was 57.

Let's add 'em all up: 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57. That's a lotta Junebugs. I think it's... 300. Yeah, 300.

Now we gotta figure out how many she gets on average. We do that by dividin' the total by how many days. There's 5 days, so... 300 divided by 5 is... 60.

60"
"So we gotta figger out how much farther the bus went than the car. 

First, we gotta see how far each one went. The bus went 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. That's like, a lotta miles. So we multiply 60 by 5, and that's 300 miles. 

The car went 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. That's a pretty long time. So we multiply 30 by 8, and that's 240 miles.

Now we gotta see how much farther the bus went. So we subtract the car's miles from the bus's miles. That's 300 minus 240, and that's 60.

"Let's count the toys. We got 31 blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 rings. That's a lot of stuff. If we add 'em all up, we get 31 + 8 + 9 = 48. Now, Sophie says she got 62 toys in total. So, we gotta figure out how many bouncy balls she got. 

If we take the total number of toys, 62, and subtract the other toys, 48, we get... 62 - 48 = 14. That's how many bouncy balls she got.

14"
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So we got Peter, Paul, and John, and they's all together 100 years old. Now, Paul's 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is the same as Paul and John's age put together.

Let's say John's age is somethin'. If Paul's 10 years older than John, then Paul's age is that somethin' plus 10. And if Peter's age is the same as Paul and John's age put together, then Peter's age is that somethin' plus (that somethin' plus 10).

So we got:
- John's age: somethin'
- Paul's age: somethin' + 10
- Peter's age: (somethin' + 10) + somethin'

Now, we know they's all together 100 years old, so we can add 'em up:
somethin' + (somethin' + 10) + (somethin' + somethin' + 10) = 100

That's a lotta somethins, but I think I can figger it out. Let's just say that somethin' is... 20. Then:
- John's age: 20
- Paul's age: 20 + 10 = 30
- Peter's age: 30 + 20 = 50

And when we add 'em up: 20 + 30 + 50 = 100! That's right!

"So Maria got 4 friends over and gave each 2 water balloons. That's 8 balloons for her friends. She had 1 for herself, so that's 9 balloons. Then her mom comes out and gives each of 'em 3 more. There's 5 of 'em, so that's 5 x 3 = 15 more balloons. Now we add 'em all up, 9 + 15 = 24.

They can only put 2 boxes on a table, so they need 60 divided by 2 tables, that's 30 tables. But they already got 15 tables, so they need 30 minus 15, that's 15 more tables.

15"
"So we gotta figger out how far them seeds go, right? Zoey got 40 seeds and she spits 'em 10 feet each. That's a lotta seeds. So we multiply 40 by 10, that's 400 feet. Sydney got 35 seeds and she spits 'em 12 feet each. That's a lotta feet too. So we multiply 35 by 12, that's 420 feet.

Now we gotta find the average. That means we add 'em together and divide by 2. So 400 plus 420 is 820. Then we divide that by 2, that's 410.

410"
"So we gotta figger out how much more cash Fern's gonna make with the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000. 

First, we need to know how many widgets each thingy makes in a day. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. Thats 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets a day. Now, we gotta multiply that by 30 days, so thats 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. Thats 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets a day. Now, we gotta multiply that by 30 days, so thats 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now we know how many widgets each thingy makes, we gotta figger out how much cash they make. Each widget sells for 6 bucks. So the Widgeteer 3000 makes 43200 * 6 = 259200 bucks a month. The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 32400 * 6 = 194400 bucks a month.

Now we just subtract the smaller number from the bigger number, so thats 259200 - 194400 = 64800.

The 24-hour deal is 1600 pesos. The 12-hour deal is 1000 pesos, and then you can add 70 pesos for every hour after that. So, Cameron's got 5 extra hours, that's 5 x 70 = 350 pesos. Add that to the 1000 pesos, and that's 1350 pesos.

Now, if Cameron pays for 24 hours, that's 1600 pesos. But if he does the 12-hour deal with extra hours, that's 1350 pesos. So, he saves... 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"So Nate's got goats and sheep, and they need hay. Goats need 5 pounds each, that's easy. Sheep need a little less than twice what the goats need, so that's a bit tricky. Twice what the goats need is 10 pounds, and 3 less than that is 7 pounds. So sheep need 7 pounds each.

Now, let's figure out how much hay Nate needs. He's got 15 goats, so that's 15 x 5, which is 75 pounds. And he's got 12 sheep, so that's 12 x 7, which is 84 pounds. Add 'em together, and you get 75 + 84, which is 159 pounds.

"Let's figger this out. John makes 50 bucks an hour, and he worked 6 hours. That's a lotta money. So, 50 times 6 is... um... 300 bucks. He made 300 bucks.

Now, he spends 50 bucks on gas, so that leaves him with... 300 minus 50... that's 250 bucks.

He buys 5 pencils, and they cost 10 bucks each. That's... um... 5 times 10... 50 bucks. So now he's got... 150 minus 50... that's 100 bucks.

Now, he wants to buy them pens that cost 25 bucks each. How many can he buy? Well, if he's got 100 bucks, and each pen costs 25 bucks... that's... um... 100 divided by 25... that's 4.

Now, his brother did 50 more letters than Craig. So we add 50 to 300. That's 350 letters for his brother.

To get the total, we add Craig's letters to his brother's letters. That's 300 + 350. I think that's... 650.

Then he rests for half that time, so that's 3 hours.

Now he's gotta swim the rest of the way, which is 8 miles. But he's goin' slower now, only 1 mile per hour. So that's 8 hours.

We know they all scored 45 points together. So if we add up Azibo's points, Bahati's points, and Dinar's points, we get 45. 

Let's say Azibo scored 5 points. Then Bahati scored 5 + 20 = 25 points, and Dinar scored 5 + 10 = 15 points.

Now, it says the island had 4 times as many holes by the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. So, 4 times 10 is 40. That's how many holes they had by the end of the fourth day.

So, how many holes did they dig on the fourth day? Well, we know they had 29 holes by the end of the third day, and 40 by the end of the fourth day. That means they dug 40 - 29 = 11 holes on the fourth day.

Let's say Adelwolfe caught x Pokémon. Then Stan caught 4x - 13, and Alex caught 4x - 8.

We know they caught 339 together, so we can set up an equation: x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339.

Now, I ain't no math whiz, but I can add and subtract. So, let's do that: x + 4x - 13 + 4x - 8 = 339. That's 9x - 21 = 339.

Now, let's add 21 to both sides: 9x = 360.

Then, let's divide by 9: x = 40.

So Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokémon. Now, let's find out how many Stan caught: 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 147.

"So John's watchin' this show, right? Each episode's 20 minutes long. Now, I'm thinkin', if there's half as many episodes as minutes in an episode, that means there's 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

So, if John watches all 10 episodes, and each one's 20 minutes, that's 10 x 20 = 200 minutes. That's how long he'll be sittin' there watchin' TV.

"So the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. That's a lotta miles. I think it's 10 times 30, so that's 300 miles. Then it flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. That's 2 times 18, so that's 36 miles. But it was flyin' north, so we gotta subtract that from the 300 miles. That's 300 minus 36, which is 264 miles. Then it flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. That's 5 times 22, so that's 110 miles. We add that to the 264 miles, so that's 264 plus 110, which is 374 miles.

The final answer is: 374"
"Greta made a batch of brownies, a dozen of 'em. That's 12. Then her office gave her half a dozen, that's 6. And her friends, they gave her 4 dozen, that's a whole lotta brownies, 48. So we add 'em all up, 12 + 6 + 48, that's 66 brownies.

Now, during the party, they ate a bunch, 1 and a half dozen, that's 18. So we gotta subtract that from the total, 66 - 18, that's 48.

48"
"So Nani's 8 years old. His brother's twice as old, so that's 8 times 2, that's 16. Now, his sister's 25% younger than Nani. I think that means we gotta take a little bit off Nani's age. 25% is like a quarter, so if we take a quarter of 8, that's 2. So we take 2 away from 8, and that's 6. That's how old his sister is.

Now we add all their ages together. Nani's 8, his brother's 16, and his sister's 6. That's 8 + 16 + 6. That's 30.

"So Andy's gotta string a bunch of tennis racquets. He's got 3 that need synthetic gut, 5 that need polyester, and 4 that need a mix of both. 

Stringin' with synthetic gut takes 15 minutes per racquet, so that's 3 * 15 = 45 minutes. Polyester takes 22 minutes per racquet, so that's 5 * 22 = 110 minutes. And them hybrid ones take 18 minutes, so that's 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Addin' all them minutes up, I get 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

227"
"So John's buyin phones for him, his wife, and 2 kids. Thats 4 phones. The first 2 phones are full price, thats 2 x 600, thats 1200 bucks. The other 2 phones are half price, so thats 2 x 300, thats 600 bucks. Add em together, thats 1200 + 600, thats 1800 bucks.

$1800"
"So Zeke's team got 7 more players than Carlton's. Carlton's team got 13 players. So if we add 7 to 13, that's how many players Zeke's team got. That's 20. Now we add 20 and 13 together to get the total number of players. That's 33.

33"
"So we gotta figure out how many slats Robert needs for his fence. First, we gotta know how long the fence is all the way around. It's like a big rectangle, right? So we add up the long sides and the short sides. 

The long sides are 15 feet each, and the short sides are 10 feet each. So we add 'em up: 15 + 15 + 10 + 10. That's 50 feet. Now we know the fence is 50 feet all the way around.

Robert needs 2 slats for every foot, so we multiply 50 by 2. That's 100. 

100"
"So Mrs. Harrington got 12 boxes of oranges. Each box got 20 oranges in it. That's a lotta oranges. So she got 12 x 20 oranges, that's 240 oranges.

Then she gave some away. She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each. That's 4 boxes. So she gave away 4 x 20 oranges, that's 80 oranges.

Now she got 240 - 80 oranges left, that's 160 oranges. She kept a quarter of 'em, that's 1/4. So she kept 160 x 1/4, that's 40 oranges.

So she sold the rest, that's 160 - 40 oranges, that's 120 oranges.

120"
"I think I can figger this out. The USA got 50 states, right? So half of that's 25. Now, India got 4 more than that, so that's 29. That's how many states India got. 

Now, if we add 'em together, that's 50 for the USA and 29 for India. That's... um... 79.

"So Tyler wants them books, right? He needs 18 bucks for one, 13 bucks for another, and 8 bucks for the last one. That's a lotta money. Let's add it up. 18 + 13 + 8 is... um... 39 bucks. He already got 14 bucks saved up, so he still needs... 39 - 14... that's 25 bucks.

Now, he gets 5 bucks an hour. So if he needs 25 bucks, and he gets 5 bucks an hour... that's like... 25 divided by 5... that's 5 hours. Yeah, he gotta work 5 hours.

5"
"So we gotta figger out how many more cherries Robert got than Jerry. Robert got 30 cherries, and he got 10 more than Richard. So Richard got 20 cherries. 

Now, we know they all got 60 cherries together. Robert and Richard got 30 and 20, that's 50. So Jerry got 60 - 50, that's 10 cherries.

Robert got 30, Jerry got 10. So Robert got 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"Let's figger this out. Sunny sold some gingerbread and apple pie. On Satiddy, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than Satiddy, so that's 10 + 5 = 15 boxes. That's a lotta gingerbread.

Now, let's add 'em up. 10 boxes on Satiddy and 15 boxes on Sunday. That's 10 + 15 = 25 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, about them apple pies. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes. On Satiddy, he sold 4 fewer boxes than Sunday, so that's 15 - 4 = 11 boxes. That's a buncha pies.

Now, let's add 'em up. 11 boxes on Satiddy and 15 boxes on Sunday. That's 11 + 15 = 26 boxes of apple pies.

Gingerbread costs 6 bucks a box, and apple pies cost 15 bucks a box. So, let's multiply.

25 boxes of gingerbread * 6 bucks = 150 bucks
26 boxes of apple pies * 15 bucks = 390 bucks

Now, let's add that up. 150 + 390 = 540 bucks.

"Pamela's gonna be outside 4 hours a day, and she puts on sunscreen every hour. That's 4 times a day. She's gonna be on vacation for 8 days, so that's 4 times a day, 8 days. That's a lotta sunscreen.

Let's see... 4 times a day, 8 days... that's 32 times she's gonna put on sunscreen. And each time she puts on 1 ounce. So that's 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. So if we take 32 ounces and divide it by 8 ounces, that's... um... 4.

"So the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, right? And the blue car costs $100. I think I can figger this out.

If the red car is 40% cheaper, that means it's 40% less than the blue car. So I gotta find 40% of $100. Um, that's like... 40 out of 100, so that's $40.

So the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. That means it's $100 - $40 = $60.

Now, if I wanna know how much both cars cost, I just add 'em together. $100 for the blue car and $60 for the red car. That's... $160.

$160"
"So Emil's 19 now, and when he's 24, he'll be half as old as his dad. That means his dad's gonna be 48 when Emil's 24. But Emil's only 19 now, so we gotta subtract 5 from 48 to get his dad's age now. That's 43.

Now, when Emil's 24, he'll be twice as old as his brother. So his brother's gonna be 12 when Emil's 24. But again, Emil's only 19 now, so we gotta subtract 5 from 12 to get his brother's age now. That's 7.

So, his dad's 43 and his brother's 7. We add those together, and we get... 50.

"Adrianne got beads from her mom, sister, and friend. Her mom gave her 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more than her mom, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mom, so that's 2 times 20, which is 40 beads.

Now, let's count 'em all up: 20 from her mom, 30 from her sister, and 40 from her friend. That's 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.

"So Joe caught some crawfish. On Thursday, he got 3 pounds. Then on Friday, he got a whole lot more, 4 times more, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 pounds. Then on Saturday, he got half of what he got on Friday, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

So if we add all them up, we get 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds. Now, I know 1 serving is 3 pounds, so I gotta divide 21 by 3. That's 7.

7"
"So we gotta figger out how many kids are leavin early. First, we gotta find out how many are football players. 20% of 30 is like, um, 6 kids. 

Now we gotta find out how many kids are left. That's 30 minus 6, which is 24. 

Next, we gotta find out how many of them 24 kids are cheerleaders or in the band. That's 25% of 24, which is like, 6 kids.

So we add the football players and the cheerleaders and band kids together. That's 6 + 6, which is 12.

12"
"So we gotta figure out the average shoe size of Charlie and Sophie. Sophie's got size 5 boots, that's a fact. Now Charlie's boots are 5 times bigger than Sophie's, so that's 5 times 5, which is 25.

Now we add their shoe sizes together, 5 + 25, that's 30. Then we divide that by 2, 'cause there's two of 'em, and that's 15.

"I'm gonna figger out how much Pat's gonna spend on them flowers. 

First, I need to know how many flowers she can fit in her flower bed. It's 111 feet long, but them flowers are measured in inches, so I gotta convert it. I think there's 12 inches in a foot, so I multiply 111 by 12.

That's a lotta numbers, but I got a calculator. It says 111 x 12 is 1332. Now I know her flower bed is 1332 inches long.

Them flowers are 12 inches wide, and she needs to leave 1.5 feet between 'em. I think that's 18 inches. So each flower takes up 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now I divide 1332 by 30. That's... um... 44.4. I don't think you can have a half a flower, so I'll just use 44.

But Pat already got 17 flowers, so she only needs 44 - 17 = 27 more.

Each flower costs 6 bucks, so I multiply 27 by 6. That's... 162.

"Katherine's got 5 baskets to fill up. She wants 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines in each one. Petunias cost 3 bucks each, and them sweet potato vines cost 2.50 each.

So, she's gonna need 3 petunias for each of them 5 baskets. That's 3 times 5, which is 15 petunias. Them petunias cost 3 bucks each, so that's 15 times 3, which is 45 bucks.

She's also gonna need 2 sweet potato vines for each basket. That's 2 times 5, which is 10 vines. Them vines cost 2.50 each, so that's 10 times 2.50, which is 25 bucks.

So, she's gonna spend 45 bucks on petunias and 25 bucks on vines. That's 45 plus 25, which is 70 bucks.

"So they got 30 pounds of dirt, right? And they wanna plant some flowers. Sunflowers need 3 pounds each, and they're plantin' 4 of 'em. That's 4 x 3 = 12 pounds. Carnations need 1.5 pounds each, and they're plantin' 10 of 'em. That's 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds. So they used 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of dirt so far.

Now, they got 30 pounds of dirt, and they used 27 pounds. That leaves 'em with 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of dirt. Roses need 1 pound each, so they can plant 3 roses.

"So Jessica makes 2,000 bucks a month. She puts away a quarter of that for them fancy shoes. That's like, 500 bucks a month. Now, if she does that for a whole year, that's 12 months, she'll have 500 * 12 = 6,000 bucks.

Them shoes cost 1,000 bucks a pop. So if she's got 6,000 bucks, she can buy... um... 6,000 / 1,000 = 6 shoes.

Now, she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. I gotta figger out how long it takes her to cook 90. If 30 takes 10 minutes, then 90 takes... um... 3 times that, 'cause 90 is 3 times 30. So, 3 times 10 is 30 minutes.

So, it takes her 15 minutes to peel 'em and 30 minutes to cook 'em. That's 15 + 30, that's... 45 minutes.

"So the air conditioner was on low for 3 hours, and it cools 2 degrees an hour. That's 3 x 2, which is 6 degrees. Then it was on high for 4 hours, and that's 3 degrees an hour. So that's 4 x 3, which is 12 degrees. Add 'em together, that's 18 degrees it cooled.

But then it was off for 2 hours, and the room gets 2 degrees hotter each hour. So that's 2 x 2, which is 4 degrees. Now we gotta subtract that from the 18 degrees it cooled. That's 18 - 4, which is 14 degrees.

So the room is 14 degrees cooler than when we started.

"Let's figger this out. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30. Now, Bill saw the comet again when he was 3 times as old as his dad was when he saw it. So Bill was 3 x 30 = 90 years old when he saw it the second time.

Now, the comet comes around every 75 years. So if Bill was 90 when he saw it the second time, he musta been 90 - 75 = 15 when he saw it the first time.

"Buford writes checks for lots of things. He writes one for the electric bill every month, so that's 12 checks a year. He does the same for the gas bill, that's another 12 checks. He writes two checks to the church every month, so that's 24 checks a year. And he writes a check for the pest and lawn service 4 times a year.

So, if we add all them up, that's 12 + 12 + 24 + 4. That's a lot of checks. Let me see... 12 + 12 is 24, and 24 + 24 is 48, and then you add 4 more, that's 52.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got two planes, right? One plane goes to Greece a lot, and the other plane only goes to Poland. The Poland plane makes 44 trips, but that's only half as many as the Greece plane. So the Greece plane makes 44 x 2 = 88 trips.

Now, the Greece plane goes to Greece 3/4 of the time. That's like, most of the time. So it goes to Greece 88 x 3/4 = 66 times. That means it goes somewhere else 88 - 66 = 22 times. It splits those 22 times between France and Germany.

So, it goes to France half of those 22 times. That's 22 / 2 = 11.

Tobias howls fer 20 seconds. That's a pretty good howl. Chikote howls fer twice as long as Tobias, so that's 2 times 20, which is 40 seconds. Igneous howls fer as long as them other two put together, so that's 20 + 40, which is 60 seconds.

Now we add all them seconds up: 20 + 40 + 60 is 120 seconds. But we need minutes, so we gotta divide by 60. I think that's right... yeah, 120 divided by 60 is 2.

It says she's twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age is like, the total age divided by how many kids there are. So that's 20 divided by 4, which is 5. 

Now we know Helene's twice that, so she's 10. We got Akbar's 3, Alessandro's 4, and Helene's 10. That's 17. We started with 20, so we subtract 17 from 20 to find out how old Wilfred is. That's 20 minus 17, which is 3.

Now the bride decides to give half of 'em to the church next door. So we gotta find half of 1500. That's 750 cookies.

The church gives 15 cookies to each person, so we gotta figure out how many people that is. It's 750 cookies divided by 15 cookies per person. That's... um... 50 people.

"So we got 2 grown-ups and 4 kids, and they're divvying up a watermelon. The grown-ups get slices that's twice as big as the kids'. I'm thinkin' we should figure out how much each grown-up gets.

Let's say the kids get a little slice, and the grown-ups get a big slice that's twice as big. If we add up all the slices, we got 4 little slices for the kids and 2 big slices for the grown-ups. But them big slices is like 2 little slices each, so it's like we got 4 little slices for the kids and 4 little slices for the grown-ups. That's 8 little slices in all.

Now, each grown-up gets 2 little slices, which is like 2 out of 8. That's like 1/4 of the whole watermelon. To make it a percentage, I think we gotta multiply by 100. So it's like 1/4 times 100, which is... 25%.

Then he gotta see 10 people for 30 minutes each, that's 10 x 30, which is 300 minutes. Add 'em together, that's 480 minutes. Now, I think there's 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 480 / 60, which is 8 hours. He's at the clinic for 9 hours, so he got 9 - 8 hours left. That's 1 hour.

Peter got 64 chocolates in 4 boxes, so I'm gonna divide 64 by 4. That's like, if I got 64 cookies and I put 'em in 4 jars, how many cookies I got in each jar? That's 16 cookies in each jar.

Martha got 56 chocolates in 7 boxes. I'm gonna divide 56 by 7. That's like, if I got 56 cookies and I put 'em in 7 jars, how many cookies I got in each jar? That's 8 cookies in each jar.

Now, I'm gonna see how many more chocolates Peter got in each box than Martha. Peter got 16 chocolates in each box and Martha got 8. So, I'm gonna subtract 8 from 16. That's 8.

"So we gotta figure out how many porcupines are gonna be in the park after a year. First, we need to know how many females there are. It says 3/5 of the total population is female. That's like, 3 out of 5. So if we got 50 porcupines, we multiply that by 3 and divide by 5. That's 30 females.

Now, each of them females has 4 babies every month. So that's 30 x 4 = 120 babies every month. And there's 12 months in a year, so that's 120 x 12 = 1440 babies in a year.

We already had 50 porcupines, and now we got 1440 more. So we add 'em together: 50 + 1440 = 1490.

First, we gotta find the volume of the pool. I think that's length times width times depth. So that's 25 times 14 times 4. That's a lotta numbers. 

25 times 14 is 350, and 350 times 4 is 1400. So the volume is 1400. Now the pool people said we gotta multiply that by 5.9. I don't know why, but okay. 

1400 times 5.9 is... um... 8260. So we need 8260 gallons of water. Now we just gotta multiply that by how much it costs per gallon, which is 10 cents. 

8260 times 10 cents is... um... 826 dollars. 

The final answer is: $826"

The other half, 1500, are under 16. Half of them are boys, so that's 750 boys under 16.

So, we got 375 boys over 16 and 750 boys under 16. That's 1125 boys in total.

"Let's figger this out. Wanda and Ms. B wanna fill up a tank that holds 18000 gallons of water. They wanna do it in two days.

On the first day, Wanda puts in 1/4 of the water. That's like, 1/4 of 18000, which is... um... 4500 gallons. Ms. B puts in 3/4 of what Wanda puts in, so that's 3/4 of 4500, which is... uh... 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda puts in 2/3 of what she put in the day before, so that's 2/3 of 4500, which is... hmm... 3000 gallons. Ms. B puts in 1/3 of what she put in the day before, so that's 1/3 of 3375, which is... uh... 1125 gallons.

So, let's add it all up. Wanda and Ms. B put in 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 gallons of water. That's... um... 9000 gallons.

The tank holds 18000 gallons, so we need to subtract 9000 from that. That's... uh... 9000 gallons left to fill the tank.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So, Maria's power bank was losin' charge, right? First, it was losin' 9% each hour for 5 hours. That's a lotta charge. Then it started losin' 7% each hour for 3 hours. 

Let's start with the last part. If it was losin' 7% each hour for 3 hours, that's 7 * 3 = 21%. So, before that, it had 28% + 21% = 49% charge left.

Now, let's go back to the first part. It was losin' 9% each hour for 5 hours. That's 9 * 5 = 45%. So, before that, it had 49% + 45% = 94% charge.

So, when Maria went out to the park, her power bank was 94% charged.

"So Janet's gettin' paid $10 an hour for her job, plus she gets $15 an hour in tips. That's $25 an hour. She works 40 hours a week, so that's $25 * 40 = $1000 a week.

Now, she wants to save up for a car that costs $10000. She needs 20% of that for a down payment. I think 20% is like, a fifth, right? So that's $10000 / 5 = $2000.

So she needs to save $2000, and she makes $1000 a week. That's $2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks. She needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Jamaar's got 10 bucks to spend on fruit. He's already bought some stuff. Let's see... 3 peaches and 4 pears, them's 50 cents each, so that's 7 of 'em, that's 7 times 50 cents, that's $3.50. Then he got 2 kiwis, them's a buck each, so that's 2 bucks. And 5 apples, them's 75 cents each, that's 5 times 75 cents, that's $3.75. Add all that up, that's $3.50 + $2 + $3.75, that's $9.25. He's spent $9.25.

Now, he's got 10 bucks, and he's spent $9.25, so he's got 10 - 9.25, that's 75 cents left. Plums is 25 cents each, so how many plums can he get? 75 cents divided by 25 cents, that's... uh... 3.

"So Anne got this big box of sweets, right? It's got 15 packs in it, and each pack's got 60 pieces. She kept 2 packs for herself, so that's 15 - 2 = 13 packs left. 

Now, each pack's got 60 pieces, so 13 packs is 13 x 60, that's a lot. Um, let me see... 13 x 60 is 780. 

So she's got 780 pieces to give to her friends, and she's got 10 friends. To make it fair, she'll give 'em all the same amount. So we gotta divide 780 by 10. That's... 78.

"So we gotta figger out how much them carrots gonna cost after 3 years. They start at $120 and go up 5% every year. 

First year, 5% of $120 is... um... $6. So that's $120 + $6 = $126.

Next year, 5% of $126 is... uh... $6.30. So now it's $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Last year, 5% of $132.30 is... hmm... $6.62. So now it's $132.30 + $6.62 = $138.92.

We gotta round that to the nearest whole number, so it's $139.

Now, 15 people stayed late, but they was already there, so we don't gotta do nothin' with 'em. 

Then, in the afternoon, a bunch more people came in. It was twice as many as them 15 people who stayed late. That's 2 x 15 = 30. So we add 'em to the 76: 76 + 30 = 106.

After dinner, 7 more people came in. So we add 'em too: 106 + 7 = 113.

The hotel now has 113 guests."

"So we gotta figure out how many points Aries is gonna get on this quiz. There's 60 questions, and 40% of 'em are easy. That's like, a lot of easy questions. So we gotta find out how many that is. 

I think 40% is like, 40 out of 100, right? So if we got 60 questions, we gotta find 40% of 60. That's like, 24 questions. Yeah, 24 easy questions.

Now, the rest of the questions, 60% of 'em, are average and hard. That's 60 - 24 = 36 questions. And they're split in half, so that's 18 average and 18 hard.

Aries is pretty sure she's gonna get 75% of the easy questions right. That's like, 3/4 of 24, which is 18 questions. And she's gonna get half of the average and hard questions right, so that's 9 average and 9 hard.

So if we add all them up, Aries is gonna get 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right.

"Let's think this through. If a small stuffed animal costs $4, and a big one costs 3 times that, then a big one costs $12. 

Now, let's say she sold L big ones. Then she sold 2L small ones, 'cause she sold twice as many small ones as big ones.

She made $12 for each big one, so for L big ones, she made 12L dollars. And she made $4 for each small one, so for 2L small ones, she made 4 * 2L = 8L dollars.

We know she made $120 total, so we can say 12L + 8L = 120. That's like sayin' 20L = 120.

Now, if 20L is 120, then L is 120 divided by 20, which is 6. So she sold 6 big ones.

And we said she sold twice as many small ones, so she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small ones.

"So we gotta figger out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month. They got steel pickaxes, which is good. 

First, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds with his bare hands. But with a iron pickaxe, he can mine twice that, so thats 24 pounds. Now, a steel pickaxe is even better, so he can mine 50% more than that. 50% of 24 is 12, so thats 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now we gotta multiply that by 40 dwarves and 30 days. Thats a lotta math, but I think I can do it. 36 * 40 is 1440, and then 1440 * 30 is... um... 43200.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got three packs of sandwiches, and we know how much two of 'em cost. The first one's got 2 sandwiches for 3 bucks, and the second one's got 4 sandwiches for 6 bucks. That means each sandwich in both packs costs the same, 1.50 bucks.

Now, if the price is the same for all packs, then the big pack with 8 sandwiches should cost 1.50 bucks per sandwich too. So, if we multiply 1.50 by 8, that's... um... 12 bucks.

But if the real teacher shows up, there's a 40% chance she'll give 'em all more time. And if she don't give 'em more time, there's a 20% chance Marcus can sweet-talk her into thinkin' his dog ate it.

So, let's think this through. If the sub's there, that's 50% of the time Marcus is good. If the real teacher's there, that's the other 50%. Of that 50%, she might give 'em more time, which is 40% of that 50%, so that's 20% of the time. And if she don't give 'em more time, which is 60% of that 50%, Marcus might be able to talk his way out, which is 20% of that 60%, so that's 6% of the time.

Addin' all that up, Marcus don't gotta do his homework 50% + 20% + 6% = 76% of the time. So, that means he gotta do it 100% - 76% = 24% of the time.

We gotta take away the seats for the graduates and the teachers. That's 950 for the graduates and 300 for the teachers. So that's 1250 seats taken. Now we subtract that from 6000. That's 6000 - 1250 = 4750 seats left.

Now we gotta divide that by the number of graduates. I'm thinkin' the number of graduates is 950 'cause that's how many seats they got. So we divide 4750 by 950. That's... um... 5.

So, she makes 45 bucks, but she pays 9 bucks, that's 45 - 9, that's 36 bucks. Now, she worked 18 hours, so we gotta divide 36 by 18, that's... 2 bucks an hour.

Now, let's think about this. He's gettin 50 grand in loans each year for 4 years, so that's 200 grand in loans. And he's not workin for 4 years, so he's missin out on 25 grand a year, that's 100 grand. So he's gotta make up for 200 grand in loans and 100 grand in lost wages, that's 300 grand.

He's makin 75 grand a year now, so how long's it gonna take him to make 300 grand? That's like, um, 300 grand divided by 75 grand a year... that's 4 years.

Now, on the third race, he lost 1.5 times what he won on the second. That's 1.5 x 11 = 16.50 bucks. 

So, he lost 5 bucks, then won 11, then lost 16.50. That's a total of 5 - 11 + 16.50 = 10.50 bucks lost.

So if we add up all the money, it's x + x + 80 + 2x + 160, and that's gotta equal 1920. That's a lotta numbers, but I think I can do it.

So I'm gonna add up the x's, and that's 4x. Then I'm gonna add 80 and 160, and that's 240. So now I got 4x + 240 = 1920.

Now I'm gonna subtract 240 from both sides, and that gives me 4x = 1680. Then I'm gonna divide both sides by 4, and that gives me x = 420.

So the first person gets 420 bucks.

Let's say he got x balls in the second set. Then he got x + 4 in the first set, and x/2 in the third set. 

We know he got 19 balls in all, so we can make a equation thingy: x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

Now, I'm not good at them fancy math things, but I can try to solve it. I'll just multiply everythin' by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

That's like 5x + 8 = 38. Now, I'll subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30

Then I'll divide by 5: x = 6

So he got 6 balls in the second set. Now I can find out how many he got in the first set: 6 + 4 = 10

Next, I'll find out how much it's worth in 2009. 21% of 15,800 is... um... 3328. So it's worth 15,800 minus 3328, which is 12,472.

Last, I'll find out how much it's worth in 2010. 21% of 12,472 is... um... 2618.52. So it's worth 12,472 minus 2618.52, which is... um... 9853.48.

Now, each tile costs 12 bucks. So, if ya need 200 tiles, and each one costs 12 bucks, ya just multiply 'em together. That's 200 x 12, which is... um... *counts on fingers* ...2400!

So, it's gonna cost ya $2400 to fix up that kitchen floor.

$2400"
"So James gotta pay more for insurance 'cause he had an accident. The normal price is $120 a month, but he gotta pay 60% more. I think that means we gotta figure out what 60% of $120 is. Um, that's like... 60% is like 60 out of 100, so it's like 60/100 * $120. That's... uh... $72. 

So he pays $120 plus $72, that's $192 a month. Now we gotta figure out how much that is for a whole year. There's 12 months in a year, so we multiply $192 by 12. That's... uh... $2304.

$2304"
"So, Greg gotta wash sheets for 4 twin beds and 1 big king bed every week. His washer can only do 2 twin sets or 1 king set at a time. 

For them twin beds, he gotta do 2 loads 'cause 4 divided by 2 is 2. And he gotta do 1 load for the king bed. That's 3 loads a week.

Now, there's 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply 3 loads a week by 52 weeks. That's 156 loads a year.

"So, Jill and her friends watch a bunch of movies on the weekends. They watch 4 movies on Saturdays. On Sundays, they watch half that, so that's 2 movies. 

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies. Now, if we gotta figure out how many they watch in 4 weeks, we just multiply 6 by 4. That's 24 movies.

"So, Leo had 100 stickers a couple years ago. Then he got 50 more last year. This year, he got twice as many as last year, so that's 100 more. Now, let's count 'em all up. 

100, plus 50 is 150. Then add 100 more, that's 250.

"So Imma got 3 cats, and she feeds 'em twice a day, 60 grams each time. That's 120 grams per cat per day. Now, she got 3 cats, so that's 120 * 3 = 360 grams per day.

She got 720 grams of food, and they eat 360 grams per day. So, I'ma divide 720 by 360. That's... 2.

"So Becky, Jake, and Silvia had some pizzas. There was 4 of 'em, and each one had 8 slices. That's a lot of slices. 

Becky ate 10 slices, and she ate 3 more than Jake. So Jake musta had 10 - 3 = 7 slices. 

Now Silvia, she ate twice as much as Jake. So she had 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Now we add 'em all up. Becky had 10, Jake had 7, and Silvia had 14. That's 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

The final answer is: 31"
"I think I can figger this out. So Donovan and Betsy made a meal together. Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan. The whole thing took 98 minutes. 

Let's say Donovan took x minutes. Then Betsy took x + 18 minutes. We know the whole thing took 98 minutes, so we can say x + (x + 18) = 98.

Now, I ain't no math whiz, but I can add them x's together. That's like 2x + 18 = 98. Now, if I subtract 18 from both sides, I get 2x = 80. Then I divide both sides by 2, and I get x = 40.

So Donovan took 40 minutes, and Betsy took 40 + 18 minutes. That's 58 minutes.

58"
"So we gotta figger out how much Hannah owes the doc. 

First, the cast is 200 bucks. Then the doc charges 300 bucks an hour, but she was only there for 30 minutes, so thats half an hour. Thats 300 divided by 2, so thats 150 bucks. 

Then she got 30 painkillers, and they're 4 bucks each. Thats 30 times 4, so thats 120 bucks. 

And she had to park for 2 hours, and thats 6 bucks an hour. Thats 6 times 2, so thats 12 bucks.

Now we add it all up: 200 plus 150 is 350, plus 120 is 470, plus 12 is 482.

482"
"So James gets 80 emails a day. 20% of 'em don't need no answer. That's like, a fifth of 'em, right? So 80 divided by 5 is 16. That's how many he don't gotta answer.

So he gotta answer the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails a day.

Now, if he does that for 5 days, that's 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

"So we gotta figger out how many classes went to the Science Center last week. 

On Monday, 32 classes went. Then on Tuesday, twice as many went, so that's 64. On Wednesday, three times as many went, so that's 96. Then on Thursday, 30 more went, and on Friday, 25 went.

Now, let's add 'em all up. 32 + 64 is 96. Then add 96 to that, that's 192. Then add 30, that's 222. And finally, add 25, that's 247.

"So John got 100 on his first 3 tests, that's 100 + 100 + 100, that's 300. Then he got 80 on the 4th test, so that's 300 + 80, that's 380. Now we gotta figure out what he got on average. I think that means we gotta divide 380 by 4, 'cause there's 4 tests. Um, 380 divided by 4 is... 95.

95"
"So the glee club got 20 pizzas and they ate most of 'em, like 70%. That's a lotta pizza. So they ate 14 pizzas, and that leaves 6 pizzas.

The football team, they got twice as many pizzas, so that's 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of 'em, which is 32 pizzas. That leaves 8 pizzas.

So if we add the pizzas left from both groups, we get 6 + 8 = 14.

"So Anthony's sendin' out them coupons for his pizza place. He's got 700 of the small ones and twice as many big ones, so that's 1400 big ones. Now, them small ones cost 5 cents each to mail, so that's 700 times 5 cents, which is... um... 35 bucks. Them big ones cost 15 cents each, so that's 1400 times 15 cents, which is... uh... 210 bucks. So if we add 'em together, that's 35 plus 210, which is... 245 bucks.

"So Sidney got 10 minus 3 meatball subs, that's 7. Each one got 4 meatballs, so that's 7 times 4, that's 28 meatballs. 

Then Mark ate 4 of 'em, so now Sidney got 7 minus 4, that's 3 subs left. 

Sidney got 3 more, so now he got 3 plus 3, that's 6 subs. 

Each one got 4 meatballs, so 6 times 4 is... um... 24. 

The final answer is: 24"
"Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks goin out to deliver fertiliser. But then some of 'em broke down. A quarter of 'em, to be exact. So that's like, 1/4 of 20, which is 5 trucks. 

Now we gotta figure out how many trucks made it. We had 20 trucks, but 5 broke down, so that leaves us with 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Each truck had 20 tons of fertiliser, so we multiply 15 trucks by 20 tons, and that's 15 x 20 = 300 tons.

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers:

"Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter. The store's got a deal, buy one get one half off. So, I'm thinkin', if I buy 6 pounds, that's like 3 pairs. 

For each pair, I pay full price for one, that's 4 bucks, and half price for the other, that's 2 bucks. So, for each pair, I pay 4 + 2 = 6 bucks.

I got 3 pairs, so I multiply 6 bucks by 3. That's 18 bucks.

"So Kayla's havin' a birthday party at the movies. She's gotta pay 125 bucks for the first 20 people, then 6 bucks for each extra person. She invited a bunch of people - 25 from school, 7 from dance class, and 13 family members. That's a lotta people. But 4 of 'em said they ain't comin'. So we gotta subtract those 4. That leaves us with 45 - 4 = 41 people.

Now, the first 20 people are covered by that 125 bucks. But we gotta pay for the extra 21 people. That's 21 x 6 bucks, which is 126 bucks. Then we add that to the 125 bucks, and we get... 251 bucks.

"Maggie and Riza, they both had 60 bucks. Maggie spent a quarter of hers, that's like, 15 bucks. So she's got 60 - 15 = 45 bucks left.

Riza spent a third of hers, that's like, 20 bucks. So she's got 60 - 20 = 40 bucks left.

So, if we add 'em together, they got 45 + 40 = 85 bucks left.

"So Mr. Robles got 315 bananas for his three monkeys, and that's enough for a whole week. Now, one monkey eats 10 bananas a day, that's a lot. The second monkey eats 4 more than the first, so that's 14 bananas a day. 

Now, let's see how many bananas they eat in a day together. 10 + 14 is 24. So the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas a day. 

Now, we gotta figure out how many bananas all three monkeys eat in a day. 315 bananas for a week, that's 315 divided by 7, that's 45 bananas a day. 

So, the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas a day, and all three monkeys eat 45 bananas a day. That means the third monkey eats 45 - 24 bananas a day. That's 21 bananas a day.

"So Jenny's buyin' roses. They got a deal for a dozen for 15 bucks, but she's buyin' 15 roses. That's a dozen, plus 3 more. The dozen's 15 bucks, and the 3 more are 2 bucks each, so that's 6 bucks. So she's payin' 15 + 6, that's 21 bucks.

She's got 5 fives, that's 25 bucks. She gives 'em 25, they give her 21 in roses, so she gets 25 - 21 in change, that's 4 bucks.

They only got quarters for change, so we gotta figure out how many quarters is 4 bucks. A quarter's 25 cents, so we gotta divide 4 by a quarter. That's like, 4 dollars is 400 cents, and 400 cents divided by 25 cents is... 16.

"So Paul's waitin' for a train, and he don't know how long it's gonna take. He knows it's the fourth train, though. The first train's comin' in 10 minutes, and it's gonna stay for 20 minutes. That means it's gonna leave in 30 minutes.

Then the second train's comin' 30 minutes after that, so that's 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. This train's only gonna stay for a little bit, like a quarter of what the first train stayed. The first train stayed 20 minutes, so a quarter of that's 5 minutes. So the second train's gonna leave in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

Next, the third train's comin' an hour after that, so that's 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. This train's just gonna come and go, so it's gonna leave at 125 minutes too.

Finally, the fourth train's comin' 20 minutes after that, so that's 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. That's how long Paul's gonna be waitin' for his train.

"Melanie's been savin' toothpicks for a while now. She's been gettin' 10 toothpicks a week from her mom's sandwiches for 12 weeks. That's a lotta toothpicks. Let's see... 10 toothpicks a week for 12 weeks is... um... 120 toothpicks.

She needs 200 toothpicks for that sculpture thingy. So, she still needs... 200 - 120... that's 80 toothpicks.

Now, if she gets 10 toothpicks a week, how many weeks will it take her to get 80 more toothpicks? Hmm... 80 divided by 10 is... 8.

"So Mr. Rogers bought a watch for 75% of the price, right? That means he paid 3/4 of the price. The watch was $2000, so he paid $2000 * 3/4 = $1500.

Then he sold it to his friend for 120% of what he paid. That's like 6/5 of what he paid. So his friend paid $1500 * 6/5 = $1800.

Now, let's see how much his friend saved. The watch was $2000, but his friend paid $1800. So he saved $2000 - $1800 = $200.

To find the percentage, I think you gotta divide the amount saved by the original price and multiply by 100. So it's ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got 5 springs, and each one makes a jellyfish every second. We need to know how many jellyfish they make in 4 hours.

First, we need to know how many seconds are in 4 hours. I know there's 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour. So that's 60 x 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. Now, we multiply that by 4, 'cause we got 4 hours. That's 3600 x 4 = 14400 seconds.

Now, we got 5 springs, and each one makes a jellyfish every second. So we multiply 14400 seconds by 5 springs. That's 14400 x 5 = 72000 jellyfish.

"So James walks to the store, but then he forgets somethin' and has to go back home. Then he goes to the store again. He walks 4 miles per hour. His house is 4 miles from the store.

So first, he walks half way, that's 2 miles. Then he walks back home, that's 2 miles again. Then he walks all the way to the store, that's 4 miles. That's a total of 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 miles.

Now, if he walks 4 miles per hour, and he walks 8 miles, that's 8 miles divided by 4 miles per hour. That's 2 hours.

"Jenny got 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch got 4 bananas. So she got 10 x 4 = 40 bananas. 

If she bought 'em one by one, it'd be 40 x 0.80 = 32 bucks. But she got 'em in bunches, so it's 10 x 3 = 30 bucks.

So she saved 32 - 30 = 2 bucks.

"I think I can figger this out. If Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, that means we gotta find out how much Sam gets first. Let's say Sam gets some amount, and Harry gets that amount plus 60. We know they got 100 feet total.

So if Sam gets some amount, and Harry gets that amount plus 60, we can add 'em together and it should equal 100. That's like sayin' Sam's amount plus Sam's amount plus 60 equals 100.

That's like 2 of Sam's amounts plus 60 equals 100. If we take away 60 from both sides, we're left with 2 of Sam's amounts equals 40. Then if we cut that in half, we get Sam's amount equals 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet.

Half of 'em were Trekking, that's 150. Then 15% were BMX, that's like, 45 bikes. So the rest, 300 - 150 - 45, that's 105 MTB's.

Now, let's do the math. 105 MTB's at $500 each, that's $52,500. 45 BMX's at $250 each, that's $11,250. And 150 Trekking's at $450 each, that's $67,500. Add all that up, and you get... $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

"So the farmer makes 5 bales of hay every hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales every hour. They both work for 6 hours. 

The farmer makes 5 bales an hour, so in 6 hours, that's 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 bales. The farmer made 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales an hour, so in 6 hours, that's 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 bales. The truck picked up 18 bales.

Now, if the farmer made 30 bales and the truck picked up 18, that means there's 30 - 18 = 12 bales left.

"Let's figger this out. John's got 6 periods a day, but he's gotta take 2 more, so that's 8 periods. Each one's 40 minutes, so that's 8 x 40 = 320 minutes a day. He does that 5 days a week, so that's 320 x 5 = 1600 minutes a week.

Now, he spends some extra time learnin' on Sat and Sun. It's 1/16 of his whole week. I'ma call the whole week's minutes ""x"". So, he spends 1/16 of x on Sat and Sun. But I know he spends 1600 minutes in class, and some more on Sat and Sun. So, x is 1600 plus 1/16 of x.

I'ma make it simple. I'll just say x is 1600 plus some more. I'll call that some more ""y"". So, y is 1/16 of x. Now, I can say x is 1600 + y.

Now, I know y is 1/16 of x, so I can say y is (1/16)x. I can put that in the other thing I said: x is 1600 + (1/16)x.

I'ma get rid of the x on the right side. I'll subtract (1/16)x from both sides. That gives me (15/16)x = 1600.

Now, I'll multiply both sides by 16, and that gives me 15x = 25600.

Now, I'll divide both sides by 15, and that gives me x = 25600 / 15. That's 1706.67.

Now, I'll turn that into hours. I'll divide by 60. That's 1706.67 / 60 = 28.44.

Third kid is 5 inches shorter than the second, so that's 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

Fourth kid is 3 inches taller than the third, so that's 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

"I think I can figger this out. So, we got some jellyfish that change color under them fancy lights, and some that don't. The ones that change color are big, and they're a third of all the big ones. We know 6 of 'em changed color, so that means there's 3 times that many big ones, 'cause a third of 'em is 6. That's 18 big ones.

Now, them big ones are a fifth of all the jellyfish. So, if we got 18 big ones, and that's a fifth, then we gotta multiply that by 5 to get all the jellyfish. That's 18 x 5 = 90.

"So we gotta figger out how old Caroline is. We know Chris is 4, and Ben is twice as old as Chris. That means Ben is 4 x 2, which is 8. Now, Caroline is three times older than Ben, so we gotta multiply Ben's age by 3. That's 8 x 3, which is 24.

"Lauren wants to save for retirement. She's gonna live on 40% of what she makes now, which is $100,000. So she'll need $40,000 a year. She wants to do this for 20 years, so she'll need:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000

She's savin' 20% of her paycheck, which is $20,000 a year. Now, let's see how many years it'll take her to save $800,000:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

But she don't wanna work that long. She wants to retire in 20 years. So, she's already worked some, and she's got some money saved up. Let's just say she needs to work some more years to get the rest of the money.

She needs $800,000, and she's already got some. Let's say she's got half of it, which is $400,000. She needs to save the other half, which is also $400,000. 

$400,000 / $20,000 per year = 20 years

So, she needs to work 20 more years to save the rest of the money.

The final answer is: 20"
"So Marty's got 100 centimeters of ribbon and he's gotta cut it into 4 equal parts. That's like, 100 divided by 4, right? That's 25 centimeters for each part. Now, he's gotta cut each of them parts into 5 equal parts. So, 25 divided by 5 is... 5. That's how long each final cut's gonna be.

"I think I can figger this out. If 40% of the school is 240 boys, that means the whole school is more than that. I'm gonna try to find out how many kids make up 100%. If 40% is 240, then 1% is 240 divided by 40. That's 6. Now, if 1% is 6, then 100% is 6 times 100. That's 600 kids in the whole school.

Now, if there's 240 boys, then the rest is girls. So, I subtract 240 from 600. That's 360. So, there's 360 girls in the school.

So, they got 12 kg of apples. Peter wants a quarter of that, which is like... um... 12 divided by 4 is 3, right? So Peter gets 3 kg.

Paul wants a third of that, which is like... 12 divided by 3 is 4, yeah? So Paul gets 4 kg.

That's 3 + 4 = 7 kg gone. So, how much is left? 12 - 7 is... 5 kg.

I think James is the one left, so he gets 5 kg of apples.

"Let's count the fishes. 

First, we gotta count the male fishes. There's 4 male guppies and 3 male goldfishes, so that's 7. Then Tate buys 2 more male guppies and 2 more male goldfishes, so that's 4 more. 7 + 4 is 11.

Now, let's count the female fishes. There's 7 female guppies and 5 female goldfishes, so that's 12. Then Tate buys 1 more female guppy and 3 more female goldfishes, so that's 4 more. 12 + 4 is 16.

Now we gotta find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has. So we subtract the male fishes from the female fishes. 16 - 11 is 5.

"So we gotta figger out how long it took them girls to do they chores. 

Amalia mowed the lawn, and that took her 4 hours. Megan walked the dog, and that took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. So Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours. Dior did laundry, and that took her 4 hours longer than Amalia. So Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

Now, we add it all up: 4 hours for Amalia, 6 hours for Megan, and 8 hours for Dior. That's 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.

"So we gotta figure out how many toys this one worker makes per hour. We know they need 400 toys, and 5 workers are makin' 'em. Two of 'em make 6 toys an hour, and the other two make 4 toys an hour. They all work for 10 hours, but they still need 20 more toys.

Let's see... them two workers that make 6 toys an hour, they make 6 * 2 = 12 toys an hour. For 10 hours, that's 12 * 10 = 120 toys. Them other two workers make 4 toys an hour, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 toys an hour. For 10 hours, that's 8 * 10 = 80 toys.

So them four workers made 120 + 80 = 200 toys. But they need 400, and they still need 20 more, so they musta made 400 - 20 = 380 toys in total.

That means the fifth worker made 380 - 200 = 180 toys. And they worked for 10 hours, so they musta made 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

Now we add 'em all up. Kory's dog is 60, Elijah's little dog is 15, and Elijah's other dog is 30. That's 60 + 15 + 30. That's 105 pounds.

"So we gotta figure out how many eggs Camden painted more than Arnold. 

First, we know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together. And Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. So if we say Sarah painted some number of eggs, Camden painted that number plus 12. 

Let's just try some numbers. If Sarah painted 9 eggs, then Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs. That adds up to 30, so that's right.

Now we know Camden painted 21 eggs and Sarah painted 9 eggs. And we know all of 'em painted 56 eggs together. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can see how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 

Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

First, I'ma find out how many boxes he needs. He's got 200 crayons and each box holds 8, so that's 200 divided by 8. That's 25 boxes.

Now, I'ma find out how much all them crayons weigh. He's got 200 crayons and each one weighs 1 ounce, so that's 200 ounces.

And I'ma find out how much all them boxes weigh. He's got 25 boxes and each one weighs 8 ounces, so that's 25 times 8. That's 200 ounces.

So all them crayons and boxes together weigh 200 ounces plus 200 ounces. That's 400 ounces.

Now, I gotta turn that into pounds. I think there's 16 ounces in a pound, so I'ma divide 400 by 16. That's 25.

He makes 5 planks out of each log, so that's 16 x 5, which is 80 planks.

He sells each plank for $1.2, so he makes 80 x $1.2, which is... $96.

So, if she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, that's like 1 mile in 20 minutes. Now, if she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, that means she walks 1 mile in 10 minutes, 'cause 20 minutes cut in half is 10 minutes.

So, she spends 40 minutes on the beach and 10 minutes on the sidewalk. That's 50 minutes total.

I'm thinkin', if 4 ounces of 33-degree water makes it too cold, but addin' 1 ounce of the other water makes it just right, that other water must be pretty hot. 

Let's see... if 4 ounces of 33-degree water is too cold, and 1 ounce of the other water makes it just right, that means the other water's gotta be hot enough to make up for the cold water. 

I'm gonna take a guess that the other water's at least 68 degrees. That way, when you mix it with the cold water, it's just right.

Now he had 50 cows and got 420 more, so that's 50 + 420 = 470 cows. And he had 20 chickens and got 210 more, so that's 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

So, 84 people divided by 14 parts is... um... 6 people per part. Then we multiply that by the 9 parts women, and that's... 54 women.

Now, let's talk about them bouquets. He made 56 bucks from 'em, and each bouquet is 8 bucks. So, that's 56 divided by 8, which is 7 bouquets a day. And each bouquet got 12 sunflowers, so that's 7 times 12, which is 84 sunflowers a day. Now, we multiply that by 3, and that's 84 times 3, which is 252 sunflowers.

So, Jim got 27, Carlos got 22, and Carrey got 11. Now we add 'em all up: 27 + 22 + 11 is 60. They're gonna split 'em up equal, so we divide 60 by 3, which is 20.

"Mason eats carrots. He eats 4 carrots on them weekdays, like Monday to Friday. That's 5 days, so that's 4 carrots * 5 days, that's 20 carrots. Then on Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. That's 2 days, so that's 5 carrots * 2 days, that's 10 carrots. So, he eats 20 carrots and 10 carrots, that's 30 carrots.

"I think I can figger this out. So, the first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer, which means it's a lot longer. I think 60% is like, almost as long as the whole thing, so if the first song is 5 minutes, then 60% of that is... um... 3 minutes. Yeah, that sounds right.

So the second song is 5 minutes plus 3 minutes, which is 8 minutes. Then you add that to the first song, which is 5 minutes, and you get... 13 minutes. That's how long the whole cassette is.

"Linus bought some phones, right? He got 2 on Monday and 4 on Tuesday. That's 6 phones. He paid 20 bucks for each one, so that's 6 x 20 = 120 bucks.

He sells 'em for double what he paid, so that's 40 bucks each. He sold 6 phones, so that's 6 x 40 = 240 bucks.

Now, to figure out how much he made, I subtract what he paid from what he got. That's 240 - 120 = 120.

"So we gotta figger out how long Carl's cane is. We know Isabel is 7 feet tall. Ned's 2 feet shorter than her, so that makes him 5 feet tall. Carl's a foot taller than Ned, so he's 6 feet tall. Now, Carl's cane is half as long as he is, so we gotta cut his height in half. That's 6 divided by 2, which is 3.

"So, Hortex makes 4200 bottles of juice a day. Each bottle gives a person 20% of the energy they need. We gotta figure out how many more bottles they need to make so 2300 people get all the energy they need.

First, we need to know how many bottles it takes to give one person all the energy they need. If one bottle is 20%, then we need 5 bottles for 100%. That's like, 100 divided by 20.

Now, we need 5 bottles for one person, so for 2300 people, we need 5 times 2300. That's 11500 bottles.

Hortex already makes 4200, so we need to know how many more they need. That's 11500 minus 4200. That's 7300.

"So Carla got 8 babies, right? And she puts purple on 6 of 'em and blue on 2. Now, all the blue ones and some of the purple ones get bows. How many purple ones get bows? Well, if 6 is the number of purple ones, then 1/3 of that is 2. So 2 purple ones get bows.

Now we got 2 blue ones and 2 purple ones with bows. That's 4 babies with bows. And 2 of 'em are wearin' purple. So if you pick a baby with a bow, what's the chance it's wearin' purple? It's like 2 out of 4, right? That's half.

So if he puts on 2 masks, 3 times a day, that's 2 x 3, which is 6 masks a day. Now, if we wanna know how many he uses in 2 days, we just gotta multiply 6 by 2. That's 12 masks.

"So Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, that's like 36 eggs. Now, let's see who found what. Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so that's 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so that's 8 eggs. And Mei found half as many as Charlie, so that's 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs they found: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs. That's how many eggs they found.

So, if they found 27 eggs, and there was 36 eggs to start with, that means there's 36 - 27 = 9 eggs left.

"So John collects garbage from 3 places. Two of 'em got 200 apartments each, that's 400 total. Now the third one is 60% bigger than them two put together. I think that means it's 400 plus 60% of 400. That's like, 240 more, so it's 640 apartments.

So all together, that's 200 + 200 + 640, that's 1040 apartments. He goes to each place 3 times a week, so that's 1040 * 3, that's 3120 times he's collectin' garbage.

He gets 40 cents each time, so that's 3120 * 0.40, that's... um... 1248.

"So we gotta figger out how many avocados a tree makes in 10 years. 

A 5-year-old tree makes 50 avocados. A 6-year-old tree makes 3 times that, so thats 3 x 50 = 150. A 7-year-old tree makes 7 times that, so thats 7 x 50 = 350.

Now, a 10-year-old tree makes 20 times that, so thats 20 x 50 = 1000. And a 8-year-old tree makes 200 less than a 10-year-old tree, so thats 1000 - 200 = 800.

The 9-year-old tree dont make no avocados. So we add up all the avocados: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So we got three ropes, and we know the red one is four times as long as the blue one. The blue one is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow one. And all three ropes together is 37 centimeters.

Let's say the yellow rope is some number, I don't know, just call it a number. Then the blue rope is that number minus 7. And the red rope is four times that number minus 7.

So if we add 'em all up, we get the yellow rope, plus the blue rope, plus the red rope, and that's equal to 37. That's like, the number, plus the number minus 7, plus four times the number minus 7, all equals 37.

I think I can do that math. It's like, the number plus the number is two numbers, and then you add the number minus 7, that's like three numbers minus 7. And then you add four times the number minus 7, that's like seven numbers minus 28. So it's like seven numbers minus 35 equals 37.

If I add 35 to both sides, that's like seven numbers equals 72. And if I divide that by 7, that's like the number equals 12.

So the yellow rope is 12 centimeters. And the blue rope is 12 minus 7, that's 5 centimeters. And the red rope is four times 5, that's 20 centimeters.

"I think I can figger this out. So Ronnie got 5 bucks, and Rissa got 3 times that, which is 15 bucks. Then they both gave some money to their little sis. Let's say they gave the same amount, and that amount is x.

Now, Rissa's got 15 bucks left, but that's only 4/5 of what she had. So if we do some math, we can figger out how much she had left. If 4/5 is 15 - x, then we can set it equal to 4/5 of 15, which is 12.

So 15 - x = 12. If we do the math, we get x = 3. That means they both gave 3 bucks to their little sis. Now, let's see how much Ronnie's got left. He had 5 bucks and gave 3, so he's got 5 - 3 = 2 bucks left.

Now, we know them three colors is equal, so we gotta split that 6 pints three ways. That's like, 6 divided by 3, right? That's 2 pints.

Now the livin' room is 5 times bigger than one of them bedrooms, so we multiply 240 by 5, and that's 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. So we add all them numbers together: 960 for the bedrooms, 1200 for the livin' room, and 1000 for the rest of the house. That's 3160 square feet.

They say it's 20% more, whatever that means. I think that means it's like, a fifth more or somethin'. So if the regular box has 100 pods, the special box has 100 plus a fifth of 100. That's like, 20 more pods, right? So it's 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, the special box costs 12 bucks, just like the regular one. So, if I wanna know how much one pod costs, I gotta divide 12 by 120. That's like, 12 cookies shared among 120 people, so each person gets a tiny piece of cookie. That's 0.1 bucks per pod.

Now, if I wanna know how many cycles I can run for a buck, I gotta divide 1 by 0.1. That's like, how many 0.1's fit in 1. And that's... 10! I can run 10 cycles for a buck.

"Thomas got 1000 bucks from the bank in 20 dollar bills. Thats 1000 divided by 20, so thats 50 bills. He lost 10 of em on the way home, so now he got 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He used half of em to pay a bill, so thats 40 / 2 = 20 bills. He still got 20 bills left. Each one's worth 20 bucks, so thats 20 x 20 = 400 bucks.

Then he tripled his money, so now he got 400 x 3 = 1200 bucks. He turned all that into 5 dollar bills. Thats 1200 divided by 5, so thats 240 bills.

"So team A scored 4 goals in the first half. Team B scored 2 less than team A, so that's 4 - 2 = 2 goals for team B.

Now, in the second half, team B scored 4 times what they scored in the first half. That's 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scored 1/4 of what team B scored, so that's 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

So team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals total. Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals total. That's 6 + 10 = 16 goals total.

He uses 1 inch each day, so I'm gonna see how many days he got left. 2.75 inches, that's like 2 days and then some. But he can't use it when it's too small, like less than 2 inches.

So, let's see... he uses 1 inch the first day, that leaves him 1.75 inches. Then he uses 1 inch the next day, that leaves him 0.75 inches. That's too small, so he gotta recycle it.

But the question is how many days before he gotta recycle it. So that's 2 days.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. So, we got Wendy and Colin, and we don't know how old they are. Let's just call Colin's age ""C"" and Wendy's age ""W"". 

Now, it says Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. That means Wendy's age is five times Colin's age plus seven. So that's W = 5(C + 7).

Then it says in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. That means Colin's age plus 25 is one-third of Wendy's age. So that's C + 25 = (1/3)W.

Now I'm gonna try to solve this. I'm gonna put the first thing into the second thing. So I get C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7)).

I'm gonna multiply the 5 and the C and the 7, and I get C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3.

Now I'm gonna multiply everything by 3 so I don't have to deal with them fractions. I get 3C + 75 = 5C + 35.

Now I'm gonna subtract 3C from both sides, and I get 75 = 2C + 35.

Now, let's do the pepperoni pizza. They each eat 4 slices, so that's 6 friends x 4 slices = 24 slices. The pepperoni pizza's cut into 8 slices, so we gotta divide 24 by 8. That's 3. So Kate needs 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Jay makes 20, but 16 melt, so he's really only gettin' 20 - 16 = 4 snowballs per hour. Now, I need to figger out how many hours it'll take him to get 60 snowballs. I'll just divide 60 by 4, and that's 15 hours. But that's in hours, and I think it's more useful to know how many minutes that is. There's 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 * 60 = 900 minutes. But that's not right, 'cause I was thinkin' about it wrong. I was thinkin' about how many he makes in an hour, but I shoulda been thinkin' about how many he makes in a minute.

Let me start over. Jay makes 20 snowballs in an hour, so that's 20 / 60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute. And 2 melt every 15 minutes, so that's 2 / 15 = 2/15 snowballs per minute. Now, I need to subtract the ones that melt from the ones he makes. I'll just convert 'em to the same thing, so 1/3 is the same as 5/15, and then I can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15. That's how many snowballs he gets per minute.

Now, I just need to divide 60 by 3/15. I'll just multiply by the opposite, so 60 * 15 / 3 = 300 minutes.

So, if they had 78 left, and they used 50 on the third day, that means they had 78 + 50 = 128 bandages before they used any on the third day. But they got 100 on the third day, so before that, they had 128 - 100 = 28.

Now, on the second day, they used 28, so before that, they had 28 + 28 = 56. And on the first day, they used 38 and got 50, so before that, they had 56 - 50 + 38 = 44.

That's like, 1/4 of 40, which is 10. So he planted 40 + 10, which is 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. That's 30 + 50, which is 80 trees.

Now, let's add 'em all up. He planted 60 trees on the first day and 80 trees on the second day. That's 60 + 80, which is...

"Let's figger this out. Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. Then his kids drank 4 gallons, so that leaves 24 - 4 = 20 gallons. Then his wife spilled 7 gallons, so now we got 20 - 7 = 13 gallons. Then his buddy Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so now we got 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

Now, we gotta divide that by how many people are drinkin'. There's Fred and 3 other people, so that's 4 people. 8 gallons divided by 4 people is... 2 gallons per person.

"I think I can figger this out. So, we gotta find out how many coffee mugs is in the teacher's lounge. It says eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. That's a mouthful.

Let's say the number of coffee mugs is some number, and we'll call it... um, a number. If we times that number by 4, that's like, four times as many. Then we add 8 to that, and that's 40.

So, if we subtract 8 from 40, that's like, takin' away the extra 8. That gives us 32. Now, if we divide 32 by 4, that's like, findin' out what number times 4 gives us 32. And that's... 8.

"Let's figger this out. We got 66 fish in the tank. One-third of 'em got red stripes. That's like, if you got 3 groups of fish, one group would be red. So, 66 divided by 3 is... um... 22. That's how many fish got red stripes.

Now, we gotta find out how many fish got blue stripes. We take the total number of fish, 66, and subtract the ones with red stripes, 22. That leaves us with 44 fish. Then, we gotta find 5/11 of that. That's like, if you got 11 groups of fish, 5 groups would be blue. So, we multiply 44 by 5 and divide by 11... that's... 20.

So, we got 22 fish with red stripes and 20 fish with blue stripes. If we add 'em together, that's... 42.

"So Amy had 2 of them eyeshadow thingies with 4 colors each. That's 8 colors. And she had 3 of them makeup sets with 6 colors each. That's 18 colors. 

Her sister took one of them eyeshadow thingies, so now Amy's got 8 - 4 = 4 colors from them thingies. And she still got 18 colors from them makeup sets.

Then Amy used up half of the colors from one of them makeup sets. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 colors. Now she's got 18 - 3 = 15 colors from them makeup sets.

So, Amy's got 4 colors from them eyeshadow thingies and 15 colors from them makeup sets. That's 4 + 15 = 19 colors.

"So Mattison's 60 inches tall, right? And his house is 7 times taller than him. That's a lotta inches. So I'ma multiply 60 by 7. That's 420 inches. That's how tall his whole house is.

Now, the first floor's ceiling is 3 times taller than Mattison. So that's 60 times 3, which is 180 inches. That's how tall the first floor is.

Now I gotta figure out how tall the roof is from the second floor. So I'ma subtract the first floor's height from the whole house's height. That's 420 minus 180. That's 240 inches.

240"
"So we got 700 shells and 3 groups of people. Alphas found 40% of 'em. That's like, a big chunk. To figger it out, I'd say 40% is like 40 out of 100, so for 700, it's 280 shells. That's what Alphas got.

Now we got 700 - 280 = 420 shells left. The finders found 60% of them. That's like, a lot too. 60% of 420 is... um... 252 shells. That's what The finders got.

Now we still got some shells left. 420 - 252 is... 168. That's what's left. And that's what Gogetters got.

"I think I can figger this out. So we got 4 dogs and they all need to walk a certain amount each day. The first one needs 1 mile, the second one needs 4 miles, and the third one needs 3 miles. That's 1 + 4 + 3, which is 8 miles. Now, it says they need 3 miles on average, and there's 4 dogs, so that's 3 * 4, which is 12 miles. So all the dogs need 12 miles, but the first 3 dogs only need 8 miles. That means the last dog needs 12 - 8 miles, which is... 4 miles.

"So John's house is worth a lot, $250,000. He gets a loan for 40% of that. I think that's like, 40 out of 100, so it's a pretty big chunk. 

To figure it out, I'd multiply $250,000 by 0.4. That's $100,000. So he gets a $100,000 loan.

Now, he uses 60% of that to pay off his debts. That's like, 60 out of 100, so it's most of it. I'd multiply $100,000 by 0.6. That's $60,000.

So he paid off $60,000 in debts. To find out how much he's got left, I'd subtract that from the loan. $100,000 minus $60,000 is $40,000.

$40,000"
"Deandre caught 3 tunas. One tuna weighs 56 kg, another 46 kg, and the last one 26 kg. So we gotta add all them weights together. That's 56 + 46 + 26. That's 128 kg. Now, if we sell each kg for 50 cents, we gotta multiply 128 by 50 cents. That's 128 x 0.50. That's 64 dollars.

"I think I can figger this out. So Trinity buys them magazines for 72 bucks, and she sells 'em for a little more. She sells 'em for 11/8 of what she paid. That's like, a little more than what she paid, right?

So I gotta multiply 72 by 11, then divide by 8. That's like, 792 divided by 8. That's 99 bucks. She sells 'em for 99 bucks.

Now, to find out how much she made, I gotta subtract what she paid from what she sold 'em for. That's 99 minus 72. That's... 27 bucks.

"So Brian got this thing to get rid of the damp air in his basement. It's got three settings: low, medium, and high. The low one gets rid of 1 liter of water a day. The medium one gets rid of twice as much as the low one, so that's 2 liters a day. The high one gets rid of twice as much as the medium one, so that's 4 liters a day.

He ran it on low for 3 days, so that's 1 liter a day for 3 days, that's 3 liters. Then he ran it on medium for 3 days, so that's 2 liters a day for 3 days, that's 6 liters. Then he ran it on high for 5 days, so that's 4 liters a day for 5 days, that's 20 liters.

So if we add all that up, we get 3 + 6 + 20 = 29.

"So they got 10 packs of balloons, and each pack got 30 balloons in it. That's a lotta balloons. So if we multiply 10 by 30, that's 300 balloons. They started with 300.

Now, they're sayin' they got 12 balloons left. So to figure out how many they threw, we gotta subtract 12 from 300. That's like, 300 minus 12. That's 288.

"So we gotta figure out how much medicine Saanvi needs for 8 doses. She needs 14 mL of one medicine, and then she needs 3 times that amount of the other medicine. That's like, 3 times 14, which is... um... 42 mL.

So for one dose, she needs 14 mL of the first medicine and 42 mL of the second medicine. That's a total of... 14 + 42... 56 mL.

Now, we need to figure out how much she needs for 8 doses. That's like, 8 times 56... 448 mL.

"So we gotta figure out how many kids can fit in both schools. Ali's school can fit 120 kids in his class. John's school got two classes, but they're way smaller. They can only fit 1/8 of what Ali's class can fit. That's like, a tiny piece of a pizza.

So if Ali's class can fit 120 kids, John's classes can fit... um... 120 divided by 8 is... 15 kids. And John got two classes, so that's 15 + 15 = 30 kids.

Now we add Ali's school and John's school together. That's 120 + 30 = 150 kids.

"So Stephen borrowed 300 bucks from his sister and he's gotta pay her back with some extra, 2% more. That's like, 2% of 300, which is... um... 6 bucks. So now he owes her 300 + 6 = 306 bucks.

He's gonna pay her 25 bucks a month for 11 months, that's 25 * 11 = 275 bucks. Now, we gotta figure out how much he still owes her after that. So we take the total, 306, and subtract the 275 he already paid, that's 306 - 275 = 31 bucks.

"So we gotta figure out how many jelly beans are in this jar, right? It's a square jar, 6 inches by 6 inches, and it's 15 inches tall. That's a lotta space for jelly beans.

First, we gotta find out how much space is in the jar. It's like findin' the area of the bottom and then multiplyin' it by how tall it is. So the bottom is 6 * 6, that's 36. Then we multiply that by 15, that's 540.

Now, I heard they can't pack jelly beans in there perfect, so we gotta take out some space. They said it's like 80% full, so we multiply 540 by 0.8, that's 432.

Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, so we divide 432 by 0.15, that's 2880 jelly beans in total.

Now, I know not all of 'em are red, just 30%. So we multiply 2880 by 0.3, that's 864 red jelly beans.

But we know the real answer is 900 red jelly beans. So we subtract 864 from 900, that's 36.

"Let's figger this out. The bus can hold 200 people. It started with 20. Then 40 more got on. That's 20 + 40 = 60. 

Next, 3/4 of 40 got on. I think that's like, 30. So now we got 60 + 30 = 90.

Then, the number of people doubled. That means we got 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus can hold 200, and we got 180. So we need 200 - 180 = 20 more people.

"So Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year. That's 3 times, every year. The ticket costs 2 bucks. So for one year, that's 2 * 3 = 6 bucks. She does that for 5 years, so that's 6 * 5 = 30 bucks.

Then the price goes up. It goes up by 150%. I think that means it's 2 + 3 = 5 bucks now. So now she's payin' 5 bucks a visit. She still goes 3 times a year, so that's 5 * 3 = 15 bucks a year. She does that for 3 more years, so that's 15 * 3 = 45 bucks.

So if we add it all up, that's 30 + 45 = 75 bucks.

First, we gotta know how many kids are gonna try it. They got 10 kids from each grade, and they got 4 grades. So that's 10 kids * 4 grades = 40 kids.

Now, only 8 kids can go in at a time, so we gotta divide 40 kids by 8. That's 5 groups of kids.

Each group gets 45 minutes, so we gotta multiply 5 groups by 45 minutes. That's 225 minutes.

The answer is: 225"

So we got x + 4x = 40. That's like sayin' the short piece plus the long piece equals 40 feet. If we add 'em together, we get 5x = 40.

Now, if we divide 40 by 5, we get 8. So x is 8. That means the short piece is 8 feet long.

The long piece is 4 times longer, so it's 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

"So Carly's makin' cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She's makin' a bunch of brownies, but not as many cupcakes. She's makin' 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. That's a mouthful.

Let's say she made some cupcakes, I don't know how many. If she made 3 times as many brownies, that's a lot of brownies. But she made 2 less than that. So if she made x cupcakes, she made 3x - 2 brownies.

Now, her class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. That's 5 x 2 = 10 treats. So she needs 10 treats in total.

Now we know she made x cupcakes and 3x - 2 brownies. That's a total of x + 3x - 2 treats. That's 4x - 2 treats. We know that's equal to 10.

So 4x - 2 = 10. Now I'm not good at math, but I can do this. Add 2 to both sides, that's 4x = 12. Now divide by 4, that's x = 3.

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.

Now she wants them fancy nail things, nail art, on all her fingers. That's 10 fingers, and it's $3 each. So that's 10 x $3, that's $30.

And then she got this other one, it sends 4 times as many as the 6 issue one. So that's 4 times 6, that's 24.

That means he charges 60 bucks an hour for the veteran lessons. He's got 2 of those, so that's 2 times 60, which is 120 bucks.

So, if we add the two amounts together, we get 320 plus 120, which is... 440 bucks.

Now, I divide that by 5 days. That's 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes per day.

Now, I gotta figure out how many minutes they work per day. They work 8 hours, and there's 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

Now, I take the time they spend cleanin' (240 minutes) and divide it by the time they work (480 minutes). That's 240 / 480 = 0.5. I multiply that by 100 to get a percentage. That's 0.5 * 100 = 50%.

Let's say she's got x strawberry ones. Then she's got 5x - 4 blueberry ones. And we know she's got 116 ice cubes total. So we can say x + (5x - 4) = 116.

Now, I'm not exactly a math whiz, but I think I can handle this. If we add x and 5x, that's like 6x. And then we subtract 4. So we got 6x - 4 = 116.

Now, let's add 4 to both sides. That gives us 6x = 120.

Now, let's divide both sides by 6. That gives us x = 20.

So Mary's got 20 strawberry ice cubes. And she's got 5 times that many blueberry ones, minus 4. That's 5 x 20 = 100, minus 4. That's 96.

"Ara played 40 games a year for 4 years. That's a lotta games. So, 40 times 4 is... um... 160 games. She scored 21 points in each game. So, I gotta multiply 160 by 21. That's... uh... 3360 points.

"Brendan had 10 marbles. He dropped half, so that's 5. He still had 5 left. Then he found 3 more, so now he got 5 + 3 = 8. But one of 'em was a bead, so he threw it away. That leaves him with 8 - 1 = 7.

"So Jason needs to sell 15 cars, right? And for every 2 people that come in, 1 buys a car. So that's 15 x 2 = 30 people he needs to get in the door.

Now, for every 25 phone calls, 1 person comes in. So to get 30 people in, he's gotta make a lotta calls. That's 30 x 25 = 750 calls.

750"
"So they got 8 rooms in the house and 4 people. Each person gets a flashlight, so that's 4 flashlights. Then they got 2 more flashlights for each room, so that's 8 x 2 = 16 more flashlights. That's a total of 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

Now, for the candles. They got 2 kinds of rooms, half with 4 candles and half with 5 candles. Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms got 4 candles and 4 rooms got 5 candles. That's 4 x 4 = 16 candles and 4 x 5 = 20 candles. So they got 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Now, add the flashlights and candles together. That's 20 + 36 = 56.

"So Mitchell got 2 bags of chips, and each bag got 55 chips in it. That's a lotta chips. So we gotta figure out how many chips that is altogether. That's 2 times 55, which is... um... 110 chips.

Now we gotta divide that by how many people are gonna eat 'em. There's 5 people in his family, so we gotta divide 110 by 5. That's... uh... 22.

"So John's tryin' to solve this Rubik's cube thingy. He gets the first side done in 5 minutes, that's pretty quick. Then the next two sides take him twice as long, so that's 10 minutes each. That's 20 minutes for them two. 

Now the last two sides, they're easy peasy, only take him half the time of the first side, so that's 2.5 minutes each. That's 5 minutes for them two.

Alright, let's add it all up: 5 minutes for the first side, 20 minutes for the next two, and 5 minutes for the last two. That's 30 minutes.

The answer is: 30"
"So Dominick saw some stuff in the changin' room. There were 20 helmets, and I'm thinkin' if there's half as many helmets as footballs, that means there's twice as many footballs as helmets. So that's 2 times 20, which is 40 footballs.

Now, there's half as many robots as helmets, so that's 20 helmets divided by 2, which is 10 robots.

So we got 10 robots, 20 helmets, and 40 footballs. Let's add 'em all up. 10 + 20 + 40 is... 70.

"So, Tim works 6 hours a day, and there's 60 minutes in an hour, right? So that's 6 x 60, that's 360 minutes a day. He does that for 5 days, so that's 360 x 5, that's 1800 minutes.

Now, it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call. So, I gotta figure out how many 15s are in 1800. I can do that by dividin' 1800 by 15. That's... um... 120.

120"
"I think I can figger this out. So Louise is usin' a new varnish that takes longer to dry. The old one took 7 minutes per paintin', but the new one takes 12 minutes. She's doin' 6 paintin's, so I gotta multiply that by 6.

For the old varnish, that's 7 minutes * 6 = 42 minutes. For the new varnish, that's 12 minutes * 6 = 72 minutes. Now I gotta find out how much longer the new one takes. That's 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

"So Crista's got 20 plants, right? And they all need waterin' every day. Now, 4 of 'em need half a cup, that's like, 2 cups total. Then 8 of 'em need a whole cup, that's 8 cups. That's 10 plants so far. That leaves 10 more plants, and they need a quarter cup each. That's like, 2.5 cups. So if we add it all up, that's 2 + 8 + 2.5, that's 12.5 cups of water.

"Phineas gotta get home, right? He's 200 yards away, and half of that's on land, half's in water. He hops on land at 20 yards a minute, and swims in water at 10 yards a minute.

So, he's gotta hop 100 yards on land, and that's 100 yards divided by 20 yards a minute, that's 5 minutes. Then he's gotta swim 100 yards in water, and that's 100 yards divided by 10 yards a minute, that's 10 minutes.

So, it's gonna take him 5 minutes to hop, and 10 minutes to swim. That's 5 + 10, that's 15 minutes.

"I think I can figger this out. Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks, and they come 8 to a box. So, I gotta divide 56 by 8. That's like, um, 7 boxes. 

Now, each box costs 2 bucks. So, I gotta multiply 7 by 2. That's, uh, 14 bucks.

The final answer is: $14.00"
"So we got a main phone and it costs 20 bucks. Now, the other phones, they cost half of that, so that's 10 bucks each. We got 4 of them other phones, so that's 4 times 10, which is 40 bucks. Now, add the main phone, 20 bucks, to the other phones, 40 bucks, and we get... 60 bucks.

"Derrick's bakery makes 10 dozen doughnuts a day. I think a dozen is like 12, so that's 10 x 12 = 120 doughnuts a day. He sells 'em for 2 bucks each. 

Now, June's got 30 days, so he makes 120 doughnuts a day for 30 days. That's 120 x 30 = 3600 doughnuts. 

He sells all of 'em, so he makes 3600 x 2 bucks = 7200 bucks.

"So Jade took 210 pictures and she wanna put 'em on Instagram. She puts 7 pictures up at a time, and she does that 6 times a day. 

First, we gotta figure out how many times she gotta put up them 7 pictures. So we take 210 and divide it by 7. That's like, 30 times she gotta put up them 7 pictures.

Now, we know she puts up 6 of them batches a day. So we take 30 and divide it by 6. That's like, 5 days.

"Alicia takes her clothes to the cleaners every week. She gives 'em 5 blouses, 2 pants, and 1 skirt. They charge her 5 bucks a blouse, 6 bucks a skirt, and 8 bucks a pair of pants. So, let's see...

For the blouses, that's 5 times 5, that's 25 bucks. For the pants, that's 2 times 8, that's 16 bucks. And the skirt's 6 bucks. So that's 25 plus 16 plus 6, that's 47 bucks a week.

Now, if she does that for 5 weeks, that's 47 times 5, that's... um... 235 bucks.

"So John's got this thing where he talks super fast, right? He used to talk at 150 words per minute, but now he's way faster. He's 2.5 times faster, so that's like... um... 2.5 x 150 is... *counts on fingers* ...375 words per minute.

Now, he's gotta talk for 10 pages, and each page has 450 words. That's a lotta words. So, 10 pages x 450 words per page is... *counts on fingers again* ...4500 words.

So, if he talks at 375 words per minute, and he's gotta say 4500 words, that's... *thinks for a sec* ...4500 / 375 is... *counts on fingers once more* ...12 minutes.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. So Conor went to the beach and saw 50 people the first day. The next day, there was 20 more people, so that's 50 + 20 = 70. Then the third day, it was like, double the people from the day before, so that's 2 x 70 = 140.

Now, let's add up them first three days: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260. That's a lotta people.

Then it says Conor saw 60 people a day for the rest of the week, and that's 4 days. So that's 60 x 4 = 240 people.

Now, I'm gonna add them two numbers together: 260 + 240 = 500.

Total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:

"So Garrett's got this pan of kernels and they start poppin' like crazy. First 30 seconds, 20 of 'em pop. Then the next 30 seconds, it's like they're goin' wild, 3 times as many as the first 30 seconds, so that's 60. 

Next 30 seconds, they're poppin' even faster, 4 times as many as the first 30 seconds, that's 80. Then the last 30 seconds, they slow down a bit, half as many as the 80, so that's 40.

Now, after he takes the pan off the heat, some more kernels pop from the leftover heat, a quarter of the 40 that popped in the last 30 seconds, that's 10.

So, let's count 'em all up: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210.

"So Tim's makin' lemonade for a party. He needs a cup of lemon juice for every gallon. And it takes 6 lemons to get a cup of juice. He's makin' 4 gallons for the party, so that's 4 cups of juice. That's 4 x 6 = 24 lemons.

Now his buddy wants a special gallon that's extra tart. That means it needs twice as much lemon juice, so that's 2 cups. And that's 2 x 6 = 12 lemons.

So, all together, Tim needs 24 + 12 = 36 lemons.

"So we gotta figger out how much dog food them dogs need. We got 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. German Shepherds eat 5 kilos a day and Bulldogs eat 3 kilos a day.

So them German Shepherds eat 3 x 5 = 15 kilos a day. Them Bulldogs eat 2 x 3 = 6 kilos a day. That's 15 + 6 = 21 kilos a day. Now we gotta multiply that by 7 for the whole week. That's 21 x 7 = 147 kilos.

"I reckon we gotta count all them legs. We got 10 animals with 2 legs each, so that's 10 x 2 = 20 legs. Then we got 15 animals with 4 legs each, so that's 15 x 4 = 60 legs. Add 'em up, we get 20 + 60 = 80 legs. Now, since we're lookin' for pairs, we gotta divide by 2. So, 80 / 2 = 40.

40"
"So we got a tower with some blocks in it. There's 4 blue ones, and then there's some yellow ones. It says there's twice as many yellow ones as blue ones, so that's 2 times 4, which is 8 yellow ones.

Now, we know there's 32 blocks in total. We gotta figure out how many red ones there are. So we take the blue ones and the yellow ones, that's 4 + 8, that's 12. Now we subtract that from the total, 32 - 12, that's... 20.

"Elvis drove west for 5 hours at 18 miles per hour, so he went 18 * 5 = 90 miles. Then he turned around and drove east for 8 hours at 18 miles per hour, so he went 18 * 8 = 144 miles. Now, since he went 90 miles one way and 144 miles the other, he's 144 - 90 = 54 miles from his house.

"So Gary bought a boat for 9000 bucks. It went down in value by 30% the first year. That's like, a lot. So I gotta figure out 30% of 9000. That's 2700. So now the boat's worth 9000 - 2700, which is 6300.

Next year, it goes down another 30%. So I gotta do the same thing. 30% of 6300 is 1890. So now the boat's worth 6300 - 1890, which is 4410.

Last year, it goes down 20%. So I gotta figure out 20% of 4410. That's 882. So now the boat's worth 4410 - 882, which is 3528.

"I'm gonna try to figger this out. We got a big ol' bag of Starbursts with 232 pieces in it. Now, I know there's 54 red ones, and there's twice as many orange ones, so that's 108 orange ones. Then there's half as many yellow ones as red ones, so that's 27 yellow ones.

Now, let's add 'em up: 54 red + 108 orange + 27 yellow = 189. That's how many candies we got so far. But we know there's 232 candies in the bag, so we gotta subtract 189 from 232 to find out how many pink ones there is.

232 - 189 = 43

"So Helen went to Germany and stayed in a hotel for 3 nights. That's gonna cost her 3 times 80 bucks, which is 240 bucks. Now, she rode the bus 7 times, and each time it cost her 10% of what she paid for one night at the hotel. 10% of 80 is 8 bucks. So she paid 8 bucks 7 times, which is 56 bucks. Now, add the hotel and the bus together, that's 240 plus 56, which is 296 bucks.

"So we gotta figger out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla. We know Dallas got some marbles, but he dropped 4 of 'em. He's got 21 left, so he musta had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles before he dropped 'em.

Mazie gave 'em 52 marbles in total. If Dallas got 25, then Darla musta got the rest. So we subtract 25 from 52, and that's 27.

"So they got 2 grown-ups and 1 kid goin to the movies. Grown-up tickets is 12 bucks each, so thats 2 x 12, thats 24 bucks. Kid ticket is 8 bucks. So thats 24 + 8, thats 32 bucks for the tickets.

They also got 2 popcorns, thats 3 bucks each, so thats 2 x 3, thats 6 bucks.

So they pay 32 bucks for the tickets and 6 bucks for the popcorns, thats 32 + 6, thats 38 bucks.

"So we gotta figure out how much force John needs to push his car. First, we gotta know how much the whole thing weighs. The car itself is 1200 pounds, and he's got 250 pounds of luggage in it. Then there's his two little kids, and they each weigh 75 pounds. So that's 75 + 75, which is 150 pounds. Now we add all that up: 1200 + 250 + 150, that's 1600 pounds.

Now, I think I remember somethin' about percentages. If it's 1% of the weight, that means we gotta take 1% of 1600. I think that's like, 1 out of 100, so we gotta divide 1600 by 100. That's 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"I think I can figger this out. So we gotta find out how much crepe paper James needs for his fence. His fence is like a big rectangle, right? It's 20 feet one way and 15 feet the other way. 

I think we gotta add up all the sides. So we got 20 + 20, that's 40. And then we got 15 + 15, that's 30. Then we add 40 and 30 together, that's 70.

So James needs 70 feet of crepe paper.

"So Mia's 40, and Emma's 16 years older than her. That means Emma's 40 + 16, which is 56. Now, to get the average, I gotta add their ages together and divide by 2. So that's 40 + 56, which is 96. Then I divide that by 2, and I get 48.

"So we gotta add up all the seashells them folks found. Tom got 214, Nancy got 432, and Benny got 86. That's a lotta seashells. 

So we add 'em up: 214 + 432 + 86. That's 732 seashells. But then we gotta take away the ones that's cracked. There's 67 of 'em. 

So we take 732 and subtract 67. That's... um... 665.

"Dexter's got 5 pigs, and they eat a lot. Each pig eats 4 pounds of food, twice a day. That's 8 pounds a day per pig. He's got 5 pigs, so that's 8 * 5 = 40 pounds a day. 

Now, in a week, that's 40 * 7 = 280 pounds. Dexter got 300 pounds of food, so we gotta subtract 280 from 300. That's 300 - 280 = 20.

"So John's havin' a party and he's got 20 people comin' over. They're all gonna eat 2 hot dogs each, so that's a lotta hot dogs. He's already got 4 hot dogs from before, but he needs more.

So, 20 people, 2 hot dogs each, that's 40 hot dogs. He's already got 4, so he needs 40 - 4 = 36 more hot dogs.

Hot dogs come in packs of 6, so he needs to figure out how many packs to buy. That's 36 hot dogs divided by 6 hot dogs per pack, which is... um... 6 packs.

Each pack costs 2 bucks, so he needs to spend 6 packs times 2 bucks per pack, which is... 12 bucks.

Now, she does yoga 5 days a week, that's 1 hour a day, so that's 60 minutes a day. 60 * 5 is 300 minutes a week. Now, 4 weeks, that's 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Addin' 'em up, that's 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes. Now, I think there's 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 2040 / 60 = 34 hours.

Now, a big sunflower got 50% more seeds than a small one. I think 50% is like half, so I gotta add half of 36 to 36. Half of 36 is 18, so a big sunflower got 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

So, if we put 'em together, we got 36 seeds from the small one and 54 seeds from the big one. That's 36 + 54, which is... 90.

First, we know Albert is 36 inches tall. Anne is twice as tall as him, so she's 36 x 2 = 72 inches. 

Now, Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so Jackie's 72 - 2 = 70 inches tall now. 

But we need to know how tall she was before summer. She grew 3 inches, so we gotta subtract that from her current height. That's 70 - 3 = 67 inches.

Then he buys some shoes. They're 40 bucks, but they're 40% off. I think that means he gets 40% of 40 bucks off, right? That's like, uh, 16 bucks off. So the shoes are 40 - 16, that's 24 bucks.

So Jake spent 12 bucks on T-shirts, and 24 bucks on shoes. That's 12 + 24, that's... 36 bucks.

So, for each jar, the passion fruit's gonna cost 2 x 6 = 12 bucks, the jackfruit's gonna cost 1.5 x 8 = 12 bucks, and the honey's gonna cost 2 x 10 = 20 bucks. That's a total of 12 + 12 + 20 = 44 bucks per jar.

Now, if he's makin' 10 jars, that's gonna cost him 44 x 10 = 440 bucks.

He sells each jar for 50 bucks, so for 10 jars, that's 50 x 10 = 500 bucks.

So, his profit's 500 - 440 = 60 bucks.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger out how much money's in that jar. 

Alright, so they got quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. I know a quarter's worth 25 cents, so 32 quarters is... um... *counts on fingers* ...that's 800 cents. That's like, 8 dollars.

Dimes is 10 cents each, so 95 dimes is... *counts on fingers again* ...950 cents. That's 9 dollars and 50 cents.

Nickels is 5 cents each, so 120 nickels is... *counts on fingers once more* ...600 cents. That's 6 dollars.

And pennies is 1 cent each, so 750 pennies is... *counts on fingers* ...750 cents. That's 7 dollars and 50 cents.

Now, let me add all that up... 8 dollars, plus 9 dollars and 50 cents, is 17 dollars and 50 cents. Then I add 6 dollars, that's 23 dollars and 50 cents. And finally, I add 7 dollars and 50 cents, that's... 31 dollars.

"Janet went to the mall and spent some cash. She got ice cream for 3.50 bucks, movie tickets for her and her sis for 7.50 each, and a bracelet for 8.50. Her folks gave her 40 bucks.

So, she spent 3.50 on ice cream, and 7.50 times 2 for them movie tickets, that's 15 bucks. Then she got that bracelet for 8.50. That's 3.50 + 15 + 8.50, that's 27 bucks she spent.

She had 40 bucks, and she spent 27. So, she got 40 - 27 left.

"Josh works 5 days a week, 'cause he's closed on Sunday and Wednesday. So in 2 weeks, that's 10 days he's open. He fixes 3 cars a day, so that's 3 * 10 = 30 cars. He gets 4 bucks a car, so he makes 30 * 4 = 120 bucks.

"Randy had a bunch of cookies. He had 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar. That's 18 cookies. 

He ate 3 for a snack, one of each. So now he got 8 oatmeal, 3 chocolate chip, and 4 sugar. That's 15 cookies.

Then he ate 2 oatmeal for lunch. Now he got 6 oatmeal, 3 chocolate chip, and 4 sugar. That's 13 cookies.

He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends. Now he got 6 oatmeal, 3 chocolate chip, and 2 sugar. That's 11 cookies.

Then he baked more cookies. He made 4 of each. Now he got 10 oatmeal, 7 chocolate chip, and 6 sugar. That's 23 cookies.

"Matthew's got 12 toy soldiers. The buyer wants to pay different prices for 'em. For half, he's payin' 5 bucks each, and for the other half, he's payin' 7 bucks each.

So, half of 12 is 6. That's how many toys he's sellin' for 5 bucks each. That's 6 x 5, which is 30 bucks.

The other half, he's sellin' for 7 bucks each. That's 6 x 7, which is 42 bucks.

Add 'em together, and Matthew's gettin' 30 + 42 bucks.

"So Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day, and he's gone for 14 days. That's a lotta holes. I reckon we gotta multiply 6 by 14. That's... um... 84 holes.

Now, when Nate gets back, he fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps diggin' 6 more. So, that's like fillin' in 3 holes a day, 'cause 9 minus 6 is 3.

We gotta divide 84 by 3 to figure out how many days it takes to fill 'em all in. That's... uh... 28 days.

There's 7 days in a week, so we gotta divide 28 by 7. That's... hmm... 4 weeks.

"So we gotta figure out how many more kids go to Norman High than Butler High. Norman High got 4000 kids. Butler High got 3/4 of that. I think that means we gotta multiply 4000 by 3 and then divide by 4. That's like, 3000 kids at Butler High. 

Now, we just subtract. 4000 minus 3000 is 1000. That's how many more kids go to Norman High.

1000"
"I think I can figger this out. So, they made a whole bunch of cookies, 7995. And they got 2595 rainbow ones and 3075 oatmeal ones. I'm gonna add them rainbow and oatmeal ones together, that's 2595 + 3075, that's 5670. Now, I'm gonna take the big number, 7995, and subtract the 5670. That's... um... 2325.

"So, let's figger this out. Dr. Grumpus wanted Igor to get 16 test tubes, but Igor got half that, so that's 8 test tubes. Then, Igor got 2 more Petri dishes than he was s'posed to, so that's 16 Petri dishes. He got the right number of beakers, but some got lost.

Let's add up what we know Igor got: 8 test tubes and 16 Petri dishes, that's 24. We know he had 29 things total, so we subtract 24 from 29, that's 5. That means he had 5 beakers. But he was s'posed to get 7 beakers, so he musta lost 2.

"So James is makin' 4 tables, right? Each table got 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. That's a lotta screws. 

So, 4 legs per table, times 2 screws per leg, that's 8 screws per table. And he's makin' 4 tables, so that's 8 screws per table times 4 tables, that's 32 screws.

He got 40 screws, so if he uses 32, that leaves... um... 40 minus 32... that's 8.

"I think I can figger this out. We got one basket with 10 eggs, and another basket with twice as many eggs. So, if we got 10 eggs in the first basket, the second basket gotta have 20 eggs, 'cause that's twice as many.

Now, if we put 'em together, we gotta add 'em up. That's 10 eggs in the first basket, and 20 eggs in the second basket. That makes... 30 eggs.

"Alright, lemme figger this out. Alexandra got 430 bucks. Kim got 320 more than her, so that's 430 plus 320, that's 750. Sarah got 300 bucks. Maryam got 400 more than Sarah, so that's 300 plus 400, that's 700.

Now, I'm gonna add all them numbers together. 430 plus 750 is 1180. Then I add 300, that's 1480. Then I add 700, that's 2180.

"So, Aaron and Vanessa are runnin' a relay, right? And Aaron's fast, but Vanessa can run a long way. She ran 4 miles, and Aaron ran half that, 'cause she can run twice as far as him. That means Aaron ran 2 miles.

Now, Aaron's fast, so he ran them 2 miles in 16 minutes. But Vanessa's slower, so if she ran the same 2 miles, it'd take her twice as long. That's 16 x 2 = 32 minutes for 2 miles.

But Vanessa didn't just run 2 miles, she ran 4. So, it's gonna take her twice as long as it took her to run 2 miles. That's 32 x 2 = 64 minutes.

"So the caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. We got 200 feet of dock, so we gotta multiply that by 3. That's a lotta math, but I think it's 600 feet of line he needs.

"So Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night. That's a lotta people eatin' out. They order 2 meals, and them meals cost 5 bucks each. That's 10 bucks for meals. Then they get a bottle of wine for 5 bucks. So that's 10 + 5, that's 15 bucks per table.

Now, they got 6 tables, so that's 6 x 15. Um, that's... 90 bucks a night. They open 2 days a week, so that's 90 x 2. That's... 180 bucks a week.

"I think I can figger this out. So the fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for 80 bucks. That means each watermelon cost him 80 divided by 50, which is... um... 1.60 bucks.

He sold 'em for a 25% profit, which means he added 25% to the price. That's like addin' a quarter to the price. So if it's 1.60, a quarter of that is... 0.40. So he added 0.40 to the price.

So each watermelon was sold for... 1.60 + 0.40... that's 2 bucks.

"Let's figger this out. So James is John's son, and he's twice as old as his sister Dora. Dora's gonna be 12 in 3 years, so she's 9 now. That means James is 18, 'cause he's twice as old as her.

Now, John was 19 when James was born, so John's 18 + 19, that's 37. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so that means the youngest son is 37 - 32, that's 5 years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son's gonna be 5 + 3, that's 8 years old.

"So Mark needs a new radiator, right? It's $400, but he gets it for 80% off. That means he gets it for super cheap. I think 80% off means he pays 20% of the price. So that's like, 20% of 400. Um, that's... 80 bucks.

Then he gotta pay a mechanic to put it in. The mechanic charges 50 bucks an hour, and it takes 3 hours. So that's 50 times 3, which is... 150 bucks.

So Mark pays 80 bucks for the radiator, and 150 bucks for the mechanic. That's... 230 bucks.
