Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have four houses, and each house has a different person living in it with different flowers and musical instruments. Here are the clues:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person with a vase of tulips lives next to the guitarist.
3. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives next to the person with carnations.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

Let's use these clues to figure out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

- The flutist lives in house number 2.
- The pianist must be in either house number 3 or house number 4 because there is one house between the flutist and the pianist.

If the pianist is in house number 3, then the guitarist must be in house number 2 (but the flutist is already in house number 2), which doesn't work. So, the pianist must be in house number 4.

If the pianist is in house number 4, then the guitarist must be in house number 3.

Now we know:
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Guitarist
- House 4: Pianist

The person with the bouquet of lilies and the person with the carnations must be in houses 1 and 4. Since the pianist is in house 4, the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in house 1, and the person with the carnations must be in house 4 (but that's already taken by the pianist), so the person with the carnations must be in house 1.

This leaves house 2 for the person with the vase of tulips.

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house number 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:

1. The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.
2. The person who likes green lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other.
4. The percussionist doesn't live in the second house.
5. The person who drinks root beer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drinks root beer.
6. The person who drinks root beer lives somewhere to the left of the person who eats grapes.
7. There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.

Let's start with what we know:

- House 1: The person eating kiwis.
- House 2: The person who likes green.
- House 3: The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy (they live next to each other).

Since the person eating kiwis is in the first house, and the person who likes green is also in the first house, this means the person who likes green and the person eating kiwis are in the same house. So, the person who likes green is in the first house, and the person eating kiwis is also in the first house.

Now, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the percussionist doesn't live in the second house, the percussionist must live in the first house. But we already know the first house is taken by the person eating kiwis. So, the percussionist must live in the third house.

This leaves the second house for the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy. Since they live next to each other, and the percussionist is in the third house, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3. But since the third house is taken by the percussionist, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3.

So, the cellist must live in the third house.

The number of the house where the cellist lives is **(C) 3**."
"Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct placement of each person step by step:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the tea drinker lives.

We know the following:
1. The person in house 3 is wearing high heels.
2. The person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza live next to each other.
3. The person who is eating mangos lives to the right of the coffee drinker.
4. The person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker.
5. The person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the coffee drinker.
6. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
7. The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
8. The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
9. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
10. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
11. The person who is wearing high heels lives in house 3.
12. The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other.

From clue 9, the coffee drinker must be to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. From clue 10, the person who had pizza is to the left of the coffee drinker. So, the coffee drinker must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

From clue 4, the person who is eating mangos is to the right of the coffee drinker, so the person who is eating mangos must be in house 4. This means the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

From clue 3, the person who is eating grapes is to the right of the coffee drinker, so the person who is eating grapes must be in house 3.

From clue 6, the person who drives a truck must be in house 1, and the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2. But we already know the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 2, so the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2, which is a contradiction. So, the person who owns an SUV must be in house 4, and the person who drives a truck must be in house 1.

From clue 7, the person who drives a truck (in house 1) lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. So, the tea drinker must be in house 2.

So, the tea drinker lives in house 2.

The answer is **(A) 2**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

We have the following clues:
1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

From clue 4, we know the person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house. So, the fifth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 7, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other. Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk must be in the first and second houses. But from clue 2, the person who had pizza does not live in the first house, so the person who had stew must be in the first house and the person who likes milk must be in the second house.

From clue 3, the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew is in the first house, the root beer lover must be in the second house.

From clue 5, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person who had stew
- House 2: Person who likes milk (root beer lover)
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Person who only drinks water

Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house, the answer is:

(A) 5"
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the bouquet of daffodils lives.

1. **Clue 1**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the soccer player and the person eating oranges must be in houses 1 and 2.

2. **Clue 2**: The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - This means the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
   - This means the person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person with daffodils must be in a house to the right of the person eating oranges.

From Clue 1, we know the soccer player and the person eating oranges must be in houses 1 and 2. So, the person eating oranges is in house 1 and the soccer player is in house 2.

From Clue 2, the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the person eating oranges is in house 1, the person with daffodils must be in house 2 (because the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be next to each other, and house 1 is taken by the person eating oranges).

From Clue 3, the person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos. Since the person eating mangos must be in house 1 (because the person eating oranges is in house 1 and the person with daffodils is in house 2), the person with tulips must be in house 3.

So, the person with the bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

1. The violinist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Violinist

2. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in either House 1 or House 3.

3. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (where the violinist lives) and the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2.

4. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person with a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3 (where the history book buff lives).

5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in House 3 (where the person who ate fried rice lives).

6. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives.
   - This means the person with a radio must be in either House 2 or House 3, and the history book buff must be in either House 3 or House 4 (but since there are only 3 houses, the history book buff must be in House 3).

7. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (where the violinist lives) and the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2.

Given these constraints, let's see where the vase of tulips can be:

- The violinist is in House 1.
- The person who ate spaghetti is in either House 1 or House 3.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils is in House 1 or House 2.
- The history book buff is in House 3.
- The person who ate fried rice is in House 3.
- The person with a radio is in House 2 or House 3.
- The person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone are next to each other.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils is to the left of the percussionist.

Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the percussionist and the violinist is in House 1, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1. This leaves House 2 for the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone.

Therefore, the person with a vase of tulips must live in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: ?

Next, clue 3 tells us the bird keeper does not live in the first or third house. So, the bird keeper must be in the third house.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Bird keeper

Clue 4 says the history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the history book buff is in the second house, the bouquet of lilies must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Bouquet of lilies
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Bird keeper

Clue 5 says the percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the computer must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement now is:

- House 3: Bird keeper

Clue 6 says the fish enthusiast does not live in the first house. Since the fish enthusiast cannot be in the first house, they must be in the third house.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Computer
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Fish enthusiast

Clue 7 says the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the gameboy is in the second house, the rose bouquet must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Fish enthusiast

Finally, clue 8 says the cellist does not live in the third house. Since the cellist cannot be in the third house, they must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Fish enthusiast

Now, we need to place the person who has a gameboy. The gameboy is in the second house, and the person who has a gameboy is directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the rose bouquet is in the first house, the gameboy must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader

Therefore, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 1.

"Let's break down the clues and figure out where each person lives and what they like based on the given information.

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the person wearing boots lives in house 2. So, the person in house 2 is wearing boots.

Now, let's look at clue 1. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, then the person driving the convertible must be in house 1. This means the person in house 1 is driving the convertible.

Since the person in house 1 is driving the convertible, they can't be the history book buff (because the history book buff must be in house 2). So, the person in house 1 must be the mystery book reader.

This leaves the person in house 2 as the history book buff.

Now, we know the person in house 1 is the mystery book reader and is driving the convertible. The person in house 2 is the history book buff and is wearing boots.

The only car left for the person in house 1 is the truck, and the only book left for the person in house 2 is the mystery book. So, the person in house 1 is wearing sandals.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the basketball player lives.

1. The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff lives in House 4 and the mystery book reader lives in House 3.
   - House 3: Mystery book reader
   - House 4: History book buff

4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - Since the mystery book reader is in House 3, the swimmer cannot be in House 3.
   - The swimmer must be in House 2.

5. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

Now we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Swimmer
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 2, and the only person left is the basketball player.

So, the basketball player lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We know the mystery book reader lives in the third house. So, we can start by placing the mystery book reader in the third house.

1. The third house is occupied by the mystery book reader.
2. The person wearing high heels cannot be in the second or fourth house. So, they must be in the first or third house. Since the third house is taken by the mystery book reader, the person wearing high heels must be in the first house.
3. The person wearing high heels (first house) and the person wearing loafers (second house) must be to the right of each other. This means the person wearing loafers must be in the fourth house.
4. The person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses. Since the first and fourth houses are taken, the only remaining houses are the second and third. The person wearing sandals must be in the second house, and the romance book lover must be in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person wearing high heels
- Second house: Person wearing sandals
- Third house: Mystery book reader
- Fourth house: Person wearing loafers

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and we need to figure out which house the person with the computer lives in. Here are the clues again:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Let's think through this:

- Since the person who likes yellow can't be in the second house, they must be in either the first or the third house.
- If the person who likes yellow is in the first house, then the person who likes green must be in the second house (because they are neighbors). But then the person who has a gameboy would have to be in the third house, and the person who has a computer would be in the second house, which doesn't fit the clue that the person who has a gameboy is directly left of the person who has a computer.
- So, the person who likes yellow must be in the third house. This means the person who likes green is in the second house (because they are neighbors). And the person who has a gameboy must be in the first house (because they are neighbors with the person who likes green).

Now, the person who has a computer must be in the second house (because the person who has a gameboy is directly left of the person who has a computer).

So, the person who has a computer lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

1. The root beer lover lives in the third house.
2. The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
3. The tea drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
5. The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
6. The person who likes white lives two houses away from the coffee drinker.
7. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
8. The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From clue 5, the root beer lover lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From clue 7, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses. This means they must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses or the third and fourth houses.

From clue 6, the person who likes white lives two houses away from the coffee drinker. This means the coffee drinker and the person who likes white must be in houses that are two apart.

From clue 8, the tea drinker does not live in the second house. So, the tea drinker must live in the first, third, or fourth house.

Let's try placing the tea drinker in the first house. If the tea drinker is in the first house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the second and fourth houses, respectively. This leaves the green drinker and the yellow drinker for the second and fourth houses, but the green drinker cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 2). So, the green drinker must be in the second house, and the yellow drinker must be in the fourth house.

This leaves the red drinker and the coffee drinker for the first and fourth houses. Since the red drinker is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house.

So, the coffee drinker lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the cat lover lives.

1. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.**
   - This means the person in house 1 likes fantasy books.

2. **Fish enthusiast lives in house 2.**
   - This means the person in house 2 likes fish.

3. **Person who had pizza does not live in house 1.**
   - This means the person who had pizza must live in house 2.

4. **Person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
   - If the person who likes green is in house 2, the person who has a radio must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, person who likes green, and person who had pizza.
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, person who has a radio, and person who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who had pizza (in house 2) and the person who likes green (in house 2) are already determined, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person who has a radio (in house 1) must have a phone (since the radio is the only other device).
- The person who ate spaghetti (in house 2) must have a radio (since the radio is already taken by the person in house 1).
- The person who is a cat lover must be in house 1.

Therefore, the person who is a cat lover lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the cat lover lives is **1**."

6. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
7. The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.
8. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
9. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
10. The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
11. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
12. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
13. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From Clue 8, we know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house, we can write:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis

From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From Clue 11, the person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person who is eating oranges must live in either house 1, 3, or 4.

From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must live in either house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 5, the flutist lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person eating kiwis.

From Clue 6, the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 7, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2 or 4.

From Clue 13, the cat lover lives in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person eating kiwis, the cat lover must be the person eating kiwis, which contradicts Clue 13. Therefore, the cat lover must be in a different house.

Let's summarize the constraints:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis
- House 2: Person drinking water
- House 3: Person drinking milk
- House 4: Person drinking root beer

From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 11, the person who is eating oranges must live in either house 3 or 4.

From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water must live in either house 2 or 4.

Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2. The person who only drinks water must live in house 2, and the person who likes milk must live in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is eating oranges must live in house 4.

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who had stew lives.

We have the following clues:
1. Grilled cheese and pizza are next to each other.
2. Grilled cheese and tulips are next to each other.
3. Grilled cheese and spaghetti are next to each other.
4. Grilled cheese and stew are next to each other.
5. Oranges are to the left of apples.
6. There are two houses between where oranges and kiwis live.
7. Oranges and carnations are next to each other.
8. Apples and mangos are next to each other.

From clue 1, clue 2, clue 3, and clue 4, we know grilled cheese must be in house 1 and pizza in house 2. This is because grilled cheese and pizza must be next to each other, and the only way to fit all these clues is if they are in houses 1 and 2.

Now, let's place the other clues:
- Oranges and apples must be next to each other (clue 2).
- Oranges and carnations must be next to each other (clue 7).
- Apples and mangos must be next to each other (clue 11).

Let's try to fit these in:
- If grilled cheese is in house 1, then pizza must be in house 2.
- Oranges and apples must be next to each other, so they could be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
- Oranges and carnations must be next to each other, so they could be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
- Apples and mangos must be next to each other, so they could be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

Given these, the only way to fit all the clues is:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Oranges
- House 4: Apples
- House 5: Mangos

This leaves house 4 for the person who had stew, as it's the only place left.

So, the person who had stew lives in house 4. The answer is (D) 4."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the fish enthusiast lives.

1. The cat lover lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the cat lover.
2. The tulip owner lives directly next to the dog owner. This means if the dog owner is in house 5, the tulip owner is in house 4, and if the dog owner is in house 4, the tulip owner is in house 3.
3. The daffodils owner does not live in the second house.
4. The lilies owner lives to the right of the horse owner.
5. There is one house between where the horse owner lives and where the carnations owner lives.

Let's start by placing the cat lover in house 1. Now we have:
- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Daffodils (since it can't be house 1 and it's not the tulip or carnation owner)
- House 3: Horse (since it can't be house 2 and it's not the tulip or carnation owner)
- House 4: Dog (since it can't be house 3 and it's not the tulip or carnation owner)
- House 5: Fish (the only pet left)

Now let's check the clues:
- Clue 1: The tulip owner lives directly next to the dog owner. This means the tulip owner is in house 4 and the dog owner is in house 5.
- Clue 2: The daffodils owner does not live in the second house. This is true since the daffodils owner is in house 2.
- Clue 4: The lilies owner lives to the right of the horse owner. This is true since the horse owner is in house 3 and the lilies owner is in house 4.
- Clue 3: There is one house between where the horse owner lives and where the carnations owner lives. This is true since the horse owner is in house 3 and the carnations owner is in house 4.

So, the fish enthusiast must live in house 5.

The number of the house where the fish enthusiast lives is \(\boxed{5}\).

Since the options provided are (A) 2, (B) 3, (C) 1, (D) 4, and house 5 is not an option, it seems there might be a mistake in the options. Based on the clues, the correct answer should be house 5."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the person with a phone lives in house 1.
2. The person who wears boots doesn't live in house 2.
3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other.

From clue 1, we know house 1 has a phone. So, house 2 doesn't have a phone.

From clue 2, the person who wears boots can't be in house 2. So, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

From clue 3, the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other. Since house 1 has a phone, it can't be the person with a radio. So, house 1 must have the person who owns horses.

This means house 2 has the person who has a radio and is wearing high heels.

So, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler approach.

We have four houses, and each house has a different person living in it. Each person plays a different sport and has a different pet. Here are the clues again:

1. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
3. The baseball player lives in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

Let's use these clues to figure out where each person lives.

### Step 1: Baseball Player
From clue 3, we know the baseball player lives in the second house. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

### Step 2: Basketball Player
From clue 1, the basketball player does not live in the first house. From clue 2, the basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the baseball player is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

### Step 3: Swimmer
From clue 2, the basketball player (House 1) lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the basketball player is in House 1, the swimmer must be in House 2 or House 3. But since the baseball player is already in House 2, the swimmer must be in House 3. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

### Step 4: Tennis Player and Cat Lover
From clue 6, the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the baseball player is in House 2 and the swimmer is in House 3, the tennis player must be in House 3 and the cat lover must be in House 4. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cat lover

### Step 5: Bird Keeper
From clue 5, the bird keeper does not live in the first house. From clue 7, the bird keeper does not live in the third house. So, the bird keeper must be in House 1. This leaves the fish enthusiast to be in House 4. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Bird keeper
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cat lover

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the soccer player lives.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. Here are the clues again:

1. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
2. There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
4. The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.
5. The violinist does not live in the first house.
6. The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
7. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

Let's start by placing the baseball player and the person who likes blue. From clue 2, the baseball player is in house 2 and the person who likes blue is in house 3.

Now, let's place the sedan and SUV. From clue 3, the sedan and SUV must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But house 2 is already taken by the baseball player, so the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 3. This means the person who owns a sedan is in house 1 and the person who owns an SUV is in house 3.

From clue 4, the swimmer must be in house 3, which is correct since the person who owns an SUV is in house 3.

Now, let's place the violinist. From clue 5, the violinist cannot be in house 1. So the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. But house 2 is already taken by the baseball player, so the violinist must be in house 3. This means the person who owns a gameboy must be in house 2 (since the sedan and gameboy are next to each other and the sedan is in house 1).

So, we have:
- House 1: Person who owns a sedan
- House 2: Person who owns a gameboy
- House 3: Person who owns an SUV

From clue 7, the guitarist must be in house 3, which is correct since the person who owns an SUV is in house 3.

This leaves the person who likes white and the soccer player. From clue 1, the person who likes white must be in house 1 or 3. But house 1 is already taken by the person who owns a sedan, so the person who likes white must be in house 3. This means the soccer player must be in house 1.

So, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

1. The pianist does not live in the first house.
2. The person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwis.
3. The pianist and the person wearing high heels live directly next to each other.
4. The person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.
5. The person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.
6. The person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.
7. The person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, let's place the remaining people:

- **Person eating oranges (O)** and **Person eating kiwis (K)** are next to each other.
- **Person eating kiwis (K)** is to the left of **Person wearing boots (B)**.
- **Person wearing high heels (H)** and **Person with a radio (R)** are next to each other.
- **Person eating oranges (O)** is directly left of **Person with a television (T)**.

Let's try placing the remaining people:

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, let's verify:

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

- **Pianist (P) is in house 1**.
- **Person wearing high heels (H) is in house 2**.
- **Pianist (P) and person wearing high heels (H) are next to each other**.
- **Person eating oranges (O) is in house 4**.
- **Person eating kiwis (K) is in house 5**.
- **Person eating kiwis (K) is to the left of person wearing boots (B)**.
- **Person wearing high heels (H) and person with a radio (R) are next to each other**.
- **Person eating oranges (O) is directly left of person with a television (T)**.

All clues are satisfied with this arrangement. Therefore, the person with a television lives in house 8.

The correct answer is (A) 8."
"Let's go through the clues step by step to figure out where the person who owns a sedan lives.

1. The tea drinker does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
3. The person who likes red does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
5. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
6. There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
8. The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
9. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
10. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
11. The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
12. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.
13. The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes milk lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the milk drinker.

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples also lives in the third house. This contradicts clue 7, so there must be a mistake. Let's assume the person who is eating apples lives in the second house instead.

Now, the third house is occupied by the milk drinker, and the second house is occupied by the person who is eating apples.

From clue 1, the tea drinker does not live in the first house, so the first house is occupied by the person who likes red.

From clue 4, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other. Since the milk drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the milk drinker is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must be in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must be in the fourth house.

From clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who likes yellow is in the fourth house, the root beer lover must be in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must be in the fifth house.

From clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the milk drinker is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the fourth or fifth house. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the fourth house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the fifth house.

From clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the milk drinker is in the third house and the person who only drinks water is in the second house, the person who likes red must be in the first house.

From clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red is in the first house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the second house.

From clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a truck is in the fifth house, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

From clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green is in the fifth house, the person who is eating mangos must be in the fourth house.

From clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow is in the fourth house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the third house.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step with the clues given:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - So, the third house is occupied by the fried rice eater.

2. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since the fried rice eater is in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second house.

3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
   - So, the first house is occupied by the swimmer.

4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.
   - This is already taken care of because the fried rice eater is in the third house.

So, we have:
- First house: swimmer
- Second house: spaghetti eater
- Third house: fried rice eater

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing boots lives.

1. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
   - House 5: Blue

2. **Clue 9:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: White

3. **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
   - Possible positions for green and truck: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
   - Possible positions for red and yellow: (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

5. **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.
   - Possible positions for sedan and running shoes: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)

6. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
   - Possible positions for boots and truck: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

   - Possible positions for truck: (1, 2), (3, 5)

8. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - Possible positions for truck and sandals: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

    - Possible positions for loafers and truck: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

11. **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.
    - Possible positions for SUV: (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

Now, let's place the known elements:

- House 5: Blue
- House 4: White
- House 1: SUV (since it cannot be in the first house)
- House 2: Running shoes (since it cannot be in the first house and there are two houses between sedan and running shoes)
- House 3: Green (since it cannot be in the first house and there is one house between green and truck)

So, we have:
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue

Next, we need to place the truck and sandals:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

Since the truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in a house to the right of the truck, we can place:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

Finally, we need to place the truck and sandals:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

Since the truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in a house to the right of the truck, we can place:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

### Conclusion

The person who is wearing boots must live somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck. Given the constraints, the only possible position for boots is in House 1.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is **(A) 1**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house (house number 1).
2. There is one house between where the person who had stew lives and where the history book buff lives. Since the history book buff is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in either house 2 or 3.
3. The person who had pizza is in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast is also in the second house. So, the person who had stew can't be in the second house.
4. Therefore, the person who had stew must be in house 3.
5. There is one house between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who had stew lives. Since the person who had stew is in house 3, the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

So, the history book buff lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is:
(B) 1"

1. **Clue 7**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Daffodils

2. **Clue 6**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Loafers

3. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - Since House 2 is Daffodils, House 1 must be Lilies (because House 2 is to the right of House 1).
   - House 3 is Loafers, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1.
   - House 1: Lilies (science fiction book fanatic)
   - House 2: Daffodils

4. **Clue 4**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house.
   - So, the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 or House 2.
   - Since House 1 is already taken by the science fiction book fanatic, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Yellow (loves yellow, has daffodils)

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house.

So, the person who likes green must be in House 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with the clues given:

1. The person wearing running shoes lives in the first house. So, the first house is taken by the person with running shoes.
2. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a minivan lives directly next to the person who is wearing high heels.
4. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly next to the person who drives a convertible.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live next to each other.
6. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.

From clue 1, we know the first house is taken by the person with running shoes.

From clue 6, the fourth house is taken by the person who owns an SUV.

Now, let's look at clue 5. The person with running shoes and the person with boots must be next to each other. Since the first house is taken by the person with running shoes, the person with boots must be in the second house.

Next, clue 4 tells us that the person with sandals and the person with a convertible must be next to each other. Since the second house is taken by the person with boots, the person with sandals must be in the third house, and the person with a convertible must be in the fifth house.

Finally, clue 3 tells us that the person with a minivan must be next to the person with high heels. Since the fourth house is taken by the person with an SUV, the person with a minivan must be in the third house, and the person with high heels must be in the fifth house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Minivan, Sandals
- House 4: SUV
- House 5: High heels, Convertible

Therefore, the person with running shoes lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

1. The cricketer lives in the first house (House 1).
2. The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
3. The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.

Let's place the people based on these clues:

- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: (Sedan owner, Cat lover, Horse owner, Truck driver)
- House 3: (Sedan owner, Cat lover, Horse owner, Truck driver)

Since the cricketer is in House 1, the sedan owner, cat lover, and horse owner must be in Houses 2 and 3. Also, the horse owner and sedan owner must be in adjacent houses because the horse owner lives directly left of the sedan owner.

So, let's try placing the sedan owner and the horse owner in Houses 2 and 3:

- House 2: Sedan owner
- House 3: Horse owner

This leaves the cat lover and the truck driver to be placed in Houses 2 and 3. Since the cat lover must be adjacent to the sedan owner, and the horse owner is already in House 3, the cat lover must be in House 2. This leaves the truck driver to be in House 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Cat lover
- House 3: Sedan owner

Since the truck driver lives in House 3, the basketball player must live in House 2.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.

The answer is (E) 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with the clues given:

1. The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live next to each other.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
4. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
5. The root beer lover lives next to the person who owns an SUV.
6. There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
8. The person who drives a convertible lives next to the person who only drinks water.
9. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing running shoes in the second house (Clue 7).

- House 2: Running shoes

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Milk drinker

Now, the person who is wearing running shoes (House 2) and the person who likes milk (House 3) are placed. We need to place the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice next to each other (Clue 1).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

So, the only remaining houses are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who drives a convertible and the person who only drinks water next to each other (Clue 8).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Since the person who drives a convertible lives next to the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), we can place them as follows:

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining house is 2, and it must be the person who drives a convertible, and the house to the left of it must be the person who only drinks water.

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, we need to place the person who is wearing high heels and the person who owns an SUV (Clue 3 and Clue 5).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3), so the only remaining house for the high heels wearer is House 1.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Sedan owner

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the cellist lives.

We know:
1. The tea drinker lives in house 4.
2. The saxophonist lives in house 2.
3. The pizza eater lives in house 3 (because the pizza eater is to the right of the saxophonist, and the saxophonist is in house 2).
4. The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
5. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
6. The cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker (so the cellist must be in house 3, and the person who ate fried rice must be in house 4).

Now, let's fill in the rest:
- The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1 (because the pizza eater is in house 3, and the pizza eater is to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes).
- The person who likes milk must be in house 4 (because the tea drinker is in house 4, and the cellist is in house 3, so the person who likes milk must be in house 4 to be to the right of the cellist).

So, the only house left for the person who only drinks water and the person who is wearing loafers is house 1. Since the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 2.

Therefore, the cellist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who drives a truck lives.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the tennis player can't live next to each other.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.
   - So, daffodils and lilies must be in adjacent houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means the swimmer and the sedan owner must be in adjacent houses, with the swimmer being to the left.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - This means the truck driver and the carnations owner must be in adjacent houses, with the truck driver being to the left.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player must be to the left of the person with the lilies.

7. **Clue 7:** The swimmer does not live in the first house.
   - The swimmer must live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - This means the basketball player and the truck driver must be in adjacent houses, with the basketball player being to the left.

   - The minivan driver lives in house 4.

10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.

Now, let's use these clues to determine the positions of the other people:

- **House 4 (Minivan driver):** Root beer lover.
- **House 3 (Root beer lover):** Root beer lover.
- **House 2 (Swimmer):** The swimmer must be to the left of the sedan owner, and the sedan owner must be to the left of the truck driver. Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the swimmer must be in house 2.
- **House 1 (Swimmer):** The swimmer lives in house 2.
- **House 4 (Minivan driver):** Root beer lover.
- **House 3 (Root beer lover):** Root beer lover.
- **House 2 (Swimmer):** The swimmer lives in house 2.
- **House 1 (Swimmer):** The swimmer lives in house 1.
- **House 3 (Root beer lover):** The root beer lover lives in house 3.
- **House 4 (Minivan driver):** The minivan driver lives in house 4.

- **House 4 (Minivan driver):** The minivan driver lives in house 4.

From the above, we can see that the truck driver must be in house 1, as house 1 is the only house left for the truck driver to live in, given the constraints.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who drives a truck lives is **(A) 1**."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - So, the tea drinker is in house 1.

2. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.

3. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.

4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3, or 1 and 2.

5. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Now, let's combine these clues:

- From Clue 1, the tea drinker is in house 1.
- From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, the person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.
- From Clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3, or 1 and 2.
- From Clue 5, the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Let's test the possible positions:

- If the person eating oranges is in house 1 (Clue 5), then the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating apples must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person eating apples is in house 2, the person driving a convertible must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person driving a minivan is in house 3, and the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person driving a convertible is in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

So, the coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.

1. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means if the person who likes red is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
   - If the person who likes red is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either house 2 or house 3.

3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house 2.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. So, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

Now, we know:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

Since the person who likes white cannot live in house 3 (Clue 3), the person who likes white must live in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

This leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have 4 houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We also know the pets, cars, fruits, flowers, and books each person likes. We need to figure out which house the person who owns an SUV lives in based on the clues.

1. The SUV owner is in house 3. This is given directly.
2. The person who drives a convertible is in house 1.
3. The person who is eating mangos is in house 2.
4. The person who owns an SUV is in house 3.
5. The person who drives a minivan is in house 2 (since house 1 is taken by the convertible).
6. The person who drives a minivan and the history book buff live next to each other. Since the minivan is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1.
7. The bird keeper is in house 4 (since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos).
8. The bird keeper and the person with carnations are next to each other. So, the person with carnations is in house 3 (but we already know the SUV owner is in house 3, so this is a contradiction).
9. The person who has a bouquet of lilies is in house 1 (since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos).
10. The person who is eating grapes is in house 4 (since house 4 is the only house left).

So, the only consistent placement is:

- House 1: Person who drives a convertible
- House 2: Person who is eating mangos
- House 3: Person who owns an SUV
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with the clues given:

1. The person with a television lives directly left of the tea drinker.
2. The person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
3. The tea drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person with a television lives directly left of the guitarist.
5. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person eating a banana lives.
6. The person with a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person with a radio.
7. The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives in house 2. So, house 2 is occupied by the person with a rose bouquet.

From clue 4, the person with a television lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the person with a rose bouquet is in house 2, the person with a television must be in house 1 and the guitarist must be in house 3.

From clue 1, the person with a television (in house 1) lives directly left of the tea drinker. So, the tea drinker must be in house 2. But we already know the tea drinker is in house 2 from clue 7, so this is consistent.

From clue 3, the tea drinker does not live in the second house, which is already satisfied since the tea drinker is in house 2.

From clue 5, there is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person eating a banana lives. Since the person eating bananas is in house 1 and the flutist must be in house 3 (since house 2 is taken by the rose bouquet), this is consistent.

From clue 6, the person with a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person with a radio. Since the person with a radio is in house 1 and the person with a vase of tulips is in house 3, this is also consistent.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with a radio, eating bananas, and having a vase of tulips.
- House 2: Person with a rose bouquet.
- House 3: Person with a television, guitarist, and eating kiwis.

The root beer lover must live in house 1, as that is the only house left.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 1. The correct answer is (C) 1."

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

4. The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
5. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

7. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
8. The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

From clue 7, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast.

From clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic must live somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's look at the other clues:
- Clue 3 says the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. This means apples and sandals must be in adjacent houses.
- Clue 4 says the person who is eating apples does not live in the third house, so apples must be in either the first or the fourth house.
- Clue 5 says the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. This means mangos and sandals must be in adjacent houses.
- Clue 6 says there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. This means if apples are in the first house, sandals and boots must be in the second and fourth houses, respectively. But this doesn't fit with the sandals and mangos being adjacent. So, apples must be in the fourth house, and sandals and mangos must be in the first and second houses, respectively.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person eating mangos
- Second house: Person eating sandals
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast
- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic
- Fifth house: Person eating a banana

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have two houses, and we need to figure out which house the person wearing sandals lives in based on the clues given.

1. The person who ate fried rice doesn't live in the first house. So, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house.
2. The person who owns an SUV doesn't live in the second house. So, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first house.
3. The flutist lives directly next to the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the flutist must live in the first house.
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly next to the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

From these clues, we can conclude:
- First house (number 1): Flutist, wearing loafers, owns an SUV
- Second house (number 2): Person who likes white, wearing sandals, owns an SUV

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.
8. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who eats apples.
9. The person who eats apples lives directly left of the violinist.

From clue 4, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house (house 3).

From clue 1, the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who only drinks water does not live in the first house (clue 3), the person who only drinks water must live in house 2, and the person who drives a minivan must live in house 1.

From clue 5, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the sedan owner cannot be in house 1 (clue 2), the sedan owner must be in house 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3. But house 3 is occupied by the root beer lover, so the sedan owner must be in house 1, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

From clue 8, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who eats apples. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the person who eats apples must be in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils, so this is a contradiction. Let's recheck the sedan owner and the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 6, the cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. This means the cellist and saxophonist must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the cellist must be in house 1, and the saxophonist must be in house 2.

From clue 9, the person who eats apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the person who eats apples is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.

From clue 7, the person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover

The violinist must be in house 3, but since the root beer lover is in house 3, the violinist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the violinist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

1. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Yellow

2. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person wearing boots can't be in house 3, 4, or 5.

3. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
   - This means the fish enthusiast and the person with a phone must be in adjacent houses.

4. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the person with a television and the person who ate fried rice must be in adjacent houses, but the television must be to the left of the fried rice.

5. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not white

6. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the person wearing sandals and the person with a gameboy must be in adjacent houses, but the sandals must be to the left of the gameboy.

7. There is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4 or 4 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 2 and 4).

8. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not stew

9. The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover.
   - This means the person wearing loafers and the cat lover must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

10. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Grilled cheese

11. The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner.
    - This means the cat lover and the dog owner must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 (but since the cat lover is already in house 4 or 5, the dog owner must be in house 1 or 2).

12. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
    - House 2: High heels

13. The person who likes red does not live in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Not red

14. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
    - This means the person with a gameboy and the person wearing loafers must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

15. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
    - This means the fish enthusiast and the person with a radio must be in adjacent houses, but the fish enthusiast must be to the left of the radio.

16. The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television.
    - This means the person who owns horses and the person with a television must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 (but since the person with a television is already in house 2, the person who owns horses must be in house 1).

17. The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.
    - House 4: Blue

18. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
    - House 3: Not boots

19. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
    - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes white must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Not boots, not yellow, not stew
- House 4: Blue, loafers, not white
- House 5: Grilled cheese, not red, not stew
- House 6: Not white, not red, not stew

Since the person who likes blue lives in house 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 5 (since the loafers must be to the right of the cat lover, and the cat lover must be in house 1 or 2, but house 2 is already occupied by high heels).

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5.

The answer is (E) 5."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and two people living in them. Each person has a different device and a different type of flower in their foyer. We know the following:

1. The person with the bouquet of lilies doesn't live in the first house.
2. The person with the television lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the first house (house 1) has a television. So, the person in house 1 has a television.

Since the person in house 1 has a television, the person in house 2 must have the computer (because there's only one computer and one television).

From clue 1, the person with the bouquet of lilies can't be in house 1, so they must be in house 2. This means the person in house 2 has a bouquet of lilies.

So, the person with the computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break down the clues and see how we can figure out where the percussionist lives.

1. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 1, we know the science fiction book fanatic and the golfer are in different houses, and the golfer is to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. So, the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1 and the golfer is in House 2.

From clue 2, the pizza-eater and the history book buff are in adjacent houses. Since the golfer is in House 2, the pizza-eater and the history book buff must be in House 1. So, the pizza-eater is in House 1 and the history book buff is in House 2.

From clue 3, the guitarist and the person with the bouquet of daffodils are in adjacent houses, and the guitarist is to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils. Since the golfer is in House 2, the guitarist and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1. So, the person with the bouquet of daffodils is in House 1 and the guitarist is in House 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Pizza-eater, Person with bouquet of daffodils
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic, Golfer, History book buff, Guitarist

Since the percussionist is not mentioned in any of the clues, and we know the guitarist is in House 2, the percussionist must be in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

The correct answer is: (B) 1"
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the percussionist lives.

1. The violinist lives in house 4.
2. The dog owner is not in house 2.
3. The fish enthusiast and the horse owner are neighbors.
4. The flutist is next to the TV owner.
5. The TV owner is to the left of the radio owner.
6. The guitarist is to the right of the percussionist.
7. The gameboy owner is next to the TV owner.
8. The violinist is in house 4.
9. There are two houses between the phone owner and the horse owner.
10. The bird keeper is in house 5.

From clue 8, we know the violinist is in house 4. So, the house layout so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: ?
- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Bird keeper

From clue 9, there are two houses between the phone owner and the horse owner. This means the horse owner and the phone owner must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But house 4 is taken by the violinist, so the horse owner and the phone owner must be in houses 2 and 3.

From clue 3, the fish enthusiast and the horse owner are neighbors. So, they must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the horse owner cannot be in house 2 (because the phone owner must be between them and there are only two houses), the horse owner must be in house 3 and the fish enthusiast in house 2.

So, the layout now is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Fish enthusiast
- House 3: Horse owner
- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Bird keeper

From clue 1, the dog owner is not in house 2. So, the dog owner must be in house 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Fish enthusiast
- House 3: Horse owner
- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Bird keeper

From clue 4, the flutist is next to the TV owner. The TV owner must be to the left of the radio owner. So, the TV owner and the flutist must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But house 2 is taken by the fish enthusiast, so the TV owner and the flutist must be in houses 1 and 3.

Since the horse owner is in house 3, the TV owner must be in house 1 and the flutist in house 3.

So, the layout now is:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Fish enthusiast
- House 3: TV owner, Flutist, Horse owner
- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Bird keeper

From clue 6, the guitarist is to the right of the percussionist. The only remaining spots are houses 4 and 5. Since the bird keeper is in house 5, the percussionist must be in house 4 and the guitarist in house 5.

So, the final layout is:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Fish enthusiast
- House 3: TV owner, Flutist, Horse owner
- House 4: Guitarist
- House 5: Bird keeper

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the violinist lives.

1. The person with the radio lives somewhere to the right of the person eating apples.
2. The person with the radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
4. The basketball player does not live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1. So, house 1 is occupied by someone with a bouquet of lilies.

From clue 4, the basketball player does not live in house 1, so the basketball player must live in house 2.

Now, let's look at clue 1 and clue 2 together. The person with the radio lives somewhere to the right of the person eating apples and also to the right of the violinist. This means the person eating apples must be to the left of both the violinist and the person with the radio.

Since the person with the bouquet of lilies is in house 1, the person eating apples must be in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the violinist.

So, the violinist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the cricketer lives.

1. The tennis player lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
3. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

From clue 1, we know the tennis player lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the tennis player.

From clue 2, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. So, the fifth house is occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese.

From clue 3, the golfer lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the golfer.

Now, let's use clue 4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives. This means the fried rice and spaghetti must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses or the third and fourth houses or the fourth and fifth houses. But since the third house is occupied by the tennis player and the fourth house is occupied by the golfer, the fried rice and spaghetti must be in the first and second houses.

From clue 5, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must be in a house to the right of the pizza eater.

From clue 6, the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means if the person who had stew is in the first house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second house, and vice versa.

From clue 7, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player. Since the tennis player is in the third house, the soccer player must be in the first or second house.

Let's put it all together:
- Third house: Tennis player
- Fifth house: Grilled cheese
- Fourth house: Golfer
- First and second houses: Stew and Spaghetti
- Pizza and Cricketer: Pizza must be to the left of the cricketer

If we place Stew in the first house and Spaghetti in the second house, then the person who had pizza must be in the first house (since pizza is to the left of the cricketer). This means the cricketer must be in the second house.

So, the cricketer lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where each person lives.

1. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. So, the person wearing running shoes must live in the second house.
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 1.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water must live in house 1.

Now, let's summarize the characteristics:
- **House 1:** Person who only drinks water, person who likes white, person who ate spaghetti.
- **House 2:** Person who only drinks water (lives in house 1), person who ate spaghetti (lives in house 2), person who likes red, person who plays baseball (lives in house 1), person who wears loafers (lives in house 2).

From the above, we can see that the person who wears loafers lives in house 2.

So, the number of the house where the person who is wearing loafers lives is **(A) 2**."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the root beer lover lives.

1. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

We have three houses numbered 1, 2, and 3. Let's denote the people as A, B, and C, corresponding to houses 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house (house 2). So, the root beer lover can only be in house 1 or house 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house (house 2). So, the person eating oranges can only be in house 1 or house 3.
- **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. This means if the root beer lover is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3. If the root beer lover is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
- **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. This means if the coffee drinker is in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 3. If the coffee drinker is in house 3, the person eating mangos must be in house 1.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 3.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 3).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 2).

This configuration does not work because the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2.

- If the root beer lover is in house 3:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 1).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 1).

This configuration works because:
- The root beer lover is in house 3.
- The person who only drinks water is in house 1.
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating mangos is in house 1 (since the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the only remaining fruit is mangos).

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the spaghetti eater.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. So, the loafers must be in either the second or third house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house. So, the fried rice eater must be in either the first or third house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Boots wearer
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

Since the loafers cannot be in House 1 and they can't be in House 2 (because the boots wearer is there), the only place left for the loafers is House 3.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

Let's start with the dog owner in house 3.

- House 3: Dog owner

Now, the root beer lover is in house 5.

- House 5: Root beer lover

The person wearing sandals cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1 or 4.

- House 1: Not sandals
- House 4: Not sandals

The coffee drinker and the person with a rose bouquet are next to each other. They can't be in house 2 because the person with running shoes and the bird keeper are next to each other, and the person with running shoes can't be in house 2 either.

- House 1: Coffee drinker and rose bouquet
- House 2: Running shoes and bird keeper
- House 4: Not sandals (so it could be coffee drinker or rose bouquet)
- House 5: Root beer lover

The person with running shoes and the bird keeper are next to each other. They can't be in house 2 because the coffee drinker and rose bouquet are there.

- House 2: Running shoes and bird keeper
- House 4: Not sandals (so it could be coffee drinker or rose bouquet)

"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. The mystery book reader lives in house 1.
2. The tennis player does not live in house 1, so the tennis player must live in house 2.

Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the person who likes fantasy books must be in house 2. That's because there are only two houses left and two different types of book readers.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues and try to figure out the house where the person who likes white lives.

1. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
4. The person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
5. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.
6. There are two houses between where the person who likes green lives and where the pianist lives.
7. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.
8. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
9. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
10. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
11. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
12. The person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
13. The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
14. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes white lives in one of the houses 2, 3, or 4. Since the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who likes white cannot be in the fourth house (because the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes), the person who likes white must be in either the second or third house.

From clue 1, the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who likes white cannot be in the fourth house, the person who likes white must be in the second or third house.

From clue 13, the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. This means the person who likes white cannot be in the second house because the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

So, the person who likes white must be in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes white lives is 3.

The answer is (A) 3."

From clue 1, the golfer does not live in House 4.
From clue 2, the violinist does not live in House 4.

So, the golfer, violinist, and person with high heels can only be in Houses 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 8, the basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. This means the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 1 or 2, and the basketball player must be in House 3 or 4.

From clue 9, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk. This means the person who likes yellow must be in House 2 or 3, and the person who likes milk must be in House 3 or 4.

From clue 10, the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must be in House 1 or 2, and the flutist must be in House 2 or 3.

From clue 11, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. This means the root beer lover must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who likes blue must be in House 3 or 4.

From clue 12, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. This means the person who only drinks water must be in House 1 or 2, and the coffee drinker must be in House 3 or 4.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Cellist (Cellist)
- House 2: Flutist (Flutist)
- House 3: Basketball Player (Basketball Player)
- House 4: Golfer (Golfer)

From the above, the person who only drinks water must be in House 1 because it's the only option left for them to be to the left of the coffee drinker.

So, the person who only drinks water lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

7. The person who is eating grapes lives in the first house. (Clue 7)

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 2: Person who has a radio, person who ate grilled cheese, person who likes white, person who is eating apples, person who is a cricketer.
- House 3: Person who has a computer, person who is a soccer player.

From Clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese (in house 1) and the person who likes white (in house 2) are adjacent.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

1. The person who likes green lives in the first house. So, House 1 is for green.
2. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue. So, if we put blue in House 2, pizza must be in House 1. But we already know House 1 is for green, so this can't be. Let's try putting pizza in House 2 and blue in House 1.
3. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. So, if we put red in House 3, the carnations must be in House 2 or House 4.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house. So, House 4 is for fried rice.
5. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house. So, the truck can be in House 1, House 2, or House 4. But House 4 is for fried rice, so the truck can be in House 1 or House 2.
6. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red. So, if we put mangos in House 2, red must be in House 3.
7. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. So, if we put the truck in House 1, the lilies must be in House 2. But we already put mangos in House 2, so the truck can't be in House 1. If we put the truck in House 2, the lilies must be in House 3.
8. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan. So, if we put the minivan in House 1, spaghetti must be in House 4. But House 4 is for fried rice, so the minivan can't be in House 1. If we put the minivan in House 2, spaghetti must be in House 3.
9. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza. So, if we put mangos in House 2, pizza must be in House 1. But we already know House 1 is for green, so this can't be. Let's try putting mangos in House 3, pizza in House 2.
10. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. So, if we put red in House 3, grapes must be in House 4.
11. The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other. So, if we put pizza in House 2, the rose bouquet must be in House 3.
12. The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other. So, if we put blue in House 1, the SUV must be in House 2.
13. The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. So, if we put pizza in House 2, apples must be in House 3.

From all these clues, we can see that the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

So, the answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the person eating grapes lives in the second house.
2. The person driving a convertible also lives in the second house.
3. Since the person eating grapes lives in the second house, the person driving a convertible must also live in the second house.
4. This means the person eating mangos must live in the first house.

So, the person eating mangos lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where each person lives and what they like.

1. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
3. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
4. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes blue lives in house 2. So, house 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue.

From clue 3, the person who likes blue (in house 2) lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis. This means the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 3. But since the person who likes blue is in house 2, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1 (because they are to the left of the person who likes blue).

From clue 4, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in house 1, the person who is eating apples must be in house 1 (because they are directly left of the person who is eating oranges). But we already know house 1 is occupied by the person who is eating kiwis, so this can't be true. Instead, the person who is eating apples must be in house 3, and the person who is eating oranges must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Person eating oranges

This leaves house 3 for the person who likes white.

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. We know the following:

1. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
2. The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

From clue 3, we know the mystery book reader must be in house 2 because the gameboy is to the left of the mystery book reader. So, the gameboy is in house 1.

From clue 2, the soccer player must be in house 1 because the mystery book reader is in house 2.

From clue 1, the root beer lover must be in house 2 because the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the root beer lover is to the right of the person with the rose bouquet.

So, the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the person with the root beer is in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a rose bouquet lives is 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the dog owner lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

From Clue 4, we know the fish enthusiast and the dog owner must be in adjacent houses. So, they can be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

From Clue 2, there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner. This means the truck and the dog owner cannot be in houses 1 or 4. So, they must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

From Clue 3, the truck and the sedan must be in adjacent houses. So, if the truck is in house 2, the sedan must be in house 3. If the truck is in house 3, the sedan must be in house 4.

Now, let's test the possible positions for the dog owner and the truck:

1. **Dog owner in house 3:**
   - Truck must be in house 2.
   - This leaves house 4 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 2 and the dog owner is in house 3).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration works:
   - House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
   - House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
   - House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
   - House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

2. **Dog owner in house 4:**
   - Truck must be in house 3.
   - This leaves house 2 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 3 and the dog owner is in house 4).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 5).

Therefore, the only valid configuration is:
- House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
- House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
- House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
- House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

So, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with the clues given:

1. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
2. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
3. The root beer lover lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow. So, the third house is:
- Yellow

From clue 3, the second house is occupied by the person who likes root beer. So, the second house is:
- Root beer

Now, we need to place the person who likes blue. From clue 1, the person who likes blue must be to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the yellow person is in the third house, the blue person must be in the fourth house:
- Blue

From clue 4, the person who likes white must be to the right of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who only drinks water must be in a house to the left of the person who likes white. Since the yellow person is in the third house and the root beer person is in the second house, the only house left for the person who only drinks water is the first house:
- Only drinks water

This leaves the fourth house for the person who likes white:
- White

So, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler approach.

We have three houses, and each house has a person with a different shoe, pet, favorite color, fruit, and sport. We also have some clues to figure out where each person lives.

1. The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
2. The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. The person eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
4. The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
5. The person wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
6. The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
7. The person wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes.

Let's start with Clue 6:
- The person who likes blue lives in the second house (house 2).

So, we have:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Unknown

Next, Clue 1:
- The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges. This means the cricketer can't be in house 1, and the person who is eating oranges can't be in house 3.

So, the cricketer must be in house 3, and the person who is eating oranges must be in house 1.

Now we have:
- House 1: Person who is eating oranges
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricketer

Next, Clue 5:
- The person wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. This means the dog owner can't be in house 3, and the person wearing sandals can't be in house 1.

So, the dog owner must be in house 1, and the person wearing sandals must be in house 3.

Now we have:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricketer, Person wearing sandals

Next, Clue 4:
- The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. This means the person who likes green can't be in house 1, and the dog owner must be in house 1.

So, the person who likes green must be in house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Person who likes green
- House 3: Cricketer, Person wearing sandals

Next, Clue 3:
- The person eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. This means the basketball player can't be in house 3, and the person eating grapes can't be in house 1.

So, the basketball player must be in house 1, and the person eating grapes must be in house 3.

Now we have:
- House 1: Dog owner, Basketball player
- House 2: Person who likes green
- House 3: Cricketer, Person wearing sandals, Person eating grapes

Finally, Clue 7:
- The person wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes. This means the person eating grapes can't be in house 3, and the person wearing loafers must be in house 3.

So, the person wearing loafers must be in house 3.

Now we have:
- House 1: Dog owner, Basketball player
- House 2: Person who likes green
- House 3: Cricketer, Person wearing sandals, Person eating grapes, Person wearing loafers

The person who likes white (the only color left) must be the bird keeper, and since the bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (as house 1 is taken by the dog owner and basketball player), the bird keeper must be in house 2.

So, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the tennis player lives.

1. The dog owner lives in the fourth house.
2. The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
3. The coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.
4. The cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker, so the cellist lives in the fourth house.
5. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who likes milk, so the root beer lover lives in the first house and the person who likes milk lives in the second house.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer, so the grilled cheese eater lives in the third house.
7. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, so the tea drinker lives in the first house and the fried rice eater lives in the third house.
8. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer, so the swimmer lives in the first house and the fish enthusiast lives in the second house.
9. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, so the spaghetti eater lives in the first house and the flutist lives in the second house.
10. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover, so the guitarist lives in the second house.
11. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice, so the stew eater lives in the third house.
12. The tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper.

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- First house: Root beer lover, grilled cheese eater, tea drinker, spaghetti eater, swimmer
- Second house: Cellist, flutist, milk drinker, fish enthusiast, stew eater
- Third house: Guitarist, fried rice eater, grilled cheese eater, fried rice eater, stew eater
- Fourth house: Dog owner, cricketer, cellist, cellist, fish enthusiast
- Fifth house: Coffee drinker, cricketer, cellist, cellist, fish enthusiast

Since the tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper, and the bird keeper must be in the second house (since the guitarist is in the second house and the bird keeper must be to the right of the guitarist), the tennis player must be in the first house.

So, the tennis player lives in the first house.

The answer is (D) 1."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Each house has a person living in it, and each person has a different musical instrument, device, and pet. We know the following:

1. The cellist lives next to the person with the gameboy.
2. The dog owner doesn't live in house 1.

Let's think about the possible positions for the cellist and the person with the gameboy:

- If the cellist is in house 1, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 2 (because they are neighbors and the cellist is to the left).
- If the cellist is in house 2, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 1 (but that would mean the dog owner is in house 1, which is not allowed).

So, the only way to satisfy both clues is if the cellist is in house 1 and the person with the gameboy is in house 2. This means the dog owner must be in house 1.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who owns an SUV lives.

1. The person with a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - So, house 3: Gameboy

2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - So, house 1: Minivan

3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the phone and SUV must be next to each other, and the phone must be to the left of the SUV.

4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in house 3, the radio must be in house 4.

5. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The third house is occupied by the person with a gameboy, so the convertible cannot be in house 3.

6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The first house is occupied by the person with a minivan, so the computer cannot be in house 1.

Now, let's fill in the houses we know:
- House 1: Minivan
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Radio

Since the person with a phone must be next to the person with an SUV and the phone must be to the left of the SUV, the only place left for the phone is house 2. So, house 2 must have the phone, and house 3 must have the SUV.

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person with the carnations arrangement lives.

We know:
1. The computer is in house 2.
2. The tulips are in house 3.
3. The daffodils are in house 4.
4. The lilies are in house 5.
5. The phone is in house 1.
6. The television is in house 3 (since the phone is in house 1 and they are directly left of each other).
7. The rose bouquet is in house 1 (since the rose bouquet is next to the carnations arrangement and the phone is in house 1).
8. The carnations arrangement must be in house 4 (since the daffodils are in house 4 and they are to the right of the radio, and the radio must be in house 1).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Phone
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Television, Tulips, Carnations
- House 4: Daffodils
- House 5: Lilies

Therefore, the person with the carnations arrangement lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."

11. The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.
12. There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.

From clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives in the second house. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in the second house, so clue 5 is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate:

- **Bird Keeper (House 1):**
  - The bird keeper lives in the first house.
- **Cricketer (House 2):**
  - The cricketer lives in the second house.
- **Loafers (House 2 or 3):**
  - The cricketer and the person with loafers must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
- **Fish Enthusiast (House 2):**
  - The fish enthusiast cannot be in the second house, so the fish enthusiast must be in the third, fourth, or fifth house.
- **Golfer (House 4):**
  - The golfer lives in the fourth house.
- **Sandals (House 3 or 5):**
  - The person with sandals must live in the third or fifth house.
- **Running Shoes (House 4 or 5):**
  - The person with running shoes cannot live in the fourth house, so the running shoes must be in the fifth house.
- **Baseball Player (House 5):**
  - The baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals, so the baseball player must be in the fifth house.
- **Horses (House 3 or 4):**
  - The person who owns horses must live in the third or fourth house.
- **Boots (House 3 or 4):**
  - The person who is wearing boots must live in the third or fourth house.
- **Cat Lover (House 3 or 4):**
  - The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer, so the cat lover must be in the fourth house.
- **Dog Owner (House 3 or 4):**
  - The dog owner must be in the third or fourth house. Since the cat lover is in the fourth house, the dog owner must be in the third house.

So, the dog owner lives in **House 3**.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

3. **Radio and Truck**: The person with the radio and the person driving the truck live next to each other.
4. **Radio and Pizza**: The person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza.

From clue 4, we know the person with the radio must be in house 1 (since they live to the left of the person who had pizza). This means the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

   - This means the tea drinker (House 1) and the pizza eater (House 2) are next to each other.

6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
   - The spaghetti eater and the water drinker can't be next to each other.

2. **Clue 11**: The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - The person who is wearing loafers cannot live in the first house (Clue 7), so they must live in the second or third house.

8. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
9. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet.

17. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes.
18. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.

Let's start deducing:

- From clue 15, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.
- From clue 16, the swimmer lives directly left of the golfer, so the swimmer is in house 1 and the golfer is in house 2.
- From clue 17, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes, so the bouquet of lilies is in house 1 and the grapes are in house 2.
- From clue 11, the person who has a carnations arrangement and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Since the golfer is in house 2, the cricketer must be in house 3 and the person with carnations in house 4.
- From clue 14, the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, so the tea drinker is in house 5 and the tulips are in house 4.
- From clue 13, the person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house, so the mangos are in house 1 or house 5. But house 1 already has the bouquet of lilies, so the mangos are in house 5.
- From clue 12, there is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives. Since the grapes are in house 2, the daffodils must be in house 3.
- From clue 18, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis, so the daffodils are in house 3 and the kiwis are in house 5.
- From clue 4, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house, so the running shoes are in house 3.
- From clue 3, the person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house, so the mangos are in house 5.
- From clue 2, the person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house, so the oranges are in house 1 or house 5. But house 1 already has the bouquet of lilies, so the oranges are in house 5.
- From clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes milk is in house 1 and the person who only drinks water is in house 5, this clue is satisfied.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Swimmer (bouquet of lilies)
- House 2: Golfer (eating grapes)
- House 3: Person eating mangos
- House 4: Person wearing loafers (carnations)
- House 5: Tea drinker (vase of tulips)

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in **House 1**.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. The people play different sports, eat different foods, and have different flowers in their foyers. Here are the clues again:

1. The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. The soccer player lives in the third house.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the soccer player lives in house number 3. So, the arrangement looks like this:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Soccer player
- House 4: ?

Now, from clue 1, the golfer and the basketball player are next to each other, and the golfer is to the left of the basketball player. So, they must be in houses 1 and 2. This means:

- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Basketball player

From clue 2, the person who has lilies and the person who ate grilled cheese are next to each other, and the person with lilies is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. So, they must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the golfer is in house 1, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2. This means:

- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 3: Soccer player
- House 4: ?

From clue 4, the person who ate grilled cheese (in house 2) lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4. This means:

- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 3: Soccer player
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
3. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
4. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
5. The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
6. The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
7. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
9. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
10. The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other.
11. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
12. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.

From clue 2, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. This means the third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice.

From clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house. This is a bit confusing because we already know the third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice. So, let's assume the person who likes red lives in the third house, but the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

Now, let's look at the remaining clues:

- The person who likes yellow must be in the second or fourth house (Clue 8).
- The person who likes yellow must be directly left of the person who had stew (Clue 4).
- The person who had pizza must be to the right of the person who likes yellow (Clue 12).
- The person who likes white must be two houses away from the person who likes yellow (Clue 8).
- The person who likes blue must be in the first house (Clue 10).

Let's place the remaining people:

- The first house is occupied by the person who likes blue.
- The second house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.
- The third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice.
- The fourth house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.
- The fifth house is occupied by the person who likes red.

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing running shoes lives.

1. The tea drinker lives in the third house.
   - So, the third house is occupied by the tea drinker.

2. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in a house with a lower number than the person who ate spaghetti.

3. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the root beer lover lives in a house with a higher number than the person who is wearing sandals.

4. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese.

5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who is wearing running shoes lives in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew.

6. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses.

7. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2, 3, or 4.

Since the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1 (Clue 7), and the tea drinker is in house 3 (Clue 1), the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 or 4.

Let's consider house 2:
- If the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, then the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 (Clue 6).
- But house 3 is already occupied by the tea drinker (Clue 1), so this is not possible.

So, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

Now, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 (Clue 6).

This leaves house 1 for the person who had stew and house 2 for the person who is wearing running shoes.

Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew (Clue 5), and the person who had stew is in house 1, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the computer lives.

1. The cricketer lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
3. The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
4. The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
5. The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
6. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
7. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
8. The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
9. The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
10. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the fifth house.
11. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
12. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
13. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

From clue 1, we know the cricketer lives in the third house. From clue 2, the person who is wearing loafers also lives in the third house. From clue 5, the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. From clue 10, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the fifth house. From clue 11, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house. From clue 12, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. From clue 9, the soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.

Now, let's place the remaining people:
- The root beer lover cannot be in the first house (clue 3).
- The root beer lover must be somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio (clue 6).
- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice (clue 12).
- The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew (clue 12).

Let's place the root beer lover in the first house (since it's the only spot left for them and they can't be in the first house):
- First house: root beer lover
- Second house: tea drinker (since the tea drinker must be somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk)
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Seventh house: person who ate fried rice
- Eighth house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Ninth house: person who is wearing loafers
- Tenth house: person who had stew
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes

From clue 9, the soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. The only spot left for the soccer player and the person with the computer is the second and third houses, but the third house is already taken by the cricketer. So, the soccer player must be in the second house, and the person with the computer must be in the first house.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in the first house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, 1 and 2. One person in each house, and they each ate different foods and like different books. The clue tells us that the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who likes science fiction books.

- If the person who ate fried rice is in house 2, then the person who likes science fiction books must be in house 1.
- The person who ate pizza must be in house 1 because they can't be the one who ate fried rice.

So, the person who likes science fiction books (and ate pizza) lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pianist lives in house 1.
2. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in house 2.

From clue 1, we know the pianist lives in house 1. So, house 1 has the pianist.

From clue 2, the root beer lover must be in house 2 because they live somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses. Since house 1 already has the pianist, the person who owns horses must be in house 1. So, house 1 has the person who owns horses (which is a dog owner) and the person who likes white.

From clue 3, the person who likes white cannot be in house 2. Since house 1 already has the person who likes white, house 2 must have the root beer lover.

So, the person who owns horses (dog owner) lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the percussionist lives.

1. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. So, house 4 is for the pizza eater.
2. The person who had stew lives in the second house. So, house 2 is for the stew eater.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist. This means the guitarist can't be in house 4, and the violinist can't be in house 1.
4. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
5. There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
6. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
7. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. This is already confirmed.

So, we have:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater

Now, the guitarist and violinist must be in houses 1 and 3, but not in houses 4 and 1. Also, the guitarist must be to the left of the violinist. So, the guitarist is in house 1 and the violinist is in house 3.

This leaves:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist

Now, the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic must be in houses 1 and 3, but since the violinist is in house 3, the history book buff must be in house 1. This leaves house 3 for the science fiction book fanatic.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Pizza eater

The percussionist must be in house 4 because the history book buff is in house 1 and the science fiction book fanatic is in house 3, and the percussionist has to be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 4.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who owns horses lives.

1. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Likes white

2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Not wearing boots

3. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Not a bird keeper

4. The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils

5. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - Since House 1 likes white and House 2 has daffodils, House 3 must be the one who likes green.
   - So, House 3: Likes green
   - House 2: Wearing running shoes

6. The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - Since House 3 likes green and House 2 has daffodils, House 1 must be the one who owns horses.
   - So, House 1: Owns horses

7. The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - This is already covered by Clue 4, so House 1 (horses) and House 2 (daffodils) are next to each other.

8. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - Since House 1 likes white and House 2 has daffodils, House 3 must be the one who has a vase of tulips.
   - So, House 3: Has a vase of tulips
   - House 2: Wearing running shoes
   - House 1: Wearing sandals

From the clues, we can see that the person who owns horses lives in House 1.

So, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who likes milk lives.

1. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement looks like this:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person eating apples

From clue 2, the person eating mangos must live directly left of the person eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing boots lives.

1. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

2. The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means they must be in Houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means they must be in Houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Carnations arrangement

5. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means they must live in either House 1 or House 2.

6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 4, we know the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 1. So, House 1: Carnations arrangement.

From Clue 1, the science fiction book fanatic lives in House 2. So, House 2: Science fiction book fanatic.

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6).
- The person who likes white must be in House 3 (Clue 3).

Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips, and the person who likes white must be in House 3, the only place left for the person who likes red is House 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 3: Person who likes red

This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 because they cannot be in House 3 (Clue 5).

Therefore, the person who is wearing boots lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. The people have different flowers and drinks:

- One person has lilies.
- One person has tulips.
- One person has roses.
- One person drinks milk.
- One person drinks root beer.
- One person only drinks water.

We know the following clues:
1. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.
2. The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
3. The person who has lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has tulips.
4. The person who has lilies lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who only drinks water lives in house 1. So, house 1 is occupied by the person who only drinks water.

From clue 4, the person who has lilies lives in house 2. So, house 2 is occupied by the person who has lilies.

Now, we need to place the person who likes milk. From clue 1, there is one house between the person who only drinks water (house 1) and the person who likes milk. So, the person who likes milk must be in house 3. This means house 3 is occupied by the person who likes milk.

Now, we need to place the person who has tulips and the person who has roses. The person who has lilies (in house 2) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has tulips. Since the person who has lilies is in house 2, the person who has tulips must be in house 1 or house 3. But house 1 is already occupied by the person who only drinks water. So, the person who has tulips must be in house 3. This leaves house 1 for the person who has roses.

So, the person who has roses lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the cricketer lives.

1. The person wearing boots doesn't live in the second house.
2. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other.
4. The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
6. The person who has a phone doesn't live in the second house.
7. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
8. The tennis player lives in the third house.
9. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
10. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
11. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.

From clue 9, we know the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person who likes green.

From clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

From clue 8, the tennis player lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the tennis player.

From clue 10, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who has a radio must live in the second house. So, the second house is occupied by the person who has a radio.

From clue 6, the person who has a phone doesn't live in the second house, so the person who has a phone must live in the first house. But we already know the first house is occupied by the person who likes green.

From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a phone lives in the first house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is wearing sandals must live in the fourth house, the cricketer must live in the third house.

However, we have a contradiction because the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, and the person who has a gameboy also lives in the third house. This means we need to recheck the placement of the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy.

Since the person who likes blue lives in the third house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the fourth house. This means the cricketer must live in the second house.

So, the cricketer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and we need to figure out who lives in each house based on the clues given. Here are the clues again:

1. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
2. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in house 1. So, house 1 is yellow.

Now, let's use clue 2. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff must be in house 3, and the romance book lover must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: History book buff

Now, clue 1 tells us the person who likes green must be to the left of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who likes green must be in house 2. But we already know the romance book lover is in house 2, so this doesn't work. We need to switch the positions.

Let's try again:
- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 2: Green
- House 3: History book buff

Now, clue 3 says the person who had pizza does not live in the first house. So, the person who had pizza must be in house 3, which is the history book buff.

And clue 5 says the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in house 2, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 3, which is correct.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 2: Green
- House 3: History book buff

The person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the computer lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
   - This means the tennis player and the television can't be in the same house, and the tennis player must be in a house to the left of the television.

2. **Clue 2:** The golfer does not live in the second house.
   - So, the golfer can live in houses 1 or 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
   - This means the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
   - This means the radio and rose bouquet must be in houses with the radio being to the right of the rose bouquet.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.
   - This means the radio and television must be in houses with the radio being to the right of the television.

Let's start by placing the tennis player and the television based on Clue 1. The tennis player and the television cannot be in the same house, and the tennis player must be to the left of the television. So, the possible pairs are:
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 3
- Tennis player in house 2, television in house 3

### Case 1: Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Television (V) in house 2

Now, the golfer cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the golfer must be in house 1 or house 3. But since the tennis player is already in house 1, the golfer must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Golfer (G) in house 3

This leaves house 2 for the computer and house 3 for the radio and rose bouquet. Since the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses (Clue 3), and the radio and rose bouquet must be in adjacent houses (Clue 4 and Clue 5), we need to place the computer and tulips in house 2 and the radio and rose bouquet in house 3.

### Checking the placement:
- House 1: Tennis player (T)
- House 2: Computer (C) and Tulips (Tul)
- House 3: Radio (R) and Rose bouquet (Rb)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
1. Tennis player (T) is to the left of the television (V) in house 1 and house 2.
2. Golfer (G) is in house 3.
3. Computer (C) and tulips (Tul) are in adjacent houses (house 2).
4. Radio (R) and rose bouquet (Rb) are in adjacent houses (house 3).
5. Radio (R) is to the right of the television (V) in house 3.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing sandals lives.

1. The swimmer lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Swimmer

2. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist can't be in house 5, and the carnations person can't be in house 1.

3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - If sandals are in house X, tulips are in house X+1.

4. The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - If running shoes are in house X, daffodils are in house X+1.

5. The violinist lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Violinist

6. The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - If basketball player is in house X, guitarist is in house X+1.

7. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - If high heels are in house X, lilies are in house X+1.

8. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.
   - If loafers are in house X, percussionist is in house X+1.

9. The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Cricketer

10. The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.
    - They must be in houses X and X+1.

11. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

12. There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.
    - This means if sandals are in house X, the cellist must be in house X+3 or X-3 (but since houses are numbered 1 to 5, X-3 is not possible).

Now, let's use these clues to figure out the positions:

- House 1: Not possible for violinist, cricketer, or cellist.
- House 2: Violinist.
- House 3: Swimmer.
- House 4: Cricketer.
- House 5: Bouquet of daffodils.

Since the daffodils are in house 5, the running shoes must be in house 4 (since they live directly left of the daffodils). So, the person with running shoes is in house 4.

Now, the only house left for the person with sandals is house 1, because house 2 is taken by the violinist, house 3 is taken by the swimmer, and house 5 is taken by the daffodils.

So, the person wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (E) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Each house has a person living in it, and each person has a different pet, ate a different lunch, and wears different shoes. Here are the clues:

1. The person wearing high heels lives next to the fish enthusiast.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese. So, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels and ate grilled cheese.

From clue 1, the person wearing high heels lives next to the fish enthusiast. Since the fish enthusiast must be in house 1 (because the person in house 2 is wearing high heels), the fish enthusiast is in house 1 and the person wearing high heels is in house 2.

This means the person in house 1 is the dog owner (since the fish enthusiast is the fish enthusiast and the person in house 2 is the one who ate grilled cheese and wears high heels).

So, the person who had stew must be in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

10. The person who has a vase of tulips lives one house to the right of the romance book lover.
11. The person who likes red is in the 4th house.
12. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
13. The person who owns horses is in the 2nd house.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils are next to each other.

From clue 11, the person who likes red is in the 4th house. From clue 12, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who likes blue.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person eating oranges lives.

1. The person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live next to each other.
2. The person with a phone lives in the third house.
3. The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.
4. The flutist lives in the third house.
5. The person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing boots.
6. The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
7. The romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.
8. The person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
9. The person with a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the flutist.
10. There are two houses between where the person wearing high heels lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
11. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person eating oranges.
12. The person eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
13. The science fiction book fanatic and the person wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.

From clue 2, we know the person with a phone lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person with a phone.

From clue 4, the flutist lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the flutist.

From clue 6, the person wearing running shoes also lives in the third house. This contradicts clue 2, so we need to re-evaluate. Since clue 2 states the phone lives in the third house, and clue 6 states the running shoes live in the third house, we need to consider the possibility that the phone and running shoes are different people.

From clue 1, the person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live next to each other. Let's denote the person eating grapes as G and the person eating oranges as O. They must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

From clue 5, the person eating oranges (O) lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing boots (B). From clue 3, the saxophonist (S) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots (B). This means B must be to the right of S.

From clue 7, the romance book lover (R) lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic (SF). This means R and SF must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person wearing high heels (HH) lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast (FB) lives. This means HH and FB must be in houses 1 and 4 or 2 and 5 (but since we only have 4 houses, it must be 1 and 4).

From clue 12, the history book buff (HB) lives somewhere to the left of the person eating oranges (O). This means HB must be in house 1 or 2.

From clue 13, the person eating kiwis (K) does not live in the first house. So K must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 14, the percussionist (P) lives in the fourth house. So P is in house 4.

From clue 15, the science fiction book fanatic (SF) and the person wearing running shoes (RS) live directly next to each other. Since RS lives in the third house, SF must live in the second house.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: HB (History book buff)
- House 2: SF (Science fiction book fanatic)
- House 3: RS (Running shoes)
- House 4: P (Percussionist)

Since the person eating oranges (O) must be to the right of the person wearing boots (B) and B must be to the right of S, and O must be to the right of B, the only possible positions for O and B are:
- O in house 4 (since P is in house 4)
- B in house 3 (since RS is in house 3)

This leaves the person eating grapes (G) and the person wearing boots (B) in houses 1 and 2. Since HB is in house 1, B must be in house 2, and G must be in house 1.

So, the person eating oranges lives in house 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person eating apples lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who likes milk live next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker.
3. **Clue 3:** There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza.

Let's start with Clue 8 and Clue 9:
- The person who had stew does not live in house 3.
- The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

So, the person who had stew must live in house 1, and the person who only drinks water must live in house 2.

Next, Clue 10:
- The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
- Since the person who had stew is in house 1, the person who likes white must be in house 2 or 3 or 4.

Since the person who only drinks water is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 4.

Now, Clue 6:
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

Since the person who likes white is in house 4, the person who is eating apples must be in house 3 or 4. But since the person who likes white is in house 4, the person who is eating apples must be in house 3.

Now, Clue 2:
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
- The person who is eating oranges must be in house 1, and the person who is eating apples must be in house 3.

So, the person who had pizza must be in house 2, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 3.

Finally, Clue 1:
- The root beer lover and the person who likes milk live next to each other.
- The person who is eating oranges (house 1) and the person who is eating apples (house 3) are not next to each other, so the root beer lover and the person who likes milk must be in houses 2 and 4.

Since the person who likes white is in house 4, the person who likes milk must be in house 2, and the person who likes root beer must be in house 4.

So, the final configuration is:
- House 1: Person who had pizza, eating oranges
- House 2: Person who likes milk, eating apples
- House 3: Person who likes yellow, eating mangos
- House 4: Person who likes white, eating grapes

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where each person lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 5, we know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

From Clue 7, the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the saxophonist.

From Clue 6, the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

From Clue 4, the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

From Clue 1, the romance book lover (in the second house) lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the guitarist must be in the third house, and the history book buff must be in the second house. But we already know the second house is occupied by the romance book lover. So, the history book buff must be in the first house.

So, the final positions are:
- **House 1:** History book buff
- **House 2:** Romance book lover
- **House 3:** Saxophonist
- **House 4:** Mystery book reader
- **House 5:** Fantasy book enthusiast

The violinist lives in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with the clues given:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
   - So, House 4: Television

2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Loafers

3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
   - Since the second house is already taken by the person with loafers, the phone must be in either House 1 or House 3.

4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Since the loafers are in House 2, the boots must be in House 1.

5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. But since House 2 is already taken by loafers, the radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3.

Let's place the radio and sandals:
- If the radio is in House 1, then the sandals must be in House 3.
- If the radio is in House 3, then the sandals must be in House 1.

Since House 1 is already taken by boots, the only option left is:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television

This leaves the gameboy for House 2, but we already know House 2 has loafers. So, the gameboy must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:

1. The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives in house number 2.

From clue 2, since the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 2, and we already know the high heels person lives in house number 2, the coffee drinker must be in either house number 1 or house number 3.

From clue 3, the person who likes milk cannot be in house number 1, so they must be in house number 2 or house number 3. But we already know the person in house number 2 is wearing high heels, so the person who likes milk must be in house number 3.

From clue 4, the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 1, and we know the coffee drinker is not in house number 2, so the coffee drinker must be in house number 1.

From clue 5, the person wearing running shoes lives in house number 3, and we already know the person in house number 3 is the one who likes milk.

So, the person wearing high heels lives in house number 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the person wearing loafers doesn't live in the first house. So, they must live in the second house.
2. The mystery book reader can't live in the second house, so they must live in the first house.
3. That leaves the second house for the person wearing loafers.
4. The first house is for the mystery book reader.
5. The remaining person, who is the history book buff, must live in the second house.
6. The person in the first house is wearing high heels.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out which house the person who had pizza lives in.

We have the following clues:
1. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other.
2. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
3. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the third house.
4. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
5. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
6. The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who had stew.
7. The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
8. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live next to each other.
9. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
10. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

Let's start by placing the person who had pizza and the person who is wearing sandals based on clue 2 and clue 9:

- Clue 2: The person who had pizza (P) and the person who is wearing sandals (S) must be adjacent.
- Clue 9: The person who is wearing boots (B) must be to the left of the person who had pizza (P).

Let's try different placements:

- If P is in house 1, then S must be in house 2 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 2, then B must be in house 1 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is not possible because P and S must be adjacent, and B must be to the left of P. So, let's try another arrangement:

- If P is in house 2, then S must be in house 3 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 3, then B must be in house 2 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is also not possible because P and S must be adjacent, and B must be to the left of P.

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is possible. Let's check the other clues with this arrangement:

- Clue 1: The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a gameboy (G) live next to each other.
- Clue 4: The person who has a vase of tulips (T) lives directly left of the person who had pizza (P).
- Clue 5: The person who has a carnations arrangement (C) lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
- Clue 6: The person who is wearing running shoes (R) lives directly left of the person who had stew (St).
- Clue 7: The person who has a television (Tv) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).
- Clue 8: The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a rose bouquet (Rb) live next to each other.
- Clue 10: The person who ate spaghetti (Sp) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).

Let's place the remaining items:

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4.
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (Clue 9).
- If R is in house 2, then G must be in house 1 (Clue 1).
- If T is in house 1, then C must be in house 2 (Clue 4).
- If R is in house 2, then St must be in house 3 (Clue 6).
- If Rb is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 8).
- If Sp is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 10).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the person eating mangos lives in house 1.
2. The saxophonist lives in house 2.
3. From Clue 1, the rose bouquet is in house 1 and the lilies are in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person eating mangos (mango eater)
- House 2: Saxophonist (saxophonist)
- Rose bouquet in house 1
- Lilies in house 2

Since the person eating apples must be in house 2 (because the mangos are in house 1 and the saxophonist is in house 2), the answer is:

(B) 2"
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
2. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible.
3. The person who only drinks water does not live in the third house.

From clue 15, the person who has a radio lives in the first house, so the first house is occupied by the person with a radio.

From clue 16, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house, the person with a television must live in one of the houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's test the possible placements:

1. If the person who only drinks water is in house 3, the basketball player must be in house 2.
2. If the person who only drinks water is in house 4, the basketball player must be in house 3.
3. If the person who only drinks water is in house 5, the basketball player must be in house 4.

Let's test the placements:

- If the person who only drinks water is in house 3, the basketball player must be in house 2. This means the person with a television must be in house 5 (since the person with a television cannot be in house 1 or 2, and the person with a radio is in house 1).
- If the person who only drinks water is in house 4, the basketball player must be in house 3. This means the person with a television must be in house 5 (since the person with a television cannot be in house 1, 2, or 3, and the person with a radio is in house 1).

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who drives a truck lives.

1. The person with tulips doesn't live in the third house.
2. The person with an SUV lives next to the person with lilies.
3. The person with a sedan and the person with roses live next to each other.
4. The person with roses doesn't live in the second house.

Let's consider the possible houses for each person:

- The person with roses can't be in the second house, so they can be in the first or third house.
- The person with tulips can't be in the third house, so they can be in the first or second house.
- The person with lilies must be next to the person with an SUV.
- The person with a sedan and the person with roses must be next to each other.

Let's try placing the person with roses in the first house:
- If the person with roses is in the first house, the person with a sedan and the person with roses must be next to each other. So, the person with a sedan could be in the second house.
- If the person with roses is in the first house and the person with a sedan is in the second house, the person with lilies must be in the third house (since the person with an SUV must be next to the person with lilies).
- This leaves the person with tulips in the second house, but we already have the person with a sedan in the second house. So, this placement doesn't work.

Now, let's try placing the person with roses in the third house:
- If the person with roses is in the third house, the person with a sedan and the person with roses must be next to each other. So, the person with a sedan could be in the second house.
- If the person with roses is in the third house and the person with a sedan is in the second house, the person with lilies must be in the first house (since the person with an SUV must be next to the person with lilies).
- This leaves the person with tulips in the second house, but we already have the person with a sedan in the second house. So, this placement doesn't work either.

Finally, let's try placing the person with roses in the first house:
- If the person with roses is in the first house, the person with a sedan and the person with roses must be next to each other. So, the person with a sedan could be in the second house.
- If the person with roses is in the first house and the person with a sedan is in the second house, the person with lilies must be in the third house (since the person with an SUV must be next to the person with lilies).
- This leaves the person with tulips in the first house, which is okay because the person with tulips can't be in the third house.

So, the person with roses is in the first house, the person with a sedan is in the second house, the person with lilies is in the third house, and the person with tulips is in the first house.

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the basketball player lives.

1. The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The soccer player does not live in the fourth house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white.
6. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white.
7. The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
8. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house.
9. The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.
10. The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
11. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white.
12. The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
13. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
14. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives.

From clue 13, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

From clue 9, the person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.

From clue 10, the person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible, the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house, and the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

From clue 11, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the second house is occupied by the person who is eating a banana, the person who likes white must be in the third house. So, the person who drives a minivan must be in the first house.

From clue 1, the cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person who drives a convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the first house. But we already know the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow. So, the cricketer must be in the second house.

From clue 6, the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white is in the third house, the swimmer must be in the second house. But we already know the second house is occupied by the person who is eating a banana. So, the swimmer must be in the first house.

From clue 7, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the second house is occupied by the person who is eating a banana, the person who is eating oranges must be in the fourth house. So, the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house.

From clue 3, the soccer player does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible, the soccer player must be in the first house. But we already know the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow. So, the soccer player must be in the third house.

From clue 12, the person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the third house is occupied by the person who likes white, the person who owns an SUV must be in the second house. So, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
- Second house: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.
- Third house: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
- Fourth house: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.

The basketball player must be in the remaining house, which is the second house.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in the second house. The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who likes blue lives.

1. **Green and Yellow**: The person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who likes yellow lives directly next to the person who likes green.
   - So, the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

2. **Stew and Grilled Cheese**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in the first house, and the romance book lover lives in the second house.

3. **Fantasy Book Enthusiast**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

4. **Grilled Cheese**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house and the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

5. **Romance Book Lover**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This confirms that the romance book lover lives in the second house, which is consistent with the previous information.

Now, we know:
- First house: Person who ate grilled cheese
- Second house: Person who had stew, romance book lover
- Third house: Person who likes green, fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

So, the person who likes blue lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

1. The person with carnations is in the first house.
2. The person who likes yellow is in the third house.
3. The bird keeper and the person with a vase of tulips are next to each other.
4. There's one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck.
5. The sedan is next to the fish enthusiast.
6. The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue are next to each other.
7. The person with a rose bouquet is next to the person who owns horses.
8. The cellist is not in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the first house has carnations. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From clue 1, the person with a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From clue 5, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the horses and the rose bouquet must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. This means the horses and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- First house: Carnations (person with carnations)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Second house: Vase of tulips and bird keeper
- Fourth house: Rose bouquet and person who likes blue (next to the person who owns horses)
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Second house: Percussionist or cellist
- Third house: Truck (next to the percussionist or cellist)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have two houses, and each house has a person living in it. We know the following:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. But from clue 2, we know the cellist also lives in house 1. This seems to be a contradiction because only one person can live in each house. So, let's assume the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1 and the cellist lives in house 2.

Now, clue 3 tells us that the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (who likes green) lives in house 1, the person who likes red must live in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast (likes green)
- House 2: Cellist (plays the cello), and the person who likes red

This means the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the mystery book reader lives is house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step by placing the people in the houses based on the clues.

1. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.

14. **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

- **Clue 14:** The golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza.

6. **Person wearing high heels and person eating grilled cheese** must be adjacent, with the high heels to the left.
7. **Science fiction book fanatic and person eating apples** must be adjacent.

From the constraints, we can deduce the following:
- **House 1:** Fantasy book enthusiast
- **House 2:** Person eating grilled cheese
- **House 3:** Person wearing high heels
- **House 4:** Tennis player (not in house 4)
- **House 5:** Person eating pizza

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the golfer lives in the second house.
2. The history book buff lives in the first house.
3. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

Now, the science fiction book fanatic can't be in the first or third house because there would be no house between them and the swimmer. So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.

This leaves the first house for the swimmer.

Therefore, the swimmer lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who had stew lives.

1. **Bird Keeper in House 3**: The bird keeper lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Bird Keeper

2. **Soccer Player and Banana Eater**: The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the soccer player.
   - House 1: Banana Eater
   - House 2: Soccer Player

3. **Fried Rice Eater**: The person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Fried Rice Eater

4. **History Book Buff and Spaghetti Eater**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.

   - House 2: Soccer Player
   - House 3: Bird Keeper
   - House 4: Fried Rice Eater
   - House 1: Spaghetti Eater

5. **Fantasy Book Enthusiast and Soccer Player**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - House 1: Spaghetti Eater
   - House 2: Soccer Player
   - House 3: Bird Keeper
   - House 4: Fried Rice Eater

   - House 4: Fried Rice Eater
   - House 1: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
   - House 2: Pizza Eater
   - House 3: History Book Buff
   - House 4: Baseball Player

From the above deductions, we can see that the person who had stew is not mentioned in any clue. However, since the person who had stew is not in any specific position, and we have filled all the other positions, the person who had stew must be in the remaining house, which is House 1.

So, the person who had stew lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues and see where the person who ate fried rice might be.

We have two houses, and each house has a person. We know the following:
- One person ate fried rice, and the other ate spaghetti.
- One person owns horses, and the other is a cat lover.
- One person likes history books, and the other likes romance books.
- One person is wearing sandals, and the other is wearing running shoes.

The clues are:
1. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

Let's think through the possible arrangements:

### Possible Arrangements:
1. **Person 1 (House 1) ate spaghetti, Person 2 (House 2) ate fried rice:**
   - Person 1 (House 1) owns horses (Clue 1).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is the history book buff (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is the cat lover (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is the romance book lover (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is wearing running shoes (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals (Clue 1).

2. **Person 2 (House 2) ate spaghetti, Person 1 (House 1) ate fried rice:**
   - Person 2 (House 2) owns horses (Clue 1).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is the history book buff (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is the cat lover (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is the romance book lover (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is wearing running shoes (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals (Clue 1).

In both scenarios, the person who ate fried rice is in House 2.

So, the number of the house where the person who ate fried rice lives is **2**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Each house has a person living in it, and each person has different flowers, musical instruments, and cars. Here are the clues:

1. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. The flutist does not live in the first house.

From Clue 1, we know the sedan owner must be in house 1 and the person with the lilies must be in house 2. From Clue 2, the flutist cannot be in house 1, so the flutist must be in house 2.

So, if the flutist is in house 2, the person with the lilies must also be in house 2. The person in house 1 must be the one who owns the sedan and plays the saxophone.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the romance book lover lives.

1. **Carnations in house 4**: This means the person with carnations is in house 4.
2. **Rose bouquet in house 3**: This means the person with a rose bouquet is in house 3.
3. **Fantasy book enthusiast in house 2**: This means the person who likes fantasy books is in house 2.
4. **Tennis player in house 5**: This is because the tennis player has to be to the right of the mystery book reader, and there's only one house between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, so the tennis player must be in house 5.
5. **Rose bouquet and carnations are one house apart**: This means the person with carnations is in house 4, and the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3.
6. **Fantasy book enthusiast and mystery book reader are two houses apart**: This means the mystery book reader is in house 1, and the romance book lover is in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the rose bouquet).

So, the only house left for the romance book lover is house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

1. **Coffee drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Coffee drinker.

2. **The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
   - Since the coffee drinker is in House 3, the computer and gameboy cannot be in House 3. So, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 4), (House 4, House 5).

3. **The saxophonist does not live in the second house.**
   - Possible houses for saxophonist: 1, 3, 4, 5.

4. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.**

5. **The person who has a gameboy does not live in the second house.**
   - Possible houses for gameboy: 1, 3, 4, 5.

6. **The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.**
   - If the computer is in House 4, the gameboy must be in House 3 (but the coffee drinker is in House 3). So, the computer must be in House 5 and the gameboy in House 4.

7. **The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.**
   - Computer in House 5, so cellist must be in House 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the percussionist.**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
   - Since the computer is in House 5, the percussionist must be in House 4 (but cellist is in House 4). So, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3 and the percussionist in House 5.

9. **The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.**
   - Possible houses for water drinker: 1, 2, 3, 5.

10. **The person who likes milk lives in the fifth house.**
    - House 5: Milk drinker.

11. **The person who has a television does not live in the fifth house.**
    - Possible houses for television: 1, 2, 3, 4.

12. **The person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

13. **The person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

14. **The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.**
    - Possible houses for water drinker: 1, 2, 3, 5.

15. **The person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

16. **The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).

### Final Deductions:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it. We know the following:

1. The person wearing boots lives next to the person driving a minivan.
2. The person who had pizza lives next to the person with a rose bouquet.
3. The person wearing running shoes doesn't live in the first house.
4. The cricketer lives next to the person with a vase of tulips.
5. The person who had pizza doesn't live in the second house.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives next to the person with a sedan.
7. The person driving a minivan lives in the third house.
8. The golfer lives in the first house.
9. The person with a rose bouquet doesn't live in the second house.

Let's figure out where each person lives:

- From clue 7, the person driving a minivan lives in house 3.
- From clue 8, the golfer lives in house 1.
- From clue 5, the person who had pizza doesn't live in house 2, so they must live in house 1 or 3. Since the golfer is in house 1, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.
- From clue 4, the cricketer lives next to the person with a vase of tulips. So, if the person with tulips is in house 2, the cricketer must be in house 1. But we already know the golfer is in house 1, so the cricketer must be in house 2.
- From clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese lives next to the person with a sedan. So, if the person with a sedan is in house 1, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2. But we already know the cricketer is in house 2, so the person with a sedan must be in house 3.
- From clue 2, the person who had pizza (in house 3) must be next to the person with a rose bouquet. So, the person with a rose bouquet must be in house 1.
- From clue 3, the person wearing running shoes doesn't live in house 1, so they must live in house 2.

So, the person with a rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the percussionist lives.

1. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
2. There are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who likes blue lives.

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who likes white lives.

1. Fried Rice is in house 3 (Clue 7).
2. White and Yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4 (Clue 8).
3. Stew cannot be in house 2 or 4 (Clue 2 and Clue 3).
4. Green cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1).
5. Blue must be to the left of Spaghetti (Clue 4).
6. Red is directly left of Stew (Clue 6).
7. Fried Rice is in house 3.

Now, let's see where Stew can be. Since Stew can't be in house 2 or 4, and Red is directly left of Stew, Stew can only be in house 1 or 5.

- If Stew is in house 1, Red is in house 2. But White and Yellow must be in houses 2 and 4, which is a contradiction.
- If Stew is in house 5, Red is in house 4. Now we have:
  - House 1: Green
  - House 2: White
  - House 3: Fried Rice
  - House 4: Yellow
  - House 5: Red

This fits all the clues:
- Green is not in house 2 (Clue 1).
- Stew is not in house 2 or 4 (Clue 2 and Clue 3).
- White is to the left of Spaghetti (Clue 4).
- Red is directly left of Stew (Clue 6).
- Fried Rice is in house 3 (Clue 7).
- White and Yellow are in houses 2 and 4 (Clue 8).

So, the person who likes white lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and we need to figure out where the basketball player lives. Here are the clues again:

1. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
2. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The percussionist lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the percussionist lives in house number 2. So, house 2 is taken by the percussionist.

From clue 2, the person who likes red lives in house number 3. So, house 3 is taken by the person who likes red.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow does not live in house number 2. Since house 2 is taken by the percussionist, the person who likes yellow must live in either house 1 or house 4.

From clue 3, the basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player. This means the tennis player cannot be in house 3 (because the person who likes red is there), and the basketball player cannot be in house 1 (because the tennis player can't be in house 3).

So, the only place left for the tennis player is house 1. This means the basketball player must be in house 4.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person with the carnations arrangement lives.

We have 5 houses, and each house has a different person with a different characteristic. Let's use the clues to narrow it down:

1. The person with a computer lives next to the root beer lover.
2. The cellist lives next to the person with a vase of tulips.
3. The root beer lover and the coffee drinker are next to each other.
4. There's one house between the person with a phone and the person with a television.
5. The person with daffodils is next to the cellist.
6. The percussionist is next to the person with a gameboy.
7. The person with carnations doesn't live in the third house.
8. There's one house between the cellist and the guitarist.
9. The cellist doesn't live in the fourth house.
10. The coffee drinker is next to the person who likes milk.
11. The guitarist is next to the person with a phone.
12. The root beer lover is next to the percussionist.
13. The root beer lover is next to the person with a bouquet of lilies.
14. There's one house between the person with daffodils and the coffee drinker.
15. The person with carnations doesn't live in the fifth house.
16. The tea drinker is next to the pianist.

Let's start by considering the possible positions for the person with carnations. They can't be in house 3, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 5.

Now, let's use the clues to narrow it down further:

- Clue 1 and 12 tell us that the root beer lover and the coffee drinker are next to each other, and the root beer lover is next to the percussionist. This means the root beer lover and coffee drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 or 4 and 5.
- Clue 10 tells us that the coffee drinker is next to the person who likes milk. This means the coffee drinker and the person who likes milk must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 or 4 and 5.
- Clue 13 tells us that the root beer lover is next to the person with a bouquet of lilies. This means the root beer lover and the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 or 4 and 5.
- Clue 14 tells us that the person with daffodils is next to the coffee drinker. This means the person with daffodils and the coffee drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 or 4 and 5.

So, the person with the carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The answer is (E) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who drives a minivan lives.

1. **Saxophonist and Science Fiction Book Fanatic**: They must be next to each other. Let's place them in houses 1 and 2.
2. **Carnations and Cellist**: They are two houses apart. Since the person with carnations can't be in house 5, let's place the person with carnations in house 3 and the cellist in house 5.
3. **Daffodils and Cat Lover**: The daffodils are one house apart from the person with horses, and the daffodils are to the left of the cat lover. So, let's place the daffodils in house 2 and the person with horses in house 3. The cat lover must be in house 4.
4. **Rose Bouquet and Science Fiction Book Fanatic**: The rose bouquet is to the left of the science fiction book fanatic, and the science fiction book fanatic is to the right of the saxophonist. So, let's place the rose bouquet in house 4 and the science fiction book fanatic in house 5.
5. **Lilies**: The lilies are not in house 5, and they are one house apart from the daffodils. So, let's place the lilies in house 1.
6. **Convertible and Bird Keeper**: The convertible is to the left of the history book buff, and the bird keeper is to the left of the sedan. So, let's place the convertible in house 2 and the bird keeper in house 3. The sedan must be in house 5.
7. **Fantasy Book Enthusiast and History Book Buff**: They are next to each other, and the history book buff is not in house 5. So, let's place the fantasy book enthusiast in house 3 and the history book buff in house 4.
8. **Romance Book Lover and Fish Enthusiast**: The romance book lover is to the right of the fish enthusiast, and the fish enthusiast is to the right of the romance book lover. So, let's place the romance book lover in house 5 and the fish enthusiast in house 4.
9. **Minivan**: The minivan is not in house 4, and it's not in house 5. So, the only place left for the minivan is house 1.

So, the person who drives a minivan lives in house 1. The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

1. The dog owner lives in the second house.
2. The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
3. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the fifth house.
5. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
6. The person who has a gameboy does not live in the second house.
7. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
8. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
9. There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives.
10. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.
11. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.

16. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
17. There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

Let's start by placing the dog owner in the second house.

### House 1: ?
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: ?
### House 5: ?

Since the fish enthusiast lives in the third house, we have:

### House 1: ?
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: ?
### House 5: ?

The person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the person who drives a truck, and there are two houses between the truck and the convertible. So, the truck must be in House 4 and the convertible in House 6 (since there are two houses between the truck and the convertible, and the convertible must be in the fifth house).

### House 1: ?
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

The person who has a gameboy must be to the left of the person who has a radio, and the gameboy is not in the second house. So, the gameboy must be in House 1 and the radio in House 2.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

The person who has a bouquet of lilies cannot be in the fifth house, so it must be in House 3.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper, so the bird keeper must be in House 1 and the gameboy in House 2.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Bird keeper
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses, and the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. The convertible is in House 5, so the vase of tulips must be in House 4.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Bird keeper
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: Convertible

The person who has a computer must be in House 2, and the person who has a gameboy must be in House 1.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Computer
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: Convertible

The person who has a television must be in House 3, and the person who owns an SUV must be in House 5.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Computer
### House 3: Television
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: SUV

So, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:

1. One person is a fish enthusiast, one is a dog owner, and one is a cat lover.
2. One person ate spaghetti, one had stew, and one had pizza.
3. One person plays basketball, one plays cricket, and one plays tennis.
4. One person plays the saxophone, one plays the guitar, and one plays the violin.
5. One person drinks tea, one drinks milk, and one only drinks water.

We also have some clues:
1. There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
2. The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
3. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
4. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. The basketball player lives in the first house.
6. The saxophonist lives in the first house.
7. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.

Let's use these clues to figure out where each person lives.

- The basketball player lives in the first house (house 1).
- The saxophonist also lives in the first house (house 1).
- So, the cricketer must be in the second house (house 2) because the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
- The fish enthusiast must be in the third house (house 3) because the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer, and the cat lover must be in the second house (house 2) because there is one house between the cat lover and the guitarist, and the guitarist must be in the third house (house 3).
- The person who only drinks water must be in the first house (house 1) because the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
- The person who had pizza must be in the second house (house 2) because the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
- The dog owner must be in the third house (house 3) because the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.

So, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the bouquet of lilies lives.

1. **History Book Buff in House 1:**
   - The person who likes history books lives in the first house (house 1). This means house 1 has a person who likes history books and a person who wears loafers.

2. **Cat Lover in House 2:**
   - The person who likes cats lives in the second house (house 2). This means house 2 has a person who likes cats and a person who likes romance books.

3. **High Heels and Daffodils:**
   - The person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person in house 1 likes history books and wears loafers, the person in house 2 must be the one with high heels. So, the person with high heels is in house 2, and the person with daffodils must be in house 1.

4. **Computer and Loafers:**
   - The person with a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person with loafers. Since the person in house 1 likes history books and wears loafers, the person in house 2 must be the one with a computer. So, the person with a computer is in house 2, and the person with loafers is in house 1.

From the above clues, we can conclude:
- House 1: History book buff (loafers)
- House 2: Cat lover (computer)

Since the person with high heels is in house 2 and the person with daffodils is in house 1, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1.

So, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the cellist lives.

1. The history book buff lives in the second house.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
4. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
5. The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
6. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
7. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
9. The flutist does not live in the first house.
10. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
12. The guitar lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
13. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.

Let's start by placing the known people:

- Second house: History book buff
- Fourth house: Fantasy book enthusiast

Now, let's place the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who ate fried rice. Since the bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and there is one house between the history book buff and the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement so far is:
1. Bouquet of daffodils
2. History book buff
3. Spaghetti
4. Fantasy book enthusiast

Next, let's place the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes yellow, and the person who likes white must be to the left of the bouquet of daffodils, the person who likes white must be in the first house, and the person who likes yellow must be in the second house.

So, the arrangement so far is:
1. White
2. Yellow
3. Spaghetti
4. Fantasy book enthusiast

Now, let's place the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who likes blue. Since the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who likes yellow, and the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist, the person who likes blue must be in the first house, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the second house.

So, the arrangement so far is:
1. White
2. Blue
3. Spaghetti
4. Fantasy book enthusiast

Now, let's place the person who had pizza and the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who had pizza must be in the first house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the fourth house.

So, the arrangement so far is:
1. Pizza
2. Blue
3. Spaghetti
4. Fantasy book enthusiast

Finally, let's place the flutist and the guitarist. Since the flutist does not live in the first house, the flutist must be in the second, third, or fourth house. Since the guitarist is directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the second house, the guitarist must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement so far is:
1. Flutist
2. Guitarist
3. Spaghetti
4. Fantasy book enthusiast

This leaves the cellist to live in the third house.

Therefore, the cellist lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the pianist lives.

1. The pianist and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.
2. The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person eating grapes lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
- Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

**Clue 4:** There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1.

**Clue 3:** There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person eating grapes must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the person eating grapes must be in house 1.

**Clue 2:** The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
- If the violinist is in house 1, the flutist must be in house 3.
- If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

### Combining Clues:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2:
  - Violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

### Correct Configuration:

- Person eating kiwis in house 2.
- Violinist in house 1.
- Flutist in house 3.
- Person eating grapes in house 1 (Clue 3).

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other (Clue 1).
- The flutist is to the right of the violinist (Clue 2).
- There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis (Clue 3).
- There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis (Clue 4).

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast doesn't live in the first house.
2. The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.

So, if the person eating kiwis is in the first house, that means the fantasy book enthusiast can't be in the first house. That leaves the second house for the fantasy book enthusiast.

Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. One person lives in each house, and they each have different musical instruments and drinks. The clues are:
1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

From clue 1, we know the root beer lover can only be in house 1 because they can't be in house 2.

From clue 2, the pianist and the cellist must be in adjacent houses, and the pianist must be to the left of the cellist. So, if the pianist is in house 1, the cellist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the root beer lover must be in house 1.

The number of the house where the root beer lover lives is 1.

So, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person with the bouquet of lilies lives.

We know:
1. The person with carnations is in the fifth house.
2. The person with sandals is not in the fifth house.
3. The person with boots and the person with carnations are next to each other.
4. The person with tulips is next to the person with loafers.

7. The person with sandals is not in the fourth house.
8. The person with tulips is not in the fourth house.
9. The person with tulips is one house away from the person with lilies.

Let's place the people based on these clues:

- The person with carnations is in the fifth house.
- The person with sandals is not in the fifth house, so they must be in the first, second, or third house.
- The person with boots is next to the person with carnations, so they must be in the fourth or third house.
- The person with sandals is not in the fourth house, so they must be in the first, second, or third house.
- The person with boots is next to the person with carnations, so they must be in the fourth house (since the fifth house is taken by carnations).
- The person with sandals is in the first house.
- The person with boots is in the fourth house.
- The person with sandals is in the first house.
- The person with tulips is next to the person with loafers and is to the right of the person with daffodils.
- The person with running shoes is next to the person with daffodils and is one house away from the person with lilies.

So, let's place the remaining people:
- The person with sandals is in the first house.
- The person with boots is in the fourth house.
- The person with carnations is in the fifth house.
- The person with tulips is in the third house (since it's to the right of the person with daffodils and next to the person with loafers).
- The person with daffodils is in the second house (since it's next to the person with running shoes and the person with tulips is in the third house).
- The person with running shoes is in the second house (since it's next to the person with daffodils and one house away from the person with lilies).
- The person with lilies is in the fourth house (since it's one house away from the person with running shoes).

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the pianist lives.

1. **Two houses between the blue and apples person:**
   - This means the blue person and the apples person are not next to each other.

2. **Baseball player in the second house:**
   - So, the baseball player lives in house 2.

3. **Water drinker to the right of the white person:**
   - This means the white person can't be in house 4, and the water drinker can't be in house 1.

4. **Swimmer to the left of the water drinker:**
   - This means the swimmer can't be in house 4, and the water drinker can't be in house 1.

5. **One house between grapes and tennis player:**
   - This means the grapes person and the tennis player are not next to each other.

6. **One house between percussionist and green:**
   - This means the percussionist and the green person are not next to each other.

7. **Saxophonist to the left of tennis player:**
   - This means the saxophonist can't be in house 4, and the tennis player can't be in house 1.

8. **One house between blue and oranges:**
   - This means the blue person and the oranges person are not next to each other.

9. **One house between white and tea drinker:**
   - This means the white person and the tea drinker are not next to each other.

10. **Swimmer and white next to each other:**
    - This means the swimmer and the white person are in adjacent houses.

11. **Coffee drinker to the right of the pianist:**
    - This means the pianist can't be in house 4, and the coffee drinker can't be in house 1.

12. **Blue to the left of tea drinker:**
    - This means the blue person can't be in house 4, and the tea drinker can't be in house 1.

Now, let's use these clues to figure out the positions:

- **Baseball player in house 2.**
- **Swimmer and white next to each other.**
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4).

- **Swimmer and white cannot be in house 1 or 4.**
  - Possible pairs: (2, 3) or (3, 4).

- **One house between grapes and tennis player:**
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

- **One house between percussionist and green:**
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

- **Saxophonist to the left of tennis player:**
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

- **One house between blue and oranges:**
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

- **One house between white and tea drinker:**
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

- **Blue to the left of tea drinker:**
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

### Combining Clues

- **Swimmer and white next to each other:**
  - Possible pairs: (2, 3) or (3, 4).

- **One house between blue and oranges:**
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

- **One house between white and tea drinker:**
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

- **Blue to the left of tea drinker:**
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4).

### Final Deduction

- If the white person is in house 2, then the tea drinker must be in house 3 (since they are one house apart).
- If the blue person is in house 1, then the oranges person must be in house 3 (since they are one house apart).

This leaves the following:
- House 1: Blue
- House 2: White
- House 3: Tea drinker, Oranges
- House 4: Green, Pianist, Coffee drinker, or Percussionist

Since the saxophonist is to the left of the tennis player, and the percussionist is to the left of the green person, the only possible positions for the saxophonist and the tennis player are:
- Saxophonist in house 1, Tennis player in house 2 (but this is already occupied by white).
- Saxophonist in house 2, Tennis player in house 3 (but this is already occupied by white).

Thus, the only possible positions are:
- Saxophonist in house 3, Tennis player in house 4.

This leaves the following:
- House 1: Blue
- House 2: White
- House 3: Saxophonist, Tea drinker, Oranges
- House 4: Green, Pianist, Coffee drinker, or Percussionist

Since the saxophonist is to the left of the tennis player, and the percussionist is to the left of the green person, the only possible positions are:
- Green in house 1, Pianist in house 2, Coffee drinker in house 3, Percussionist in house 4.

This leaves the pianist in house 2.

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

1. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
2. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
3. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
4. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. From clue 4, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots. From clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. From clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in the second house, so the person who had stew must live in the first or third house. Since the person who likes green lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house (since the person who had stew cannot live in the second house).

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who likes white must live in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew.

Now, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots. The person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the second house (Clue 3), so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. Since the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

From clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house. This contradicts clue 2, which states that the person who likes white lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first or second house. From clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the bouquet of lilies lives.

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other (clue 4), the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 1 or 3. But the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (clue 1), so the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

Now, the person with the rose bouquet is in house number 2, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house number 3. This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people.

From clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the science fiction book fanatic (SF) lives in house 1. So, house 1 has a romance book lover.
2. The coffee drinker (CD) must be in house 2 because the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals (SW). This means the CD can't be in house 1, and the SW can't be in house 1.
3. Since the CD is in house 2, the person in house 1 must be the water drinker and the romance book lover.

So, the romance book lover lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and two people living in them. We know the following:
- One person plays the piano, and the other plays percussion.
- One person has a radio, and the other has a phone.

We also know that the percussionist lives directly left of the person with the radio. This means the percussionist is in House 1 and the person with the radio is in House 2.

Now, we need to figure out who has the piano and who has the phone. Since the percussionist is in House 1, the pianist must be in House 2. That leaves House 1 for the person with the phone.

So, the person with the phone lives in House 1.

The correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who likes yellow lives.

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. So, the second house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 2, the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3. Since the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, the person who owns a sedan must be in house 3 and the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.

So, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where each person lives and what they own.

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Running shoes

2. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Sedan

3. The dog owner does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not dog owner

4. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
   - House 1: Running shoes
   - House 2: Sandals
   - House 3: Sedan
   - House 4: Bird keeper
   - House 5: High heels

5. There are two houses between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the bird keeper lives.
   - Running shoes (House 1)
   - Bird keeper (House 4)
   - Two houses between House 1 and House 4: Houses 2 and 3

6. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Bird keeper

7. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.
   - House 5: High heels
   - House 4: Bird keeper
   - House 3: Sedan
   - House 2: Sandals
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. The fish enthusiast does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Sedan

9. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - House 5: High heels
   - House 4: Bird keeper
   - House 3: Sedan
   - House 2: Sandals
   - House 1: Running shoes

10. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the fifth house.
    - House 5: High heels

11. The fish enthusiast does not live in the fifth house.
    - House 5: High heels

12. The dog owner does not live in the first house.
    - House 1: Running shoes

    - House 5: High heels
    - House 4: Bird keeper
    - House 3: Sedan
    - House 2: Sandals
    - House 1: Running shoes

From the clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Running shoes (loafers)
- House 2: Sandals (high heels)
- House 3: Sedan (high heels)
- House 4: Bird keeper (loafers)
- House 5: Minivan (loafers)

The person who owns horses lives in the fifth house.

So, the correct answer is (E) 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who drives a truck lives.

1. We know the convertible is in the first house, so House 1 is a convertible.
2. The person wearing loafers is in the second house, so House 2 is loafers.
3. The bird keeper is in the first house, so House 1 is a bird keeper.
4. The grapes and fish enthusiast are next to each other, and the fish enthusiast is in House 5 (since the truck is in House 5 and the sedan is in House 3, which is next to the SUV).
5. The sandals are in House 4, and the truck is in House 5.
6. The dog owner is two houses away from the person eating oranges, and the person eating oranges is in House 4.
7. The sedan is next to the SUV, and the sedan is in House 3.
8. The person wearing high heels is two houses away from the person with the bouquet of lilies, and the bouquet of lilies is in House 1.
9. The person with the rose bouquet is next to the person with the bouquet of lilies, so the rose bouquet is in House 2.
10. The person with the vase of tulips is next to the person wearing boots, and the boots are in House 4.
11. The person with the bouquet of daffodils is next to the person with the horses, and the horses are in House 3.
12. The person with the cat is next to the person with the sedan, and the sedan is in House 3.
13. The person with the cat is in House 5.

So, the person who drives a truck lives in House 5. The answer is (C) 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it. We know the following:
1. One person ate fried rice, one ate spaghetti, and one ate grilled cheese.
2. One person likes science fiction books, one likes fantasy books, and one likes mystery books.
3. The fried rice eater lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the fried rice eater lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Fried Rice
- House 3: ?

From clue 4, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. So, the arrangement is now:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: ?

From clue 2, the fried rice eater (in the second house) lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the fried rice person is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in a house to the left of the second house. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1:
- House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: ?

From clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the fried rice person is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 1:
- House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic, Spaghetti Eater
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: ?

Now, the only person left to place is the grilled cheese eater. Since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in House 1 (because the science fiction book fanatic is there) and cannot be in House 3 (because the grilled cheese eater cannot be to the right of the fried rice eater), the grilled cheese eater must be in House 3:
- House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic, Spaghetti Eater
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: Grilled Cheese Eater

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. One person lives in each house. We know two things:
1. There are two types of flowers: tulips and carnations.
2. There are two types of pets: dogs and horses.

We also know that the person with the carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. This means the person with the carnations (let's call them C) must be in house 1, and the dog owner (let's call them D) must be in house 2. 

So, the person with the carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing high heels lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.
   - If the person drinking water is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means if the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the person liking yellow must be in house 2.
   - If the person wearing sandals is in house 2, the person liking yellow must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - This means the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

Now, let's use these clues together:

- From Clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis is in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2).
- From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

So, we have:
- House 1: Person drinking water, Person wearing sandals
- House 2: Person eating kiwis, Person liking yellow

Since the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).

Therefore, the person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person eating kiwis lives.

1. **Clue 1**: The person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals.
   - This means the person wearing sandals can't be in house 2 (the right house), so they must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2**: The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the person eating grapes must also be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3**: The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
   - Since the person eating grapes is in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 1 (because the tea drinker can't be in house 2).
   - This means the person with the television must be in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Person eating grapes, tea drinker
- House 2: Person with the television, high heels, water drinker

Since the person eating kiwis must be in the remaining house, which is house 2, the answer is:

(A) 2"
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the guitarist lives.

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the tea drinker.
2. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist. This means the cellist can't be in the third house, and the person who only drinks water can't be in the first house.
3. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives. This means the violinist and the guitarist can't be in adjacent houses.
4. The violinist does not live in the third house.

Let's place the tea drinker in house 1:
- House 1: Tea drinker

Now, the cellist can't be in house 3, and the person who only drinks water can't be in house 1. So, the cellist must be in house 2, and the person who only drinks water must be in house 3:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Person who only drinks water

Now, the violinist can't be in house 3, and there must be one house between the violinist and the guitarist. So, the violinist must be in house 2 (but that's already taken by the cellist), and the guitarist must be in house 3:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Violinist

This leaves house 2 for the guitarist.

So, the guitarist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
   - So, the third house is occupied by someone wearing sandals.

2. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - This means the first house is occupied by someone else.

3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.

4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
   - So, the fifth house is occupied by the tea drinker.

5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.

6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person who only drinks water cannot be in the fifth house (where the tea drinker lives), and the person who is wearing boots cannot be in the first house.

7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
   - So, the third house is occupied by someone who likes milk.

Now, let's put it all together:
- Third house: Someone who likes milk (Clue 7)
- Third house: Someone wearing sandals (Clue 1)
- Fourth house: Someone who only drinks water (Clue 3)
- Fifth house: Someone who drinks tea (Clue 4)
- First house: Someone who is not wearing running shoes (Clue 2)
- Second house: Someone who is not the coffee drinker or the person who is wearing loafers (Clue 5)
- Fourth house: Someone who only drinks water (Clue 3)
- Fifth house: Someone who drinks tea (Clue 4)

From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person who is wearing boots
- Second house: Person who is wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person who likes milk (and wearing sandals)
- Fourth house: Person who only drinks water
- Fifth house: Person who drinks tea

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person who had pizza lives in house 4.
2. The person who has a computer does not live in house 4, so the computer must be in one of the other houses (1, 2, 3, or 5).
3. The person who has a radio does not live in house 4, so the radio must be in one of the other houses (1, 2, 3, or 5).
4. The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live next to each other.
5. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.

7. There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
8. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.

Let's start by placing the pizza in house 4:

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person eating a banana lives.

1. **Pianist and Horse Owner**: The pianist lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. **Apples and Kiwis**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
3. **Baseball Player and Fried Rice**: The baseball player and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
4. **Apples in Second House**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the second house.
5. **Fried Rice and Oranges**: The person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
6. **Dog Owner and First House**: The dog owner does not live in the first house.
7. **Bird Keeper in Second House**: The bird keeper lives in the second house.
8. **Horse and Grilled Cheese**: The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
9. **Stew and Banana**: The person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
10. **Saxophonist and Grilled Cheese**: The saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other.
11. **Tennis Player and Baseball Player**: The tennis player and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
12. **Basketball Player and Cat Lover**: The basketball player lives directly left of the cat lover.
13. **Saxophonist and Golfer**: There is one house between where the saxophonist lives and where the golfer lives.
14. **Mangos and Horse**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
15. **Tennis Player in First House**: The tennis player lives in the first house.
16. **Percussionist in Fourth House**: The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
17. **Pianist Not in Third House**: The pianist does not live in the third house.
18. **Apples and Golfer**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
19. **Pizza and Fifth House**: The person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 15, the tennis player lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the tennis player.

From clue 16, the percussionist lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the percussionist.

From clue 17, the pianist does not live in the third house. So, the pianist must live in either the first, second, or fifth house.

From clue 14, the saxophonist and the golfer are one house apart. Since the saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese are next to each other (clue 10), and the saxophonist cannot be in the first house (clue 15), the saxophonist must be in the second or third house. If the saxophonist is in the second house, the golfer must be in the third house. But the pianist cannot be in the third house (clue 17), so the saxophonist must be in the third house and the golfer in the fourth house. This leaves the pianist to be in the first house.

So, the first house is occupied by the pianist, the second house by the bird keeper, the third house by the saxophonist, the fourth house by the percussionist, and the fifth house by the golfer.

From clue 1, the pianist lives directly left of the person who owns horses. So, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house, but the fourth house is occupied by the percussionist. This means the person who owns horses must be in the fifth house.

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. The only possible positions for apples and kiwis are the second and third houses, but the second house is occupied by the bird keeper, so the person who is eating apples must be in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis must be in the second house.

From clue 3, the baseball player and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. The only possible positions for these are the first and second houses, but the first house is occupied by the tennis player, so the baseball player must be in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the first house.

From clue 4, the person who is eating apples does not live in the second house, but we already placed the bird keeper in the second house. This means the person who is eating apples must be in the third house, which we already have.

From clue 5, the person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other. The only possible positions for these are the first and second houses, but the first house is occupied by the tennis player, so the person who ate fried rice must be in the first house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the second house.

From clue 6, the dog owner does not live in the first house, so the dog owner must be in the second, third, or fifth house. But the second house is occupied by the bird keeper, the third house by the saxophonist, and the fifth house by the golfer. So, the dog owner must be in the third house, which is occupied by the saxophonist, which is a contradiction. This means the dog owner must be in the second house, but we already have the bird keeper in the second house. So, the dog owner must be in the fifth house.

From clue 7, the person who is eating a banana lives directly next to the person who had stew. The only possible positions for these are the first and second houses, but the first house is occupied by the tennis player, so the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house, and the person who had stew must be in the first house.

So, the person who is eating a banana must be in the fifth house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is **5**."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. One person lives in each house. We know the following:

- One person is a percussionist and plays a different musical instrument.
- One person ate grilled cheese for lunch.
- One person has a pet, either a dog or a bird.

We also have two clues:
1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know:
- The bird keeper and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in the same house.
- Since the bird keeper can't be in house 2, the bird keeper must be in house 1.
- Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.

From clue 2, we know:
- The percussionist cannot be in house 2.
- So, the percussionist must be in house 1.

This leaves the guitarist and the person who had pizza to be in house 1 and house 2, respectively.

Since the percussionist is in house 1, the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

So, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler approach:

1. The bird keeper lives in house number 3. This is given directly in the clues.
2. The cat lover can't be in house number 2.
3. The golfer is to the left of the person who drives a truck.
4. The person who drives a convertible can't be in house number 1.
5. The baseball player can't be in house number 3.
6. The person who drives a convertible can't be in house number 3.
7. The person who owns a sedan is to the right of the baseball player.
8. The soccer player is to the left of the bird keeper.
9. The fish enthusiast is to the left of the soccer player.

Given these clues, let's place the bird keeper in house number 3. Now we need to fit the rest of the clues around this.

- The convertible driver can't be in house number 1, so they can be in houses 2, 3, or 4.
- The baseball player can't be in house number 3, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
- The sedan owner must be to the right of the baseball player, so if the baseball player is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 2 or 4. If the baseball player is in house 2, the sedan owner must be in house 4. If the baseball player is in house 4, the sedan owner must be in house 2 or 3 (but house 3 is taken by the bird keeper).

Let's try placing the convertible driver in house 1:
- Convertible driver in house 1
- Baseball player in house 2 (since they cannot be in house 3)
- Sedan owner in house 4 (to the right of the baseball player)

This leaves house 3 for the bird keeper and house 4 for the sedan owner. The fish enthusiast must be in house 1 or 2, but house 1 is taken by the convertible driver. So the fish enthusiast must be in house 2.

This leaves house 4 for the sedan owner, house 2 for the fish enthusiast, and house 3 for the bird keeper.

So, the bird keeper lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Let's break down the clues and try to figure out where each person lives and what they like.

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
2. **Clue 2**: The percussionist does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3**: The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4**: The history book buff does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
6. **Clue 6**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
8. **Clue 8**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. **Clue 10**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.

From Clue 9 and Clue 10, we know the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist must be in the first and third houses, respectively, or the third and first houses, respectively. Let's assume the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first house and the flutist is in the third house.

Now, let's look at Clue 5 and Clue 8:
- Clue 5: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
- Clue 8: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

This means the person eating a banana and the person wearing running shoes must be in the first and second houses, respectively, or the second and first houses, respectively. Let's assume the person eating a banana is in the first house and the person wearing running shoes is in the second house.

Now, we have:
- First house: Person eating a banana
- Second house: Person wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person eating oranges

From Clue 7, the person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. So, the pianist must be in the first house, and the person eating oranges must be in the third house.

Now, we have:
- First house: Person eating a banana
- Second house: Person wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person eating oranges

From Clue 1, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house. So, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first or third house. Since the first house is taken by the person eating a banana, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the third house.

Now, we have:
- First house: Person eating a banana
- Second house: Person wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person eating oranges

From Clue 2, the percussionist does not live in the second house. So, the percussionist must be in the first or third house. Since the first house is taken by the person eating a banana, the percussionist must be in the third house.

Now, we have:
- First house: Person eating a banana
- Second house: Person wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person eating oranges

From Clue 3, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house. So, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first or third house. Since the first house is taken by the person eating a banana, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the third house.

Now, we have:
- First house: Person eating a banana
- Second house: Person wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person eating oranges

The only person left is the cat lover, who must be in the first house. This contradicts the person eating a banana being in the first house. So, let's re-evaluate the positions.

From Clue 1, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house. So, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first or third house. Since the first house is taken by the person eating a banana, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the third house.

Now, we have:
- First house: Person eating a banana
- Second house: Person wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person eating oranges

From Clue 2, the percussionist does not live in the second house. So, the percussionist must be in the first or third house. Since the first house is taken by the person eating a banana, the percussionist must be in the third house.

- First house: Person eating a banana
- Second house: Person wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person eating oranges

From Clue 3, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house. So, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first or third house. Since the first house is taken by the person eating a banana, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the third house.

Now, we have:
- First house: Person eating a banana
- Second house: Person wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person eating oranges

From Clue 4, the history book buff does not live in the second house. So, the history book buff must be in the first or third house. Since the first house is taken by the person eating a banana, the history book buff must be in the third house.

Now, we have:
- First house: Person eating a banana
- Second house: Person wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person eating oranges

From Clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana. So, the fish enthusiast must be in the second or third house. Since the second house is taken by the person wearing running shoes, the fish enthusiast must be in the third house.

Now, we have:
- First house: Person eating a banana
- Second house: Person wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person eating oranges

From Clue 6, the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast. So, the flutist must be in the third house.

Now, we have:

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person eating kiwis lives.

1. We know the person eating grapes is in house 2.
2. The person who likes red and the person who likes green live next to each other. Since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes green must be in house 1 and the person who likes red must be in house 3.
3. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who eats a banana lives. This means they must be in houses 1 and 3 or houses 2 and 4. But since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1 and the person who eats a banana must be in house 3.
4. The person who likes green is to the left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who likes yellow must be in house 4.
5. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives. This confirms that the person who likes white is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3.
6. The person who eats a banana is in house 3, and the person who likes white is in house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: White
- House 2: Grapes
- House 3: Red
- House 4: Kiwis

Therefore, the person who eats kiwis lives in house 4. The correct answer is (A) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Each house has a person living in it, and each person has different things. Here are the clues:

1. One person had stew for lunch, and the other had fried rice.
2. One person has horses as a pet, and the other has a cat.
3. One person is eating oranges, and the other is eating apples.
4. One person reads mystery books, and the other reads science fiction.
5. One person is wearing running shoes, and the other is wearing sandals.

And we have these clues:
1. The person wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person eating oranges.
2. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
3. The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.

Let's start by placing the person eating oranges. Since the person eating oranges must be in house 1 (because the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2, and the person eating oranges can't be in house 2), the person eating oranges is in house 1.

So, house 1: Person eating oranges.
House 2: Person wearing running shoes.

Now, the person who had stew must be next to the mystery book reader, and the mystery book reader must be next to the cat lover. Since the person eating oranges is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in house 2 (because the person wearing running shoes is in house 2, and they must be next to the person who had stew).

So, house 2: Person who had stew.
House 1: Person eating fried rice (since the person eating oranges is in house 1).

This leaves house 3 for the cat lover and the person who ate fried rice. Since the mystery book reader and the person who had stew are next to each other, and the mystery book reader is in house 1, the person who had stew is in house 2, and the person who ate fried rice is in house 3.

So, house 3: Cat lover and person who ate fried rice.

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who likes root beer lives.

1. **Clue 3** tells us the root beer lover lives in house 1.
2. **Clue 2** says the person who only drinks water lives in house 2.
3. **Clue 4** says the person who has a television does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3.
4. **Clue 5** says the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover is in house 1. So, house 1 is taken by the root beer lover.

From Clue 2, the person who only drinks water is in house 2. So, house 2 is taken by the person who only drinks water.

Now, the person who has a television cannot be in house 2 (Clue 4), so they must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who has a television (in house 3) must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since house 3 is taken by the person who has a television, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2. But we already know the person who only drinks water is in house 2, so this is a contradiction. This means the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 1, but we already know the root beer lover is in house 1. So, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3.

Therefore, the person who likes root beer lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the computer lives.

1. The person wearing loafers lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by someone wearing loafers.
2. The person with a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos. This means the phone can be in house 1 or 2, but not in house 3.
3. The person eating grapes lives directly left of the person drinking water. This means grapes and water must be in adjacent houses.
4. The person wearing boots does not live in the third house.
5. The person eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk. This means kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses.
6. The person wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person with a gameboy.
7. The person eating kiwis does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the person wearing loafers in house 1. So, house 1 is occupied by someone wearing loafers.

Now, let's place the phone. Since the phone must be to the left of the person eating mangos, the phone can be in house 1 or 2. But if the phone is in house 2, the mangos must be in house 3. So, the phone is in house 1 and the mangos are in house 3.

Next, let's place the person eating grapes. Since grapes and water must be in adjacent houses, and the phone is in house 1, the grapes must be in house 2 and the water in house 3.

Now, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2 or 3. Since kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses, and the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the milk must be in house 3.

Finally, the person wearing boots must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person with a gameboy, and the person with a gameboy must be in house 1, the person wearing boots must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Wearing loafers
- House 2: Phone, Kiwis, Gameboy
- House 3: Mangos, Milk, Boots

The person with the computer must be in house 2 because the phone is there and the phone is not the one with the computer.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in **House 2**.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Golfer does not live in the third house.**
   - So, the golfer can live in house 1 or house 2.

2. **Fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means if the fish enthusiast is in house 1, the person who owns horses must be in house 2 or 3.
   - If the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the person who owns horses must be in house 3.

3. **Golfer and baseball player live next to each other.**
   - This means they must be in adjacent houses.

4. **Carnations arrangement and person who owns horses live next to each other.**
   - This means they must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.**
   - This means the carnations arrangement and baseball player must be in adjacent houses, and the carnations arrangement must be to the left of the baseball player.

6. **Rose bouquet and bouquet of daffodils live next to each other.**
   - This means they must be in adjacent houses.

7. **Cricketer does not live in the third house.**
   - So, the cricketer can live in house 1 or house 2.

Let's try to fit these clues together:

- If the golfer is in house 1, the baseball player must be in house 2 (since they live next to each other).
- The fish enthusiast must be in house 1 (since the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses).
- The person who owns horses must be in house 2 (since the fish enthusiast is in house 1 and the person who owns horses must be to the right of the fish enthusiast).
- This contradicts the fact that the golfer and the baseball player are in adjacent houses (golfer in house 1, baseball player in house 2).

So, the golfer must be in house 2, and the baseball player must be in house 1.

- The fish enthusiast must be in house 1 (since the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses).
- The person who owns horses must be in house 3 (since the fish enthusiast is in house 1 and the person who owns horses must be to the right of the fish enthusiast).

Now, let's check the remaining clues:
- The person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who owns horses live next to each other, so the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (since the person who owns horses is in house 3).
- The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player, so the carnations arrangement must be in house 1 (since the baseball player is in house 2).

This is a contradiction. Let's try another arrangement:

- If the golfer is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 1 (since they live next to each other).
- The fish enthusiast must be in house 1 (since the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses).
- The person who owns horses must be in house 3 (since the fish enthusiast is in house 1 and the person who owns horses must be to the right of the fish enthusiast).

Now, let's check the remaining clues:
- The person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who owns horses live next to each other, so the carnations arrangement must be in house 1 (since the person who owns horses is in house 3).
- The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player, so the carnations arrangement must be in house 1 (since the baseball player is in house 2).

This is consistent. So, the person who owns horses must be in house 3.

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who drives a truck lives.

1. The person eating oranges lives in the first house. So, house 1 is occupied by the person eating oranges.
2. The person driving a truck lives next to the person driving a convertible. This means they are in adjacent houses.
3. The bird keeper lives to the right of the dog owner.
4. The person eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person owning horses lives in the third house.
6. The person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible live next to each other.

From clue 5, we know the person owning horses lives in house 3. So, house 3 is occupied by the person owning horses.

From clue 1, the person eating oranges lives in house 1. So, house 1 is occupied by the person eating oranges.

From clue 6, the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible live next to each other. Since house 1 is taken by the person eating oranges, the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in houses 2 and 3. But house 3 is taken by the person owning horses, so the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in houses 2 and 1. Since house 1 is taken, house 2 must be the one with the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible.

So, house 2 is occupied by the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible. This leaves house 3 for the person owning horses.

Now, we need to place the bird keeper and the dog owner. From clue 3, the bird keeper lives to the right of the dog owner. The only house left for the bird keeper and the dog owner is house 1 and house 2. Since house 1 is taken by the person eating oranges, house 2 must be the one with the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible, and house 1 must be the one with the bird keeper and the dog owner.

So, house 1 is occupied by the bird keeper and the dog owner. This leaves house 2 for the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible.

Therefore, the person who drives a truck must live in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the percussionist lives.

1. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew. This means if the percussionist is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in house 2. If the percussionist is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 3, and so on.

2. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader must be somewhere to the left of the percussionist.

3. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in a house to the left of the percussionist.

4. There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives. This means the saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, and the person who had pizza must be in the second or fourth house.

5. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader.

6. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist. This means the flutist must be in a house to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

7. The guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. This means the guitarist and the percussionist must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist.

8. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader and the grilled cheese eater must be in adjacent houses, and the grilled cheese eater must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

9. There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the history book buff must be in the house directly to the right or left of the mystery book reader.

10. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house. This means the person who ate spaghetti must be in one of the first, second, fourth, or fifth houses.

Let's start by placing the mystery book reader and the saxophonist:
- The saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, so he must be in the second or fourth house.
- The mystery book reader must be directly left of the saxophonist, so the saxophonist must be in the second house and the mystery book reader must be in the first house.

Now, let's place the percussionist:
- The percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the percussionist must be in the third or fourth house.
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist, so the guitarist must be in the first or second house.

Given the saxophonist is in the second house, the mystery book reader is in the first house, and the guitarist is to the left of the percussionist, the only possible positions for the percussionist are the third or fourth house. Let's check the third house:
- If the percussionist is in the third house, the guitarist must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the percussionist must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the science fiction book fanatic:
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the first house because the mystery book reader is there.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the second house.

Now, let's place the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist:
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be to the left of the flutist, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first or second house, but the first house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic.
- Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

Now, let's place the history book buff:
- The history book buff must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader, so the history book buff must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the history book buff must be in the third house, and the flutist must be in the fourth house.

Finally, let's place the person who ate spaghetti:
- The person who ate spaghetti cannot be in the third house, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first, second, fourth, or fifth house.
- The person who ate spaghetti must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth or fifth house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

So, the percussionist lives in the fourth house.

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the saxophonist lives.

1. The person who has a radio lives in house 3.
2. The percussionist and the guitarist live next to each other.
3. The cellist does not live in house 5.
4. There is one house between where the guitarist lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
5. There are two houses between where the percussionist lives and where the violinist lives.
6. The person who has a phone lives to the right of the person who has a gameboy.

11. The person who has a computer does not live in house 2.
12. The person who has a computer lives to the left of the person who has a phone.

From clue 7, we know house 3 has a radio and the person who likes green lives there. So, house 3 is occupied by the person who likes green.

From clue 1, the person who has a radio lives in house 3, which is already confirmed.

From clue 8, the percussionist and the guitarist are next to each other. Since the person who likes green is in house 3, the percussionist and guitarist must be in houses 2 and 4.

From clue 4, there is one house between the guitarist and the person who likes yellow. So, if the guitarist is in house 2, the person who likes yellow must be in house 4. If the guitarist is in house 4, the person who likes yellow must be in house 2. But since the percussionist and guitarist are next to each other, the guitarist cannot be in house 2. So, the guitarist is in house 2 and the person who likes yellow is in house 4.

From clue 9, the person who likes red does not live in house 2. So, the person who likes red must live in house 4.

From clue 10, the person who has a computer lives to the left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who likes red is in house 4, the person who has a computer must be in house 3 (but house 3 has a radio), so the person who has a computer must be in house 1 and the person who has a phone must be in house 2.

From clue 11, the person who has a computer lives to the left of the person who has a phone. This confirms that house 1 has a computer and house 2 has a phone.

From clue 5, there are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist. Since the percussionist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 5.

So, the houses are as follows:
- House 1: Computer
- House 2: Phone
- House 3: Radio
- House 4: Person who likes red
- House 5: Violinist

The saxophonist must be in the remaining house, which is house 1.

Therefore, the saxophonist lives in house 1.

The answer is (D) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who owns horses lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
   - The root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, but since the history book buff is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 2, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2 in that order.

So, we have:
- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

Since the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, and the guitarist must be next to the root beer lover, the guitarist must be in house 1 and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in house 1.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

1. **Clue 1**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
   - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
   - If the bird keeper is in house 3, there's no house to the right of house 3, so this scenario is not possible.

2. **Clue 2**: The dog owner does not live in the second house.
   - This means the dog owner can only live in house 1 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 3 if the dog owner lives in house 1.
   - If the dog owner lives in house 3, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 3.

Now, let's consider the possible placements:

- If the dog owner is in house 1:
  - The bird keeper can't be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3 (Clue 1).
  - The dog owner is in house 1.
  - The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3 (Clue 3).

- If the dog owner is in house 3:
  - The bird keeper can't be in house 3 (Clue 1), so the bird keeper must be in house 1 or house 2.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (Clue 1).
  - The dog owner is in house 3.
  - The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2 (Clue 3).

From the above analysis, the only consistent scenario is when the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper is in house 2, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is **3**.

So, the correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing loafers lives.

1. **Swimmer lives in the 4th house.**
   - House 4: Swimmer

2. **Banana lives in the 3rd house.**
   - House 3: Banana

3. **Basketball player lives in the 1st house.**
   - House 1: Basketball player

4. **Rose bouquet lives directly left of the person eating a banana.**
   - House 2: Rose bouquet
   - House 3: Banana
   - House 1: Basketball player

5. **Phone lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals.**
   - House 1: Basketball player
   - House 2: Computer
   - House 3: Banana
   - House 4: Rose bouquet

6. **Banana lives in the 3rd house.**
   - House 3: Banana

7. **Banana lives in the 3rd house.**
   - House 3: Banana

8. **Banana lives in the 3rd house.**
   - House 3: Banana

9. **Banana lives in the 3rd house.**
   - House 3: Banana

10. **Banana lives in the 3rd house.**
    - House 3: Banana

11. **Banana lives in the 3rd house.**
    - House 3: Banana

12. **Banana lives in the 3rd house.**
    - House 3: Banana

From the clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Banana
- House 4: Rose bouquet

The person wearing sandals must be in House 1 because the basketball player is in House 1 and the person wearing sandals cannot be in House 2 (Clue 5).

So, the person wearing sandals lives in House 1.

The person wearing loafers cannot be in House 2 (Clue 5) or House 1 (sandals), and they cannot be in House 4 (swimmer).

Therefore, the person wearing loafers must live in House 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the bird keeper lives.

1. The person eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - So, the first house has mangos.

2. The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - So, the first house is not for horses.

3. The bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2, and vice versa.

4. The person eating a banana does not live in the third house.
   - So, the third house is not for bananas.

5. The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - So, the second house is not for horses.

6. The person eating a banana lives directly next to the dog owner.
   - This means if the person eating a banana is in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2, and vice versa.

From clue 6, the person eating a banana must be in house 1 because the dog owner cannot be in house 1 (since the person eating a banana lives directly next to the dog owner). So, the person eating a banana is in house 1 and the dog owner is in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Eating mangos, not bananas, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, not bananas, dog owner.
- House 3: Not bananas.
- House 4: Not horses.

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in adjacent houses. Since the person eating mangos is in house 1, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

From clue 4, the person eating a banana is in house 1, so the person eating kiwis must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating mangos, not bananas, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, not bananas, dog owner.
- House 3: Not bananas, eating kiwis.
- House 4: Not horses.

The bird keeper must be in house 4.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 4. The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the mystery book reader lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Mystery book reader

2. The bird keeper and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses, and the romance book lover can't be in the third house.
   - So, the history book buff and the bird keeper must be in houses 2 and 3.

3. The person who owns horses can't be in the third house, so the bird keeper must be in the third house.

4. This means the history book buff must be in the second house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Bird keeper

Since the bird keeper lives in the third house, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(B) 2**."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house. This is a direct clue, so we know the coffee drinker is in house 2.
2. The person eating apples lives next to the person drinking water, and the apple eater is to the left of the water drinker.
3. The person eating mangos doesn't live in the first house, so they can be in houses 2, 3, or 4.
4. The person eating mangos doesn't live in the third house, so they can be in houses 1 or 4.
5. The person eating apples is to the left of the tea drinker.
6. The person eating kiwis doesn't live in the third house, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Let's try to fit these clues together:

- If the mangos eater is in house 1, then the kiwi eater must be in house 4 (since they can't be in house 3).
- The apple eater and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the apple eater is to the left of the water drinker, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Mangos eater
  - House 2: Coffee drinker (Clue 1)
  - House 3: Apple eater
  - House 4: Water drinker

This arrangement fits all the clues:
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The apple eater is to the left of the water drinker.
- The mangos eater is in house 1.
- The kiwi eater is in house 4.
- The water drinker is in house 4.

So, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is house 2. The correct answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person eating a banana lives.

1. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
4. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
5. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The cricketer does not live in the fifth house.
7. The soccer player lives in the third house.

10. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives.
11. The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
12. The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the soccer player lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person who is eating a banana.

From clue 9, the person who likes white lives in the second house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house too. This means the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other, and since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house.

From clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, and the baseball player must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer cannot live in the fifth house, and the golfer must be to the left of the cricketer, the golfer must live in the first house, and the cricketer must live in the fourth house.

From clue 2, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives (second house) and where the person who likes blue lives (fourth house). This is consistent.

From clue 1, the person who likes white (second house) lives directly left of the person who likes red (fourth house). Since the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house, the person who likes red must live in the first house.

From clue 3, the person who likes white (second house) lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player (fourth house). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the person who likes white (second house) lives and where the person who is eating apples (fourth house). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From clue 6, the cricketer (fourth house) does not live in the fifth house, which is consistent.

From clue 9, the person who is eating kiwis (second house) and the person who is eating a banana (third house) live directly next to each other, which is consistent.

So, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person with the carnations arrangement lives.

We have three houses, and we need to place the people based on the clues given:

1. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
3. The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
4. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
5. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
6. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
8. The soccer player lives in the second house.

Let's start with the clues:

- **Clue 8:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
  - So, the second house is occupied by the soccer player.

- **Clue 5:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
  - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the person with stew cannot be in the third house.

- **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
  - This means the person with high heels cannot be in the third house, and the person with stew cannot be in the first house.

- **Clue 6:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
  - This means the person with rose bouquet cannot be in the third house, and the person with spaghetti cannot be in the first house.

- **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
  - So, the mystery book reader can be in the first or third house.

- **Clue 3:** The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
  - This means the golfer cannot be in the first house, and the person with rose bouquet cannot be in the third house.

- **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
  - This means the golfer cannot be in the first or third house, and the person with daffodils cannot be in the first or second house.

- **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
  - This means the person with running shoes cannot be in the first house, and the person with stew cannot be in the third house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The second house is occupied by the soccer player.
- The first house can be the history book buff or the mystery book reader.
- The third house can be the person with stew, the person with spaghetti, or the person with running shoes.

Since the person with stew must be to the left of the history book buff, and the person with stew cannot be in the first house, the first house must be the history book buff.

So, the first house is the history book buff, the second house is the soccer player, and the third house must be the person with stew.

The person with running shoes must be in the first house, but we already have the history book buff in the first house. So, the person with running shoes must be in the third house.

This leaves the person with the carnations arrangement in the first house.

Therefore, the person with the carnations arrangement lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the percussionist lives.

1. The person with a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Let's start by considering the possible positions for the minivan and truck.

### Case 1: Minivan in House 2, Truck in House 1
- Clue 6 tells us the flutist is directly left of the person who drives a minivan. So, the flutist must be in house 1.
- Clue 5 tells us the minivan is to the right of the truck. So, the truck is in house 1 and the minivan is in house 2.
- Clue 3 tells us the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. So, the cellist must be in house 3.
- Clue 4 tells us the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the flutist is in house 1, the person with the television must be in house 2 and the person with high heels must be in house 1.
- Clue 7 tells us the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 2 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

This case doesn't work because the person with high heels and the person with the television can't both be in houses 1 and 2.

### Case 2: Minivan in House 3, Truck in House 1
- Clue 6 tells us the flutist is directly left of the person who drives a minivan. So, the flutist must be in house 2.
- Clue 5 tells us the minivan is to the right of the truck. So, the truck is in house 1 and the minivan is in house 3.
- Clue 3 tells us the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. So, the cellist must be in house 2.
- Clue 4 tells us the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 2, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 3. Since the flutist is in house 2, the person with the television must be in house 3 and the person with high heels must be in house 1.
- Clue 7 tells us the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 3 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

This case works. The percussionist lives in house 1.

So, the correct answer is (C) 1."

2. **Clue 9**: The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 13**: The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person with a television.
   - So, the person with a television lives in the third house (house 3).
4. **Clue 10**: The person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist.
   - The pianist cannot be in house 1 or 2 because the bouquet of daffodils is in house 2 and the bouquet of lilies must be in house 1.
   - So, the pianist lives in house 4.
   - The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.
5. **Clue 11**: The violinist and the person eating oranges live directly next to each other.
6. **Clue 12**: The person eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist.

   - The person eating oranges lives in house 4.
   - The violinist lives in house 3.
7. **Clue 8**: The person with a phone lives directly left of the person with a radio.
   - The person with a radio lives in house 2.
   - The person with a phone lives in house 1.
8. **Clue 2**: The person eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - The violinist lives in house 3.
   - The person eating mangos lives in house 4 or 5.
   - Since the person eating oranges is in house 4, the person eating mangos must be in house 5.
9. **Clue 7**: The person with a gameboy and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
   - The person with a gameboy lives in house 3.
   - The guitarist lives in house 4.

Now we have:
- House 1: Person with a bouquet of lilies
- House 2: Person with a radio
- House 3: Person with a gameboy
- House 4: Person eating oranges

   - So, the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the SUV lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the root beer lover).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the minivan driver cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the minivan driver).

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we know:
- The SUV driver is in the first house.
- The root beer lover is not in the third house.
- The truck driver is to the right of the root beer lover.
- The minivan driver is not in the third house.

Since the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet, and the first house is occupied by the person with the SUV, the third house must be occupied by the coffee drinker.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who drives a truck lives.

1. **Blue and Spaghetti**: The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.

5. **Red and First House**: The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. **Minivan and Daffodils**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 5, we know the person who likes red does not live in the first house, so they must live in either house 2 or house 3.

From clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. So, if the minivan person is in house 1, the daffodils person must be in house 2, and vice versa.

From clue 4, the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. So, if the minivan person is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in house 2, and if the minivan person is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 1.

From clue 3, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. So, if the person who has a rose bouquet is in house 2, the person who drives a truck must be in house 3.

From clue 1, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

So, the configuration is:
- House 1: Person who likes blue (rose bouquet)
- House 2: Person who has a rose bouquet (blue)
- House 3: Person who likes red (truck)

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."

From clue 6, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. From clue 8, the basketball player lives in the fourth house. From clue 9, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. From clue 15, the person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house, so the sedan owner must live in either the first, third, or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the sedan owner must live in either the first or third house.

From clue 13, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. From clue 12, the person who likes green does not live in the third house. From clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. From clue 10, the cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. From clue 7, the flutist lives in the third house. Therefore, the cellist must live in the second house (since the flutist lives in the third house and they must be next to each other).

Now, let's summarize the known information:
- Second house: Flutist
- Third house: Cellist
- Fourth house: Person who owns an SUV (and also the person who likes white)

Since the sedan owner cannot be in the second house (clue 15) and the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the sedan owner must be in the first house.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes

4. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - This is already confirmed as House 3 (grapes) and House 2 (red).

5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in Houses 1 and 3 or Houses 2 and 4. Since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 2.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - The person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2 (since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes), and the person who has a phone must be in House 1.

From clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the guitarist is in house 1, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 (guitarist), and the dog owner must be in house 2 (bird keeper).

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti (house 4) must be to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese (house 1). Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4.

From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese (house 1) must be to the left of the guitarist (house 1), which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the placement.

Given the constraints, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who owns horses

So, the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (C) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person eating mangos lives.

1. The tea drinker and the person eating grapes live next to each other.
2. The saxophonist and the golfer live next to each other.
3. The baseball player and the person eating grapes live next to each other.
4. The saxophonist lives in the first house.
5. The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other.

From clue 4, we know the saxophonist lives in house 1. So, house 1 has the saxophonist.

From clue 1, the tea drinker and the person eating grapes are next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the tea drinker and the person eating grapes must be in houses 1 and 2.

From clue 3, the baseball player and the person eating grapes are next to each other. Since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 1. But we already know the saxophonist is in house 1, so this doesn't work. Let's recheck the clues.

From clue 2, the saxophonist and the golfer are next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the golfer must be in house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Saxophonist
- House 2: Golfer, Person eating grapes

From clue 1, the tea drinker and the person eating grapes are next to each other. Since the golfer is in house 2, the tea drinker must be in house 1. But we already know the saxophonist is in house 1, so the tea drinker must be in house 2. This means the person eating grapes is in house 2.

From clue 5, the romance book lover and the golfer are next to each other. Since the golfer is in house 2, the romance book lover must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Romance book lover, Tea drinker
- House 2: Golfer, Person eating grapes

Since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the person eating mangos must be in house 1.

Therefore, the person eating mangos lives in house 1.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{1}\)."

16. The baseball player lives directly left of the tennis player (Clue 6).
17. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house (Clue 11).

From Clue 1, the person who drives a truck does not live in the second house. From Clue 2, the person who drives a minivan does not live in the third house. From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck. From Clue 4, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover. From Clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. From Clue 6, the baseball player lives directly left of the tennis player. From Clue 7, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player. From Clue 8, the person who drives a minivan and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. From Clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover. From Clue 10, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. From Clue 11, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house. From Clue 12, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house. From Clue 13, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. From Clue 14, the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house. From Clue 15, the soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player.

Given all these clues, let's place the people step by step:

1. The first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.
2. The second house is occupied by the person who has a vase of tulips.
3. The third house is occupied by the person who drives a minivan or the person who drives a convertible.
4. The fourth house is occupied by the person who has a rose bouquet.

Since the person who has a rose bouquet must live to the right of the person who owns a sedan (Clue 10), and the person who owns a sedan must be to the left of the person who drives a truck (Clue 3), the person who owns a sedan must be in the second house, and the person who drives a truck must be in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, the second house is occupied by the person who has a vase of tulips, the third house is occupied by the person who drives a truck, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a rose bouquet.

Since the person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house (Clue 11), and the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the fourth house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first, second, or third house. But since the second house is occupied by the person who has a vase of tulips, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first or third house.

Since the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the fourth house, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player (Clue 7), the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the third or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a rose bouquet, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, the second house is occupied by the person who has a vase of tulips, the third house is occupied by the person who has a bouquet of lilies, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a rose bouquet.

Since the person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house (Clue 11), and the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the fourth house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first or third house. But since the third house is occupied by the person who has a bouquet of lilies, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

Let's use these clues to figure out who likes what and where they live.

From Clue 3, if the person who likes yellow lives next to the person who drives a truck, and from Clue 1, the person eating grapes lives next to the person who drives a truck, we can deduce that the person who likes yellow and the person who eats grapes must be next to each other. This means the person who likes yellow and the person who eats grapes must be in the same house, and the person who drives a truck must be in the other house.

From Clue 2, the person wearing boots lives next to the person who likes mystery books. This means the person who likes mystery books and the person who wears boots must be in the same house, and the person who likes fantasy books must be in the other house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- If the person who likes yellow is in House 1, then the person who drives a truck must be in House 2.
- The person who likes yellow (House 1) and the person who eats grapes (House 1) must be next to each other.
- The person who likes mystery books (House 2) and the person who wears boots (House 2) must be next to each other.
- The person who likes fantasy books must be in the remaining house, which is House 1.

So, the person who likes fantasy books lives in House 1.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the violinist lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Violinist

2. From Clue 1, the cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer can't be in House 3 because the cellist would then be in House 3, which would make the cellist to the left of the cricketer. So, the cricketer must be in House 1, and the cellist must be in House 3.

   - House 1: Cricketer
   - House 2: Violinist
   - House 3: Cellist

3. From Clue 2, the basketball player lives in the second house. But we already know the violinist is in the second house. So, the basketball player must be in House 1 or House 3. Since the cricketer is in House 1 and the cellist is in House 3, the basketball player must be in House 1.

   - House 1: Basketball player
   - House 2: Violinist

"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, one numbered 1 and the other 2. The pianist lives in the second house (Clue 2). The person with the daffodils and the pianist live next to each other (Clue 1). Since the pianist lives in house 2, the only house next to it is house 1. So, the person with the daffodils must live in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives is 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have 5 houses, and each house has a different person living in it. Each person has a different kind of fruit, car, and flowers. We need to figure out which house the person with the sedan lives in based on the clues.

1. The person with tulips is to the left of the person with the convertible.
2. The person with oranges lives in the first house.
3. The person with apples lives next to the person with daffodils.
4. The person with bananas lives in the fourth house.

7. The person with daffodils is next to the person with the minivan.
8. The person with grapes does not live in the fifth house.
9. The person with an SUV lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, we know the person with bananas lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person with bananas.

From clue 2, the person with oranges lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person with oranges.

From clue 9, the person with an SUV lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person with an SUV.

From clue 4, the person with bananas lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person with bananas.

From clue 3, the person with apples lives next to the person with daffodils. This means they are neighbors and the person with apples is to the left of the person with daffodils.

From clue 7, the person with daffodils lives next to the person with the minivan. This means they are neighbors and the person with daffodils is to the left of the person with the minivan.

From clue 1, the person with tulips lives next to the person with the convertible. This means they are neighbors and the person with tulips is to the left of the person with the convertible.

From clue 5, the person with a sedan lives next to the person with carnations. This means they are neighbors and the person with carnations is to the left of the person with a sedan.

From clue 6, there is one house between the person with carnations and the person with lilies. This means they are neighbors and the person with carnations is one house to the left of the person with lilies.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- First house: Person with oranges
- Fourth house: Person with bananas
- Fifth house: Person with grapes (since the person with grapes does not live in the fifth house)
- Third house: Person with daffodils (since the person with daffodils lives next to the person with the minivan)
- Second house: Person with tulips (since the person with tulips lives next to the person with the convertible)
- Fifth house: Person with grapes (since the person with grapes does not live in the fifth house)
- Sixth house: Person with carnations (since the person with carnations is one house to the left of the person with lilies)
- Fourth house: Person with an SUV

Now, we need to place the remaining person (the person with apples) and the person with the minivan. The only house left is the second house, and the only person left is the person with apples. The person with the minivan must be in the sixth house.

So, the arrangement is:
1. Person with oranges
2. Person with apples
3. Person with daffodils
4. Person with bananas
5. Person with grapes
6. Person with the minivan

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must live in the second house.

2. The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
4. The soccer player lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the soccer player lives in house 2. So, house 2 is occupied by the soccer player.

From clue 1, the person who likes blue must be in house 1 because the root beer lover is to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. So, house 1 is occupied by the person who likes blue.

From clue 2, the romance book lover cannot be in house 1, so the romance book lover must be in house 2. But we already know house 2 is occupied by the soccer player. So, the romance book lover must be in house 1.

Now we have:
- House 1: Person who likes blue
- House 2: Romance book lover

This leaves house 2 for the root beer lover, and house 1 for the person who ate grilled cheese.

From clue 8, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2. So, house 2 is occupied by daffodils.

From clue 9, the person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live next to each other. Since house 2 is taken, the only possible pair for house 1 and 2 is (1, 2).

From clue 1, the soccer player does not live in house 4. From clue 4, the soccer player does not live in house 1. So, the soccer player must live in house 3 or 5.

From clue 2, the cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player. If the soccer player is in house 3, the cricketer must be in house 4 or 5. If the soccer player is in house 5, the cricketer must be in house 4.

From clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. If the swimmer is in house 3, the person with the lilies must be in house 4 or 5. If the swimmer is in house 4, the person with the lilies must be in house 5.

From clue 10, the person who likes white does not live in house 2. So, the person who likes white must be in house 1 or 5.

From clue 11, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2 (but house 2 is taken by daffodils), so the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 or 5. Since the person who likes yellow is in house 1, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 5.

So, the person who likes white must be in house 5.

From clue 12, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white is in house 5, the person who has a rose bouquet must be in house 6 (but house 6 is not there), so the person who has a rose bouquet must be in house 4.

So, the person who likes white is in house 5, the person who has a vase of tulips is in house 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in house 4, the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who likes yellow is in house 1, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in house 2, the person who has a carnations arrangement is in house 5, the person who has a rose bouquet is in house 4, and the person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player are in house 1 and 5.

From clue 1, the person with boots lives in house 2. From clue 3, the person with boots lives somewhere to the left of the person with grilled cheese. So, the person with grilled cheese must be in house 3 or 4. Since the person with pizza is in house 4, the person with grilled cheese must be in house 3.

From clue 10, the science fiction book fanatic does not live in house 5. From clue 11, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 5.

Since the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 5, the person with carnations arrangement must be in house 2 or 3. But house 3 is already taken by the person with the television. So, the person with carnations arrangement must be in house 2.

From clue 16, the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. Since the person with boots is in house 2, the person with running shoes must be in house 3, and the person with the computer must be in house 4.

- House 2: Tulips, Person who likes blue, Person who eats oranges
- House 3: Tea drinker

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader (MR) lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the MR.

From clue 1, the MR lives directly left of the history book buff (HBB). This means the HBB must be in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: MR (mystery book reader)
- House 2: HBB (history book buff)

Now, clue 4 tells us that the MR lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV). Since the MR is in the first house, the TV must be in the second house. But we already know the HBB is in the second house, so this clue is a bit confusing. Let's re-evaluate.

From clue 3, the person who has a computer (C) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone (P). Since the MR is in the first house, the phone must be in the first house, and the computer must be in the second or third house. But since the HBB is in the second house, the computer must be in the third house.

So, we have:
- House 1: MR (mystery book reader)
- House 2: HBB (history book buff)

Growing seedless cucumbers might not be good for a gardener with entomophobia. Here’s why:

1. **Insects**: Seedless cucumbers need pollinators, like bees, to grow. If you have a fear of insects, this could be a problem.
2. **Manual Pollination**: Some people try to pollinate seedless cucumbers by hand. While this might help, it still involves dealing with insects, which could be scary.

So, if you have entomophobia, it might be better to grow regular cucumbers. They don’t need pollinators, so you wouldn’t have to worry about insects.

If we assume ""slam dance"" refers to a more energetic dance, it might be more likely to cause injuries.

So, if we have to choose between ""waltz"" and ""slam dance"" in terms of injury, I would say:

(A) No

This means that waltz is not less injurious than slam dance."

- The pressure is too high, making it hard to breathe.
- The atmosphere is made of sulfuric acid clouds, which are not friendly to humans or snow.

So, the answer is:

(B) Yes"

This feeling can be very appealing and might make someone want to use the drug again. However, it's not just drugs that can cause euphoria. Things like listening to music or exercising can also make you feel good. In drug addiction, people might use drugs to try to get that feeling of euphoria, even if it means doing something that's not good for them."
"Given the information we have, it's hard to say for sure if Apollo could defeat D'Artagnan. Apollo is a god from Greek mythology, known for his wisdom and power, but not necessarily for physical combat. D'Artagnan, on the other hand, is a trained musketeer from a novel, known for his bravery and swordsmanship.

Since we don't have specific details about Apollo's abilities in a physical battle, and D'Artagnan is described as a skilled fighter, it seems more likely that D'Artagnan could defeat Apollo. Therefore, the answer is:

(A) No"
"The correct answer is (B) Yes.

Sunscreen is meant to protect your skin from harmful UV rays that can cause sunburn and increase the risk of skin cancer. However, it's important to understand that sunscreen doesn't treat skin cancer. Bob Marley died from melanoma, which is a type of skin cancer.

So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"No, week-old chlorine-treated water is not safe to drink. Chlorine is used to kill germs, but it doesn't last long in water. Over time, the chlorine levels decrease, and the water might get contaminated again. It's best to use fresh water or treat it with new chlorine before drinking."
"No, a dichromat would probably not easily distinguish chlorine gas from neon gas. Chlorine gas is greenish-yellow, and neon gas is red-orange. A dichromat has trouble distinguishing between green and red, so they would have difficulty telling these two colors apart."

The Jackson 5 had five members: Michael, Jermaine, Tito, Marlon, and Jackie. They were very famous and had many hit songs like ""I Want You Back"" and ""ABC.""

The Isley Brothers had four members: O'Kelly, Ronald, Ernie, and Rudolph. They were also famous, but not as many people know them as much as the Jackson 5.

So, the Jackson 5 had one more member than the Isley Brothers. That means the Jackson 5 was bigger in terms of the number of members.

"No, Alice from ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" is a fictional character, so she can't join a Masonic Lodge. Masonic Lodges are for real people who meet certain requirements."
"To answer this question, we need to think about how both bull shark bites and crocodile bites can hurt. Bull sharks are known for their aggressive behavior and can be found in coastal and river areas. Their bites can be quite severe because of their powerful jaws. Crocodiles, while also powerful, are generally more selective about their prey and are less likely to attack humans unless provoked. 

Both can cause significant pain and injury, but the severity can depend on the size of the animal and the individual's response to the bite. 

So, to directly answer the question:

A strong password needs to be complex and hard to guess. Binary numbers and the standard alphabet only use a limited set of characters. For example, if you use only binary numbers (0 and 1) or only the standard alphabet (A-Z and a-z), it's easy for someone to guess or use a dictionary attack to break the password.

So, to make a password strong, we need to include numbers, letters, and special characters. Binary numbers and the standard alphabet alone can't do that.

"To figure out if a 500GB USB device is enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day, we need to think about how much space Netflix takes up.

Netflix shows are usually pretty big. If we imagine that one hour of Netflix takes up about 2.5GB of space, then 10 hours would take up:
\[ 10 \text{ hours} \times 2.5 \text{ GB/hour} = 25 \text{ GB} \]

Now, a 500GB USB device has a lot of space. It's enough to store 500GB of data. Since 25GB is just a small part of 500GB, a 500GB USB device is more than enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day.

(A) No"
"To answer this question, we need to think about the size and weight of the Voyager 2 spacecraft and compare it to Jon Brower Minnoch.

Voyager 2 was a very large spacecraft, weighing about 795 kilograms (1,753 pounds). On the other hand, Jon Brower Minnoch was extremely underweight, weighing only about 10 pounds at the time of his death in 1983.

(A) Yes"
"Sure, let me explain this in a simpler way.

In Texas, it's not unusual to see frost in September. Even though Texas is known for its warm weather, the temperature can drop quite a bit, especially if there's a cold front moving through. So, frost can happen in September, even though it's still pretty warm. It's more common in the fall and winter, but September can still have some cooler days. So, seeing frost in September isn't strange at all. 

The answer is: (A) No"
"Sure, let's think about this.

Mickey Mouse is a character, and characters can buy things. So, if we imagine a scenario where Mickey Mouse hypothetically makes a purchase, it's not impossible. Mickey Mouse merchandise is sold on places like Zazzle, so it's possible for Mickey Mouse to hypothetically buy something from there.

"Sure, let me explain this in a simpler way.

During Pope John Paul I's time, which was very short (only about 3 weeks), traveling around the world would be very difficult. In those days, people traveled mostly by ship, and it took a long time to go around the world. The journey in the book ""Around the World in Eighty Days"" would take much longer than 80 days because of the slow travel methods available back then. Plus, the technology for air travel wasn't as advanced, so it would be even harder to complete such a journey in such a short time. So, the answer is:

(B) Yes"
"No, the Spice Girls could not compete against ŽRK Kumanovo. The Spice Girls are a music group, and ŽRK Kumanovo is a football club. They are different types of teams, so they can't compete against each other."
"To answer this question, let's think about how we get vitamin A from carrots.

When we eat cooked carrots, our bodies can use the vitamin A more easily. This is because cooking helps break down the carrots, making the vitamin A more available to our bodies. 

However, raw carrots are still good for getting vitamin A. The vitamin A in carrots is in a form called beta-carotene, which our bodies can turn into vitamin A. But when the carrots are cooked, more of this beta-carotene is released, so our bodies can get more vitamin A from them.

So, while cooked carrots might be better for getting vitamin A, raw carrots are still a good source. 

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) No"
"Sure, let me explain this in a simpler way.

In most places, you don't need to finish eleventh grade to get a driver's license. The age you can start getting a license depends on the state.

"Sure, let's break it down simply:

A student in eleventh grade would not be able to run for president of the United States. The reason is that the Constitution of the United States requires a person to be at least 35 years old to be elected as President. Since a 17-year-old is not yet 35, they can't run for president.

So, the answer is:
(A) No"

"To answer this question, we need to think about the size and contents of both libraries.

The Library of Alexandria was a very large library that contained many scrolls, but we don't know exactly how many or how much space they took up. It existed a long time ago, from about 300 BC to 500 AD.

The Library of Congress, on the other hand, is a modern library that was started in 1800. It has a huge collection of books, manuscripts, and other materials. It's located in Washington, D.C., and is one of the largest libraries in the world.

Given that the Library of Alexandria is much older and had fewer items compared to the Library of Congress, it's very unlikely that the Library of Alexandria would need less shelf space than the Library of Congress.

So, the answer is:

(A) No"
"Sure, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Paratroopers are trained to do a lot of cool stuff, like jumping out of planes and moving quickly to help people.

Quiet from Metal Gear, despite her background in stealth and combat, could still be a good choice for a lecturer at Haub College of Environmental Science. While her military and espionage skills might not be directly applicable to environmental science, her strategic thinking, problem-solving abilities, and calm under pressure could be valuable in teaching courses related to environmental policy, sustainability, or even in interdisciplinary fields that require critical thinking and strategic planning. So, even though her background might seem unusual for an environmental science lecturer, her skills could still make her a good fit for certain roles."
"Sure, let's think about this:

Watermelons are grown in places where it's warm enough for them to grow. Brazil is a country with warm climates, so they can grow watermelons there. Antarctica, on the other hand, is a very cold place covered in ice and snow. It's too cold for watermelons to grow there.

So, more watermelons are grown in Brazil than in Antarctica. 

The answer is:

"No, a silverfish couldn't reach the top of the Empire State Building. Silverfish are small insects that can climb vertical surfaces, but they are just too small and light to move that high up. The Empire State Building is very tall, and even if a silverfish could climb, it would take much more than one day for it to reach the top."
"No, someone could not theoretically use an armadillo as a shield. Here’s why:

- An armadillo’s shell is small and lightweight, which isn’t enough to protect a human from most attacks.
- Armadillos can’t move quickly or change their position easily, making them hard to use as a shield.
- The shell might get damaged or broken, leaving the person unprotected.
- The shell isn’t very versatile; it’s not good for different types of attacks or situations.

So, while the shell is strong, it’s not practical or effective as a shield for a human."
"Sure, let's think about this.

Wool can be washed in the washing machine, but it's better to hand wash it. Here’s why:

1. **Machine Washing**: You can put wool in the washing machine, but use a gentle cycle and a special detergent for wool. Don’t use fabric softener, as it can hurt the wool.

2. **Hand Washing**: If you want to be extra careful, you can hand wash the wool. Fill a basin with water and use a gentle detergent. Gently move the wool around in the water and then rinse it well.

3. **Drying**: Wool should be air-dried or put in a low heat setting in the dryer. Don’t put it in direct sunlight, as it can make the colors fade and the wool might shrink.

4. **Ironing**: You can iron wool, but use a low heat setting and a cloth to protect the wool from getting scorched.

So, while you can machine wash wool, it’s not necessary. You can choose to hand wash it if you want to be extra careful."
"To answer this question, we need to compare the number of Imams Reza Shah believed in with the number of Jesus's disciples.

Reza Shah, the first monarch of Iran, was a Shia Muslim. Shia Islam believes in a succession of 12 Imams. So, Reza Shah believed in 12 Imams.

Jesus's disciples were 12 apostles as mentioned in the New Testament of the Bible. So, Jesus had 12 disciples.

So, the answer is:
(B) No"
"To answer this question, we need to compare the number of people who pass through 30th Street Station every day with the capacity of Dorton Arena.

First, let's think about how many people pass through 30th Street Station. It's a big station in Philadelphia, and on a busy day, lots of people use it. If we imagine a busy weekday, about 100,000 to 150,000 people might pass through the station. On weekends, this number can be even higher, maybe up to 200,000 to 250,000 people.

Now, let's look at Dorton Arena. It's a big indoor sports arena, but it can only hold about 10,000 people at a time.

So, if we take the highest number of people passing through the station (250,000 on a weekend) and compare it to the arena's capacity (10,000), we can see that 250,000 is much bigger than 10,000.

However, the number of smoggy days can vary from year to year. Some years might have more smoggy days, and some might have fewer.

Without specific data for the current year or a recent year, we can't say for sure if Düsseldorf has only a small number of smoggy days each year. The city has been working on improving its air quality, so the number of smoggy days might be decreasing.

So, based on this information, the answer is:

"To answer this question, we need to think about the differences between Japanese and English serfdom.

In England, serfs were bound to the land and had limited rights. They worked on the lord's land in exchange for protection and basic necessities. They were considered lower in status compared to the nobility.

In Japan, the feudal system was different. The samurai class, who were warriors, were not necessarily tied to the land in the same way as serfs in England. They had a more complex relationship with the land and the nobility, but they were not serfs in the traditional sense.

So, if we compare the status of serfs in England to the samurai in Japan, the samurai would have a higher status than serfs. However, the question asks if Japanese serfdom had a higher status than English serfdom, which it didn't.

Therefore, the answer is:

(A) No"
