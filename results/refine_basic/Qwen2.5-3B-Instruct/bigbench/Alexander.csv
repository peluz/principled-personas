"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
9. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
11. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
12. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.

From Clue 3, we know the person in the third house is wearing high heels. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person in the third house is wearing high heels, the third house is house number 3.

Now, let's use Clue 11 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the root beer lover and the person who is eating mangos. Since the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating mangos lives next to the person who had pizza, we can infer the following:

- The root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.
- The person who is eating mangos must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be next to each other.

Given that the person in house 3 is wearing high heels, the person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who is eating mangos lives to the right of the coffee drinker, and the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 3 and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Next, we use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Finally, we use Clue 6 and Clue 7 to determine the positions of the person who drives a truck and the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, the person who drives a truck must be in house 1 and the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 2: Person who owns an SUV
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

From this arrangement, we can see that the tea drinker must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **(C) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
   - This directly tells us the grilled cheese eater lives in house number 5.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who had pizza lives in one of the houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the root beer lover and the person who had stew are neighbors, with the root beer lover being to the left of the person who had stew.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in house number 5.

5. **Clue 5:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who ate spaghetti are neighbors, with the coffee drinker being to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in house number 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are neighbors.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 5: Grilled cheese eater, person who only drinks water
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 1: Person who had pizza (not in the first house)
- House 2: Person who had stew and the person who likes milk (must be neighbors)
- House 4: Person who only drinks water (not in the fifth house)

Since the person who only drinks water lives in house 5, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk must be in houses 1 and 2. Given that the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are neighbors, they must be in houses 1 and 2.

Let's place the people:
- House 1: Person who had stew
- House 2: Person who likes milk

This leaves house 4 for the person who only drinks water, which is consistent with Clue 4.

Now, we need to place the root beer lover and the person who drinks coffee:
- The root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2, but since the person who had stew is in house 1, the root beer lover must be in house 2.
- The coffee drinker must be in house 1 or 4, but house 4 is taken by the person who only drinks water, so the coffee drinker must be in house 1.

This leaves house 4 for the person who only drinks water, which is consistent with Clue 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who had stew
- House 2: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Person who only drinks water (already placed)

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5.

The answer is (A) 5."
"The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's deduce the positions step by step:

1. The violinist lives in House 1.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 1.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.
4. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
5. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
6. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.
7. The person who has a radio lives one house away from the history book buff.
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.

From these, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Violinist (since the violinist lives in the first house)
- House 3: Fried rice eater (since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house)
- House 2: Vase of tulips and phone (since the vase of tulips and phone live next to each other)
- House 3: History book buff (since the history book buff lives to the right of the person with the vase of tulips, and the only remaining house for the history book buff is House 3)
- House 2: Vase of tulips and phone
- House 1: Violinist
- House 3: Fried rice eater
- House 4: Radio (since the radio lives one house away from the history book buff, and the only remaining house is House 4)

Therefore, the person with a vase of tulips lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Given the clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the person wearing boots lives in house 2. From Clue 1, the person driving a convertible must live in house 1 because the convertible driver is directly left of the history book buff. Therefore, the person driving a truck must live in house 2.

This leaves the person in house 1 as the mystery book reader and the person in house 2 as the history book buff. Since the person wearing boots lives in house 2, the person wearing boots is not the mystery book reader, so the person wearing boots must be the history book buff. Consequently, the person wearing sandals must be the mystery book reader, and they live in house 1.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. **Clue 4**: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. **Clue 1**: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover must live in House 2, and the swimmer lives in House 1 (but we already know the golfer lives in House 1, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the swimmer must live in House 2, and the romance book lover must live in House 3.

   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 3: Mystery book reader (since the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff)
   - House 4: History book buff

4. **Clue 2**: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

5. **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This is consistent with our previous findings.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
The correct option is (B) 3.
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the person who likes yellow:
- Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2, they must be in either house 1 or house 3.

### Case 1: The person who likes yellow is in house 1.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 1, then the person who likes green must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a gameboy must be in house 3 (since they are neighbors with the person who likes green).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Therefore, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1.

### Case 2: The person who likes yellow is in house 3.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 3, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person who likes green (in house 1) is directly left of the person who has a gameboy (in house 2).
- The person who has a gameboy (in house 2) is directly left of the person who has a computer (in house 2).
- The person who likes yellow (in house 3) is not in the second house.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement:

1. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house (reaffirmed).
6. **Clue 6:** The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house (reaffirmed).
8. **Clue 8:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, the root beer lover lives in the third house. This means the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From Clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses. Since the root beer lover is in the third house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. However, the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, so the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the first and second houses.

From Clue 4, the romance book lover does not live in the first house. Therefore, the romance book lover must live in the second house, and the history book buff must live in the first house.

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house, which is already occupied by the root beer lover. This means the red drinker must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the romance book lover, the tea drinker must live in the first house.

From Clue 2, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. The green drinker cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 2), so the green drinker must be in the first house, but the first house is occupied by the romance book lover. Therefore, the green drinker must be in the second house, and the coffee drinker must be in the fourth house.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house numbers:

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
   - This means if the person with the radio is in house 1, the person who likes green must be in house 2.
   - If the person with the radio is in house 2, the person who likes green must be in house 1.

2. **The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.**
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.

3. **The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the fish enthusiast must live in house 2.

4. **The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who had pizza must live in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The fish enthusiast lives in house 2.

From Clue 4, we know:
- The person who had pizza lives in house 2.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
  - Since the person who likes green lives in house 2 (from Clue 3), the person who has a radio must live in house 1 (since house 1 is directly left of house 2).

So, we have:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, person who likes green, and person who had pizza.
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, person who has a radio, and person who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who had pizza (in house 2) and the person who likes green (in house 2) are already determined, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person who has a radio (in house 1) must have a phone (since the radio is the only other device).
- The person who ate spaghetti (in house 2) must have a radio (since the radio is already taken by the person in house 1).
- The person who is a cat lover must be in house 1 (since the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

Therefore, the person who is a cat lover lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the cat lover lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Based on the given clues and the deductions made, the person who only drinks water lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"The person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"The person who had stew lives in house 4. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues and the logical deductions, the correct house where the fish enthusiast lives is house 5. However, since the options provided are (A) 2, (B) 3, (C) 1, (D) 4, and house 5 is not an option, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or a typo in the options. 

Based on the provided options, none directly match the logical deduction. But if we were to choose the closest logical fit from the given options, the cat lover lives in house 1, and the daffodils owner lives in house 2, which leaves houses 3 and 4 for the remaining pets. 

Given the constraints and the options, the most plausible answer from the provided choices would be:

(C) 1"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their house numbers step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 has a phone.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 does not wear boots.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person with horses lives in house 1 and the person with a radio lives in house 2, or vice versa.

From Clue 1, we know the person in house 1 has a phone. From Clue 2, the person in house 2 does not wear boots. From Clue 3, the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other.

Since the person in house 1 has a phone, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels.

Now, let's determine the pets and devices:
- House 1: Owns horses or has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots and has a phone.

Since the person in house 1 cannot have a phone (because the person in house 1 has a phone), the person in house 1 must own horses. The person in house 2 must have a radio.

So, the characteristics are:
- House 1: Owns horses, wears high heels, has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots, has a phone.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."

From Clue 5"
"The bird keeper lives in House 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 1."
"The soccer player lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The cat lover lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
7. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives.
8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who had fried rice must live in the second house.

From Clue 2, the cat lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza must live next to each other. Since the cat lover is in the third house, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza must be in the first and second houses. Given that the person who ate grilled cheese is in the first house, the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

From Clue 10, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who had fried rice is in the second house, the person who had stew must be in the fourth or fifth house, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house.

From Clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the third house, the bird keeper must be in the first or second house. Since the person who had pizza is in the second house, the bird keeper must be in the first house.

From Clue 7, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the bird keeper is in the first house, the person who has a television must be in the fourth or fifth house. Given that the person who had pizza is in the second house, the person who has a television must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 9, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the third house, the person who had stew must be in the fourth or fifth house. Since the person who has a television is in the fourth house, the person who had stew must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person with a phone
- Second house: Person with pizza
- Third house: Cat lover
- Fourth house: Person with a television
- Fifth house: Person with a radio

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Pianist does not live in the first house.**
2. **Person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwis.**
3. **Pianist and person wearing high heels live directly next to each other.**
4. **Person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
5. **Person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.**
6. **Person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.**
7. **Person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.**

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Next, we need to place the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis next to each other, and the person eating kiwis must be to the left of the person wearing boots.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, we need to place the person wearing high heels and the person with a radio next to each other, and the person eating oranges must be directly left of the person with a television.

- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Finally, we need to place the person with a television directly left of the person with a radio.

- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Thus, the person with a television lives in house 8.

The correct answer is (A) 8."
"Given the clues and the logical deductions, the person who owns a sedan lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

3. This leaves the second house for the person eating mangos.
4. The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house (Clue 3) and does not live in the third house (Clue 1), so they must live in the second house.
5. This leaves the first house for the person who owns an SUV.

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 5."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
6. **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing running shoes in the second house (Clue 7).

- House 2: Running shoes

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Milk drinker

Now, the person who is wearing running shoes (House 2) and the person who likes milk (House 3) are placed. We need to place the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice next to each other (Clue 1).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining houses are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who drives a convertible and the person who only drinks water next to each other (Clue 8).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Since the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), we can place them as follows:

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining house is 2, and it must be the person who drives a convertible, and the house to the left of it must be the person who only drinks water.

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, we need to place the person who is wearing high heels and the person who owns an SUV (Clue 3 and Clue 5).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3), so the only remaining house for the high heels wearer is House 1.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Sedan owner

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 10:** The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.
   - Tea drinker in house 4.

2. **Clue 3:** The saxophonist lives in the second house.
   - Saxophonist in house 2.

3. **Clue 8:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.
   - Since the saxophonist is in house 2, the pizza eater must be in house 3 or 4. But since the tea drinker is in house 4, the pizza eater must be in house 3.

4. **Clue 7:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the cellist and the person who ate fried rice must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - This means the person who only drinks water and the person who is wearing loafers must be in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 5:** The cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker.
   - Since the tea drinker is in house 4, the cellist must be in house 3.

7. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - Since the pizza eater is in house 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1.

8. **Clue 4:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - Since the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in house 2 or 3. But since the saxophonist is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

9. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the person who likes milk must be in a house to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.

10. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
    - Since the person who is wearing sandals is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 2. This means the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 3.

11. **Clue 7:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
    - Since the cellist is in house 3, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 4.

From the above analysis, we can conclude that the cellist lives in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the cellist lives is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
6. **Clue 6:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
7. **Clue 7:** The swimmer does not live in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 9, we know the minivan driver lives in house 4. From Clue 10, the root beer lover lives in house 3. 

From Clue 8, the basketball player lives directly left of the truck driver, so the truck driver must be in house 2 and the basketball player in house 1.

From Clue 3, the swimmer lives directly left of the sedan owner. Since the swimmer is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the truck driver. This means the sedan owner must be in house 3, and the swimmer in house 1.

From Clue 2, the daffodils and lilies must be in adjacent houses. Since the root beer lover is in house 3 and the lilies must be next to the daffodils, the daffodils must be in house 2 and the lilies in house 3.

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker and the tennis player must be in houses that are not adjacent. Since the root beer lover is in house 3 and the lilies are in house 3, the coffee drinker and the tennis player must be in houses 1 and 4. Since the truck driver is in house 2 and the sedan owner is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the tennis player in house 1.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 3) lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player (house 1). This is consistent.

From Clue 6, the tennis player (house 1) lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker must be in house 4, this is consistent.

From Clue 7, the swimmer (house 1) does not live in the first house, which is consistent with house 1 being the truck driver.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who drives a truck lives is **(A) 1**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - Tea drinker in house 1.

2. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.

3. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.

4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3, or 1 and 2.

5. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Let's combine these clues:

- From Clue 1, the tea drinker is in house 1.
- From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, the person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.
- From Clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3, or 1 and 2.
- From Clue 5, the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Let's test the possible positions:

- If the person eating oranges is in house 1 (Clue 5), then the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating apples must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person eating apples is in house 2, the person driving a convertible must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person driving a minivan is in house 3, and the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person driving a convertible is in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means if the person who likes red is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
   - If the person who likes red is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either house 2 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house 2.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

Now, we know:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

Since the person who likes white cannot live in house 3 (Clue 3), the person who likes white must live in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

This leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The answer is (A) 3."
"The person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 3."
"The root beer lover lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"The science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 4"
"The person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house (number 2). Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The violinist lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct option is (A) 2."
"The person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 5."
"The person who has a computer lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic and the golfer cannot be in the same house, and the golfer must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - This means the pizza-eater and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - This means the guitarist and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

### Possible Arrangements:
Let's denote the houses as House 1 and House 2, and the people as Person 1 (in House 1) and Person 2 (in House 2).

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1 Analysis:**
   - The science fiction book fanatic (SFF) and the golfer (Golfer) must be in different houses, and Golfer must be to the right of SFF.
   - Possible positions: Golfer in House 2, SFF in House 1.

2. **Clue 2 Analysis:**
   - The pizza-eater (PE) and the history book buff (HBB) must be in adjacent houses.
   - Possible positions: PE in House 1, HBB in House 2 or PE in House 2, HBB in House 1.

3. **Clue 3 Analysis:**
   - The guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D.
   - Possible positions: G in House 2, D in House 1 or G in House 1, D in House 2.

### Combining Clues:
- From Clue 1, Golfer is in House 2 and SFF is in House 1.
- From Clue 2, PE and HBB must be in adjacent houses. Since Golfer is in House 2, PE and HBB must be in House 1 and House 2.
- From Clue 3, G and D must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D. Since Golfer is in House 2, G and D must be in House 1 and House 2.

Given these constraints, let's try to fit the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff), G (golfer), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)

Since the golfer is in House 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2, this arrangement is not possible because the golfer cannot be in House 2 if the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2.

Therefore, the only feasible arrangement is:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff)

Given this arrangement, the percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1 because the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) are in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. The person with a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person eating apples.
2. The person with a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
4. The basketball player does not live in the first house.

From Clue 3, we know the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1. Let's denote the houses as follows:
- House 1: Lilies
- House 2: Unknown (person eating apples, violinist, or basketball player)

From Clue 4, the basketball player cannot live in house 1. Therefore, the basketball player must live in house 2.

Now, considering Clue 1 and Clue 2 together, the person with the radio must live to the right of the person eating apples and also to the right of the violinist. This means the person eating apples must be to the left of both the violinist and the person with the radio. Since the basketball player is already in house 2, the person eating apples must be in house 1, and the violinist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is **2**.

The correct option is (B) 2."
"The cricketer lives in the 2nd house. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who is wearing loafers lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is **(A) 2**."
"The root beer lover lives in house number 3.

(C) 3"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

"The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3."
"The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct option is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses. We'll use the process of elimination and logical deduction to find the correct answer.

1. **Person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
2. **Person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
3. **Person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
4. **Person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
5. **Person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the guitarist.**
6. **Person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.**
7. **Person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.**
8. **Person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.**
9. **There are two houses between where the person who likes green lives and where the pianist lives.**
10. **Person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
11. **Person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.**

From clue 8, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist. From clue 9, there are two houses between where the person who likes green lives and where the pianist lives. This means the pianist cannot be in the first house (house 1), and the person who likes green cannot be in the first house (house 1).

From clue 11, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house. This means the person who likes white lives in one of the first three houses (houses 1, 2, or 3).

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- If the person who likes white is in house 1, then the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2 (since the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes). This would place the person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils in house 3 and house 4, respectively, but house 4 is occupied by the person who is wearing loafers. This is a contradiction.
- If the person who likes white is in house 2, then the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3. This would place the person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils in house 1 and house 4, respectively. This is consistent with the other clues.
- If the person who likes white is in house 3, then the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 4. This would place the person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils in house 1 and house 2, respectively. This is also consistent with the other clues.

Given the constraints, the only consistent placement is when the person who likes white is in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes white lives is **2**.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"The person who only drinks water lives in House 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives in the first house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house number 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
   - This means the person who had pizza lives in house number 1 or 2, and the person who has a computer lives in house number 2 or 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives.
   - This means the person who has a radio lives in house number 2, and the person who has a computer lives in house number 3.

"The person who had pizza lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The person eating grapes does not live in the first house.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
3. The person driving a convertible lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the baseball player lives in the second house. From Clue 3, the person driving a convertible also lives in the second house. Since the person eating grapes does not live in the first house (Clue 1), and the second house is occupied by the baseball player and the person driving a convertible, the person eating grapes must live in the second house.

Therefore, the person eating mangos must live in the first house.

The number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is (B) 1."
"The person who likes white lives in house number 3.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 3."
"The person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct option is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the positions of the people and their pets and vehicles step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the people as Cat Lover, Fish Enthusiast, Horse Owner, and Dog Owner.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**From Clue 4:**
- The fish enthusiast and the dog owner must be in adjacent houses.

**From Clue 2:**
- There are two houses between the truck and the dog owner.
- This means the truck and the dog owner cannot be in the first or last house. They must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

**From Clue 3:**
- The truck lives directly left of the sedan.
- This means the truck and the sedan must be in adjacent houses.

**From Clue 1:**
- The minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
- This means the minivan cannot be in the first house.

**From Clue 5:**
- The cat lover does not live in the second house.
- This means the cat lover must live in either the first or the fourth house.

### Combining Clues:

Let's test the possible positions for the dog owner and the truck:

1. **Dog owner in house 3:**
   - Truck must be in house 2 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
   - This leaves house 4 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 2 and the dog owner is in house 3).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration works:
   - House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
   - House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
   - House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
   - House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

2. **Dog owner in house 4:**
   - Truck must be in house 3 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
   - This leaves house 2 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 3 and the dog owner is in house 4).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 5).

Therefore, the only valid configuration is:
- House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
- House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
- House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
- House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics:

1. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
2. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
3. The root beer lover lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow. From clue 3, the second house is occupied by the person who likes root beer. From clue 1, the person who likes blue must be in a house number greater than 3. From clue 2, the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3. From clue 4, the person who likes white must be in a house number greater than the house number of the person who only drinks water.

Given these constraints, let's place the people in the houses:
- House 1: Only drinks water (let's call this person ""W"")
- House 2: Likes root beer (let's call this person ""R"")
- House 3: Likes yellow (let's call this person ""Y"")
- House 4: Likes blue (let's call this person ""B"")

Since the person who likes blue (B) must be in a house number greater than 3, and the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3, the only possible house for the person who likes blue is House 4.

Thus, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 3."

The number of the house where the history book buff lives is **3**.
"Given the clues:

1. The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the dog owner cannot be in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2.
- The cellist and the person with the gameboy must be neighbors, and the cellist must be to the left of the person with the gameboy.

Therefore, the arrangement must be:
- Cellist in house 1
- Gameboy owner in house 2

This leaves house 1 for the dog owner.

Thus, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Minivan

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in house 3, the radio must be in house 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The third house is occupied by the person with a gameboy, so the convertible cannot be in house 3.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The first house is occupied by the person with a minivan, so the computer cannot be in house 1.

From the above, we know:
- House 1: Minivan
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Radio

Since the person with a phone must be adjacent to the person with an SUV and the phone must be to the left of the SUV, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 2: Phone

From Clue 11, the cricketer lives in the third house. From Clue 12, the person who is wearing loafers also lives in the third house. From Clue 5, the person who has a radio lives in the third house. From Clue 6, the basketball player lives in the fourth house. From Clue 10, the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. From Clue 1, the person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. From Clue 3, the root beer lover does not live in the first house. From Clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. From Clue 7, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. From Clue 2, the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

Let's summarize the information:
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- First house: root beer lover (since the root beer lover does not live in the first house and the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio, the root beer lover must be in the first house)
- Second house: tea drinker (since the tea drinker must be somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk, and the root beer lover is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the second house)
- First house: root beer lover
- Second house: tea drinker
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk (since the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, and the person who is wearing high heels must be in the fifth house)
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Sixth house: person who had stew (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the sixth house)
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who had stew
- Seventh house: person who ate fried rice
- Seventh house: person who had stew
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers (since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house, and the third house is occupied by the cricketer, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the eighth house)
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers
- Ninth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Ninth house: person who had stew
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the tenth house)
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese
- Eleventh house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew lives in the ninth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the eleventh house)
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes

From the above analysis, the person with the computer lives directly left of the person with the gameboy. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person with the radio lives in the third house, and the person with the loafers lives in the third house, the person with the gameboy must be in the second house, and the person with the computer must be in the first house.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The person who ate pizza and the person who ate fried rice have different characteristics (one is a science fiction book fanatic and one is a history book buff).

From the first clue, if the person who ate fried rice is in house 2, then the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1. This is because the fried rice eater is to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is (B) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

We can deduce the following:

- The pianist lives in house 1.
- The root beer lover lives in house 2.
- The person who owns horses lives in house 1 (since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who owns horses, and the root beer lover is in house 2).

Since the person who owns horses is in house 1, and the person who likes white is also in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **1**.

The correct option is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

2. **Clue 6**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist cannot be in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 5**: There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Stew eater

5. **Clue 4**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

6. **Clue 1**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

7. **Clue 3**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater
- The guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.
- The percussionist and science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

Let's place the known elements:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater

Since the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively, and the guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, the only possible positions for the guitarist and violinist are:
- Guitarist in house 1
- Violinist in house 3

This leaves the following possibilities for the remaining houses:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

Now, we need to place the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 2, the person eating mangos must live directly left of the person eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations arrangement

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots must live in either house 1 or house 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who likes red and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: Unknown

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who likes white must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1 (Clue 2).
- The person who likes red must be in house 2 (Clue 6).

This leaves the person who is wearing boots to be in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing boots lives in house 3.

3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

From Clue 1, the person who only drinks water is in house 1. From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in house 2. This leaves house 3 for the person who likes milk.

Now, considering Clue 3, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 3 because the person who has a bouquet of lilies (in house 2) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. This leaves house 1 for the person who has a rose bouquet.

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house number 1.

- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: History book buff

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in house 1, so they must live in either house 2 or house 3. Since the romance book lover is in house 2, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

From Clue 1, the person who likes green must be to the left of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who likes green must be in house 2. This is consistent with the arrangement we have.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 2: Green
- House 3: History book buff

"The person who is eating oranges lives in house number 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"The person who is eating apples lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"The person who had pizza lives in House 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
7. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.

From Clue 5 and Clue 7, we know:
- The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
- The mystery book reader also lives in the fourth house, which is a contradiction since only one person can live in one house. Therefore, we need to reassess the positions.

Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the mystery book reader must be in the fifth house. This means the saxophonist and the violinist must be in the third and fifth houses, respectively, or the saxophonist and the violinist must be in the third and fourth houses, respectively, but the saxophonist is already in the fourth house. Thus, the violinist must be in the third house.

From Clue 4, the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the guitarist must be in the fifth house, and the history book buff must be in the second house, which is consistent with the romance book lover being in the second house.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives. Since the percussionist is in the third house and the mystery book reader is in the fifth house, this is consistent.

Thus, the violinist lives in the third house.

The number of the house where the violinist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

- House 3: Person who only drinks water, person who likes yellow, or person who owns a sedan
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 5: Person who likes red, person who has a television, or person who likes milk

Given Clue 16, the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house, and the person who has a television must be in one of the remaining houses. Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (E) 4."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the placement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house. This means the tulip person can only live in houses 1 or 2.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. This means the SUV person and the lilies person are neighbors, and the lilies person is to the left of the SUV person.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house. This means the rose bouquet person can only be in house 1 or 3.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 2:
  - The sedan person must live in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 2).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 1).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

The only valid configuration is:
- Rose bouquet person in house 1.
- Sedan person in house 2.
- Lilies person in house 3.
- Tulip person in house 2.

Thus, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and the refined approach, let's deduce the correct house for the person who likes milk.

1. **House 4: Lilies**

9. **House 3: Pianist or Mystery Book Reader**
10. **House 4: Carnations Arrangement**
11. **House 5: Rose Bouquet**

From the clues, we can deduce that the person who likes milk lives in House 4. The person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other, and the carnations arrangement is in House 4. Therefore, the person who likes milk must be in House 4.

The number of the house where the person who likes milk lives is **4**.

From clue 13, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. This means the first house is occupied by the person who is eating kiwis.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. This means the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

From clue 1, the cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the convertible driver lives in the fourth house (clue 9), the cricketer must live in the third house.

From clue 14, the swimmer and the cricketer must be in houses that are two houses apart. Since the cricketer is in the third house, the swimmer must be in the first house (yellow).

From clue 5, the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the first house is yellow, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

From clue 6, the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the swimmer is in the first house and the person who likes white is in the second house, this is consistent.

From clue 7, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating oranges is in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house.

From clue 8, the person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the person who is eating a banana, the person who owns an SUV must be in the first house (yellow).

From clue 10, the person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the first house and the person who is eating a banana is in the second house, this is consistent.

From clue 2, the person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the first house (yellow), this is consistent.

From clue 3, the soccer player does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who likes green, the soccer player must be in the second house (banana).

From clue 10, the person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the first house (yellow) and the person who is eating a banana is in the second house (banana), this is consistent.

From clue 11, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white is in the second house (banana) and the person who drives a minivan is in the first house (yellow), this is consistent.

From clue 12, the person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the first house (yellow) and the person who likes blue is in the third house, this is consistent.

From clue 14, the swimmer and the cricketer must be in houses that are two houses apart. Since the cricketer is in the third house and the swimmer is in the first house, this is consistent.

The remaining house, the fourth house, is occupied by the person who likes green and the person who is eating oranges.

Therefore, the basketball player must be in the remaining house, which is the second house.

The number of the house where the basketball player lives is **2**."
"The person who likes blue lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the house where the bird keeper lives step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

From Clue 7, we know the first house has a carnations arrangement. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From Clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 5, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the horses and the rose bouquet must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. This means the horses and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1).
2. The cellist lives in the first house (number 1).
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. From clue 2, the cellist also lives in house 1. This creates a contradiction because only one person can live in each house. Therefore, we need to reassess.

Let's consider the fantasy book enthusiast living in house 1 and the cellist living in house 2. This means:

- The fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green.
- The person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red.
- The cellist (living in house 2) plays the cello.
- The pianist (living in house 1) plays the piano.

Now, we need to determine the mystery book reader. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green and the person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red, the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

The number of the house where the swimmer lives is (A) 1.
"The person who had stew lives in House 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues and the logical deductions:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- If Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals, then Person 2 (House 2) must own horses.
- If Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals, then Person 1 (House 1) must own horses.

From Clue 2:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals.**
   - Person 1 (House 1) ate spaghetti.
   - Person 2 (House 2) is the history book buff.
   - Person 1 (House 1) is the cat lover.
   - Person 2 (House 2) is the romance book lover.
   - Person 1 (House 1) is wearing running shoes.
   - Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals.

2. **Scenario 2: Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals.**
   - Person 2 (House 2) ate spaghetti.
   - Person 1 (House 1) is the history book buff.
   - Person 2 (House 2) is the cat lover.
   - Person 1 (House 1) is the romance book lover.
   - Person 2 (House 2) is wearing running shoes.
   - Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals.

In both scenarios, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate fried rice lives is **2**."
"The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct option is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics step by step:

1. **Carnations arrangement in the fourth house**: House 4.
2. **Rose bouquet in the third house**: House 3.
3. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer**: This means if the swimmer is in house \(i\), the fantasy book enthusiast is in house \(i-1\).
4. **Tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the tennis player is in house \(i+1\) or later.
5. **There is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet**: This means if the rose bouquet is in house \(i\), the daffodils are in house \(i+1\) or \(i-1\).
6. **There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the romance book lover is in house \(i+2\) or \(i-2\).

### Analyzing the Clues:
- **Clue 6**: Rose bouquet in house 3.
- **Clue 4**: Fantasy book enthusiast in house 2 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer).
- **Clue 1**: There is one house between the mystery book reader and the swimmer.
- **Clue 7**: Tennis player does not live in house 4.
- **Clue 8**: There is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet.
- **Clue 9**: There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover.

### Placing the People:
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Tennis player (since the tennis player does not live in house 4, and the only available house is house 4).
- House 1: Mystery book reader (since there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, and the only possible positions are houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1).
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast (since the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the only available house is house 5).

### Final Placement:
- House 1: Mystery book reader.
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Tennis player.
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast.

### Conclusion:
The romance book lover must be in house 2, as there are two houses between the mystery book reader (house 1) and the romance book lover.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person with the rose bouquet:

1. The golfer lives in the first house (house 1).
2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the third house (house 3).
3. The person who had pizza lives in the third house (house 3) because they cannot be in the second house (clue 5).
4. The person wearing running shoes does not live in the first house (clue 3), so they must live in either house 2 or 3. Since the person with pizza is in house 3, the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.
5. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. Since the person with running shoes is in house 2, the person with grilled cheese must be in house 3 (since the person with pizza is already in house 3).
6. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person driving a minivan is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.
7. The person who had pizza (in house 3) must be to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Since the person with pizza is in house 3, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 1.

Therefore, the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."

"The person who likes white lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
The number of the house where the basketball player lives is (A) 1.
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 1."
"The person who drives a minivan lives in house number 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"The dog owner lives in house 3.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 3."
"The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct option is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house where the person who had pizza lives:

1. **Carnations in House 1.**
2. **Apples in House 2.**
3. **Banana not between pianist and pizza.**
4. **Stew and grilled cheese next to each other.**
5. **Piano not in House 5.**
6. **Tulips not in House 3.**
7. **Daffodils next to roses.**
8. **Banana not between pizza and saxophonist.**
9. **Two houses between banana and pianist.**
10. **Guitarist not in House 3.**
11. **Pizza to the right of saxophonist.**
12. **Banana not in House 4.**
13. **Mango not in House 4.**
14. **Mango not in House 5.**
15. **Piano not in House 5.**

From the clues, we can deduce the following:
- Since the pianist cannot be in House 5, and the person who had pizza must be to the right of the saxophonist, we can start placing the pianist and saxophonist.
- The pianist cannot be in House 5, and the saxophonist cannot be in House 1 (since the pianist is to the right of the saxophonist).
- The person who had pizza must be to the right of the saxophonist, and the person who had pizza cannot be in House 5.

Let's place the pianist and saxophonist:
- If the pianist is in House 2, the saxophonist must be in House 3 (since the pianist is to the right of the saxophonist).
- The person who had pizza must be in House 4 (since the saxophonist is in House 3 and the person who had pizza must be to the right of the saxophonist).

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

12. **Clue 5**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
13. **Clue 11**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.

1. Pizza
2. History book buff
3. Spaghetti
4. ?

1. Pizza
2. Bouquet of daffodils
3. Spaghetti
4. Fried rice

"Given the clues, let's analyze the positions of the people and the fruits step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person eating grapes lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
- Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

**Clue 4:** There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1.

**Clue 3:** There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person eating grapes must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the person eating grapes must be in house 1.

**Clue 2:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
- If the violinist is in house 1, the flutist must be in house 3.
- If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

### Combining Clues:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2:
  - Violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

### Correct Configuration:

- Person eating kiwis in house 2.
- Violinist in house 1.
- Flutist in house 3.
- Person eating grapes in house 1 (Clue 3).

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other (Clue 1).
- The flutist is to the right of the violinist (Clue 2).
- There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis (Clue 3).
- There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis (Clue 4).

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating kiwis lives in house 1. 

From clue 1, we know that the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in house 1. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 2.

The number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is house 2.

The correct option is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person who likes red:

1. The person who likes red lives in the third house (Clue 8 and Clue 1).
2. The person who has a television lives in the third house (Clue 10).
3. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow (Clue 10).
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (Clue 2).
5. The person who has a television lives in the third house (Clue 10).

From these clues, we can conclude that the person who likes red lives in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the root beer lover cannot be in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 1. The pianist and the cellist must be in the remaining houses, with the pianist in house 1 and the cellist in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the root beer lover lives is:

(A) 1"
"The person who has the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 4."
"The pianist lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 2."
"The person who ate fried rice lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) 1"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other (Clue 4), the science fiction book fanatic must live in house number 1 or 3. However, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1), the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

Now, the person with the rose bouquet is in house number 2, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house number 3. This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The coffee drinker (CD) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals (SW).
2. The science fiction book fanatic (SF) lives in the first house (house 1).

From Clue 2, we know the SF lives in house 1. Therefore, the CD must be in house 2 because the CD cannot be in house 1 (as the SF is there). This leaves house 1 for the water drinker (WD) and house 2 for the romance book lover (RBL).

Thus, the romance book lover lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who has a phone lives in House 1. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 1, we know the second house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.

From clue 2, the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them. This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3.

From clue 3, the person who likes yellow must be in the house directly to the left of the person who owns a sedan. Given the positions of the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan, the only way this can be satisfied is if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3 and the person who likes yellow is in house 2.

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who owns horses lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 5."
"The person who drives a truck lives in House 5. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 5."
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

(C) 3"
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.

Since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 1, and the dog owner must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.
   - If the person drinking water is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means if the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the person liking yellow must be in house 2.
   - If the person wearing sandals is in house 2, the person liking yellow must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - This means the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis is in house 2. From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2). From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

So, we have:
- House 1: Person drinking water, Person wearing sandals
- House 2: Person eating kiwis, Person liking yellow

Since the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).

Therefore, the person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who is eating kiwis lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house (Clue 3).
2. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist (Clue 1).
3. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives (Clue 2).
4. The violinist does not live in the third house (Clue 4).

From Clue 3, we know the tea drinker is in house 1. This leaves houses 2 and 3 for the cellist and the guitarist. Since the violinist cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), the violinist must be in house 2. This leaves house 3 for the guitarist.

From Clue 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3, which aligns with our deduction.

Therefore, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza

2. **Clue 6:** The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
   - The radio cannot be in house 4.

3. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the grilled cheese and spaghetti must be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
   - This means the grilled cheese and radio must be separated by one house.

5. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
   - This means the gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house.

6. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
   - The television and phone must be in houses with the television to the left of the phone.

Let's place the pizza in house 4:
- House 4: Pizza

Now, the radio cannot be in house 4, so it must be in one of houses 1, 2, 3, or 5. The grilled cheese and radio must be separated by one house. Let's try placing the radio in house 1:

"Given the clues and logical deductions, the person who is eating a banana must live in the fifth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 5"
"Given the clues:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.

From Clue 1, we deduce:
- The bird keeper must be in house 1 because the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2, and the grilled cheese eater cannot be in house 1.
- Therefore, the bird keeper is in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater is in house 2.

From Clue 2:
- The percussionist does not live in house 2, so the percussionist must live in house 1.

This leaves the guitarist and the pizza eater to be placed in houses 1 and 2. Since the percussionist is in house 1 and the grilled cheese eater is in house 2, the guitarist and the pizza eater must be in the remaining houses.

Since the percussionist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2 (because the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the pizza eater cannot be in house 2).

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 2**: The bird keeper lives in the third house.
   - This directly tells us the bird keeper lives in house number 3.

2. **Clue 1**: The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - This means the cat lover can live in houses 1, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 3**: The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
   - This means the golfer and the truck driver cannot be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.
   - This means the convertible driver can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

5. **Clue 5**: The baseball player does not live in the third house.
   - This means the baseball player can live in houses 1, 2, or 4.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - This is consistent with Clue 5, as the convertible driver cannot be in the third house.

7. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player.
   - This means the sedan owner cannot be in the first house and must be in a house to the right of the baseball player.

8. **Clue 8**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
   - Since the bird keeper lives in house 3, the soccer player must live in house 1, 2, or 4.

9. **Clue 9**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.
   - This means the fish enthusiast must live in a house to the left of the soccer player.

Let's summarize the constraints:
- Bird keeper: House 3
- Cat lover: House 1, 2, or 4
- Golfers and truck drivers: Not adjacent
- Convertible driver: House 2, 3, or 4
- Baseball player: House 1, 2, or 4
- Sedan owner: House 2, 3, or 4 (to the right of the baseball player)
- Soccer player: House 1, 2, or 4 (to the left of the bird keeper)
- Fish enthusiast: House 1, 2, or 4 (to the left of the soccer player)

Given Clue 2, the bird keeper is in house 3. Let's place the other constraints:

- Convertible driver cannot be in house 3, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
- Baseball player cannot be in house 3, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
- Sedan owner must be to the right of the baseball player, so if the baseball player is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 2 or 4. If the baseball player is in house 2, the sedan owner must be in house 4. If the baseball player is in house 4, the sedan owner must be in house 2 or 3 (but house 3 is taken by the bird keeper).

Let's try placing the convertible driver in house 1:
- Convertible driver in house 1
- Baseball player in house 2 (since they cannot be in house 3)
- Sedan owner in house 4 (to the right of the baseball player)

This leaves house 3 for the bird keeper and house 4 for the sedan owner. The fish enthusiast must be in house 1 or 2, but house 1 is taken by the convertible driver. So the fish enthusiast must be in house 2.

This leaves house 4 for the sedan owner, house 2 for the fish enthusiast, and house 3 for the bird keeper.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house number 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
2. **Clue 2**: The percussionist does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3**: The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4**: The history book buff does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
6. **Clue 6**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
8. **Clue 8**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. **Clue 10**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.

From Clue 10, we know the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist must be in the first and third houses respectively, or the third and first houses respectively. Since the fantasy book enthusiast cannot be in the second house (Clue 3), the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

Now, let's place the fish enthusiast and the person eating a banana. From Clue 5, the fish enthusiast must be to the right of the person eating a banana. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the person eating a banana must be in the first house.

So, the first house is occupied by the person eating a banana, and the third house is occupied by the flutist.

Next, we need to place the percussionist, the pianist, and the person wearing running shoes. From Clue 2, the percussionist cannot be in the second house. From Clue 4, the history book buff cannot be in the second house. From Clue 8, the fish enthusiast (in the third house) must be to the right of the person wearing running shoes. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the person wearing running shoes must be in the first house, but we already know the first house is occupied by the person eating a banana. Therefore, the person wearing running shoes must be in the second house.

Now, the second house is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, and the first house is occupied by the person eating a banana. The third house is occupied by the flutist.

Finally, we need to place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who is eating oranges. From Clue 1, the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house. From Clue 7, the person who is eating oranges must be to the right of the pianist. Since the flutist is in the third house, the pianist must be in the second house, and the person eating oranges must be in the first house, but we already know the first house is occupied by the person eating a banana. Therefore, the person eating oranges must be in the third house.

So, the second house is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the first house is occupied by the person eating a banana, the second house is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the third house is occupied by the flutist, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house.

Therefore, the person who is eating oranges lives in the third house.

The number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is **3**.

**Final Answer: (C) 3**"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: ?
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

2. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means the person who likes white and the person who is eating a banana must be in houses 1 and 3, or houses 2 and 4. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1 and the person who is eating a banana must be in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

3. **Clue 4**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes green must be in a house to the left of the person who likes yellow. Given the arrangement so far, the person who likes green must be in house 1 or house 2. Since house 1 is already occupied by the person who likes white, the person who likes green must be in house 2. This contradicts Clue 6, which states that the person who is eating grapes is in house 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in house 1, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: Yellow

4. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who likes red lives in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes green is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3, this is consistent. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

6. **Clue 1**: The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes red is in house 3 and the person who is eating kiwis must be in a house to the right of house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 4. So, the arrangement is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Kiwis

Thus, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4. The correct answer is (A) 4."
"The person who had stew lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct option is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
   - This means if the daffodils are in house 1, the phone must be in house 2.
   - If the daffodils are in house 2, the phone must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the person who likes root beer lives in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who has a television lives in either house 1 or house 3.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means if the person with the television is in house \(X\), the person with the vase of tulips must be in house \(X-1\).

From Clue 3, the root beer lover lives in house 1. From Clue 2, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2. From Clue 4, the person who has a television cannot live in house 2, so they must live in house 1 or house 3. From Clue 5, if the person with the television is in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2 (which contradicts Clue 2). Therefore, the person with the television must live in house 3.

This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2. This leaves house 3 for the person who likes root beer.

Thus, the person who likes root beer lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Wearing loafers

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
   - Phone: House 1, 2
   - Mangos: House 2, 3

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - Grapes: House 1, 2
   - Water: House 2, 3

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - Boots: House 1, 2

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - Kiwis: House 1, 2
   - Milk: House 2, 3

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Boots: House 1, 2
   - Gameboy: House 1, 2, 3

7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
   - Kiwis: House 2, 3

### Deductions

- **House 1:** Wearing loafers (Clue 1)
- **House 2:** Phone, Boots, Gameboy, Kiwis, Milk
- **House 3:** Mangos

From Clue 2, the phone and mangos must be in different houses, and the phone must be to the left of the mangos. Since the phone is in House 2, the mangos must be in House 3.

From Clue 3, grapes and water must be in adjacent houses. Since the phone is in House 2, grapes must be in House 1 and water in House 3.

From Clue 5, kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses. Since the phone is in House 2, kiwis must be in House 1 and milk in House 3.

From Clue 6, boots must be to the right of the gameboy. Since the phone is in House 2, the gameboy must be in House 1, and boots in House 2.

From Clue 7, kiwis cannot be in the first house, which is already occupied by grapes.

### Final Arrangement

- **House 1:** Wearing loafers, Grapes, Kiwis
- **House 2:** Phone, Boots, Gameboy, Kiwis
- **House 3:** Mangos, Milk

Since the person with the phone is in House 2, the person with the phone is not the one who has a computer. The person with the phone is not the one who has a gameboy, so the person with the phone is the one who has a computer.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in **House 2**.

The answer is (A) 2."

   - Given the positions of the cellist and the mystery book reader, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the history book buff is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 2, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2 in that order.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

Since the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, and the guitarist must be next to the root beer lover, the guitarist must be in house 1 and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
   - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
   - If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, so this scenario is not possible.

2. **Clue 2**: The dog owner does not live in the second house.
   - This means the dog owner can only live in house 1 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 3 if the dog owner lives in house 1.
   - The person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 if the dog owner lives in house 3.

Let's summarize the possibilities:

- If the dog owner is in house 1:
  - The bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1).
  - The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3 (Clue 1).
  - The dog owner is in house 1.
  - The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3 (Clue 3).

- If the dog owner is in house 3:
  - The bird keeper cannot be in house 3 (Clue 1).
  - The bird keeper must be in house 1 or house 2.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (Clue 1).
  - The dog owner is in house 3.
  - The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2 (Clue 3).

From the above analysis, the only consistent scenario is when the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper is in house 2, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 4**: The swimmer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Swimmer

2. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not apples

3. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
   - Possible positions for boots and kiwis: (1, 3) or (2, 4)

4. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not loafers

5. **Clue 6**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - Possible positions for tulips and cricketer: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)

6. **Clue 7**: The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - House 1: Phone, House 2: Sandals

7. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
   - House 1: Oranges, House 2: Computer

8. **Clue 9**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not lilies

9. **Clue 10**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not loafers

11. **Clue 11**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
   - Possible positions for rose bouquet and banana: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)

12. **Clue 12**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.
   - Possible positions for gameboy and basketball: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)

Let's combine these clues:

- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 2**: Computer, Sandals
- **House 3**: Not apples, Not kiwis, Not loafers, Not lilies
- **House 4**: Swimmer

Since House 3 cannot be apples, kiwis, loafers, or lilies, and considering the positions of the other items, the only logical placement for House 3 is:
- **House 3**: Banana

Now, we need to place the remaining items:
- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 2**: Computer, Sandals
- **House 3**: Banana
- **House 4**: Swimmer

The remaining items are:
- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 2**: Computer, Sandals
- **House 3**: Banana
- **House 4**: Swimmer

Since the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player, and considering the positions:
- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 2**: Computer, Sandals
- **House 3**: Banana
- **House 4**: Swimmer

The only remaining positions for gameboy and basketball are:
- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 2**: Computer, Sandals
- **House 3**: Banana
- **House 4**: Swimmer

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1.

**The number of the house where the person who is wearing loafers lives is 1.**

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the bird keeper step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating mangos.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not horses.

3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2, and vice versa.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not banana.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not horses.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the person eating a banana is in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2, and vice versa.

From Clue 6, the person eating a banana must be in house 1, and the dog owner must be in house 2. This leaves house 3 and house 4 for the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis.

Since the person eating a banana is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 3 (since they must be adjacent to the bird keeper).

From Clue 5, the person who owns horses cannot be in house 2. Since the dog owner is in house 2, the person who owns horses must be in house 4.

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating mangos, not horses, not banana, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, not banana, dog owner.
- House 3: Not banana, eating kiwis.
- House 4: Not horses, owns horses.

The bird keeper must be in house 4.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 4. The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

From Clue 3, the bird keeper and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the only possible adjacent houses are the second and third houses.

From Clue 2, the bird keeper cannot be in the third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the history book buff must be in the third house.

This leaves the first house for the mystery book reader and the second house for the bird keeper. Consequently, the third house must be occupied by the romance book lover.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(B) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the placement of the people:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person eating apples lives directly left of the person drinking water.
3. The person eating mangos does not live in the first house.
4. The person eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
6. The person eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in house 2.

From Clue 3, the person eating mangos cannot be in house 1 or 3, so they must be in house 4.

From Clue 4, the person eating mangos cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 4.

From Clue 6, the person eating kiwis cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 2 or 4. Since the coffee drinker is in house 2 and the mangos eater is in house 4, the kiwis eater must be in house 1.

From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be to the left of the person drinking water. Since the mangos eater is in house 4 and the kiwis eater is in house 1, the apples eater must be in house 3 and the water drinker must be in house 4. However, this contradicts Clue 4, which states the mangos eater cannot be in house 3. Therefore, the mangos eater must be in house 1, and the apples eater must be in house 3, making the water drinker in house 4.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in house 2.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"The person who is eating a banana lives in house 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3."
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"The correct option is (C) 1.

To elaborate on the reasoning without referencing the previous response:

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. Clue 6 states the flutist is directly left of the person who drives a minivan. This means the flutist must be in house 1 and the person who drives a minivan must be in house 2.
2. Clue 5 states the minivan is to the right of the truck. Therefore, the truck must be in house 3.
3. Clue 2 states the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. Since the truck is in house 3, the person with the gameboy must be in house 2 (but we already know the minivan is in house 2, so this is a contradiction unless we consider the person with the gameboy is in house 1, which is not possible since the flutist is in house 1).
4. Clue 3 states the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. Since the minivan is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 3.
5. Clue 4 states the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person with the television must be in house 2 (but this is a contradiction since the minivan is in house 2).
6. Clue 7 states the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 3 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 1.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 1."

2. **Clue 9**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house (house 2).
3. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist, so the pianist must be in house 3.
4. **Clue 13**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils (house 2) lives directly left of the person who has a television (house 3).
5. **Clue 8**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the SUV lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the root beer lover).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the minivan driver cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the minivan driver).

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we know:
- The SUV driver is in the first house.
- The root beer lover is not in the third house.
- The truck driver is to the right of the root beer lover.
- The minivan driver is not in the third house.

Since the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet, and the first house is occupied by the person with the SUV, the third house must be occupied by the coffee drinker.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"The person who drives a truck lives in house 3. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 3."
"The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the placement of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in House 3 (since there is no house to the left of House 3), and the person who likes white must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 2 is already taken by the person who likes red, the person who likes white must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red

4. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in House 2, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 3.
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 2: Red
   - House 1: White

5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in Houses 1 and 3 or Houses 2 and 4. Since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 2.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - The person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2 (since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes), and the person who has a phone must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

7. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - This is already confirmed as House 3.

8. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This is already confirmed as House 1.

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who is wearing boots must be in House 4.
- The person who has a television must be in House 4.
- The person who is wearing sandals must be in House 4.

Since the person who is wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who has a television must be in House 4.

Thus, the person who has a phone must be in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"The bird keeper lives in house number 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics and house assignments step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.

4. **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the first house (house 1).
   - Therefore, the saxophonist is in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   - This means the romance book lover and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 4, we know the saxophonist is in house 1. From Clue 5, the romance book lover and the golfer must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the golfer must be in house 2 (Clue 2).

Now, the baseball player and the person eating grapes must be in houses 1 and 2 (Clue 3). Since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Saxophonist, Baseball player, Tea drinker, Romance book lover

"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding houses step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

### Initial Setup

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. Let's denote the people in the houses as follows:
- House 1: Person 1
- House 2: Person 2

### Clue 3 Analysis

Clue 3 states that the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. This means:
- If Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
- If Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, then Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.

### Clue 1 and Clue 2 Analysis

Clue 1 states that the person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. This means:
- If Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.
- If Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck, then Person 1 (House 1) eats grapes.

Clue 2 states that the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader. This means:
- If Person 1 (House 1) wears boots, then Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.
- If Person 2 (House 2) wears boots, then Person 1 (House 1) is the mystery book reader.

### Combining Clues

Let's combine the information from Clue 3 and Clue 1:

- If Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
- If Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck, then Person 1 (House 1) eats grapes (Clue 1).

This creates a contradiction because Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow and eat grapes simultaneously. Therefore, Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow.

Thus, Person 2 (House 2) must like yellow.

Now, let's use Clue 1 again:
- If Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, then Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.

This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.
- Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.

Now, let's use Clue 2:
- If Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) wears boots (Clue 2).

This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) wears boots.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.

Finally, we need to determine the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the remaining characteristics are:
- Person 1 (House 1) likes red.
- Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow.
- Person 1 (House 1) eats grapes.
- Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
- Person 1 (House 1) wears boots.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.

The only remaining characteristic is the fantasy book enthusiast. Since Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader, Person 1 (House 1) must be the fantasy book enthusiast.

### Conclusion

The fantasy book enthusiast lives in **House 1**.

Thus, the correct option is (B) 1."
"Based on the given clues and the deductions made, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 5.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person:

1. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house (house 1).
   - House 1: Spaghetti

2. **Clue 9**: The person who likes red lives directly to the left of the person who likes green.

   - House 2: Green
   - House 3: Red

3. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.

   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Science fiction book fanatic

4. **Clue 2**: The golfer lives in the fourth house.

   - House 1: Spaghetti
   - House 2: White
   - House 3: Romance book lover
   - House 4: Science fiction book fanatic

6. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue.

7. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the percussionist lives in house 2 and the person who had pizza lives in house 3.

   - House 1: Spaghetti
   - House 2: White
   - House 3: Pizza
   - House 4: Science fiction book fanatic

8. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - The only remaining houses are 1 and 4, but house 1 is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti. Therefore, the soccer player must live in house 1 and the guitarist must live in house 4.

   - House 1: Soccer player
   - House 2: White
   - House 3: Pizza
   - House 4: Science fiction book fanatic

9. **Clue 3**: There are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives.
   - The fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 1 and the saxophonist must live in house 4.

   - House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast
   - House 2: White
   - House 3: Pizza
   - House 4: Saxophonist

10. **Clue 1**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
    - The person who ate grilled cheese must live in house 2 or house 4. Since house 4 is occupied by the saxophonist, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in house 2.

    - House 1: Soccer player
    - House 2: Grilled cheese
    - House 3: Pizza
    - House 4: Saxophonist

11. **Clue 11**: The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
    - The only remaining houses are 1 and 4, but house 4 is occupied by the saxophonist. Therefore, the violinist must live in house 1 and the person who likes blue must live in house 2.

    - House 1: Violinist
    - House 2: Grilled cheese
    - House 3: Pizza
    - House 4: Saxophonist

From the analysis, we can see that the person who had pizza lives in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The basketball player lives in the second house.
   - This means House 2 is occupied by the basketball player.

2. **Clue 3:** The violinist lives in the second house.
   - This is a contradiction because the violinist and the basketball player both live in House 2. However, since the violinist is mentioned first, it implies the violinist is in House 2.

3. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
   - Since the violinist is in House 2, the cricketer and the cellist must be in Houses 1 and 3, respectively, with the cellist to the right of the cricketer.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

Since the basketball player is in House 2, the soccer player must be in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the soccer player lives is **(A) 1**."

   - If the root beer lover is in house 1, the person who likes blue must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the romance book lover must live in house 2.

This leaves house 2 for the remaining characteristics:
- The person in house 2 must be the bird keeper.
- The person in house 2 must have a gameboy (since the computer is in house 1).

"Given the clues, let's deduce the house where the person who has a computer lives:

1. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house (house 4).
2. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house (house 2).
3. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 3 or 4. Since house 4 is occupied by the person who had pizza, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 3.
4. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
5. The person who had stew does not live in the second house (house 2).

- House 5: Not science fiction book fanatic

Since the person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips, we can infer the following:
- The person with the gameboy (house 1) cannot have a bouquet of daffodils.

   - House 3: Sedan

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - House 1: High Heels
   - House 2: Boots
   - House 3: Sedan

Since the person wearing high heels lives in house 1, and the cat lover lives in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be the cat lover. This leaves the person wearing running shoes to live in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 3.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the history book buff (HBB).

3. The person with a computer (C) lives somewhere to the right of the person with a phone (P).
4. The mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person with a television (TV).

From Clue 2, we know the mystery book reader (MR) lives in the first house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as Mystery Reader (MR), History Book Buff (HBB), and Science Fiction Fanatic (SFF).

From Clue 1, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the history book buff (HBB). Since MR is in the first house, HBB must be in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: HBB

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person with a television (TV). Since MR is in the first house, TV must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the history book buff (HBB), which contradicts Clue 1. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Since the mystery book reader (MR) is in the first house, the history book buff (HBB) must be in the third house. This means the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: ?
- House 3: HBB

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person with a television (TV). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the person who has a computer (C). So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: TV (computer)
- House 3: HBB

From Clue 3, the person with a computer (C) lives somewhere to the right of the person with a phone (P). Since the person with the computer is in the second house, the person with the phone must be in the first house. This means the person with the phone is the mystery book reader (MR). This is consistent with Clue 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: MR (mystery book reader)
- House 2: TV (computer)
- House 3: HBB (history book buff)

The person who has a phone is the mystery book reader (MR), and the person who has a computer is in the second house. The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic (SFF), who must be in the third house.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

Wool can typically be machine washed, but it's important to handle it with care. Here are some considerations:

1. **Machine Washing**: Wool can be washed in a washing machine, but it's best to use a gentle cycle and a wool or delicates detergent. Avoid using fabric softeners, as they can damage the wool fibers.

2. **Hand Washing**: Hand washing is also an option, especially for delicate items or when you want to ensure the garment is treated with extra care. Use a gentle detergent and a basin or sink with enough water to submerge the garment. Gently agitate the wool in the water, then rinse thoroughly.

3. **Drying**: Wool should be air-dried or tumble-dried on a low heat setting. Avoid drying wool in direct sunlight, as it can cause color fading and shrinkage.

4. **Ironing**: Wool can be ironed, but it's best to do so on a low heat setting and using a pressing cloth to protect the fabric.

So, while wool can be machine washed, it's not necessary to hand wash it only. The choice between machine washing and hand washing depends on the specific garment and your preference for care."
