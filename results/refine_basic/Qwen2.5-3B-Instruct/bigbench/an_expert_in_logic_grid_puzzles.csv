"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

Let's start with the first clue:
- The flutist lives in house number 2.

Next, let's consider the fourth clue:
- There is one house between the flutist (house 2) and the pianist. This means the pianist can only be in house number 3 or house number 4.

Now, let's use the second clue:
- The person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. This means the guitarist and the person with the vase of tulips must be adjacent, and the guitarist must be to the left of the person with the vase of tulips.

Finally, let's use the third clue:
- The person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement. This means the carnations and the bouquet of lilies must be adjacent, and the person with the carnations must be to the left of the person with the bouquet of lilies.

Let's place the pianist in house number 3 (since the pianist cannot be in house number 4):
- If the pianist is in house number 3, then the guitarist must be in house number 2 (but house 2 is already occupied by the flutist), which is a contradiction. Therefore, the pianist must be in house number 4.

If the pianist is in house number 4:
- The guitarist must be in house number 3 (since the guitarist must be to the left of the person with the vase of tulips).

Now, we have:
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Guitarist
- House 4: Pianist

The person with the bouquet of lilies must be in house number 1 (since house 2 is occupied by the flutist and house 3 is occupied by the guitarist):
- House 1: Bouquet of lilies

The person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 4 (since house 4 is occupied by the pianist and house 3 is occupied by the guitarist):
- House 4: Carnations

This leaves house number 2 for the person with the vase of tulips, as it must be directly left of the guitarist (house 3).

Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To determine the house where the cellist lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating kiwis.

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes green lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Green.

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 7**: The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - This means the percussionist must live in either house 1 or house 3.

5. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
   - This means the cellist and the person with a gameboy must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4 (but since there are only 3 houses, this is not possible).

6. **Clue 3**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
   - This means the person who only drinks water must be in a house to the left of the root beer lover.

7. **Clue 2**: The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
   - This means the person who has a television must be in a house to the left of the root beer lover.

8. **Clue 1**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the root beer lover must be to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

Given Clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3.

Given Clue 7, the percussionist cannot be in house 2, so the percussionist must be in house 1. This leaves house 3 for the root beer lover and the person who has a gameboy.

Since the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3, and the person who likes green is in house 1, the only possible arrangement is:

- **House 1**: Green (person who likes green)
- **House 2**: Blue (person who likes blue)
- **House 3**: Root beer (person who drinks root beer) and Gameboy (person who has a gameboy)

Thus, the cellist must live in house 3.

**Final Answer**: The number of the house where the cellist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house (House 3).
2. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
9. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
11. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
12. **Clue 9**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
13. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.

From Clue 3, we know the person in the third house is wearing high heels. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person in house 3 is wearing high heels, the third house is house number 3.

Now, let's use Clue 11 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the root beer lover and the person who is eating mangos. Since the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating mangos lives next to the person who had pizza, we can infer the following:

- The root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.
- The person who is eating mangos must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be next to each other.

Given that the person in house 3 is wearing high heels, the person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who is eating mangos lives to the right of the coffee drinker, and the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 3 and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Next, we use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Finally, we use Clue 6 and Clue 7 to determine the positions of the person who drives a truck and the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, the person who drives a truck must be in house 1 and the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 2: Person who owns an SUV
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

From this arrangement, we can see that the tea drinker must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **(C) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
   - This directly tells us that the grilled cheese eater lives in house number 5.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who had pizza lives in one of the houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the root beer lover and the person who had stew are neighbors, with the root beer lover being to the left of the person who had stew.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in house number 5.

5. **Clue 5:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who ate spaghetti are neighbors, with the coffee drinker being to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in house number 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are neighbors.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 5: Grilled cheese eater, person who only drinks water
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 1: Person who had pizza (not in the first house)
- House 2: Person who had stew and the person who likes milk (must be neighbors)
- House 4: Person who only drinks water (not in the fifth house)

Since the person who only drinks water lives in house 5, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk must be in houses 1 and 2. Given that the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are neighbors, they must be in houses 1 and 2.

Let's place the people:
- House 1: Person who had stew
- House 2: Person who likes milk

This leaves house 4 for the person who only drinks water, which is consistent with Clue 4.

Now, we need to place the root beer lover and the person who drinks coffee:
- The root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2, but since the person who had stew is in house 1, the root beer lover must be in house 2.
- The coffee drinker must be in house 1 or 4, but house 4 is taken by the person who only drinks water, so the coffee drinker must be in house 1.

This leaves house 4 for the person who only drinks water, which is consistent with Clue 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who had stew
- House 2: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 4: Person who only drinks water

The answer is (A) 5."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the soccer player and the person eating oranges cannot be in houses 1 and 3, but they must be in houses 1 and 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - This means the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
   - This means the person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person with daffodils must be in a house to the right of the person eating oranges.

From Clue 1, the soccer player and the person eating oranges must be in houses 1 and 2. 

From Clue 4, the person with daffodils must be in a house to the right of the person eating oranges. Since the person eating oranges is in house 1, the person with daffodils must be in house 2.

From Clue 2, the swimmer and the person with daffodils (house 2) must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person with daffodils is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 1.

From Clue 3, the person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos. Since the person eating mangos is in house 1, the person with tulips must be in house 3.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person eating mangos
- House 2: Person with daffodils
- House 3: Person with tulips

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's deduce the positions step by step:

1. **Violinist lives in House 1.**
2. **History book buff lives in House 3.**
3. **Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone are next to each other.**
4. **Person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.**
5. **Person who ate spaghetti does not live in House 2.**
6. **Person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.**
7. **There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives.**
8. **Person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.**

From these constraints:
- Violinist in House 1
- History book buff in House 3
- Person with a bouquet of daffodils and person with a phone are next to each other
- Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone are next to each other
- Person with a bouquet of daffodils is to the left of the percussionist

Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the percussionist and the violinist is in House 1, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1. This leaves House 2 for the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone.

Therefore, the person with a vase of tulips must live in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
5. **Clue 5:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
6. **Clue 6:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the person who lives in the second house (Clue 2). This person is the mystery book reader.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: ?

Next, we use Clue 3 and Clue 6 to place the bird keeper and the fish enthusiast. The bird keeper cannot be in House 1 or House 3, and the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in House 3, and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, we use Clue 4 to place the history book buff. The history book buff must be directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the history book buff is in House 2, the bouquet of lilies must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, we use Clue 5 to place the percussionist. The percussionist must be directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the computer must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Next, we use Clue 7 to place the person who has a gameboy. The person who has a gameboy must be directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the gameboy is in House 2, the rose bouquet must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Finally, we use Clue 8 to place the cellist. The cellist cannot be in House 3. Since the cellist is not in House 3, the cellist must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the person who has a gameboy. The gameboy is in House 2, and the person who has a gameboy is directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the rose bouquet is in House 3, the gameboy must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Therefore, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the person wearing boots lives in house 2. This means the person driving a truck must live in house 1 because the person driving a truck is the only other car type left.

From Clue 1, since the person driving a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff, and the person driving a truck is in house 1, the person driving a convertible must be in house 2. Therefore, the person driving a convertible is the history book buff and lives in house 2.

This leaves the person in house 1 as the mystery book reader and the person in house 2 as the boots wearer. Since the person in house 1 is the mystery book reader, they must be wearing sandals.

Thus, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. **Clue 4**: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. **Clue 1**: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover must live in House 2, and the swimmer lives in House 1 (but we already know the golfer lives in House 1, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the swimmer must live in House 2, and the romance book lover must live in House 3.

   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 3: Mystery book reader (since the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff)
   - House 4: History book buff

4. **Clue 2**: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

5. **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This is consistent with our previous findings.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing loafers.
4. **Clue 4:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover.

From Clue 3, we know the mystery book reader lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

Now, let's use the other clues to determine the remaining houses:

- **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person wearing high heels must live in either the first, third, or fourth house.
- **Clue 4:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. Therefore, the person wearing high heels must live in either the first or third house.
- **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers. This means the history book buff cannot live in the first house, and the person who is wearing loafers cannot live in the fourth house.
- **Clue 5:** The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses.

Given these constraints, let's try to place the remaining people:

1. The third house is occupied by the mystery book reader.
2. The person wearing high heels cannot be in the second or fourth house, so they must be in the first or third house. Since the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the person wearing high heels must be in the first house.
3. The person wearing high heels (first house) and the person wearing loafers (second house) must be to the right of each other. This means the person wearing loafers must be in the fourth house.
4. The person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses. Since the first and fourth houses are occupied, the only remaining houses are the second and third. The person wearing sandals must be in the second house, and the romance book lover must be in the fourth house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person wearing high heels
- Second house: Person wearing sandals
- Third house: Mystery book reader
- Fourth house: Person wearing loafers

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the person who likes yellow. Since they cannot be in house 2, they must be in either house 1 or house 3.

### Case 1: The person who likes yellow is in house 1.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 1, then the person who likes green must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a gameboy must be in house 3 (since they are neighbors with the person who likes green).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Therefore, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1.

### Case 2: The person who likes yellow is in house 3.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 3, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person who likes green (in house 1) is directly left of the person who has a gameboy (in house 2).
- The person who has a gameboy (in house 2) is directly left of the person who has a computer (in house 2).
- The person who likes yellow (in house 3) is not in the second house.

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

1. **Clue 1:** There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
6. **Clue 6:** The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, the root beer lover lives in the third house. This means the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the root beer lover and the person who likes red are in the same house, which contradicts Clue 5. Therefore, Clue 5 must be incorrect, and the root beer lover does not live in the third house. This means the root beer lover must live in one of the other houses.

From Clue 8, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house. So, the tea drinker must live in either the first, third, or fourth house.

Let's place the tea drinker in the first or fourth house. If the tea drinker is in the first house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the second and fourth houses, respectively. This leaves the green drinker and the yellow drinker for the second and fourth houses, but the green drinker cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 2). So, the green drinker must be in the second house, and the yellow drinker must be in the fourth house.

This leaves the red drinker and the coffee drinker for the first and fourth houses. Since the red drinker is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house numbers:

1. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (House 1).**
2. **The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house (House 1).** Therefore, the fish enthusiast must live in House 2.
3. **The person who had pizza does not live in the first house (House 1).** Therefore, the person who had pizza must live in House 2.
4. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.** Since the fish enthusiast (who likes green) lives in House 2, the person who has a radio must live in House 1.

From these deductions:
- **House 1:** Fantasy book enthusiast, person who likes green, and person who had pizza.
- **House 2:** Fish enthusiast, person who has a radio, and person who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who had pizza (in House 2) and the person who likes green (in House 2) are already determined, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person who has a radio (in House 1) must have a phone (since the radio is the only other device).
- The person who ate spaghetti (in House 2) must have a radio (since the radio is already taken by the person in House 1).
- The person who is a cat lover must be in House 1 (since the fish enthusiast is in House 2).

Therefore, the person who is a cat lover lives in House 1.

The number of the house where the cat lover lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Based on the given clues and the logical deductions made, the person who only drinks water lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The flutist lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
9. **Clue 10:** The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
11. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
12. **Clue 13:** The cat lover lives in the first house.

From Clue 8, we know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house, we can write:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis

From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From Clue 11, the person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person who is eating oranges must live in either house 1, 3, or 4.

From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must live in either house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 5, the flutist lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person eating kiwis.

From Clue 6, the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 7, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2 or 4.

From Clue 13, the cat lover lives in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person eating kiwis, the cat lover must be the person eating kiwis, which contradicts Clue 13. Therefore, the cat lover must be in a different house.

Let's summarize the constraints:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis
- House 2: Person drinking water
- House 3: Person drinking milk
- House 4: Person drinking root beer

From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 11, the person who is eating oranges must live in either house 3 or 4.

From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water must live in either house 2 or 4.

Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2. The person who only drinks water must live in house 2, and the person who likes milk must live in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is eating oranges must live in house 4.

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Rose bouquet and grilled cheese are adjacent.**
2. **Oranges and apples are adjacent.**
3. **Tulips are not in house 5.**
4. **Grilled cheese and stew are adjacent.**
5. **Daffodils are not in house 5.**
6. **Pizza is directly left of grilled cheese.**
7. **Grilled cheese is to the right of spaghetti.**
8. **Grilled cheese and tulips are adjacent.**
9. **There are two houses between where the person who eats oranges lives and where the person who eats kiwis lives.**
10. **Oranges are to the right of carnations.**
11. **Apples are to the left of mangos.**

Let's deduce step by step:

- From Clue 6 and Clue 4, grilled cheese and pizza must be in houses 1 and 2.
- From Clue 8 and Clue 4, grilled cheese and tulips must be in houses 1 and 2.
- From Clue 7 and Clue 4, grilled cheese and spaghetti must be in houses 1 and 2.
- From Clue 4, grilled cheese and stew must be in houses 1 and 2.

Given these constraints, the only possible arrangement for grilled cheese and pizza, grilled cheese and tulips, grilled cheese and spaghetti, and grilled cheese and stew is in houses 1 and 2.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Stew
- House 5: Tulips

The person who had stew lives in house 4.

Thus, the correct answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues and logical deductions, let's re-evaluate the placement of each person and their pets:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the dog owner lives in house \(X\), the tulip owner lives in house \(X-1\).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - This means the daffodils owner cannot live in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
   - This means if the horse owner lives in house \(X\), the carnations owner lives in house \(X+1\) or \(X-1\).

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the horse owner lives in house \(X\), the lilies owner lives in house \(X+1\) or higher.

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the cat lover lives in house 1.

Given the cat lover lives in house 1, we can start filling in the houses:

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Daffodils (from Clue 2)
- House 3: Horse (from Clue 4, since the lilies owner must be to the right of the horse owner)
- House 4: Dog (from Clue 1, since the tulip owner must be to the left of the dog owner)
- House 5: Fish (remaining pet)

Now, let's verify the remaining clues:

- **Clue 1:** The tulip owner lives in house 4, and the dog owner lives in house 5.
- **Clue 2:** The daffodils owner lives in house 2.
- **Clue 3:** The horse owner lives in house 3, and the carnations owner lives in house 4 (which is consistent with the dog owner living in house 5).
- **Clue 4:** The lilies owner lives in house 4 (which is consistent with the dog owner living in house 5).
- **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in house 1.

Thus, the fish enthusiast must live in house 5.

However, since the options provided are (A) 2, (B) 3, (C) 1, (D) 4, and house 5 is not an option, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or a typo in the options. Based on the given clues and logical deductions, the correct answer should be house 5.

Given the options, the closest correct answer is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their house numbers step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 has a phone.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 does not wear boots.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person with horses lives in house 1 and the person with a radio lives in house 2, or vice versa.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Has a phone.

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Does not wear boots.

From Clue 3, we know:
- House 1: Owns horses or has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots and has a phone.

Since the person in house 1 has a phone (Clue 1), the person in house 2 must be wearing boots (since the person in house 2 does not wear boots). Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels.

Now, let's determine the pets and devices:
- House 1: Owns horses or has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots and has a phone.

Since the person in house 1 cannot have a phone (because the person in house 1 has a phone), the person in house 1 must own horses. The person in house 2 must have a radio.

So, the characteristics are:
- House 1: Owns horses, wears high heels, has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots, has a phone.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the constraints and clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

1. **Grilled Cheese and Computer**: The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
2. **Grilled Cheese in Third House**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
3. **Apples in First House**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the first house.
4. **Apples and Boots**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the first house, and the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
5. **Blue and Phone**: There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives.
6. **Loafers and Computer**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house, and the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
7. **Pizza in Second House**: The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.
8. **Mangos and Yellow**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
9. **Computer and Phone**: The person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
10. **Grilled Cheese and Computer**: The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.

Let's start by placing the person who had pizza. Since they do not live in the second house, they must live in the first or third house.

### Step-by-Step Deduction

1. **Grilled Cheese and Computer**: Since grilled cheese and computer are next to each other, and grilled cheese cannot be in the third house, the possible pairs are:
   - First house: Grilled Cheese, Computer
   - Second house: Grilled Cheese, Computer
   - Third house: Grilled Cheese, Computer

2. **Grilled Cheese in Third House**: Eliminate the first and second house options for grilled cheese.

3. **Apples in First House**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the first house, so they must live in the second or third house.

4. **Apples and Boots**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. If the person who is eating apples lives in the second house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house. If the person who is eating apples lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.

5. **Blue and Phone**: There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives. This means the person who likes blue and the person who has a phone must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4.

6. **Loafers and Computer**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house, and the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. This means the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first or second house.

7. **Mangos and Yellow**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes yellow must live in the house to the right of the person who is eating mangos.

8. **Computer and Phone**: The person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone. This means the person who has a computer must live in the first house, and the person who has a phone must live in the third house.

### Final Placement

- **First House**: Boots, Mangos, Yellow
- **Second House**: Grilled Cheese, Computer, Pizza
- **Third House**: Apples, Loafers, Blue

Therefore, the person who likes green must live in the **first house**.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of the people and their characteristics.

### Clues Recap:
1. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
3. The baseball player lives in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Step 1: Identify the baseball player
From clue 3, the baseball player lives in the second house. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

#### Step 2: Identify the basketball player
From clue 1, the basketball player does not live in the first house. From clue 2, the basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Therefore, the basketball player must be in either House 1 or House 2. Since the baseball player is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

#### Step 3: Identify the swimmer
From clue 2, the basketball player (House 1) lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the basketball player is in House 1, the swimmer must be in House 2 or House 3. But since the baseball player is already in House 2, the swimmer must be in House 3. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

#### Step 4: Identify the tennis player and cat lover
From clue 6, the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the baseball player is in House 2 and the swimmer is in House 3, the tennis player must be in House 3 and the cat lover must be in House 4. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cat lover

#### Step 5: Identify the fish enthusiast and bird keeper
From clue 4, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 4, the dog owner must be in House 3. So, the fish enthusiast must be in House 4. This leaves the bird keeper to be in House 1. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Bird keeper
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cat lover

### Conclusion:
The bird keeper lives in House 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (D) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **White and Computer:**
   - The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - This means the computer owner cannot be in the first house, and the white lover cannot be in the first house either.

2. **Baseball Player and Blue:**
   - There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
   - This means the baseball player and the person who likes blue must be in houses 2 and 3, with the baseball player in house 2 and the person who likes blue in house 3.

3. **Sedan and SUV:**
   - The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the sedan owner and the SUV owner must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Sedan and Gameboy:**
   - The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
   - This means the sedan owner and the gameboy owner must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

5. **Violinist and First House:**
   - The violinist does not live in the first house.
   - This means the violinist must live in either house 2 or 3.

6. **Guitarist and White:**
   - The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the guitarist must live in a house to the right of the white lover.

### Deduction

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Person who likes blue

From clue 1, we know:
- The computer owner cannot be in house 1, and the white lover cannot be in house 1.

From clue 3, we know:
- The sedan and SUV owners must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 4, we know:
- The sedan and gameboy owners must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 5, we know:
- The violinist cannot be in house 1.

From clue 6, we know:
- The guitarist must be to the right of the white lover.

### Combining Clues

Let's place the known elements:

- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Person who likes blue

Now, let's place the sedan and SUV:
- If the sedan is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (but house 2 is already taken by the baseball player).
- Therefore, the sedan must be in house 2, and the SUV must be in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 3 for the person who likes blue.

Now, we need to place the violinist and the white lover:
- The violinist cannot be in house 1, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3.
- The white lover must be in house 1 or 3.

Since the white lover cannot be in house 1 (because the computer owner is there), the white lover must be in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 2 for the sedan owner.

Now, we need to place the guitarist and the gameboy:
- The guitarist must be to the right of the white lover (house 3), so the guitarist must be in house 3.
- The gameboy must be next to the sedan owner (house 2).

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 3 for the person who likes blue.

### Final Arrangement

- House 1: Computer owner
- House 2: Sedan owner
- House 3: Person who likes blue

The remaining characteristics:
- The white lover is in house 3.
- The guitar is in house 3.
- The gameboy is in house 2.
- The violinist is in house 2.
- The baseball player is in house 2.
- The soccer player is in house 1.

Thus, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house and is directly left of the person who had fried rice. Therefore, the person who had fried rice must live in the second house.

From Clue 2, the cat lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza must live next to each other. Since the cat lover is in the third house, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza must be in the first and second houses. Given that the person who ate grilled cheese is in the first house, the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

From Clue 10, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who had fried rice is in the second house, the person who had stew must be in the fourth or fifth house, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house.

From Clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the person who has a television must be in the fourth or fifth house, the bird keeper must be in the first or second house. Given that the person who had pizza is in the second house, the bird keeper must be in the first house.

From Clue 7, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the bird keeper is in the first house, the person who has a television must be in the third or fourth house. Since the cat lover is in the third house, the person who has a television must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 9, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the third house, the person who had stew must be in the fourth or fifth house. Since the person who has a television is in the fourth house, the person who had stew must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Cat lover
- House 4: Person who had stew
- House 5: Person who had fried rice

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."

3. **Pianist and person wearing high heels live directly next to each other.**
4. **Person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
5. **Person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.**
6. **Person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.**
7. **Person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.**

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Next, we need to place the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis next to each other, and the person eating kiwis must be to the left of the person wearing boots.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, we need to place the person wearing high heels and the person with a radio next to each other, and the person eating oranges must be directly left of the person with a television.

- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Finally, we need to place the person with a television directly left of the person with a radio.

- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Thus, the person with a television lives in house 8.

The correct answer is (A) 8."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses.

1. **The tea drinker does not live in the first house.**
2. **The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.**
3. **The person who likes red does not live in the third house.**
4. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.**
5. **The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.**
6. **There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.**
7. **The person who likes milk lives in the third house.**
8. **The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.**

12. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
13. **The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.**

From Clue 7, we know the person who likes milk lives in the third house. Let's denote this as:

- House 3: Milk drinker

From Clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives in the third house. This is a contradiction since the milk drinker is already in the third house. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the setup.

Let's assume the person who is eating apples lives in the second house:

### Deductions

- House 5: Blue
- House 4: White
- House 1: SUV (since it cannot be in the first house)
- House 2: Running shoes (since it cannot be in the first house and there are two houses between sedan and running shoes)
- House 3: Green (since it cannot be in the first house and there is one house between green and truck)

Now, we need to place the remaining elements:

- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the history book buff:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - This means the history book buff lives in house number 1.

2. There is one house between where the person who had stew lives and where the history book buff lives.
   - Since the history book buff lives in house number 1, the person who had stew must live in either house number 2 or 3.
   - The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house, so the person who had stew cannot live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the person who had stew must live in house number 3.

3. There is one house between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who had stew lives.
   - The person who had stew lives in house number 3.
   - There must be one house between the person who had pizza and the person who had stew.

"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - This directly places the person wearing running shoes in house number 1.

2. **Clue 6:** The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - This places the person who owns an SUV in house number 4.

3. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person wearing running shoes is in house 1, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the sandals wearer and the convertible driver must be adjacent. Given the remaining houses (3 and 5), the sandals wearer must be in house 3, and the convertible driver must be in house 5.

5. **Clue 2:** The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.
   - Since the third house is occupied by the sandals wearer, the person who owns a sedan must be in either house 1, 2, 4, or 5. Given that house 1 is occupied by the running shoes wearer and house 2 by the boots wearer, the sedan owner must be in house 4 or 5. But house 4 is occupied by the SUV owner, so the sedan owner must be in house 5.

6. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - Given the remaining houses (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), and knowing the positions of the running shoes wearer (1), boots wearer (2), sandals wearer (3), and convertible driver (5), the minivan driver must be in house 2, and the high heels wearer must be in house 3.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: High heels, Sandals
- House 4: SUV
- House 5: Convertible, Sedan

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Cricketer lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Cricketer

2. **The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - This means the sedan owner and the cat lover are not in adjacent houses.

3. **The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - This means the sedan owner and the horse owner are adjacent.

4. **The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.**

Let's place the people in the houses:

- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: (S, C, H, T)
- House 3: (S, C, H, T)

Since the cricketer is in house 1, the sedan owner (S) and the horse owner (H) must be in houses 2 and 3. Also, the cat lover (C) must be in a house adjacent to the sedan owner (S) or the horse owner (H).

Let's try placing the sedan owner (S) and the horse owner (H) in houses 2 and 3:

- House 2: S (sedan owner)
- House 3: H (horse owner)

This leaves the cat lover (C) and the truck driver (T) to be placed in houses 2 and 3. Since the cat lover (C) must be adjacent to the sedan owner (S), and the horse owner (H) is already in house 3, the cat lover (C) must be in house 2. This leaves the truck driver (T) to be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Cat lover (C)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)

Since the truck driver (T) lives in house 3, the basketball player (B) must live in house 2.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

8. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing running shoes in the second house (Clue 7).

- **House 2:** Running shoes

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- **House 3:** Milk drinker

Now, the person who is wearing running shoes (House 2) and the person who likes milk (House 3) are placed. We need to place the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice next to each other (Clue 1).

- **House 1:** Root beer lover
- **House 4:** Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

- **House 1:** Root beer lover
- **House 2:** Running shoes
- **House 3:** Milk drinker
- **House 4:** Fried rice eater

The only remaining houses are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who drives a convertible and the person who only drinks water next to each other (Clue 8).

- **House 1:** Root beer lover
- **House 2:** Running shoes
- **House 3:** Milk drinker
- **House 4:** Fried rice eater

Since the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), we can place them as follows:

- **House 1:** Root beer lover
- **House 2:** Running shoes
- **House 3:** Milk drinker
- **House 4:** Fried rice eater

The only remaining house is 2, and it must be the person who drives a convertible, and the house to the left of it must be the person who only drinks water.

- **House 2:** Convertible driver
- **House 3:** Milk drinker
- **House 4:** Fried rice eater

Finally, we need to place the person who is wearing high heels and the person who owns an SUV (Clue 3 and Clue 5).

- **House 1:** Root beer lover
- **House 2:** Convertible driver
- **House 3:** Milk drinker
- **House 4:** Fried rice eater

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3), so the only remaining house for the high heels wearer is House 1.

- **House 1:** High heels wearer
- **House 2:** Convertible driver
- **House 3:** Milk drinker
- **House 4:** Fried rice eater

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

- **House 1:** High heels wearer
- **House 2:** Convertible driver
- **House 3:** SUV owner
- **House 4:** Fried rice eater

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- **House 1:** High heels wearer
- **House 2:** Only drinks water
- **House 3:** SUV owner
- **House 4:** Fried rice eater

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

- **House 1:** High heels wearer
- **House 2:** Only drinks water
- **House 3:** SUV owner
- **House 4:** Sedan owner

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

- **House 3 (Root beer lover):** Root beer lover.
- **House 2 (Swimmer):** The swimmer must be to the left of the sedan owner, and the sedan owner must be to the left of the truck driver. Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the swimmer must be in house 2.

- **House 2 (Swimmer):** The swimmer lives in house 2.
- **House 1 (Swimmer):** The swimmer lives in house 1.

- **House 1 (Swimmer):** The swimmer lives in house 1.
- **House 3 (Root beer lover):** The root beer lover lives in house 3.
- **House 4 (Minivan driver):** The minivan driver lives in house 4.

   - If the person who likes red is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either house 2 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

Since the person who likes white cannot live in house 3 (Clue 3), the person who likes white must live in house 1.

This leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the placement of each person:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.
   - This directly tells us that the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

2. **Clue 2**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - If the SUV owner is in house 3, the person in house 2 must be the mystery book reader, and the person in house 1 must be the person who drives a convertible.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - Since the SUV owner is in house 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1 or 2. But house 1 is already taken by the person who drives a convertible, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - The person who drives a convertible is in house 1, so the person who is eating mangos must be in house 2.

5. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - The person who drives a minivan must be in house 2 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible), and the dog owner must be in house 3.

6. **Clue 7**: There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
   - The person who is eating oranges must be in house 4 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible, house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, and house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV). The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 4. Since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, the bird keeper must be in house 4.

7. **Clue 8**: The bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The bird keeper is in house 4, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. But house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to recheck the placement.

8. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a minivan and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - The person who drives a minivan is in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1 or house 3. Since house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, the history book buff must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker must be in a house with a lower number than the person eating kiwis. Since the tea drinker is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 or 2. Given the television is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but that's occupied by the rose bouquet). Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in house 1, and the person eating kiwis must be in house 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - This confirms that the television is in house 1 and the guitarist is in house 3.

5. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.

1. **Clue 7**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
   - Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast.

2. **Clue 6**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.

   - Therefore, the person eating apples must live in either the first or the fourth house.

4. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the mangos and sandals must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 3**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the apples and sandals must be in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 2**: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

7. **Clue 1**: The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the history book buff must live in the second house.

8. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the person eating a banana must live in either the fourth or the fifth house. But since there are only 4 houses, the person eating a banana must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- Second house: History book buff.
- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic (from Clue 2 and Clue 6).
- First house: Person eating mangos (from Clue 5 and Clue 3).
- Fourth house: Person eating a banana (from Clue 8).
- Fifth house: Person eating apples (from Clue 4 and Clue 3).

Since the person eating apples must live in either the first or the fourth house, and the fourth house is already occupied by the science fiction book fanatic, the person eating apples must live in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person eating mangos
- Second house: History book buff
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast
- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic
- Fifth house: Person eating a banana

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the sedan owner cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), the sedan owner must be in house 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3. But house 3 is occupied by the root beer lover, so the sedan owner must be in house 1, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

From Clue 8, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the person who is eating apples must be in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils, so this is a contradiction. Let's recheck the sedan owner and the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 6, the cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. This means the cellist and saxophonist must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the cellist must be in house 1, and the saxophonist must be in house 2.

From Clue 9, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the person who is eating apples is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.

From Clue 7, the person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover

The violinist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the violinist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person wearing loafers step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Yellow

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person wearing boots cannot be in house 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
   - This means the fish enthusiast and the person with a phone must be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the person with a television and the person who ate fried rice must be in adjacent houses, but the television must be to the left of the fried rice.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not white

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the person wearing sandals and the person with a gameboy must be in adjacent houses, but the sandals must be to the left of the gameboy.

7. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4 or 4 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 2 and 4).

8. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not stew

9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover.
   - This means the person wearing loafers and the cat lover must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Grilled cheese

11. **Clue 11:** The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner.
    - This means the cat lover and the dog owner must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 (but since the cat lover is already in house 4 or 5, the dog owner must be in house 1 or 2).

12. **Clue 12:** The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
    - House 2: High heels

13. **Clue 13:** The person who likes red does not live in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Not red

14. **Clue 14:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
    - This means the person with a gameboy and the person wearing loafers must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

15. **Clue 15:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
    - This means the fish enthusiast and the person with a radio must be in adjacent houses, but the fish enthusiast must be to the left of the radio.

16. **Clue 16:** The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television.
    - This means the person who owns horses and the person with a television must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 (but since the person with a television is already in house 2, the person who owns horses must be in house 1).

17. **Clue 17:** The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.
    - House 4: Blue

18. **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
    - House 3: Not boots

19. **Clue 19:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
    - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes white must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Not boots, not yellow, not stew
- House 4: Blue, loafers, not white
- House 5: Grilled cheese, not red, not stew
- House 6: Not white, not red, not stew

Since the person who likes blue lives in house 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 5 (since the loafers must be to the right of the cat lover, and the cat lover must be in house 1 or 2, but house 2 is already occupied by high heels).

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5.

The answer is (E) 5."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person who has a television lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the person in the first house (house 1) has a television. Therefore, the person in the second house (house 2) must have the computer.

From clue 1, the person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house. This means the person in the first house (house 1) has a rose bouquet, and the person in the second house (house 2) has a bouquet of lilies.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the constraints and analyzing the clues step-by-step, we can deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses as follows:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic (SFF) lives somewhere to the left of the golfer (Golfer). This means SFF is in House 1 and Golfer is in House 2.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (PE) and the history book buff (HBB) live directly next to each other. Since SFF is in House 1, PE and HBB must be in House 1 and House 2.
3. **Clue 3:** The guitarist (G) lives somewhere to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils (D). Since Golfer is in House 2, G and D must be in House 1 and House 2.

From Clue 1, we know SFF is in House 1 and Golfer is in House 2. From Clue 2, PE and HBB must be in adjacent houses, and since SFF is in House 1, PE and HBB must be in House 1 and House 2. From Clue 3, G and D must be in adjacent houses, and since Golfer is in House 2, G and D must be in House 1 and House 2.

Given these constraints, the only feasible arrangement is:
- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff), G (golfer), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)

Since the golfer is in House 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2, this arrangement is not possible because the golfer cannot be in House 2 if the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2.

Therefore, the only feasible arrangement is:
- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff)

Given this arrangement, the percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1 because the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) are in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

Final answer: (B) 1"

2. **House 2: Phone**
3. **House 3: Television**
4. **House 4: Violinist**
5. **House 5: Bird keeper**

"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
4. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house.

From Clue 3, we know that the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1. Let's denote the houses as follows:
- House 1: Lilies
- House 2: Unknown

From Clue 4, the basketball player cannot live in house 1. Therefore, the basketball player must live in house 2.

Now, let's consider Clue 1 and Clue 2 together. Since the person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples and also to the right of the violinist, the person eating apples must be to the left of the violinist. This means the person eating apples must live in house 1, and the violinist must live in house 2.

To summarize:
- House 1: Lilies (person with the bouquet of lilies)
- House 2: Unknown (person eating apples, violinist, or basketball player)

Since the basketball player cannot be in house 1, and the violinist must be in house 2, the violinist must live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is **2**.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct house for the cricketer:

1. **Tennis player lives in the 3rd house.**
2. **Grilled cheese lives in the 5th house.**
3. **Golfer lives in the 4th house.**
4. **There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.**
5. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.**
6. **The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
7. **The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.**

Let's start by placing the known individuals:

- Tennis player: 3rd house
- Grilled cheese: 5th house
- Golfer: 4th house

This leaves us with the 1st, 2nd, and 5th houses for the remaining individuals (Stew, Spaghetti, Pizza, Cricketer).

From clue 6, the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means if Stew is in the 1st house, Spaghetti must be in the 2nd house, and vice versa.

From clue 5, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must be in a house to the right of the pizza eater.

From clue 7, the tennis player (3rd house) lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player. Since the tennis player is already in the 3rd house, the soccer player must be in a house to the left of the 3rd house, which means the soccer player must be in the 1st or 2nd house.

Let's test the possible placements:

- If Stew is in the 1st house, then Spaghetti must be in the 2nd house.
- If Pizza is to the left of the cricketer, and considering the remaining houses (1st, 2nd, 5th), the only logical placement for the cricketer is the 2nd house.

Thus, the cricketer lives in the 2nd house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding houses step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house (house 2).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - Since the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water must live in house 1.

From these deductions:
- **House 1:** 
  - Person who only drinks water
  - Person who likes white
  - Person who ate spaghetti (lives in house 2)
  
- **House 2:** 
  - Person who only drinks water (lives in house 1)
  - Person who ate spaghetti (lives in house 2)
  - Person who likes red (lives in house 2)
  - Person who plays baseball (lives in house 1)
  - Person who wears loafers (lives in house 2)

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 2.

The correct answer is **(A) 2**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as A, B, and C, corresponding to the houses 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

- **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house (house 2). Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either house 1 or house 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house (house 2). Therefore, the person eating oranges must live in either house 1 or house 3.
- **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. This means if the root beer lover is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3. If the root beer lover is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
- **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. This means if the coffee drinker is in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 3. If the coffee drinker is in house 3, the person eating mangos must be in house 1.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 3.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 3).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 2).

This configuration does not work because the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2.

- If the root beer lover is in house 3:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 1).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 1).

This configuration works because:
- The root beer lover is in house 3.
- The person who only drinks water is in house 1.
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating mangos is in house 1 (since the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the only remaining fruit is mangos).

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person and their characteristics:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Now, we know:
- House 1: Spaghetti eater
- House 2: Boots wearer
- House 3: Fried rice eater

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

2. **Root beer lover in the fifth house**: House 5: Root beer lover
3. **Person wearing sandals not in the second house**: House 2: Not sandals
4. **Coffee drinker and rose bouquet next to each other**: Houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the coffee drinker and rose bouquet must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
5. **Bird keeper and running shoes next to each other**: Houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the bird keeper and running shoes must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
6. **One house between daffodils and lilies**: Houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the daffodils and lilies must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
7. **One house between horses and lilies**: Houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horses and lilies must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
8. **Carnations arrangement and bird keeper directly next to each other**: Houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the bird keeper is directly left of the person wearing loafers, the bird keeper and carnations arrangement must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
9. **Tulips and dog owner directly next to each other**: Houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the tulips must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
10. **Two houses between water drinker and boots**: Houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the root beer lover is in house 5, the water drinker and boots must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
11. **Water drinker and milk drinker directly next to each other**: Houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the root beer lover is in house 5, the water drinker and milk drinker must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

### Deductions:
- From clue 1, the dog owner is in house 3.
- From clue 2, the root beer lover is in house 5.
- From clue 3, the person wearing sandals is not in house 2.
- From clue 4, the coffee drinker and rose bouquet are next to each other.
- From clue 5, the bird keeper and running shoes are next to each other.
- From clue 6, the daffodils and lilies are one house apart.
- From clue 7, the horses and lilies are one house apart.
- From clue 8, the bird keeper and carnations arrangement are next to each other.
- From clue 9, the tulips and dog owner are next to each other.
- From clue 10, the water drinker and boots are two houses apart.
- From clue 11, the water drinker and milk drinker are next to each other.

### Final Deduction:
- Since the root beer lover is in house 5, the water drinker and boots must be in houses 1 or 2.
- Since the water drinker and milk drinker are next to each other, and the water drinker is not in house 5, the water drinker and milk drinker must be in houses 1 and 2.
- The person wearing sandals is not in house 2, so the person wearing sandals must be in house 1.
- The coffee drinker and rose bouquet are next to each other, and the coffee drinker is not in house 5, so the coffee drinker and rose bouquet must be in houses 1 or 2.
- Since the water drinker and milk drinker are in houses 1 and 2, the coffee drinker and rose bouquet must be in house 2.
- The person with daffodils and the person with lilies are one house apart, so the person with lilies must be in house 3.
- The person with horses and the person with lilies are one house apart, so the person with horses must be in house 4.
- The bird keeper and the person with tulips are next to each other, and the bird keeper is directly left of the person with loafers, so the bird keeper must be in house 1 and the person with tulips must be in house 2.
- The person with running shoes and the bird keeper are next to each other, so the person with running shoes must be in house 2.
- The person with running shoes is in house 2, so the person with running shoes and the person with loafers must be in houses 1 and 2, but since the person with running shoes is in house 2, the person with loafers must be in house 1.
- The person with running shoes is in house 2, so the person with running shoes and the person with loafers must be in houses 1 and 2, but since the person with running shoes is in house 2, the person with loafers must be in house 1.

Thus, the person with lilies lives in house 3.

The answer is (D) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The tennis player does not live in the first house.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The person who likes mystery books lives in house 1.
- The person who likes fantasy books must live in house 2 because the tennis player lives in house 2 and the tennis player plays tennis.

Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions, let's analyze the information step by step to determine the correct house number where the person who likes white lives.

1. **Person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
2. **Person who likes white cannot be in the first house (house 1).**
3. **Person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.**
4. **Person who likes white lives in one of the other three houses (houses 1, 2, or 3).**

From clue 3, we know the person who likes white lives in either house 2 or house 3.

Let's consider the possible placements for the person who likes white:

- If the person who likes white is in house 2, then the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1.
- If the person who likes white is in house 3, then the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

Now, let's check the constraints for each scenario:

### Scenario 1: Person who likes white in house 2
- Person who is wearing running shoes in house 1.
- Person who likes white (house 2) is to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes (house 1).

This scenario is consistent with the given clues. No other constraints conflict with this placement.

### Scenario 2: Person who likes white in house 3
- Person who is wearing running shoes in house 2.

From Clue 1, grilled cheese and pizza are adjacent, so grilled cheese must be in house 4. From Clue 2, cat lover and fish enthusiast are adjacent, so cat lover must be in house 1. From Clue 6, two houses between spaghetti and bird keeper, and from Clue 11, bird keeper must be in house 5, so spaghetti must be in house 1. From Clue 14, one house between dog owner and person eating kiwis, and from Clue 11, bird keeper is in house 5, so dog owner must be in house 4, and kiwis must be in house 3. This leaves house 1 for the person eating grapes.

Thus, the person eating grapes lives in house 1.

The answer is (E) 1."

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person eating grapes must live in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The baseball player lives in the second house.
   - Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person eating grapes must also live in the second house. This is consistent with Clue 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - Since the person eating grapes lives in the second house, the person driving a convertible must also live in the second house.

From these clues, we can conclude:
- The person eating grapes lives in the second house.
- The person driving a convertible lives in the second house.
- The person eating mangos must live in the first house (since the person eating grapes lives in the second house and the person driving a convertible lives in the second house).

Therefore, the person eating mangos lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes blue is in house number 2.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in house 2, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 3. But since the person who likes blue is to the left of the person who is eating kiwis, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person who is eating apples is in house 1 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3. But we already know the person who likes blue is in house 2, so the person who is eating oranges must be in house 3.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since the person who likes blue is in house 2 and the person who likes white must be in house 3).
   - Therefore, the person who likes white must be in house 3.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the location of the person who has a rose bouquet:

1. **Clue 1**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
   - This means if the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the root beer lover must be in house 2.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 3 (but there is no house 3, so this is not possible).

2. **Clue 2**: The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the soccer player and the mystery book reader must be in adjacent houses, with the soccer player in house 1 and the mystery book reader in house 2, or vice versa.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the person with the gameboy must be in house 1, and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person with the gameboy is in house 1.
- The mystery book reader is in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The soccer player is in house 1 (since the mystery book reader is in house 2).

From Clue 1, we know:
- The root beer lover must be in house 2 (since the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the root beer lover is to the right of the person with the rose bouquet).

So, we have:
- House 1: Soccer player, Gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Root beer, Rose bouquet

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the people as Cat Lover, Fish Enthusiast, Horse Owner, and Dog Owner.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**From Clue 4:**
- The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
- This means the fish enthusiast and the dog owner must be in adjacent houses.

**From Clue 2:**
- There are two houses between the truck and the dog owner.
- This means the truck and the dog owner cannot be in the first or last house. They must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

**From Clue 3:**
- The truck lives directly left of the sedan.
- This means the truck and the sedan must be in adjacent houses.

**From Clue 1:**
- The minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
- This means the minivan cannot be in the first house.

**From Clue 5:**
- The cat lover does not live in the second house.
- This means the cat lover must live in either the first or the fourth house.

### Combining Clues:

Let's test the possible positions for the dog owner and the truck:

1. **Dog owner in house 3:**
   - Truck must be in house 2 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
   - This leaves house 4 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 2 and the dog owner is in house 3).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration works:
   - House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
   - House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
   - House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
   - House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

2. **Dog owner in house 4:**
   - Truck must be in house 3 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
   - This leaves house 2 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 3 and the dog owner is in house 4).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 5).

Therefore, the only valid configuration is:
- House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
- House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
- House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
- House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - This means the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

2. **Clue 4**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the person who likes white must be in a house number greater than the house number of the person who only drinks water.

3. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person who likes root beer.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in a house number greater than 3.

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3.

Given these constraints, let's place the people in the houses:
- House 1: Only drinks water (let's call this person ""W"")
- House 2: Likes root beer (let's call this person ""R"")
- House 3: Likes yellow (let's call this person ""Y"")
- House 4: Likes blue (let's call this person ""B"")

Since the person who likes blue (B) must be in a house number greater than 3, and the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3, the only possible house for the person who likes blue is House 4.

Thus, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"To determine the house where the bird keeper lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house (house 2).
2. **Clue 1**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
3. **Clue 2**: The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
4. **Clue 3**: The person eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
5. **Clue 4**: The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
6. **Clue 5**: The person wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
7. **Clue 7**: The person wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes.

Given Clue 6, we know:
- House 2: Person who likes blue.

Given Clue 5, the person wearing sandals must be in house 3 (since house 2 is taken by the person who likes blue).

Given Clue 4, the dog owner must be in house 1 (since house 2 is taken by the person who likes blue and house 3 is taken by the person wearing sandals).

Given Clue 2, the baseball player must be in house 1 (since house 1 is taken by the dog owner).

Given Clue 3, the person eating grapes must be in house 3 (since house 2 is taken by the person who likes blue and house 1 is taken by the baseball player).

Given Clue 1, the cricketer must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals).

Given Clue 7, the person wearing loafers must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals).

Thus, the bird keeper must be in house 1, as it is the only remaining house.

The bird keeper lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's deduce the correct placement of each person based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who owns horses lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 10:** The dog owner lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 12:** The coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 13:** The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 14:** The tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper.
6. **Clue 18:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice.

From Clue 2, the first house is occupied by the person who owns horses.

From Clue 10, the fourth house is occupied by the dog owner.

From Clue 12, the fifth house is occupied by the coffee drinker.

From Clue 13, the fourth house is occupied by the cricketer.

From Clue 14, the tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper must be in the third house, and the tennis player must be in the second house.

From Clue 18, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice. Since the cricketer is in the fourth house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house, and the person who had stew must be in the fifth house.

Now, we have:
- First house: Person who owns horses
- Second house: Tennis player
- Third house: Person who ate fried rice
- Fourth house: Cricketer
- Fifth house: Coffee drinker

The remaining houses (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are occupied by the pianist, flutist, guitarist, cellist, and the person who ate spaghetti. We need to place the remaining people based on the other clues.

From Clue 4, the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the third house, the flutist must be in the fourth house, which is occupied by the cricketer. This is a contradiction, so the flutist must be in the fifth house, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second house.

From Clue 5, there is one house between where the pianist lives and where the bird keeper lives. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the pianist must be in the second house, which is occupied by the flutist. This is a contradiction, so the pianist must be in the first house, and the flutist must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 7, the guitarist does not live in the fifth house. Since the fifth house is occupied by the flutist, the guitarist must be in the fourth house, which is occupied by the cricketer. This is a contradiction, so the guitarist must be in the third house, and the cricketer must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 8, the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. Since the root beer lover is in the first house, the guitarist must be in the second house, which is occupied by the flutist. This is a contradiction, so the guitarist must be in the third house, and the cricketer must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is in the first house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house, which is occupied by the flutist. This is a contradiction, so the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house, and the tea drinker must be in the first house.

From Clue 3, the root beer lover does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who owns horses, the root beer lover must be in the second house, which is occupied by the flutist. This is a contradiction, so the root beer lover must be in the third house, and the tea drinker must be in the first house.

From Clue 1, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in the first house, the bird keeper must be in the second house, which is occupied by the flutist. This is a contradiction, so the bird keeper must be in the third house, and the golfer must be in the first house.

From Clue 16, the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the root beer lover is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house, which is occupied by the cricketer. This is a contradiction, so the person who likes milk must be in the fifth house, and the root beer lover must be in the third house.

From Clue 17, the cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker. Since the coffee drinker is in the fifth house, the cellist must be in the fourth house, which is occupied by the cricketer. This is a contradiction, so the cellist must be in the first house, and the pianist must be in the second house.

From Clue 1, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in the first house, the bird keeper must be in the second house, which is occupied by the flutist. This is a contradiction, so the bird keeper must be in the third house, and the golfer must be in the first house.

From Clue 14, the tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the tennis player must be in the second house, which is occupied by the flutist. This is a contradiction, so the tennis player must be in the first house, and the pianist must be in the second house.

From Clue 1, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in the first house, the bird keeper must be in the second house, which is occupied by the flutist. This is a contradiction, so the bird keeper must be in the third house, and the golfer must be in the first house.

"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the cellist and the person with the gameboy are neighbors, and the cellist is to the left of the person with the gameboy.

2. **Clue 2:** The dog owner does not live in the first house.
   - This means the dog owner must live in the second house.

Let's consider the possible positions for the cellist and the person with the gameboy:

- If the cellist is in house 1, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 2.
- If the cellist is in house 2, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 1.

However, the dog owner cannot be in house 1, so the only possible arrangement is:
- Cellist in house 1
- Gameboy owner in house 2

This leaves house 1 for the dog owner.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **1**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Minivan

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the person with a phone and the person with an SUV must be adjacent, and the phone must be to the left of the SUV.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in house 3, the radio must be in house 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The third house is occupied by the person with a gameboy, so the convertible cannot be in house 3.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The first house is occupied by the person with a minivan, so the computer cannot be in house 1.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Minivan
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Radio

Since the person with a phone must be adjacent to the person with an SUV and the phone must be to the left of the SUV, the only possible arrangement for the phone and SUV is:
- House 2: Phone
- House 4: SUV

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (A) 4."

3. **Root Beer Lover**: The root beer lover does not live in the first house (house 1).
4. **Grapes and Computer**: The person eating grapes lives directly left of the person with the computer.

Given these clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person:

- Since the root beer lover does not live in house 1, they must live in house 2.
- The person eating grapes must live directly left of the person with the computer, so the computer must be in house 1 and the grapes in house 2.
- The person with the radio must live to the left of the person who had pizza, and they must live next to each other.

From the above deductions:
- The person with the radio must be in house 1 (since they must be next to the person with the pizza and the pizza person must be in house 1).
- The person who had pizza must be in house 1.
- The person eating grapes is in house 2.
- The person with the computer is in house 1 (since they must be directly left of the person with the grapes).

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's systematically analyze the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the milk drinker and the spaghetti eater cannot be in adjacent houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the yellow liker cannot be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - This means the white liker and the water drinker must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 5:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the tea drinker (House 1) and the pizza eater (House 2) are adjacent.

From Clue 5, the tea drinker (House 1) and the pizza eater (House 2) are adjacent. Therefore:
- House 2: Pizza eater

From Clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses. Since the pizza eater is in House 2, the white liker and the water drinker must be in House 1 and House 3 or House 2 and House 3. However, since the tea drinker is in House 1, the white liker and the water drinker must be in House 2 and House 3:
- House 2: Pizza eater
- House 3: White liker and Water drinker

From Clue 6, the spaghetti eater must be to the left of the water drinker. Since the water drinker is in House 3, the spaghetti eater must be in House 2, but we already have the pizza eater in House 2. This means the spaghetti eater must be in House 1, which contradicts Clue 1. Therefore, the spaghetti eater must be in House 3, and the water drinker must be in House 2:
- House 1: Spaghetti eater
- House 2: Water drinker

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker must be to the left of the yellow liker. Since the water drinker is in House 2, the coffee drinker must be in House 1, which contradicts Clue 1. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 3, and the yellow liker must be in House 4:
- House 1: Spaghetti eater
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Coffee drinker
- House 4: Yellow liker

From Clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house. Since the green liker cannot be in House 1, the only remaining house is House 4:
- House 1: Spaghetti eater
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Coffee drinker
- House 4: Green liker

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the golfer and the basketball player are adjacent, and the golfer is to the left of the basketball player.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person with lilies and the person who ate grilled cheese are adjacent, and the person with lilies is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

3. **Clue 3:** The soccer player lives in the third house.
   - This means the soccer player lives in house number 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in a house number less than the house number where the person who ate spaghetti lives.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person with tulips does not live in house number 3.

From Clue 3, we know the soccer player lives in house 3. Now, let's consider Clue 1 and Clue 2 together:
- The golfer and the basketball player are adjacent, and the golfer is to the left of the basketball player.
- The person with lilies and the person who ate grilled cheese are adjacent, and the person with lilies is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

Since the soccer player is in house 3, the golfer and the basketball player must be in houses 1 and 2. The person with lilies and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in houses 1 and 2 as well, with the person with lilies to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

Given that the person with lilies cannot be in house 3 (Clue 5), the only possible arrangement for houses 1 and 2 is:
- House 1: Person with lilies
- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese

This leaves house 3 for the soccer player and house 4 for the person who ate spaghetti. The person who ate spaghetti must be to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese, which fits our arrangement.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.

9. **Clue 11:** The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
10. **Clue 12:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 2 and Clue 7, we know:
- The third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice.
- The fourth house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 5, the person who likes green cannot be in the fourth house, so the fourth house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 7, the third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice.

From Clue 4, the person who had stew must be in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must be in the first house (since there are two houses between the person who likes yellow and the person who likes white).

From Clue 8, the person who likes white must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 10, the percussionist and the cellist must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. Since the third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice, the percussionist and the cellist must be in the first and second houses.

From Clue 6, the pianist must be in the fifth house, and the cellist must be in the second house (since the percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other and the pianist must be to the right of the percussionist).

Thus, the only house left for the person who likes green is the fifth house.

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

The answer is (D) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's systematically analyze the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in a house with a lower number than the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the root beer lover lives in a house with a higher number than the person who is wearing sandals.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who is wearing running shoes lives in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew.

   - This means the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2, 3, or 4.

Given Clue 1, we know the tea drinker lives in house 3. Let's place the remaining people:

- House 1: Not grilled cheese (from Clue 7)
- House 2: Not grilled cheese (from Clue 7)
- House 4: Not grilled cheese (from Clue 7)

Since the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1, 2, or 4, the only option left is house 1. So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Tea drinker

Since the person who only drinks water must be in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 4), the only option left for the person who only drinks water is house 4.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Only drinks water

This leaves house 2 for the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 2), the person who had stew must be in house 1, which is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater.

So, the only remaining option for the person who had stew is house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Only drinks water

This leaves house 4 for the person who is wearing running shoes (Clue 5). The person who is wearing running shoes must be in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew (Clue 5), and the only option left is house 4.

Thus, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 4.

From Clue 11, Clue 12, and Clue 5, we know:
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- First house: root beer lover (since the root beer lover does not live in the first house and the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio, the root beer lover must be in the first house)
- Second house: tea drinker (since the tea drinker must be somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk, and the root beer lover is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the second house)
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk (since the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, and the person who is wearing high heels must be in the fifth house)
- Sixth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Sixth house: person who had stew (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the sixth house)
- Seventh house: person who ate fried rice
- Seventh house: person who had stew
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers (since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house, and the third house is occupied by the cricketer, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the eighth house)
- Ninth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Ninth house: person who had stew
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the tenth house)
- Eleventh house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew lives in the ninth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the eleventh house)
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes

From Clue 10, Clue 4, and Clue 8, we know:
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Seventh house: person who ate fried rice
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers
- Ninth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes

From Clue 4, we know the person with the computer lives directly left of the person with the gameboy. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person with the radio lives in the third house, and the person with the loafers lives in the third house, the person with the gameboy must be in the second house, and the person with the computer must be in the first house.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This implies that the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1, and the person who ate fried rice must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who ate pizza and the person who ate fried rice have different characteristics (one is a science fiction book fanatic and one is a history book buff).
   - Since the person who ate fried rice is in house 2, the person who ate pizza must be in house 1.
   - Therefore, the person who ate pizza is the science fiction book fanatic.

From these deductions, it is clear that the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

Thus, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their house number step by step:

1. **The pianist lives in the first house.**
   - This means the pianist lives in house 1.

2. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the root beer lover lives in house 2, and the person who owns horses lives in house 1.

3. **The person who likes white does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person who likes white lives in house 1.

From these clues, we can conclude:
- The pianist lives in house 1.
- The person who owns horses lives in house 1 (since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who owns horses, and the root beer lover is in house 2).
- The person who likes white lives in house 1.
- The root beer lover lives in house 2.

Since the person who owns horses is the dog owner, the dog owner lives in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 7**: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

2. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Stew eater

3. **Clue 1**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

4. **Clue 4**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

5. **Clue 5**: There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fried rice eater and fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 3, or 2 and 4. But since the pizza eater is in house 4, the fried rice eater and fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 3.

6. **Clue 6**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist cannot be in the fourth house.

7. **Clue 3**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater
- The guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.
- The percussionist and science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the guitarist and violinist are:
- Guitarist in house 1
- Violinist in house 3

This leaves the following possibilities for the remaining houses:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

Now, we need to place the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils

5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Likes green (since it's directly left of the person wearing running shoes)

6. **Clue 6:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - House 3: Owns horses
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 1: Likes white

7. **Clue 7:** The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.

   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Owns horses

From Clue 7, we know that the person who owns horses lives in House 3 and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in House 2.

From Clue 5, the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who owns horses (House 3) and the person who has daffodils (House 2) are next to each other, the person who likes green must be in House 1, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 1, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3. However, since the person who owns horses is already in House 3, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Likes white, Wearing sandals
- House 2: Has daffodils, Wearing running shoes
- House 3: Owns horses, Wearing boots

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 2, the person eating mangos must live directly left of the person eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations arrangement

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots must live in either house 1 or house 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who likes red and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: Unknown

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who likes white must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1 (Clue 2).
- The person who likes red must be in house 2 (Clue 6).

This leaves the person who is wearing boots to be in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing boots lives in house 3.

3. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Person who has a bouquet of lilies

From Clue 1, the person who likes milk must be in House 3 because there is one house between House 1 and House 3. This leaves House 1 for the person who has a rose bouquet.

Thus, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."

11. **Swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.**

From clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, so the person who is wearing sandals must live in the fourth house. This means the cricketer lives in the third house.

From clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. Since the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, the cricketer must live in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who has a radio must live in the second house. Therefore, the person who has a phone lives in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who has a phone does not live in the second house, which is consistent with the person who has a phone living in the first house.

From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a phone lives in the first house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the second or third house. Since the person who likes blue lives in the third house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the second house.

From clue 8, the tennis player lives in the third house, which is consistent with the person who likes blue living in the third house.

From clue 11, the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the swimmer must live in the second house.

4. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 1: Yellow

From Clue 2, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses, and since the romance book lover is in House 1, the history book buff must be in House 2.

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza cannot be in House 1, so the person who had pizza must be in House 3.

From Clue 1, the person who likes green must be in House 2, but since the history book buff is already in House 2, this is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to reassess the positions.

Let's try the following arrangement:
- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 2: Green
- House 3: History book buff

From Clue 5, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 3, but since the history book buff is in House 3, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 2.

This arrangement is consistent with all clues:

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

Let's start by placing the tennis player and the television based on Clue 1. The tennis player and the television cannot be in the same house, and the tennis player must be to the left of the television. So, the possible pairs are:
- Tennis player (T) in house 1, television (V) in house 2
- Tennis player (T) in house 1, television (V) in house 3
- Tennis player (T) in house 2, television (V) in house 3

### Case 1: Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Television (V) in house 2

Now, the golfer cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the golfer must be in house 1 or house 3. But since the tennis player is already in house 1, the golfer must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Golfer (G) in house 3

This leaves house 2 for the computer and house 3 for the radio and rose bouquet. Since the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses (Clue 3), and the radio and rose bouquet must be in adjacent houses (Clue 4 and Clue 5), we need to place the computer and tulips in house 2 and the radio and rose bouquet in house 3.

### Checking the placement:
- House 1: Tennis player (T)
- House 2: Computer (C) and Tulips (Tul)
- House 3: Radio (R) and Rose bouquet (Rb)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
1. Tennis player (T) is to the left of the television (V) in house 1 and house 2.
2. Golfer (G) is in house 3.
3. Computer (C) and tulips (Tul) are in adjacent houses (house 2).
4. Radio (R) and rose bouquet (Rb) are in adjacent houses (house 3).
5. Radio (R) is to the right of the television (V) in house 3.

- **Clue 12:** There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.
  - This means if the sandals person is in house X, the cellist must be in house X+3 or X-3 (but since houses are numbered 1 to 5, X-3 is not possible).

### Deduction Process:
1. **House 1:** Not possible for violinist, cricketer, or cellist.
2. **House 2:** Violinist.
3. **House 3:** Swimmer.
4. **House 4:** Cricketer.
5. **House 5:** Bouquet of daffodils.

Given Clue 11, the daffodils person is in house 5. Clue 12 tells us that the sandals person must be in house 1.

### Final Check:
- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

The person wearing sandals lives in house 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (E) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their house numbers step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
   - This means the fish enthusiast lives in house 1, and the person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.
   - This confirms that the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can deduce:
- The person in house 1 is the fish enthusiast.
- The person in house 2 is wearing high heels and ate grilled cheese.

Since the person in house 2 (high heels) cannot be the fish enthusiast (house 1), the person in house 1 (fish enthusiast) must be the dog owner. This leaves the person in house 2 as the fish enthusiast (wearing high heels and ate grilled cheese).

The remaining characteristic for the person in house 1 is that they had stew.

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the cat lover lives is **1**. 

So, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house where the person eating oranges lives:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a phone lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
4. **Clue 4:** The flutist lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
7. **Clue 7:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
9. **Clue 10:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the flutist.
11. **Clue 11:** There are two houses between where the person who is wearing high heels lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
12. **Clue 12:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
13. **Clue 13:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
14. **Clue 14:** The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
15. **Clue 15:** The science fiction book fanatic and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.

From Clue 2, the person with a phone lives in the third house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

From Clue 4, the flutist lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the flutist.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing running shoes also lives in the third house. This contradicts Clue 2, so we need to re-evaluate. Since Clue 2 states the phone lives in the third house, and Clue 6 states the running shoes live in the third house, we need to consider the possibility that the phone and running shoes are different people.

From Clue 1, the person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live next to each other. Let's denote the person eating grapes as G and the person eating oranges as O. They must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

From Clue 5, the person eating oranges (O) lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing boots (B). From Clue 3, the saxophonist (S) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots (B). This means B must be to the right of S.

From Clue 7, the romance book lover (R) lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic (SF). This means R and SF must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From Clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is wearing high heels (HH) lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast (FB) lives. This means HH and FB must be in houses 1 and 4 or 2 and 5 (but since we only have 4 houses, it must be 1 and 4).

From Clue 12, the history book buff (HB) lives somewhere to the left of the person eating oranges (O). This means HB must be in house 1 or 2.

From Clue 13, the person eating kiwis (K) does not live in the first house. So K must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 14, the percussionist (P) lives in the fourth house. So P is in house 4.

From Clue 15, the science fiction book fanatic (SF) and the person who is wearing running shoes (RS) live directly next to each other. Since RS lives in the third house, SF must live in the second house.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: HB (History book buff)
- House 2: SF (Science fiction book fanatic)
- House 3: RS (Running shoes)
- House 4: P (Percussionist)

Since the person eating oranges (O) must be to the right of the person wearing boots (B) and B must be to the right of S, and O must be to the right of B, the only possible positions for O and B are:
- O in house 4 (since P is in house 4)
- B in house 3 (since RS is in house 3)

This leaves the person eating grapes (G) and the person wearing boots (B) in houses 1 and 2. Since HB is in house 1, B must be in house 2, and G must be in house 1.

So, the person eating oranges lives in house 4.

The answer is (B) 4."

Thus, the correct answer is (A) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

5. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 5, we know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

### Deductions

From Clue 7, the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the saxophonist.

### Clue 6
The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

### Clue 4
The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

### Clue 1
The romance book lover (in the second house) lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house.

### Clue 2
There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the guitarist must be in the third house, and the history book buff must be in the second house. But we already know the second house is occupied by the romance book lover. This means the history book buff must be in the first house.

### Clue 3
There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives. Since the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the saxophonist must be in the fourth house. This is consistent with Clue 4.

### Final Positions
- **House 1:** History book buff
- **House 2:** Romance book lover
- **House 3:** Saxophonist
- **House 4:** Mystery book reader
- **House 5:** Fantasy book enthusiast

### Conclusion
The violinist must be in the third house, as the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.

Thus, the number of the house where the violinist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.

Let's deduce step by step:

- **Clue 1:** The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
  - House 4: Television

- **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
  - House 2: Loafers

- **Clue 3:** The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
  - House 2: Loafers (already determined)
  - House 3: Phone (since the phone cannot be in house 2)

- **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
  - House 1: Boots
  - House 2: Loafers

- **Clue 5:** There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
  - Since the radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4, and house 2 is already occupied by loafers, the radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3.
  - If the radio is in house 1, then the sandals must be in house 3.
  - If the radio is in house 3, then the sandals must be in house 1.

Let's test these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Radio in house 1, Sandals in house 3**
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television
- House 1: Radio
- House 3: Sandals

This leaves the gameboy for house 2, which contradicts Clue 3 (the phone is in house 3).

**Scenario 2: Radio in house 3, Sandals in house 1**
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television
- House 3: Radio
- House 1: Sandals

This leaves the gameboy for house 2, which is consistent with Clue 3 (the phone is in house 3).

Therefore, the person who has a gameboy lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
   - This directly places the person wearing high heels in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Since the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 2, and we know the high heels person lives in house number 2, the coffee drinker must live in either house number 1 or house number 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who likes milk must live in either house number 2 or house number 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
   - This is consistent with Clue 2, as the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing running shoes lives in house number 3.

Since the person wearing running shoes lives in house number 3, the person who likes milk must be in house number 2 (because the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 2, and the person who likes milk cannot be in house number 1).

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house number 2, and the coffee drinker must live in house number 1.

Thus, the person wearing high heels lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. The person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

From Clue 1, we know the person wearing loafers must live in the second house. 

From Clue 2, since the mystery book reader cannot live in the second house, the mystery book reader must live in the first house.

This leaves the history book buff to live in the second house, and the person wearing high heels to live in the first house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing loafers lives is 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the placement of each person and their belongings:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a gameboy (G) live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (P) lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a vase of tulips (T) lives directly left of the person who had pizza (P).
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a carnations arrangement (C) lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) lives directly left of the person who had stew (St).
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a television (Tv) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a rose bouquet (Rb) live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing boots (B) lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza (P).
10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti (Sp) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).

Let's start by placing the person who had pizza (P) and the person who is wearing sandals (S):

- **Clue 2:** P and S must be adjacent.
- **Clue 9:** B must be to the left of P.

Let's try different placements:

- If P is in house 1, then S must be in house 2 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 2, then B must be in house 1 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is not possible because P and S must be adjacent, and B must be to the left of P. So, let's try another arrangement:

- If P is in house 2, then S must be in house 3 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 3, then B must be in house 2 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is also not possible because P and S must be adjacent, and B must be to the left of P.

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is possible. Let's check the other clues with this arrangement:

- **Clue 1:** R and G must be adjacent.
- **Clue 4:** T lives directly left of P.
- **Clue 5:** C lives somewhere to the left of S.
- **Clue 6:** R lives directly left of St.
- **Clue 7:** Tv lives directly left of Rd.
- **Clue 8:** R and Rb live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 10:** Sp lives directly left of Rd.

Let's place the remaining items:

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4.
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (Clue 9).
- If R is in house 2, then G must be in house 1 (Clue 1).
- If T is in house 1, then C must be in house 2 (Clue 4).
- If R is in house 2, then St must be in house 3 (Clue 6).
- If Rb is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 8).
- If Sp is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 10).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person with a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in house 1 and the lilies are in house 2, or the lilies are in house 1 and the rose bouquet is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
   - This means the saxophonist lives in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - This means the person eating mangos lives in house 1.

From Clue 1, we know the rose bouquet is in house 1 and the lilies are in house 2. This matches our deductions from Clue 3 and Clue 2.

Therefore, the person eating apples must live in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is **(B) 2**."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions, we can determine the house where the coffee drinker lives as follows:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone.

From Clue 15, the person who has a radio lives in the first house, so the first house is occupied by the person with a radio.

From Clue 16, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house, the person with a television must live in one of the houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's test the placements:

- If the person who only drinks water is in house 3, the basketball player must be in house 2. This means the person with a television must be in house 5 (since the person with a television cannot be in house 1 or 2, and the person with a radio is in house 1).
- If the person who only drinks water is in house 4, the basketball player must be in house 3. This means the person with a television must be in house 5 (since the person with a television cannot be in house 1, 2, or 3, and the person with a radio is in house 1).

Given Clue"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- From Clue 4, the rose bouquet person can only be in house 1 or 3.
- From Clue 2, the SUV person and the lilies person are neighbors, and the lilies person is to the left of the SUV person.
- From Clue 3, the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors.

Let's consider the placements:

1. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

2. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

3. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 2:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 2).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 1).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

4. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

5. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

The only valid configuration is:
- Rose bouquet person in house 1.
- Sedan person in house 2.
- Lilies person in house 3.
- Tulip person in house 2.

Thus, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and the refined analysis, let's deduce the correct house for the person who likes milk.

1. **House 4: Lilies**
2. **House 5: Tulips**
3. **House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic**
4. **House 2: Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic**
5. **House 1: Fantasy Book Enthusiast or Root Beer Lover**
6. **House 3: History Book Buff**
7. **House 4: Cellist**
8. **House 5: Violinist**
9. **House 3: Pianist**
10. **House 4: Mystery Book Reader**
11. **House 5: Romance Book Lover**
12. **House 2: Carnations**
13. **House 1: Daffodils**
14. **House 3: Rose Bouquet**
15. **House 4: Milk Lover**

From the above deductions, the person who likes milk lives in **House 4**.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(D) 4"
"Given the constraints and logical deductions, let's re-evaluate the information step by step:

1. **First house**: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
2. **Fourth house**: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.
3. **Third house**: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
4. **Second house**: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.

From clue 14, the swimmer and the cricketer must be in houses that are two houses apart. Given the constraints, the only possible positions for the swimmer and the cricketer are:
- Cricketer in the first house (yellow), and swimmer in the third house (blue).
- Cricketer in the third house (blue), and swimmer in the first house (yellow).

Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the cricketer must be in the first house, and the swimmer must be in the third house.

Now, the second house must be occupied by the person who likes white and the person who is eating oranges. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house (yellow), and the person who is eating oranges cannot be in the first house (yellow). Therefore, the person who likes white must be in the second house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house.

This leaves the person who owns an SUV in the third house, and the person who is eating a banana in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
- Second house: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.
- Third house: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
- Fourth house: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.

The basketball player must be in the remaining house, which is the second house.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in the second house. The answer is (D) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues and deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

### Clue Breakdown

1. **Green and Yellow**: The person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who likes yellow lives directly next to the person who likes green.
   - Therefore, the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

2. **Stew and Grilled Cheese**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in the first house, and the romance book lover lives in the second house.

3. **Fantasy Book Enthusiast**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

4. **Grilled Cheese**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house and the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

5. **Romance Book Lover**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This confirms that the romance book lover lives in the second house, which is consistent with the previous information.

### Summary of Arrangement

- **First House**: Person who ate grilled cheese
- **Second House**: Person who had stew, romance book lover
- **Third House**: Person who likes green, fantasy book enthusiast

### Determining the Person Who Likes Blue

- The person who likes green lives in the third house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the second house.
- The person who likes blue must live in the first house.

Thus, the person who likes blue lives in the first house.

### Final Answer

The number of the house where the person who likes blue lives is **1**.

So, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"To determine the house where the bird keeper lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

From Clue 7, we know the first house has a carnations arrangement. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From Clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 5, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the horses and the rose bouquet must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. This means the horses and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (house 1).
2. The cellist lives in the first house (house 1).
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. From clue 2, the cellist also lives in house 1. This creates a contradiction because only one person can live in each house. Therefore, we need to reassess the clues.

Let's consider the fantasy book enthusiast living in house 1 and the cellist living in house 2. This reassessment aligns with clue 3, which states that the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green, the person who likes red must live in house 2.

This means:
- The fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green.
- The person who likes red (living in house 2) likes red.
- The cellist (living in house 2) plays the cello.
- The pianist (living in house 1) plays the piano.

Now, we need to determine the mystery book reader. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green and the person who likes red (living in house 2) likes red, the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

   - This leaves the swimmer to be in the second house.

Thus, the swimmer lives in the second house.

The number of the house where the swimmer lives is (B) 2."

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the information and constraints step by step:

1. **Lunch Choices:**
   - Fried Rice
   - Spaghetti

2. **Pet Owners:**
   - Cat Lover
   - Horse Owner

3. **Book Buffs:**
   - History Book Buff
   - Romance Book Lover

4. **Shoes:**

5. **Clue 1:**
   - The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.

6. **Clue 2:**
   - The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

### Analyzing Clue 1:
- If Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals, then Person 2 (House 2) must own horses.
- If Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals, then Person 1 (House 1) must own horses.

### Analyzing Clue 2:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

### Possible Arrangements:
- **Scenario 1:**
  - Person 1 (House 1) owns horses, Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals.
  - Person 1 (House 1) ate spaghetti (Clue 2).
  - Person 2 (House 2) is the history book buff (Clue 2).
  - Person 1 (House 1) is the cat lover (Clue 2).
  - Person 2 (House 2) is the romance book lover (Clue 2).
  - Person 1 (House 1) is wearing running shoes (Clue 2).
  - Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals (Clue 1).

- **Scenario 2:**
  - Person 2 (House 2) owns horses, Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals.
  - Person 2 (House 2) ate spaghetti (Clue 2).
  - Person 1 (House 1) is the history book buff (Clue 2).
  - Person 2 (House 2) is the cat lover (Clue 2).
  - Person 1 (House 1) is the romance book lover (Clue 2).
  - Person 2 (House 2) is wearing running shoes (Clue 2).
  - Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals (Clue 1).

### Conclusion:
- In both scenarios, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate fried rice lives is **2**."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the sedan owner is in house 1 and the person with the bouquet of lilies is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The flutist does not live in the first house.
   - This means the flutist must live in house 2.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can deduce:
- The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.
- The flutist lives in house 2.
- The person who owns a sedan lives in house 1.

Since the flutist is in house 2, the person who owns a sedan (house 1) must play the saxophone and the person with the bouquet of lilies (house 2) must play the flute.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. **Carnations arrangement in the fourth house**: House 4.
2. **Rose bouquet in the third house**: House 3.
3. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer**: This means if the swimmer is in house \(i\), the fantasy book enthusiast is in house \(i-1\).
4. **Tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the tennis player is in house \(i+1\) or later.
5. **There is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet**: This means if the rose bouquet is in house \(i\), the daffodils are in house \(i+1\) or \(i-1\).
6. **There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the romance book lover is in house \(i+2\) or \(i-2\).
7. **Tennis player does not live in the fourth house**: This means the tennis player cannot be in house 4.
8. **There is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet**: This means if the rose bouquet is in house 3, the daffodils must be in house 2 or 4. Since house 4 is taken by the carnations, the daffodils must be in house 2.
9. **There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house 1, the romance book lover must be in house 3 or 5. Since house 3 is taken by the rose bouquet, the romance book lover must be in house 5.

Given these deductions:
- House 1: Mystery book reader.
- House 2: Daffodils bouquet.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Carnations arrangement.
- House 5: Tennis player.

Since the romance book lover must be two houses away from the mystery book reader, and the only available position for the romance book lover is house 5, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Coffee drinker lives in the third house.**

3. **The saxophonist does not live in the second house.**
   - Possible houses for saxophonist: 1, 3, 4, 5.

   - Possible houses for gameboy: 1, 3, 4, 5.

6. **The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.**

7. **The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.**
   - Computer in House 5, so cellist must be in House 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the percussionist.**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).

    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

13. **The person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means if the minivan driver is in house 2, the person wearing boots must be in house 1.
   - If the minivan driver is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

2. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.**
   - This means if the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the person with pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 2, the person with pizza must be in house 3.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, the person with pizza must be in house 3 (but this is not possible since the person with pizza must be to the right).

3. **The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person wearing running shoes must live in either house 2 or 3.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means if the person with tulips is in house 2, the cricketer must be in house 1.
   - If the person with tulips is in house 3, the cricketer must be in house 2.

5. **The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with pizza must live in either house 1 or 3.

6. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - This means if the person with grilled cheese is in house 2, the person with sedan must be in house 1.
   - If the person with grilled cheese is in house 3, the person with sedan must be in house 2.

7. **The person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person driving a minivan is in house 3.

8. **The golfer lives in the first house.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1.

9. **The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet must live in either house 1 or 3.

Now, let's combine all the clues:

- From clue 7, the person driving a minivan is in house 3.
- From clue 8, the golfer is in house 1.
- From clue 5, the person who had pizza cannot be in house 2, so the person who had pizza must be in house 1 or 3. Since the golfer is in house 1, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.
- From clue 4, the cricketer must be in house 1 (since the person with tulips cannot be in house 1).
- From clue 3, the person wearing running shoes cannot be in house 1, so the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.
- From clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 (since the person with sedan must be in house 1).
- From clue 2, the person with pizza (in house 3) must be to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Since the person with pizza is in house 3, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 1.
- From clue 1, the person wearing boots must be in house 2 (since the person driving a minivan is in house 3).

Therefore, the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. **The person who likes green does not live in the second house.**
2. **The person who had stew does not live in the second house.**
3. **The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.**
4. **The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
5. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.**
6. **The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.**
7. **The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.**
8. **There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.**

From Clue 7, we know:
- Fried Rice lives in house 3.

From Clue 8, we know:
- White and Yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4.

From Clue 2, we know:
- Stew does not live in house 2 or 4.

From Clue 3, we know:
- Stew does not live in house 4.

From Clue 1, we know:
- Green does not live in house 2.

From Clue 6, we know:
- Red lives directly left of the person who had stew. Since Stew cannot be in house 4, Red must be in house 3 (but Fried Rice is already in house 3), which is a contradiction. Therefore, Stew must be in house 1, and Red must be in house 2.

From Clue 4, we know:
- Blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since Red is in house 2, Blue must be in house 1, and Spaghetti must be in house 3 (but Fried Rice is already in house 3), which is a contradiction. Therefore, Blue must be in house 1, and Spaghetti must be in house 4.

From Clue 5, we know:
- Grilled Cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. Since White is in house 2, Grilled Cheese must be in house 3 (but Fried Rice is already in house 3), which is a contradiction. Therefore, Grilled Cheese must be in house 5.

From Clue 1, we know:
- Green does not live in house 2. Since White is in house 2, Green must be in house 5.

From Clue 2, we know:
- Stew does not live in house 2 or 4. Since Stew is in house 1, and Fried Rice is in house 3, and Spaghetti is in house 4, and Grilled Cheese is in house 5, the only house left for Yellow is house 4.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person:

1. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives in the second house.
   - This means the percussionist lives in house number 2.

2. **Clue 1**: The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the basketball player cannot be in house 3.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who likes red lives in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house number 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2.

5. **Clue 3**: The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

From Clue 5, we know the percussionist lives in house 2. From Clue 2, the person who likes red lives in house 3. This leaves house 1 for the person who likes yellow.

Now, we need to place the violinist and the basketball player in houses 1 and 4. From Clue 1, the violinist must be to the right of the basketball player. This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the basketball player cannot be in house 3.

Since the person who likes yellow is in house 1, the basketball player must be in house 4, and the violinist must be in house 3.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in house number 1.

The number of the house where the basketball player lives is (A) 1."

- The person who has a phone must live in house 3 or 4 (Clue 11).
- The tea drinker must live in house 1 or 2 (Clue 16).

Given all these constraints, the only feasible arrangement is:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement
- House 2: Root beer lover
- House 3: Coffee drinker
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies
- House 5: Percussionist

Thus, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

### Placing the Saxophonist and Science Fiction Book Fanatic

Let's place the saxophonist in house 1 and the science fiction book fanatic in house 2.

### Placing the Person with Carnations and Cellist

Since the person with carnations and the cellist are two houses apart, and the person with carnations cannot be in the fifth house, we can place the person with carnations in house 3 and the cellist in house 5.

### Placing the Person with Daffodils and Cat Lover

The person with daffodils is one house apart from the person with horses, and the person with daffodils is to the left of the cat lover. Let's place the person with daffodils in house 2 and the person with horses in house 3. The cat lover must be in house 4.

"To determine the house where the person with a vase of tulips lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Dog owner lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Dog owner

2. **Fish enthusiast lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Fish enthusiast

3. **Bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.**
   - This means the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in House 5.

4. **Person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.**
   - This means the gameboy cannot be in House 5.

5. **Person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the fifth house.**
   - This means the bouquet of lilies cannot be in House 5.

6. **Person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house.**
   - This contradicts Clue 5, so the bouquet of lilies must be in House 1 or House 2.

7. **Person who has a gameboy does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the gameboy cannot be in House 2.

8. **Person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer.**
   - This means the truck and computer must be in consecutive houses, with the truck to the left of the computer.

9. **Person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.**
   - This means the gameboy cannot be in House 1.

10. **Person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.**
    - This means the vase of tulips cannot be in House 5.

11. **Person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.**
    - This means the convertible must be in House 5.

12. **There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives.**
    - This means the truck must be in House 4 and the convertible in House 6 (but House 6 is not available).

13. **Person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.**
    - This means the minivan must be in House 5 (but House 5 is already occupied by the convertible).

14. **Person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house.**
    - This means the computer cannot be in House 5.

15. **Person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.**
    - This means the carnations arrangement must be in House 4 and the vase of tulips in House 5 (but House 5 is already occupied by the convertible).

16. **Person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.**
    - This means the carnations arrangement must be in House 1 or House 2.

17. **There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.**
    - This means the television and SUV must be in consecutive houses, with one house between them.

Given the constraints, the only feasible arrangement is:

- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Vase of tulips
- House 5: Convertible

Thus, the person with a vase of tulips lives in House 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"To determine the house where the dog owner lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.

Given Clue 5, the basketball player lives in house 1, and the saxophonist also lives in house 1. This leaves house 2 and house 3 for the remaining people.

### Analyzing Clue 6 and Clue 5:
- Since the saxophonist lives in house 1, the basketball player must be in house 1.
- The basketball player lives in house 1, and the saxophonist also lives in house 1, so house 1 is occupied by the basketball player.

### Analyzing Clue 2 and Clue 7:
- The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer, so if the tea drinker is in house 2, the cricketer must be in house 3.
- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk, so if the person who had stew is in house 2, the person who likes milk must be in house 3.

### Analyzing Clue 3:
- There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives. If the fish enthusiast is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 2.

### Analyzing Clue 4:
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner. If the pizza eater is in house 2, the dog owner must be in house 3.

Combining all the clues:
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: Person who only drinks water (pizza eater)
- House 3: Cat lover (cricketer, tea drinker, dog owner)

Since the person who had pizza (in house 2) lives directly left of the dog owner (in house 3), the dog owner must be in house 3.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each characteristic:

1. **History Book Buff**: Lives in house 1.
2. **Cat Lover**: Does not live in house 2, so must live in house 1.
3. **Person with High Heels**: Lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.
4. **Person with Computer**: Lives somewhere to the right of the person with loafers.
5. **Person with Loafers**: Lives in house 1 (since the history book buff is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 2).
6. **Person with a Bouquet of Daffodils**: Lives to the right of the person with loafers, so in house 2.
7. **Person with a Computer**: Lives to the right of the person with loafers, so in house 2 (but since the person with loafers is in house 1, the computer must be in house 2, which is consistent with the daffodils).

From the above deductions:
- House 1: History book buff (romance book lover) and person with loafers (loafers).
- House 2: Cat lover (cat enthusiast) and person with computer (computer).

Therefore, the person with a bouquet of lilies must live in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is **1**.

**Correct Option: (B) 1**"

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The history book buff lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. **Clue 12**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
4. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
9. **Clue 9**: The flutist does not live in the first house.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
11. **Clue 2**: There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who likes green lives.
12. **Clue 11**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.

Let's start by placing the history book buff in the second house:
1. History book buff (2)

Next, we need to place the person who had pizza and the person who ate fried rice. According to Clue 10 and Clue 12, the person who had pizza must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the fourth house:
1. Pizza (1)
4. Fried rice (4)

Now, the person who likes blue and the percussionist must be placed such that the percussionist is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and there are two houses between the person who likes blue and the person who likes green:
1. Pizza (1)
2. Blue (3) or Blue (2)
4. Fried rice (4)
3. Spaghetti (3)

If Blue is in the third house, then the percussionist must be in the second house:
1. Pizza (1)
2. Percussionist (2)
3. Blue (3)
4. Fried rice (4)
3. Spaghetti (3)

This arrangement contradicts Clue 6 and Clue 7, so Blue must be in the second house:
1. Pizza (1)
2. Blue (2)
3. Spaghetti (3)
4. Fried rice (4)

Now, the person who likes white and the romance book lover must be placed such that the person who likes white is directly left of the romance book lover:
1. Pizza (1)
2. Blue (2)
3. Spaghetti (3)
4. Fried rice (4)
3. White (1)
4. Romance book lover (4)

This arrangement contradicts Clue 8, so the person who likes white must be in the third house:
1. Pizza (1)
2. Blue (2)
3. White (3)
4. Fried rice (4)
3. Spaghetti (3)

Now, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who ate fried rice must be placed such that the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is to the left of the person who ate fried rice:
1. Pizza (1)
2. Blue (2)
3. White (3)
4. Fried rice (4)
3. Spaghetti (3)
3. Daffodils (2)
4. Fried rice (4)

This arrangement contradicts Clue 8, so the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house:
1. Daffodils (1)
2. Blue (2)
3. White (3)
4. Fried rice (4)
3. Spaghetti (3)

Finally, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fourth house:
1. Daffodils (1)
2. Blue (2)
3. White (3)
4. Fantasy book enthusiast (4)
3. Spaghetti (3)

Thus, the cellist must live in the third house.

The number of the house where the cellist lives is **3**.

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person eating grapes lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
- Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

**Clue 4:** There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1.

**Clue 3:** There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person eating grapes must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the person eating grapes must be in house 1.

**Clue 2:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
- If the violinist is in house 1, the flutist must be in house 3.
- If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

### Combining Clues:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2:
  - Violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

### Correct Configuration:

- Person eating kiwis in house 2.
- Violinist in house 1.
- Flutist in house 3.
- Person eating grapes in house 1 (Clue 3).

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other (Clue 1).
- The flutist is to the right of the violinist (Clue 2).
- There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis (Clue 3).
- There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis (Clue 4).

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating kiwis lives in house 1. 

From clue 1, since the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in house 1, they must live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person who likes red:

1. **Clue 8**: The person who likes red lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 10**: The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
4. **Clue 1**: The bird keeper and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 6**: The person who had pizza does not live in the third house.
6. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives.

From Clue 8, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house.

From Clue 2, the person who likes green does not live in the second house, so the second house is not occupied by the person who likes green.

From Clue 10, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes yellow cannot be in the third house (since the third house is occupied by the person who likes red).

From Clue 1, the bird keeper and the person who has a television live directly next to each other. This means if the bird keeper is in the first house, the person who has a television must be in the second house, and vice versa.

From Clue 6, the person who had pizza does not live in the third house, so the third house is occupied by the person who likes red.

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives. This means the person who has a television cannot be in the first house (since there would be no house to the left of the first house).

Given all these constraints, the only consistent placement for the person who likes red is in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the situation systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
   - This means the root beer lover must live in the first house.

2. **Clue 2:** The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.
   - This means the pianist and the cellist must be in adjacent houses, with the pianist in the house to the left of the cellist.

Given the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the root beer lover lives in the first house (house 1), we can deduce the following:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the pianist and the cellist must be in houses 1 and 2.
- Since the pianist must be to the left of the cellist, the pianist must be in house 1 and the cellist must be in house 2.

Thus, the root beer lover lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues and place each person in their respective houses:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.
   - Fifth house: Person with carnations.

2. **Clue 6**: The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
   - Fourth house: Not tulips.

3. **Clue 8**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.
   - Adjacent houses: Daffodils and running shoes.

4. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - One house apart: Running shoes and lilies.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Right of daffodils: Tulips.

6. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.
   - Fifth house: Not sandals.

   - Adjacent houses: Boots and carnations.

9. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.
   - Fifth house: Not sandals.

Let's summarize and place the people:
- Fifth house: Person with carnations.
- Fourth house: Not tulips.
- Third house: Not daffodils (since daffodils and running shoes are adjacent).
- Second house: Not tulips (since tulips are to the right of daffodils).
- First house: Not sandals (since sandals are not in the fifth house).

Now, let's place the remaining people:
- The person with sandals must be in the first house.
- The person with boots is in the fourth house (since the fifth house is occupied by carnations and the fourth house is not occupied by sandals).
- The person with carnations is in the fifth house.
- The person with tulips is in the third house (since it is to the right of the person with daffodils and adjacent to the person with loafers).
- The person with daffodils is in the second house (since it is adjacent to the person with running shoes and the person with tulips is in the third house).
- The person with running shoes is in the second house (since it is adjacent to the person with daffodils and one house away from the person with lilies).
- The person with lilies is in the fourth house (since it is one house away from the person with running shoes).

Thus, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person step by step:

1. **Baseball player in house 2.**

From clue 2, the only valid pair for swimmers and whites is (2, 3) or (3, 4).

From clue 10, the only valid pair for blue and tea drinkers is (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4).

From clue 8, the only valid pair for white and tea drinkers is (2, 3) or (3, 4).

From clue 7, the only valid pair for blue and oranges is (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4).

From clue 6, the only valid pair for blue and oranges is (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4).

From clue 5, the only valid pair for saxophonist and tennis player is (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4).

From clue 4, the only valid pair for percussionist and green is (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4).

From clue 3, the only valid pair for water drinker and white is (2, 3) or (3, 4).

- House 4: Pianist, Coffee drinker

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the first house is occupied by someone who likes white. From Clue 4, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in the second house, so the person who had stew must live in the first or third house. Since the person who likes green lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house (since the person who had stew cannot live in the second house).

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who likes white must live in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew.

Now, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. The person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the second house (Clue 3), so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. Since the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house. This contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who likes white lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first or second house. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other (Clue 4), the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 1 or 3. However, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1), the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

Now, the person with the rose bouquet is in house number 2, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house number 3. This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker (CD) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals (SW).
   - This means the CD cannot be in house 2, and the SW cannot be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The science fiction book fanatic (SF) lives in the first house (house 1).

From Clue 2, we know:
- The SF lives in house 1.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The CD cannot be in house 1, so the CD must be in house 2.
- The SW cannot be in house 1, so the SW must be in house 1.

This leaves the water drinker and the romance book lover to be assigned to the remaining houses. Since the CD is in house 2, the water drinker must be in house 1. This leaves the romance book lover to be in house 2.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues and the logical deductions:

1. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
2. The percussionist must be in House 1 and the person with the radio must be in House 2.
3. The pianist must be in House 2 (since the percussionist is in House 1 and they play different instruments).
4. The person with the phone must be in House 1 (since the person with the radio is in House 2).

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:

(A) 1"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.

2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
   - This indicates that the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them.

3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means the person who likes yellow and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3, with the person who likes yellow in the house directly to the left of the person who owns a sedan.

Given these clues, let's analyze the possible placements:

- The second house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.
- The person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them. This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3.
- The person who likes yellow must be in the house directly to the left of the person who owns a sedan.

Considering the above, if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, then the person who likes yellow must be in house 2 (since the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan).

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

   - House 5: Truck

   Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover, and the person who is wearing high heels lives two houses to the right of the person who has a bouquet of lilies, we can deduce:
   - House 3: Fish Enthusiast
   - House 4: Sandals
   - House 5: Truck
   - House 1: Bird Keeper
   - House 2: Loafers

   The person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 1 or House 2.

    - House 2: Loafers
    - House 3: Fish Enthusiast
    - House 4: Sandals
    - House 5: Truck

    Since the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3, and the person who is wearing boots must be in House 4.

11. **Clue 6:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
    - House 3: Fish Enthusiast
    - House 4: Sandals
    - House 5: Truck

    Since the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is eating apples, the person who is eating apples must be in House 4, and the fish enthusiast must be in House 5.

   - House 3: Grilled Cheese Eater

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the dog owner (D) must be in house 2 (as they are to the right of the person with carnations arrangement), the person with the carnations arrangement (C) must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the individuals step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.
   - If the person drinking water is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means if the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the person liking yellow must be in house 2.
   - If the person wearing sandals is in house 2, the person liking yellow must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - This means the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis is in house 2. From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2). From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

Therefore, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is **2**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals.
   - This means the person wearing sandals cannot be in house 2 (the right house).

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person wearing sandals cannot be in house 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (the left house).

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
   - Since the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 1 (because the tea drinker cannot be in house 2).

From these deductions:
- The person wearing sandals is in house 1.
- The person eating grapes is in house 1 (since they live next to the person wearing sandals).
- The tea drinker is in house 1.
- The person wearing high heels must be in house 2 (since they live to the right of the person wearing sandals and cannot be in house 1).

Therefore, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is eating kiwis lives is **(A) 2**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the cellist cannot be in house 3, and the person who only drinks water cannot be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - This means the violinist can only be in houses 2 or 3.

Given the tea drinker is in house 1, we can deduce the following:

- The cellist cannot be in house 3 (from Clue 1).
- The violinist cannot be in house 3 (from Clue 4).
- The guitarist cannot be in house 3 (since the violinist cannot be there and there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist).

So, the possible positions for the cellist and the guitarist are:
- Cellist in house 2 (since the cellist cannot be in house 3).
- Guitarist in house 3 (since the cellist is in house 2 and there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist).

Let's verify this:
- The tea drinker is in house 1.
- The cellist is in house 2.
- The violinist cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), so the violinist must be in house 2 (but that's already taken by the cellist), so the violinist must be in house 3.
- The guitarist must be in house 3.

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
   - Third house: Someone wearing sandals.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - First house: Not running shoes.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the fourth house: Someone who only drinks water.
   - Third house: Someone wearing sandals.

4. **Clue 4:** The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
   - Fifth house: Someone who drinks tea.

5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person who only drinks water cannot be in the fifth house (where the tea drinker lives), and the person who is wearing boots cannot be in the first house.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
   - Third house: Someone who likes milk.

From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person who is wearing boots.
- Second house: Person who is wearing running shoes.
- Third house: Person who likes milk (and wearing sandals).
- Fourth house: Person who only drinks water.
- Fifth house: Person who drinks tea.

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

   - Grilled cheese and radio must be separated by one house.

6. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
   - Television and phone must be in houses with television to the left of phone.

Let's place the pizza in house 4:
- House 4: Pizza

Now, the radio cannot be in house 4, so it must be in house 1, 2, 3, or 5. Let's try placing the radio in house 1:
- House 1: Radio
- House 4: Pizza

Grilled cheese and spaghetti must be adjacent, so they could be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Let's try house 1 and 2:
- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza

Now, the gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house. If grilled cheese is in house 2, then fried rice must be in house 3:
- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Pizza

This leaves house 5 for the computer:
- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Computer

Finally, the person who has a phone must be to the right of the person who has a television. The only house left for the phone is house 5, and the only house left for the television is house 1:
- House 1: Television
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Phone

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3, as it is adjacent to the grilled cheese in house 2.

**The number of the house where the person who ate spaghetti lives is 3.**

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot be in house 2, because the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2 or 3, and the bird keeper must be in house 1 or 2. Since the bird keeper cannot be in house 2, the bird keeper must be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - Since the percussionist cannot be in house 2, the percussionist must be in house 1.

From this, we know:
- The percussionist lives in house 1.
- The grilled cheese eater lives in house 2.
- The bird keeper lives in house 1 (but since the grilled cheese eater is already in house 2, the bird keeper must be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2).

This leaves the guitarist and the pizza eater to be placed in the remaining houses (houses 1 and 2). Since the percussionist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2 (because the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the pizza eater cannot be in house 2).

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's systematically deduce the placement of each person and their characteristics:

1. **Clue 2**: The bird keeper lives in the third house.
   - Bird keeper: House 3

2. **Clue 1**: The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Cat lover: House 1, 2, or 4

3. **Clue 3**: The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
   - Golfer and truck driver cannot be adjacent.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.
   - Convertible driver: House 2, 3, or 4

5. **Clue 5**: The baseball player does not live in the third house.
   - Baseball player: House 1, 2, or 4

6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - This is consistent with Clue 5.

7. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player.
   - Sedan owner: House 2, 3, or 4 (to the right of the baseball player)

8. **Clue 8**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
   - Soccer player: House 1, 2, or 4 (to the left of the bird keeper)

9. **Clue 9**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.
   - Fish enthusiast: House 1, 2, or 4 (to the left of the soccer player)

Given Clue 2, the bird keeper lives in house 3. Let's place the other constraints:

- Convertible driver cannot be in house 3, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
- Baseball player cannot be in house 3, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
- Sedan owner must be to the right of the baseball player, so if the baseball player is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 2 or 4. If the baseball player is in house 2, the sedan owner must be in house 4. If the baseball player is in house 4, the sedan owner must be in house 2 or 3 (but house 3 is taken by the bird keeper).

Let's try placing the convertible driver in house 1:
- Convertible driver in house 1
- Baseball player in house 2 (since they cannot be in house 3)
- Sedan owner in house 4 (to the right of the baseball player)

This leaves house 3 for the bird keeper and house 4 for the sedan owner. The fish enthusiast must be in house 1 or 2, but house 1 is taken by the convertible driver. So the fish enthusiast must be in house 2.

This leaves house 4 for the sedan owner, house 2 for the fish enthusiast, and house 3 for the bird keeper.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: ?
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

2. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means the person who likes white and the person who is eating a banana must be in houses 1 and 3, or houses 2 and 4. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1 and the person who is eating a banana must be in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

3. **Clue 4**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes green must be in a house to the left of the person who likes yellow. Given the arrangement so far, the person who likes green must be in house 1 or house 2. Since house 1 is already occupied by the person who likes white, the person who likes green must be in house 2. This contradicts Clue 6, which states that the person who is eating grapes is in house 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in house 1, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: Yellow

4. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who likes red lives in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes green is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3, this clue is satisfied. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

6. **Clue 1**: The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes red is in house 3 and the person who is eating kiwis must be in a house to the right of house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 4. So, the arrangement is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Kiwis

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4. The correct answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the placement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1, and the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the cat lover must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the cat lover.

3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the person who had stew.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Person eating oranges
- House 2: Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we know:
- The mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the person who had stew.

Since the person eating oranges is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in house 2 (as house 2 is the only house to the right of house 1 and the only house that can be next to the mystery book reader).

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives in the first house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

Let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

- From Clue 3, the root beer lover lives in house 1.
- From Clue 2, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2.
- From Clue 4, the person who has a television cannot live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3.
- From Clue 5, if the person with the television lives in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 (which contradicts Clue 2). Therefore, the person with the television must live in house 3.
- This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2.
- From Clue 1, the person with the daffodils must live in house 1 (since the root beer lover lives in house 1 and the daffodils must be directly left of the phone, which is in house 2).

So, we have:
- House 1: Root beer lover (bouquet of tulips)
- House 2: Person who only drinks water (bouquet of daffodils)
- House 3: Person who likes root beer (bouquet of tulips) (but this contradicts Clue 3, so this must be a different person)

Since the root beer lover is in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2, and the person with the daffodils must be in house 1. This leaves house 3 for the person who likes root beer.

Therefore, the person who likes root beer lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Wearing loafers

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
   - Phone: House 1, 2
   - Mangos: House 2, 3

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - Grapes: House 1, 2

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - Kiwis: House 1, 2
   - Milk: House 2, 3

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Boots: House 1, 2
   - Gameboy: House 1, 2, 3
   - Boots must be in House 2 (since kiwis are in House 2)

7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
   - Kiwis: House 2, 3

### Deductions

- **House 1:** Wearing loafers (Clue 1)
- **House 2:** Phone, Boots, Gameboy (Clue 2, Clue 6, Clue 7)
- **House 3:** Mangos, Milk, Kiwis (Clue 2, Clue 3, Clue 5)

Since the person with the phone is in House 2, the person with the phone is not the one who has a gameboy. The person with the phone is not the one who has a gameboy, so the person with the phone is the one who has a computer.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in **House 2**.

"Given the constraints and the logical deductions, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Golfer does not live in the third house.**
2. **Fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.**
3. **Golfer and baseball player live directly next to each other.**
4. **Carnations arrangement and person who owns horses live directly next to each other.**
5. **Carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.**
6. **Rose bouquet and bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other, with the rose bouquet to the left.**
7. **Cricketer does not live in the third house.**

Let's start by placing the golfer and the baseball player next to each other. Since the golfer cannot be in house 3, the possible pairs are:
- Golfer in house 1, Baseball player in house 2
- Golfer in house 2, Baseball player in house 1

### Case 1: Golfer in house 1, Baseball player in house 2
- Fish enthusiast must be in house 1 (since the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses).
- Person who owns horses must be in house 2 (since the fish enthusiast is in house 1 and the person who owns horses must be to the right of the fish enthusiast).
- This contradicts the fact that the golfer and the baseball player are in adjacent houses (golfer in house 1, baseball player in house 2).

### Case 2: Golfer in house 2, Baseball player in house 1
- Fish enthusiast must be in house 1 (since the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses).
- Person who owns horses must be in house 2 (since the fish enthusiast is in house 1 and the person who owns horses must be to the right of the fish enthusiast).
- This contradicts the fact that the golfer and the baseball player are in adjacent houses (golfer in house 2, baseball player in house 1).

"To determine the house where the person who drives a truck lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating oranges.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the truck and convertible drivers must be in adjacent houses, and the truck driver must be to the left of the convertible driver.

3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the bird keeper and dog owner must be in houses with the bird keeper to the right of the dog owner.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not eating mangos.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Owning horses.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 5, we know:
- House 3: Owning horses.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Eating oranges.

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 3: Not eating mangos.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in adjacent houses.

Since the person eating mangos cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), and the person driving a convertible must be adjacent to the person eating mangos (Clue 6), the only possible positions for the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible are:
- House 1: Eating oranges (Clue 1)
- House 2: Driving a convertible (Clue 6)
- House 3: Owning horses (Clue 5)

Now, we need to place the bird keeper and the dog owner. From Clue 3, the bird keeper must be to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are 2 and 3, but house 3 is occupied by the person owning horses. Therefore, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 1. Given that house 1 is occupied by the person eating oranges, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 3.

Thus, the only remaining house for the person driving a truck is house 2.

### Conclusion

The person who drives a truck lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics:

1. **Clue 1 and Clue 2**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew, and the percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader must be somewhere to the left of the percussionist, and the percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

2. **Clue 3**: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in a house to the left of the percussionist.

3. **Clue 4**: There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives. This means the saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, and the person who had pizza must be in the second or fourth house.

4. **Clue 5**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader.

5. **Clue 6**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist. This means the flutist must be in a house to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

6. **Clue 7**: The guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. This means the guitarist and the percussionist must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist.

7. **Clue 8**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader and the grilled cheese eater must be in adjacent houses, and the grilled cheese eater must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

8. **Clue 9**: There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the history book buff must be in the house directly to the right or left of the mystery book reader.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house. This means the person who ate spaghetti must be in one of the first, second, fourth, or fifth houses.

Let's start by placing the mystery book reader and the saxophonist:
- The saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, so he must be in the second or fourth house.
- The mystery book reader must be directly left of the saxophonist, so the saxophonist must be in the second house and the mystery book reader must be in the first house.

Now, let's place the percussionist:
- The percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the percussionist must be in the third or fourth house.
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist, so the guitarist must be in the first or second house.

Given the saxophonist is in the second house, the mystery book reader is in the first house, and the guitarist is to the left of the percussionist, the only possible positions for the percussionist are the third or fourth house. Let's check the third house:
- If the percussionist is in the third house, the guitarist must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the percussionist must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the science fiction book fanatic:
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the first house because the mystery book reader is there.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the second house.

Now, let's place the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist:
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be to the left of the flutist, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first or second house, but the first house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic.
- Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

Finally, let's place the history book buff:
- The history book buff must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader, so the history book buff must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the history book buff must be in the third house, and the flutist must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the person who ate spaghetti:
- The person who ate spaghetti cannot be in the third house, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first, second, fourth, or fifth house.
- The person who ate spaghetti must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth or fifth house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
   - Given the positions of the cellist and the mystery book reader, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the history book buff is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 2, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2 in that order.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

Since the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, and the guitarist must be next to the root beer lover, the guitarist must be in house 1 and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

   - House 3: Not loafers

10. **Clue 11**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
    - Possible positions for rose bouquet and banana: (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4)

12. **Clue 12**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.
    - Possible positions for gameboy and basketball player: (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4)

Let's combine these clues:

- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 2**: Sandals, Computer
- **House 3**: Not apples, Not loafers, Not lilies, Not gameboy, Not basketball player
- **House 4**: Swimmer

Since House 3 cannot be apples, loafers, lilies, gameboy, or basketball player, and it must be either banana or rose bouquet (from Clue 11), and considering the positions, the only logical fit is:

- **House 3**: Banana
- **House 2**: Not loafers, Not gameboy, Not basketball player, Not lilies, Not apples
- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 4**: Swimmer

From Clue 7, the person with the phone (House 1) must be to the left of the person with sandals (House 2). This fits our current arrangement.

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1.

**The number of the house where the person who is wearing loafers lives is 1.**

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating mangos.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not horses.

3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2, and vice versa.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not banana.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not horses.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the person eating a banana is in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2, and vice versa.

From Clue 6, the person eating a banana must be in house 1, and the dog owner must be in house 2. This is because the banana eater cannot be in house 3, and the dog owner cannot be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating bananas, not horses, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, not banana, dog owner.
- House 3: Not banana.
- House 4: Not horses.

From Clue 5, the person who owns horses cannot be in house 2. Since the dog owner is in house 2, the person who owns horses must be in house 4.

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating bananas, not horses, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, not banana, dog owner.
- House 3: Not banana.
- House 4: Not horses, owns horses.

From Clue 3, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in adjacent houses. Since the person eating bananas is in house 1, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

Since the person eating kiwis cannot be in house 1, and the person eating bananas is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 3, and the bird keeper must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating bananas, not horses, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, not banana, dog owner, bird keeper.
- House 3: Not banana, eating kiwis.
- House 4: Not horses, owns horses.

The bird keeper lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader lives in the first house.

From Clue 4, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house (house number 1).

So, the arrangement of the houses and the people in them looks like this:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: ?
- House 3: ?

From Clue 3, the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff and the bird keeper must be in adjacent houses. Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the only possible adjacent houses are houses 2 and 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Romance book lover or bird keeper

From Clue 2, the person who owns horses does not live in the third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must live in the third house (since the romance book lover cannot live in the third house, and the bird keeper must be in an adjacent house).

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Bird keeper

Since the bird keeper lives in the third house, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(B) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the people and their characteristics:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
   - This directly places the coffee drinker in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the apple eater and the water drinker must be adjacent, with the apple eater to the left of the water drinker.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
   - This means the mangos eater lives in houses 2, 3, or 4.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - This means the mangos eater lives in houses 1 or 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the apple eater must be in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.
   - This means the kiwi eater lives in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- If the mangos eater is in house 1, then the kiwi eater must be in house 4 (since they cannot be in house 3).
- The apple eater and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Mangos eater
  - House 2: Coffee drinker (Clue 1)
  - House 3: Apple eater
  - House 4: Water drinker

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The apple eater is to the left of the water drinker.
- The mangos eater is in house 1.
- The kiwi eater is in house 4.
- The water drinker is in house 4.

From Clue 1, the person who likes white (house 2) lives directly left of the person who likes red (house 4). Since the person who likes blue lives in house 4, the person who likes red must live in house 1.

From Clue 3, the person who likes white (house 2) lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player (house 4). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From Clue 4, there is one house between where the person who likes white (house 2) lives and where the person who is eating apples (house 4). This is consistent with the arrangement.

"To determine the house where the percussionist lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

From Clue 6, the flutist is directly left of the person who drives a minivan. Let's consider the possible positions for the flutist and the minivan:

- If the flutist is in house 1, then the person who drives a minivan must be in house 2.
- If the flutist is in house 2, then the person who drives a minivan must be in house 3.

Let's analyze each case:

#### Case 1: Flutist in house 1, Minivan in house 2
- Clue 5 states the minivan is to the right of the truck. So, the truck must be in house 3.
- Clue 2 states the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. So, the gameboy must be in house 3.
- Clue 3 states the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. So, the cellist must be in house 2.
- Clue 4 states the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 2, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 3. Since the gameboy is in house 3, the person with the television must be in house 1 and the person with high heels must be in house 3.
- Clue 7 states the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 3 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

So, in this case, the percussionist lives in house 1.

#### Case 2: Flutist in house 2, Minivan in house 3
- Clue 5 states the minivan is to the right of the truck. So, the truck must be in house 1.
- Clue 2 states the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. So, the gameboy must be in house 1.
- Clue 3 states the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. So, the cellist must be in house 3.
- Clue 4 states the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the gameboy is in house 1, the person with the television must be in house 2 and the person with high heels must be in house 1.
- Clue 7 states the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 2 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

This case contradicts Clue 5, as the minivan cannot be in house 3 if the truck is in house 1. Therefore, this case is invalid.

### Conclusion
The only valid configuration is the one where the flutist is in house 1, the minivan is in house 2, the cellist is in house 2, the gameboy is in house 3, the person with high heels is in house 3, the person with the television is in house 1, the person with boots is in house 3, and the percussionist is in house 1.

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 1.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the root beer lover).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the minivan driver cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the minivan driver).

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

From Clue 15, the person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house, so the sedan owner must live in either the first, third, or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the sedan owner must live in either the first or third house.

From Clue 13, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. From Clue 12, the person who likes green does not live in the third house. From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. From Clue 10, the cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other.

   - This means the guitarist cannot live in house number 4, and the person who had pizza cannot live in house number 1.

4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
   - This means the violinist and the person with the rose bouquet must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner must live in the house immediately to the right of the person with the vase of tulips.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
   - This means the saxophonist cannot live in house number 1, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house number 4.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist cannot live in house number 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot live in house number 4.

8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot live in house number 4, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house number 1.

   - This means the person who owns horses lives in house number 4.

10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 1.

From Clue 1, we know the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

From Clue 8, the bird keeper (house 2) must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (house 4). Since the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4, the bird keeper must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza must be to the right of the guitarist. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 4, the person who had pizza must be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 1.

From Clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 (guitarist), and the dog owner must be in house 2 (bird keeper).

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese (house 1) must be to the left of the guitarist (house 1), which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the placement.

Given the constraints, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who owns horses

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (C) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics and house assignments step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
   - This means the tea drinker and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   - This means the saxophonist and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
   - This means the baseball player and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2.

   - Therefore, the saxophonist is in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   - This means the romance book lover and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 4, we know the saxophonist is in house 1. From Clue 5, the romance book lover and the golfer must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the golfer must be in house 2 (Clue 2).

Now, Clue 3 tells us the baseball player and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2. Since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 1.

This leaves house 2 for the tea drinker and the person eating grapes. Since the tea drinker and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2, and the person eating grapes is in house 2, the tea drinker must be in house 1.

Thus, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The person wearing boots lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 4**: The person with the bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we can conclude that the first house is occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person wearing boots.

Next, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The second house is not occupied by the person with the bouquet of lilies (Clue 1).
- The second house is not occupied by the person wearing high heels (Clue 2).

This means the second house must be occupied by the person with the bouquet of lilies and the person wearing high heels.

- House 4: Grilled cheese eater
- House 6: Root beer lover

From Clue 12, the first house is occupied by the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 13, the first house is also occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 11, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house.

From Clue 14, the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

From Clue 15, the soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player.

From Clue 2, the person who drives a minivan does not live in the third house.

From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

From Clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover.

From Clue 4, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.

From Clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

From Clue 6, the baseball player lives directly left of the tennis player.

From Clue 1, the person who drives a truck does not live in the second house.

From Clue 8, the person who drives a minivan and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.

From Clue 7, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player.

From Clue 15, the soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player.

Let's place the people based on these clues:

1. First house: Person who ate spaghetti (spaghetti)
2. Second house: Person who has a vase of tulips (tulips)
3. Third house: Person who owns a sedan (sedan)
4. Fourth house: Person who has a rose bouquet (rose)

Now, we need to place the remaining people:

- The person who drives a truck cannot be in the second house (Clue 1).
- The person who drives a truck cannot be in the first house (Clue 1).
- The person who drives a truck cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 1).
- Therefore, the person who drives a truck must be in the third house (sedan).

So, the third house is occupied by the person who owns a sedan (sedan).

Now, we need to place the remaining people:

- The person who drives a minivan and the person who drives a convertible must be next to each other.
- The person who drives a minivan cannot be in the third house (Clue 2).
- The person who drives a minivan cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 1).
- Therefore, the person who drives a minivan must be in the first house (spaghetti) or the second house (tulips).

Since the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house (tulips).

Now, the second house is occupied by the person who has a vase of tulips (tulips).

The remaining people are the person who drives a truck (sedan) and the person who drives a convertible. Since the person who drives a truck is in the third house (sedan), the person who drives a convertible must be in the fourth house.

The fourth house is occupied by the person who has a rose bouquet (rose).

The remaining person, the person who has a bouquet of lilies, must be in the first house (spaghetti).

So, the final arrangement is:

1. First house: Person who ate spaghetti (spaghetti)
2. Second house: Person who has a vase of tulips (tulips)
3. Third house: Person who owns a sedan (sedan)
4. Fourth house: Person who has a rose bouquet (rose)

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the characteristics of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

Let's denote the houses as follows:
- House 1: Person 1
- House 2: Person 2

### Analysis of Clue 3

- If Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
- If Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, then Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.

Since Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow and drive a truck simultaneously, Person 2 (House 2) must like yellow.

### Analysis of Clue 1

- If Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, then Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.
- If Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes (Clue 1).

This creates a contradiction because Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow and eat grapes simultaneously. Therefore, Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow.

Thus, Person 2 (House 2) must like yellow.

### Analysis of Clue 2

- If Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) wears boots (Clue 2).
- If Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck, then Person 1 (House 1) wears boots.

Since Person 1 (House 1) cannot wear boots and drive a truck simultaneously, Person 2 (House 2) must drive a truck.

### Final Deductions

- Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow and drives a truck.
- Person 1 (House 1) wears boots.
- Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.
- Person 1 (House 1) is the mystery book reader.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the fantasy book enthusiast.

   - House 1: Spaghetti
   - House 2: White
   - House 3: Pizza
   - House 4: Science fiction book fanatic

8. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - The only remaining houses are 1 and 4, but house 1 is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti. Therefore, the soccer player must live in house 1 and the guitarist must live in house 4.

   - House 1: Soccer player
   - House 2: White
   - House 3: Pizza
   - House 4: Science fiction book fanatic

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The basketball player lives in the second house.
   - This means House 2 is occupied by the basketball player.

2. **Clue 3:** The violinist lives in the second house.
   - This is a contradiction with Clue 2, but since Clue 3 must be true, it implies that the violinist is in House 2, which is already occupied by the basketball player. This suggests a re-evaluation of the clues or a potential misinterpretation. However, since Clue 3 is given as a fact, we must consider it as is.

Given Clue 2 and Clue 3, we realize there's an inconsistency. Let's re-evaluate with the given constraints:

- House 2 is occupied by the violinist.
- House 2 is also occupied by the basketball player (Clue 2).

Since Clue 3 states the violinist is in House 2, and Clue 2 states the basketball player is in House 2, we must consider the possibility that Clue 3 might be a misinterpretation or a different person. However, since Clue 3 is given as a fact, we must consider the arrangement:

- House 1: Cricketer (Clue 1)
- House 2: Violinist (Clue 3)
- House 3: Cellist (Clue 1)

This leaves the soccer player in House 1, which contradicts the given Clue 1. Therefore, we must consider the possibility that Clue 3 might be a misinterpretation or a different person. Given the constraints, the only consistent arrangement is:

- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

Thus, the soccer player must live in House 1.

The number of the house where the soccer player lives is **(A) 1**."

From clue 3, the flutist lives in the fourth house, which is consistent with clue 2.

From clue 4, the tennis player does not live in the fourth house. So, the tennis player must live in one of the other houses (1, 2, or 3).

From clue 5, the guitarist does not live in the third house. So, the guitarist must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house. So, the violinist must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 7, the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must live in the first or second house, and the guitarist must live in the third or fourth house.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the history book buff (HBB).
2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader (MR) lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a computer (C) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone (P).
4. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV).

From Clue 2, we know the mystery book reader (MR) lives in the first house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as Mystery Reader (MR), History Book Buff (HBB), and Science Fiction Fanatic (SFF).

From Clue 1, the mystery book reader (MR) must be in the first house, and the history book buff (HBB) must be in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: HBB

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the history book buff (HBB), which contradicts Clue 1. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Since the mystery book reader (MR) is in the first house, the history book buff (HBB) must be in the third house. This means the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: ?
- House 3: HBB

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the person who has a computer (C). So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: TV (computer)
- House 3: HBB

From Clue 3, the person who has a computer (C) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone (P). Since the person with the computer is in the second house, the person with the phone must be in the first house. This means the person with the phone is the mystery book reader (MR). This is consistent with Clue 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: MR (mystery book reader)
- House 2: TV (computer)
- House 3: HBB (history book buff)

The person who has a phone is the mystery book reader (MR), and the person who has a computer is in the second house. The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic (SFF), who must be in the third house.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

To elaborate on this from a logic grid puzzle perspective, let's break down the key points:

1. **Dimensions and Capacity**: The Santa María, the largest ship from Christopher Columbus's voyages, had a length of approximately 55 meters (180 feet). The Statue of Liberty, including its pedestal, stands at 46 meters (151 feet) tall. This means the ship would not be able to carry the statue, as it is taller than the ship itself.

2. **Logical Deduction**: Given the dimensions, it's clear that the ship's capacity to haul the statue is not feasible. The ship's length is insufficient to accommodate the statue's height, making it impossible for the Santa María to haul the Statue of Liberty.

"Given the context of watching all 191 episodes of ""JAG"" at a rate of one episode per day, we need to determine if it's possible to complete this task within six months.

First, let's convert six months into days. Assuming a month has approximately 30 days, six months would be:
\[ 6 \text{ months} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 180 \text{ days} \]

Since ""JAG"" has 191 episodes, and you watch one episode per day, it would take:
\[ 191 \text{ days} \]

Comparing the required days to the available days:
\[ 191 \text{ days} > 180 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it is not possible to watch all of ""JAG"" in six months.
